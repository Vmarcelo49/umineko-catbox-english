"Wahahahaha, you alright, Battler‐kun...?!
 We\'re already on the ground, y\'know, you can\'t fall any further than that, wahahahaha...!"
"Uu, *giggle*giggle*!
 Gonna faaall, gonna faaall, *giggle*giggle*!"
In the lobby of the Niijima airport, Maria dashed around in excitement.
{n}Battler\'s uproar in the plane must have been very funny to her.
"Hey, Maria!
 That\'s enough!
 ...Sorry, Battler‐kun.
 Don\'t take it badly."
"Man, you\'re {i:pathetic}.
 A grown‐ass man like you still can\'t handle vehicles?"
"Urgh, shut up...
 All humans have one or two things they can\'t handle..."
"Battler‐kun, why don\'t you come with your aunt on an overseas trip sometime soon?
 What about Europe?
 I\'m sure you\'d conquer your fears after the half‐day plane trip.
 *giggle*giggle*giggle*!"
"...Stop it, Mother.
 I\'m sure Battler‐kun\'s dislike for vehicles is inherited."
"Oh, from Asumu‐san?"
"......For some reason, she just couldn\'t handle vehicles.
 Pretty much anything other than a bicycle or a car.
 Whenever we tried to take a trip somewhere far away, that woman was so annoying with the "no not this, no not that,
 I\'m scared I\'m scared, I\'m going to fall I\'m going to fall, scream scream"."
"Children tend to learn that things which their parents can\'t seem to handle are dangerous.
 Battler‐kun must have seen Asumu‐san doing something like that and learned that vehicles are scary."
"*giggle*giggle*.
 Could it be Asumu‐san\'s genes, I wonder?"
"Beats me.
 Those\'d be some damned annoying genes.
 .........Stop talking about Asumu.
 Right now, the one who\'s here is you.
 Right?"
"...You\'re right, sorry."
"Heyyy, the cars are here!
 Exactly three of \'em.
 All in, all in!"
"Gonna fall, gonna faaall!!
 Where\'s the parachuuute, where\'s the parachuuuute!!
 Uu‐uu, *giggle*!!"
"You little rapscallio~n!!
 Wait, wait, come back here, you!
 I\'ll sentence you to the tickle punishme~nt!!"
"Ehheheheheh.
 It\'s good that they\'re in high spirits.
 If Battler‐kun and Maria‐chan weren\'t there, the atmosphere in that plane would have been very stiff."
"Thanks.
 I\'ll take that at face value.
 ......Hey, brats!
 The taxis are here!
 Save the games for later."
"Uu‐uu!!
 Taxiii, taxiii!!
 I\'m gonna be first iiiiin!
 *giggle*!!"
"Hey!
 Maria, and you too, Battler‐kun, stop fooling around!
 You\'ll bump into someone!"
The tone of Auntie Rosa\'s voice became a little frightening.
Battler, too, had started to think that perhaps he really was fooling around too much...when, just as expected, he bumped into someone.
"Oh, sorry..."
"Battler‐kun, your family is going in the car over there.
 You\'re keeping them waiting."
Rushed on by George, Battler made an apologetic gesture to the person he had bumped into and ran up to his parents, who were telling him to come quickly.
With clunking sounds, the doors on the three taxis were shut one after another, and they departed, heading for the harbor......
......As their taxis dashed away...
...the entire world grew suddenly dull,
 ......and slowed to a halt.
Voices, the wind, and even sound—
absolutely everything ceased, and as if they had been frozen in the instant a photo was taken, everything moving or about to move...
...stopped.
People, machines, clock hands, even the dust dancing in the wind—frozen.
{n}People who were in the middle of walking—frozen, with one foot still raised.
{n}Scraps of paper dancing in the wind—frozen, pinned in midair.
......And among these stationary figures in this world that had come to a standstill, a single one...moved.
It was a woman.
 The very woman that Battler had just bumped into...
It was truly the slightest of movements.
Her gaze dropped, her shoulders lowered a minuscule amount, and she sighed.
{n}...That was all.
In a normal world, that probably wouldn\'t even count as movement,
 but in this still world, it looked very out of place.
...Then something else moved.
{n}It was a black cat that had been dozing in the shadows near the taxi rank.
It came up right behind the woman,
 ......and leisurely...changed its form into that of a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.
It wasn\'t a cat.
 It was a witch.
{n}Of course, the woman was also a witch.
As the witch stood there, her gaze still downwards, she muttered...
".........I can\'t stop them...
...from going to Rokkenjima, can I..."
"You cannot.
 On October 4th, 1986, you are not here."
"......So if I had been here, it might even have been possible to stop them all from going...?"
"What verbal acrobatics a six‐year‐old girl could possibly perform to persuade them to turn back,
 I can\'t even imagine.
 ......But yes.
 If you had been in this place, the probability wouldn\'t have been zero.
 If there is a probability other than zero, I can find a miracle."
"......If I hadn\'t been sick,
 ...and they hadn\'t left me behind......"
With her head facing downwards, the witch tightened her fists...
{n}...They were trembling very slightly.
"You were sick in bed starting October 3rd, 1986.
 And Beato\'s game board is a snippet of time beginning on October 4th.
 ......You are not given the possibility of not getting sick.
 ...In other words, you are fundamentally an existence which can never step up onto the game board."
"Thanks for being so patronizing.
 ......I\'m aware of that.
 ......I know that just seeing Mom, Dad,
 .........and Onii‐chan healthy and happy like this,
 ......that alone...
...is a very wonderful miracle...
 .........I know that all too well..."
Ange had been trying to stand in the way of her family, and prevent them from going outside the airport, ......towards Rokkenjima.
...But that was impossible for Ange, who could not exist there on October 4th, 1986.
Just receiving a shoulder‐bump and words of apology from her older brother...
...Even though he hadn\'t known that she was his sister,
 ...that was still such a miracle,
 ......it could have moved her to tears......
"............I\'m sorry for the sarcasm.
 I won\'t waste the miracle you\'ve given me."
"I\'m glad to hear it.
 ......Now, let\'s go with them.
 To Rokkenjima.
 Soon, all of the pieces will be gathered.
 ......The curtain will open on the fourth game.
 Beato and Battler will already be seated by now."
"......To Rokkenjima......
 ............To the day my...
no,
 ......the day {i:everyone\'s} fates changed...October 4th, 1986,
 ...on Rokkenjima........."
...What happened on that day?
{n}I will expose that.
 Learn that.
 And I\'ll take them back...!
As she stood there with her fists still clenched, she surely turned her face to the heavens.
{n}A single teardrop from the depths of her eyes dripped down into the air.
And when time started moving again, the two witches\' figures were sucked into a blowing gale, and erased in an instant."Good morning, Milady.
 My, my, you do appear to be in a good mood.
 What a pleasant awakening you seem to have had."
"‘Pleasant awakening’...!
 I was so excited, I couldn\'t sleep a wink.
 After all, the curtain is rising on the oh‐so‐fun fourth game...!"
It seemed that she truly had been so excited that she hadn\'t gotten any sleep.
And yet she showed absolutely no signs of tiredness; was that due to her youth, or her low mental age?
Ronove chose not to say that aloud, and laughed with a {nobreak:"pu ku ku"} instead.
"I really ran that Battler into the ground last time!
 Ah, that look of "you tricked meee" all over his face!
 He looked so pathetic!
 In any case, I do hope he\'s not still feeling down?"
"Feeling down, you say...?"
"Mm, well, how to put it.
 ...You know how he is a bit too sincere for his age?"
"Indeed I do.
 Although one could call that his charm.
 Pu ku ku..."
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!
 You could, you certainly could!
 Well, speaking of that.
 You know how he completely fell for the thing I pulled the last time?"
"Oh, yes, completely and splendidly.
 ...His pure, rosebud‐like innocence, arising from never once having been tricked by another since birth, you unreservedly violated."
"............Even the joy of running around a field covered with beautiful new snow on a winter morning and trampling it utterly wouldn\'t even begin to compare."
"You took Battler‐sama\'s innocent heart, Milady,
 and thrillingly, splendidly, atrociously, mercilessly, and in quite the uncultured manner, enough to make one think "maybe I went a teensy little bit overboard...?",
 you most assuredly perpetrated the very worst of atrocities against it."
"I am quite sure most people {i:would} start to feel down.
 Pukkukukuku, so much so, that I doubt they would ever want to see your face again."
"S‐so you understand...!"
"I also, umm, considering that the fourth game is finally getting underway,
 I thought that it would be such a pain if he was so disheartened that he wouldn\'t join us at the table,
 and so, you see, I asked you first, thinking that it would be better to prepare a countermeasure beforehand...!"
"Hmmmm...
 In that case, indeed, I do think you would be well served to prepare such a countermeasure.
 Most unfortunately, due to your "North Wind and the Sun Strategy", it appears that Battler‐sama has received quite a shock."
"H‐hoh...
 ......A shock, you say... How badly...?"
Beato lowered her voice slightly, asking timidly.
{n}Ronove went along with that, and lowered his voice in the same way.
"......In truth, he has been curled into a ball clutching his knees for some time now.
 I called out to him several times, but he did not answer.
 I also carried him something to eat, but he does not appear to have touched it."
"...Th‐that is...troublesome......
 Is he really feeling that down......?"
"Pukkukukuku.
 It is only natural.
 ...After all, you
 {nobreak:com‐
pre‐
hensively}
 destroyed him, Milady.
 That would turn most anyone into a misanthrope."
"Hoh, distrust of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s? How convenient!
 Let him give up on {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s and trust witches, wahahaha...
 ...............O‐...oh,
 *cough*.
 Sorry, I took it too far."
Beato had tried to joke about it, but it seemed that the situation was quite serious, and after picking up on this, she hid her laughter.
"......Is it really that serious...?
 Sh‐should we wait just a little longer before beginning the fourth game...?"
"Because Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}\'s guest will be coming,
 it may be more appropriate to open the fourth game quickly.
 However, it might be useful if you were to show him a little consideration, Milady."
"Consideration!
 Consideration, you say?!
 How should I show that...?!
 He is feeling down, so,
 ...h‐how about...I cheer him up, or something?!"
"When a person\'s heart is closed off to the light, it is useless to interact with them in a gloomy fashion.
 You can do nothing but shine with a brightness stronger than the dark."
"Damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiit, quit messing arooooooooouund...!!!"
"Kyaahhahaha!!
 Battler‐kuun, over he~re!
 A croissant baked by Ronove‐sama would be wasted on the likes of youuuu!
 Maybe I\'ll enjoy it aaalll myself?"
Battler\'s stomach involuntarily growled at the fragrant smell of the croissant.
His breakfast plate was empty, but he hadn\'t eaten any of it.
{n}...The biggest glutton of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory,
 Beelzebub, had waited for Ronove to leave, and had then come to snatch the food away.
Battler had discovered her in the process, and they had been charging about causing a crazy amount of noise ever since.
Even though Beelzebub could have ended it by either giving it back already or else throwing it into her own mouth,
 she intentionally ran around in circles, making fun of Battler.
"Give me my breakfast back, damn iiiiiiit!!
 If you give it back now, I\'ll let you off with a single flick to the forehead.
 But just you try eating it!!"
"What, are you gonna eat me inste~ad?!
 Kyaha!
 Try it if you think you can! I\'ll bet I\'d be as sweet as honey pancakes.
 ...kya!"
"Gotcha!!
 Right now, I\'m more interested in that bread than your thighs.
 Be a good girl and give it heeeeeeeeere,
 fugagigigigi...!!
 So, you resist until the eeeeeeeeeend...!!"
"Ugugugugu!!
 No way, no way, I won\'t give it to yo~u!!
 Even the croissant wants me to eat i~~t!!!"
"Y‐yaa~y, yoo‐hooooooooo, g\'moooooorning, Battleeee~r!!
 Get a load of this guy, first thing in the morning and he\'s back to moping already~?!?!
 It\'s the beginning of a new day, and a new game, you know, so get your spirits up and let\'s get this party starte{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}eeddd!!"
...The door opened forcefully.
Like a marathon runner drawn on a {c:86EF9C:certain caramel box},
 with her hands held high and with an idiotic cheeriness,
 ......Beato appeared.
For some reason, countless country flags and confetti scattered everywhere, creating what was clearly intended to be the perfect party atmosphere.
......Battler and Beelzebub, who had been grappling on the floor over the croissant, completely forgot about their argument and stared at her speechless.
"Kya‐...kyahahahaha!
 Good morning, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama!
 Well, that\'s all for me!
 Here, Battler‐kun, say aa~h!"
"Mggmffff!!"
"Mmmffmmmff, *munch*munch*, ...*gulp*.
 .....................
 ......H‐hey, morning, Beato...
 ......Glad to see you\'re in perfect form this morning."
....................................
Beato and Battler looked at each other.
{n}...It seemed that neither had a clue what was going on with the other.
"B‐......Battlerr......?
 Wh‐wh‐what is this, Ronoveeeee,
 he looks like he\'s in high spiriiiiiiits!!
 He isn\'t clutching his knees!
 And he\'s answering!
 {i:And} he was even in the middle of eating!!"
"Pukkukukukuku!!
 No, no, he certainly was clutching his knees, under the blanket as he slept like a baby.
 I informed him that it was time for him to wake up, but he just wouldn\'t get out of bed.
 As for his food, it seems that he was rather too preoccupied with the naughty cat that had wandered in.
 Pu ku ku, puu ku ku ku ku!"
"G‐
.........gwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh...!!!
 You tricked meeeeeeeeeee...!!"
"Heh, you should talk.
 Weren\'t you the one who played that massive trick on me last time?
 I don\'t have a clue what\'s going on, but I\'m glad to see you started your morning with a helping of just deserts.
 ...Well, anyway, nice one, Ronove."
"Pukkukuku, I am much obliged, Battler‐sama."
The two stuck up their thumbs as though they had forged some kind of male bond, chuckling together.
For a while, Beato acted very energetically, trying to hide her embarrassment......
"Heh.
 Don\'t take me so lightly.
 You thought I\'d still be hiding in a corner, holding my knees?"
"*cackle*.
 Then who was that person crying their eyes out in frustration last time?
 I should\'ve collected your copious tears in a bottle and used it as eau de toilette."
"Sh‐shut up.
 That was, uh, you got me a bit with your crappy acting and crazy plot twist, that\'s all.
 I made an ass of myself, but you\'d better not think that same move is ever gonna work again."
"Naturally.
 Don\'t disappoint me by falling for the same move over and over again, alright?
 *cackle*cackle*!"
"Ihihi, yeah, just you watch.
 I\'ll teach you that I\'m a guy who gets stronger every time he\'s beaten down."
"............But Beato."
"Mm, what is it?"
"Never do it again."
"Hoh?
 And why is thaaat?
 So you really are weak against the rear attack?"
"............You and I are enemies,
 and we\'ll never, ever join forces.
 ...I now understand that clearly.
 ......So never again do something as unpleasant as trying to make me confused about that fact."
"*cackle*cackle*!
 You say that, but now that I know it\'s your weak point, ........."
Beato thought they were still joking around, ...but that had disappeared from Battler\'s expression some time ago.
Beato felt as though his eyes were like the surface of black tea gone cold...
"You hear me?
 Never do it again."
"..................
 ......You never know...
 I might do it again when you\'ve forgotten..."
"Never do it again."
"............nn, ..............."
Pierced by his strong and forceful gaze, Beato held her tongue.
She may have thought that Battler would surely be the one to break that silence with laughter.
...However, Battler\'s serious expression didn\'t change in the slightest.
So, to break that silence, Beato had no choice but to start laughing herself.
"*cackle*cackle*, hahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!!
 As things should be.
 You and I are worthy adversaries.
 No matter how favorable our relationship, we shall never cross that line defining us as enemies.
 If you have not mistaken this, that is enough for me."
"...That\'s right.
 I almost forgot that you were my enemy for just a second.
 I won\'t show such a disgraceful display again.
 ......I won\'t fall for your rear attack again.
 Ever...!"
"...........................
 ...Heh!
 Hahhahahyahhahha!!
 It seems that I am not the only one who cannot wait for the fourth game.
 I am pleased, Battler.
 Come, take your seat."
"...Sure.
 Bring it on.
 ......Clever little tricks aren\'t gonna work anymore."
"Stop acting so tough.
 You remain in a state of surrender for the last mystery in the previous game, the mystery of Nanjo\'s murder...!"
".........I\'m still holding off on an answer for that one.
 But that doesn\'t mean I\'ve lost heart.
 I will break your "red truth" and deny witches—I guarantee it...!"
"Hmph.
 A good disposition.
 You truly are a man like a phoenix.
 You don\'t betray my expectations!
 With that, let us raise the curtains on the fourth game."
"But before that,
 it seems that we must welcome a new guest."
"A guest......"
"I am sure you must remember.
 That mystery woman, who appeared at the very end of the last game without an invitation and spoiled my performance."
"......Her........."
"She says that she wants to join our game, you see.
 I took the liberty of sending her an official invitation to join us.
 Ronove, call the guest."
"......There\'s no need.
 I\'m already here."
The voice that answered Beato\'s call came from the darkness in a corner of the room.
Battler turned around in surprise to discover that the mysterious woman was suddenly there.
"Goodness gracious.
 How rude.
 If you were here, the least I would have expected is a simple greeting."
"I don\'t make a habit of greeting people before punching them.
 But I will give one after I punch."
"Hoh, and what will that be?"
"<Good night,
 have a nice dream>."
"*cackle*cackle*, hahhahhahahahahahaha!
 Entertaining, truly entertaining...!"
Beato cackled and clapped her hands.
But that was only Beato, and nothing rose to Battler\'s face except an uncertain smile.
"......Whew.
 So you\'re the "punch first, ask questions later" type, huh."
".............................."
Battler met eyes with the woman, shrugging his shoulders as he spoke.
{n}But the woman didn\'t answer, giving only a cold stare in return.
"......You helped me out last game when things were really coming down to the wire.
 I\'m grateful."
"I don\'t need gratitude.
 The way you were acting was just {i:flaccid}.
 I only told you to get a clue."
"Kuhhyahhyahhya!
 Yesss, Battler is flaccid indeed, hyahhyahha!"
Beato tried to laugh in agreement, but the woman wasn\'t listening.
She did absolutely nothing except stare at Battler with ice‐cold eyes.
"...............Well, it looks like someone hates me."
"I\'m just annoyed that you aren\'t fighting seriously."
"You say I\'m not serious......?"
"You can\'t possibly mean that the mess you got yourself into earlier was you being {i:serious}?
 ......What do you take me for?
 How long do you intend to go along with this witch\'s farce?"
"...I am fighting Beato in my own way.
 And yes, I\'m serious about it."
"Serious?
 .........Don\'t make me laugh.
 You keep on drinking tea and chatting with a witch for all eternity and call that fighting seriously?
 Keep the jokes to just your hairstyle."
"......I mean, sure, I wasn\'t used to this witch\'s game in the beginning, and I\'ve had a hell of a rough time, I\'ll admit.
 But now, I\'m finally starting to see how to fight and the knack to doing it.
 ...If the pathetic way I\'ve been acting makes it look to you like I haven\'t been serious, you\'re mistaken."
".........Am I?"
"Of course, I know I\'ve gotta close in a lot more before I can grab Beato by the collar."
"But no matter how long that distance is, it is finite.
 And with each passing game, I am steadily closing that distance step by step!"
"No matter how long it takes, I will close in on that witch, and I\'ll definitely checkmate her.
 ......Borrowing one of her common phrases, it might even take me "a thousand years".
 ...But even so, eventually, I will definitely win."
"Why?
 Because I will never accept losing.
 I will never stand still, and I\'ll keep closing in on her!
 So in other words, there\'s just one thing I can say for sure."
"......I will definitely win against that witch someday!
 That\'s how it is."
"You sure are patient.
 Are you even trying to win?
 Even the finite can become infinite if it\'s treated the wrong way.
 You\'ve already become Achilles, unable to even outstrip a tortoise."
".........Now I get it. So this is why I\'m needed.
 At this rate, there\'s no way you could win against the Endless Witch even after a billion years."
"......Who are you?
 It wouldn\'t kill you to tell me your name."
"................................."
At that point, the woman fell silent, gazing straight into Battler\'s eyes.
At first, Battler faltered under the firmness of that look and his gaze wavered slightly, but as her eyes continued to stare into his, gradually, he found himself becoming lost in them.
......And in their depths, he saw a light that he had seen at some time before...
Battler was struck by how strongly they resembled the eyes of a girl who definitely couldn\'t be here,
 ......but that was completely impossible.
"...I know it\'s stupid,
 ......but for some reason, I\'m getting that feeling.
 But that can\'t be right.
 ......She\'s supposed to still be six years old.
 ............You couldn\'t possibly be...
.........Ange, could you............?"
"........................
 If I said yes, ...would you believe me?"
"Nn..............."
"I\'ll put it another way.
 If I said "I am on your side, so trust me",
 would you believe me?
 Would you unconditionally trust some unknown woman you\'re meeting for the first time just because she looks a little like someone you know?"
"......It\'s because you\'re so trusting that you were tricked so easily in the last game and cried so bitterly."
"......You said it yourself.
 That kid is six, right?
 Do I look like I\'m six?
 And despite that, if I were to claim that I\'m that kid, you\'d still just swallow that story?"
"......When you put it like that,
 ...I guess you\'re right."
"...Sorry.
 Yeah, I am too trusting.
 The last game should have taught me that.
 ......Is this what you meant when you said I wasn\'t serious?"
"Yes.
 You may think you\'re fighting against the witch, but all you\'re doing is making friends with her and having fun.
 ......You\'re just competing in a friendly game of chess."
"That may be a serious contest for you two,
 but looking at it from far away, I only see you two playing around like you\'re good friends, protected by the rules."
".....................
 ......Ihihihi.
 That\'s harsh."
"But as long as you can\'t win this game, you won\'t be released from this place.
 ......That\'s why I came.
 To bring this game to its conclusion.
 ......You claim that you\'re closing in on the witch, but you\'re just like a hamster running around in a wheel."
"*cackle*cackle*!
 Oh, those? Those things that run around and around in a wheel night after night?"
"At a glance, you might think that running around in a wheel is endless.
 ......Endless Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}.
 You are just like that wheel.
 And he is the one running around in the wheel forever, thinking he\'s fighting, but actually just making a fool of himself."
"......This isn\'t a game.
 This is nothing more than a cage to keep him imprisoned for all eternity."
"Hoh.
 ......You would liken my infinity to a mere wheel that a mouse plays in?
 Interesting, interesting, *cackle*..."
"Something that\'s infinite in a certain dimension tends not to be infinite in a higher one.
 A Menger sponge may have infinite surface area, but that only applies in a world of less than three dimensions.
 In the three‐dimensional world of reality, it has zero mass.
 Not only is it not infinite, it can\'t even exist."
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!
 What an assertive woman.
 It seems you are worthy of calling yourself my enemy."
"............Who...are you?"
"I am your ally.
 And an enemy of witches.
 .........Of course, you don\'t have to believe it."
"No one can prove that I really am your ally.
 In fact, it would be preferable if you stayed on your guard strongly enough to find me very suspicious."
".........You\'re right.
 I got burned bad the last time.
 I\'ve got to be at least that careful.
 ...I\'m done with getting tricked."
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*......!"
Beato laughed with true satisfaction in a way that was insulting only to Battler.
"People don\'t just get tricked out of the blue.
 They neglect to check things for themselves, and entrust that to other people—and that\'s when they get tricked.
 ......Saying that you thought the light had turned green just because you saw other people start crossing is no excuse for getting into an accident.
 Get it...?"
"Yeah... I get it.
 ......You\'re telling me not to swallow information given to me by others, but to think for myself.
 .........I\'ve just been swallowing the magic that Beato showed me."
"{i:I\'d stopped thinking}.
 That\'s why it was no good."
Battler grimaced as he remembered his many painful losses.
 ...Seeing that, the witch laughed audaciously once again.
"I will advise you in a way that will be to your advantage.
 Of course, you shouldn\'t just swallow the things I say.
 Because no one can provide absolute proof that I\'m on your side."
In the last game, {f:5:Virgilia}, who I\'d thought was an ally, turned out to be on the witch\'s side after all.
......Battler couldn\'t get that eerie smile worn by {f:5:Virgilia}, who he had even thought of as dependable, out of his head.
"So you don\'t have to unconditionally trust me.
 Therefore, taking my advice as nothing more than an opinion to be considered is absolutely fine.
 After all, ......the player who\'s fighting in a game against the witch {i:is you}."
"...Yeah, you\'re right.
 Saying I lost because I followed the moves of an outsider would be just too pathetic of an excuse."
"Indeed it would!
 My opponent is Battler.
 You are nothing more than an outsider.
 It is good that you understand that.
 *cackle*!"
"No, I\'m not an outsider.
 {f:5:Beatrice}, Ushiromiya Battler,
 ...and me with my bird\'s‐eye perspective over you...will fight in a formation almost like a triangle.
 At a glance it might not seem to be a united front, but fighting together is not the only way to form a united front."
"Hoh.
 What an odd thing to say."
"Just now, he described fighting with you as closing the distance.
 But you can\'t measure distance with a single eye.
 Only with two eyes are things visible in three dimensions, and only then can distance be measured."
"......And having two viewpoints is meaningless if they\'re in the same place.
 You can gauge the witch more accurately if they\'re far apart."
"......Shooting from different positions and different angles.
 ...So, like crossfire, then.
 Heheh, interesting."
"We will shoot from different positions...and different angles.
 ......So I won\'t make friends with anybody.
 In order to separate my own position and catch the witch in a pincer attack."
".........Are you sure about this, Battlerr?
 This woman may actually be an ambush I set up, you know?
 She might just be saying something plausible to gain your trust, you know...?"
"......Maybe.
 She\'s been saying that over and over again herself.
 ...So, of course, I can\'t blindly accept her advice."
"But I can think for myself and decide whether it\'s worthy of being trusted or not.
 As long as I don\'t stop thinking for myself, I won\'t be tricked by anyone again...!"
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!
 Impressive confidence, Ushiromiya Battleerr!
 After you\'ve said so much, it makes me want to...
trick you all over again, you see...?
 And I want to see what kind of face you\'ll make when you realize that you\'ve been tricked yet again!
 I like it, kuhha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"
"......So, it looks like you know my name, but I don\'t know yours.
 ...Tell me your name."
For a while, the woman remained silent without the slightest change in her expression.
...She looked as though she couldn\'t decide whether to say her name or not, or possibly, as though she was deciding what to call herself on the spot.
"......Gretel."
"Girdle?
 You wear one?"
"That\'s my name, dumbass.
 Call me Gretel."
"Then should I call myself Hansel?
 Ihihihi, just kidding, I\'m Ushiromiya Battler!
 Just call me Battler."
"............Nice to meet you.
 ...I hate handshakes.
 Don\'t take it personally."
"...Yeah, you\'re right, sorry.
 I mean, it isn\'t a sure thing that you\'re on my side.
 ......And you only just told me to keep my guard up, too."
Battler drew back the right hand he had stuck out.
His bitter smile disappeared, and was replaced with a strong expression of resolve for the new game, now in its fourth iteration.
"Battler.
 ......Think deeply about why you must win against this witch.
 ......You can\'t stop with something abstract, like "She annoys me so she\'s going down".
 ......Have a deep conviction that you\'ll definitely defeat the witch and escape from this world."
".........Because there is definitely...
......someone waiting for you to come back.
 ......For her sake as well, you...
..........................."
Maybe she had something on her mind.
 Gretel clenched a fist in front of her chest and hung her head in silence, at a loss for words for a short while.
Beato spoke up in a forceful voice, shattering that silence.
"Good, that should be enough of an introduction for Gretel or whoever!
 Come, try to remember, what happened on October 4th!
 Kuhhihihihihihihi, the curtain opens on the fourth game!!"
In unison with her voice, the clock, which had been turned back to October 4th, 1986, ......started to move, as though blown by a suddenly raging storm.
While we remained in the witch\'s tea room, the blue‐gray sea and the green Rokkenjima spread out beneath us,
 ......and we could see the boat heading there, trailing a wake behind it.
The sky was already cloudy, and it seemed that the barrier of the typhoon would soon shut the island away.
The boat docked in the harbor,
 .........and Gohda, who had been waiting there, could be seen helping to unload it.
And finally,
 ......the boat dropped off all of the passengers,
 .........and began to separate from the island.
The relatives started to get swallowed up by the island.
"Ahhahahaha!
 You\'re as energetic as ever, Maria."
"Maria‐chan, you\'ll trip if you don\'t look out.
 Be careful...!"
"Uu‐uu‐uu!!
 Gonna faaall gonna faaall, gonna siiink gonna siiink, *giggle*!"
...All my fondly remembered cousins I had loved so much dashed away through the beach,
 ......disappearing as they were sucked into the forest path leading to the mansion.
And of course, Onii‐chan could be seen among them too.
"......Dammii~it!!
 Hold it, hold it, Mariaaaa!!
 You nimble little brat!"
"*giggle*! Uu‐uu‐uu!
 *giggle*giggle*!"
Maria onee‐chan, who I had loved, dashed away, and Onii‐chan chased after her.
They were swallowed up by the forest.
Following in pursuit, Mom and Dad were also swallowed up.
The rest of my relatives were swallowed up, too...
......Swallowed up, leaving only me behind...
You idiot......
How long are you going to joke around and play with a witch in a place like this......
Come back quickly, ......Onii‐chan......!
Don\'t leave me all alone...!
And realize.
Realize what a cruel and lonely world I end up isolated in..."Good day to you."
".........G‐...good day to you."
"Good day to you" is the standard greeting used here.
No matter how many years pass by, this style of greeting still feels very awkward...
I had responded to the greeting in order to stifle that awkward feeling,
 but the classmate who had spoken looked at me blankly.
"......Oh?
 *giggle*giggle*giggle*."
"Ohhh? What\'s this?
 I think you must be mistaken, *giggle*giggle*..."
Their choice of words and manner were certainly what you would expect of a school for rich girls,
 but at their core, they were as innocent and cruel as any children of that age.
......It seems they found it funny that I\'d mistakenly thought the greeting had been directed at me.
 No, it might be the opposite.
...Maybe I should say that they didn\'t know what to do after being greeted by an introverted kid like me.
No, judging by the looks of my classmates, glancing this way over their shoulders and whispering to each other,
 there were even some who seemed to consider their refreshing morning ruined.
......I am...depressing.
 Because no one likes me.
So, trying not to get in the way of everyone\'s refreshing morning any more, I entered the classroom in a low crouch.
......Almost like I was cutting across the aisle in a movie theater while the movie was running.
This is an all‐dorm academy called Saint Lucia Academy.
It\'s not a school that just anyone can get into simply by passing a test.
{n}...It\'s a hidden rich‐girls\' school, known only to a select group of celebrities from various circles.
For lofty nobles who truly wish their daughters to be brought up like saints,
 this is probably the ideal academy in which to protect them from the impurities of the common world.
......But at the same time, it was probably also a convenient place for nobles to confine daughters who they didn\'t want the public to know about.
As well as an academy isolated from the impurities of the common world, it also held excellent potential as a prison school.
I was truly among the latter, and spent my days confined in Saint Lucia Academy,
 .........as the weeks, months, and years dragged on at a mind‐numbing pace.
Of course, there weren\'t that many students like me, and you couldn\'t tell us apart at a glance.
However, even if they didn\'t come forward, you could usually guess from their appearance.
...Because they were always hanging their heads all the time, with an expression on their faces as though the whole world had abandoned them.
And every class had one or two kids like that, so even if they didn\'t speak up about it, you could guess who they were.
So.
Even though I never confessed that I was one of those kids, at some point, everyone in the class knew......
Just like how the seriousness of your injury grants you status in a hospital room, here, status is granted by the nobility of your birth.
Those who aren\'t permitted to go out in public are probably nothing more than filth to them.
They must think that getting involved with students like that would dirty them as well.
Whenever such a rumor sprang up about a particular student,
 those fastidious girls would about‐face and grow cold and distant, chasing that student out of all possible social groups.
I have that to thank for this quiet and solitary school life of mine...
Well, that\'s only if hearing people whisper behind my back, finding my things lost or broken all the time,
 and having everyone pretend like they don\'t know anything about it can be called a quiet school life.
I must be wearing a weary expression already this morning.
......I can understand completely why my other classmates, who had been enjoying a refreshing morning, would want to click their tongues upon seeing it.
Consciously trying to do my best to avoid tainting my classmates\' morning, I quietly took my seat.
......Then, unusually, someone came to talk to me.
{n}It was the class leader.
"Good day to you, Ushiromiya‐san.
 ......You seem to be in a bad mood this morning.
 Are you certain you\'re getting enough sleep?"
"............Is there some business you have with me?"
"You do know you\'re the only one who hasn\'t submitted her questionnaire for the class presentation?
 Did you forget that the deadline was yesterday?"
...I\'m pretty sure I heard something about that sometime last week.
But I think the questionnaire hadn\'t been passed out yet.
{n}All the necessary information would be written on that, so it should have been no problem to forget about it until it was handed out...
"......I wasn\'t given a questionnaire..."
"You must have been.
 The dormitory leader distributed a copy to everyone.
 If you lost it, all you have to do is honestly say so."
"............I lost it.
 I\'ll fill it in right now, so could you give me a paper?"
Again.
 ......Either someone lost my paper, or they intentionally didn\'t tell me about it.
But I have no way of knowing who was behind that.
In the end, treating it as though it was my own carelessness would settle everything more quickly and without any drama...
"Once you\'ve filled it out, drop it in the questionnaire box in the student council room yourself.
 Our class is the only one, you know, that didn\'t get everyone\'s in by last night."
As I hung my head at the class leader\'s scolding,
 I could hear the giggles and whispers of people watching, coming from no direction in particular...
Ushiromiya‐san did it again.
{n}Because she never concentrates.
{n}She is unsuitable for this school.
{n}She has neither class nor manners.
......Sorry, girls, but I\'ve dealt with much worse when it comes to unfair personal attacks.
I froze my heart and let those arrows of ridicule pass by as I quickly filled out the questionnaire...
When I heard the news that Mom, Dad, Onii‐chan,
 and all the rest of my family had died, I was in the house of my grandpa on my mom\'s side.
The only survivor of the accident was...Ushiromiya Eva.
{n}......Only Aunt Eva.
Even at the time, I hadn\'t really liked Aunt Eva.
At a glance, she seemed to act kindly to me,
 but even as young as I was, I could see clearly that she was somehow belittling Dad and the rest, and I didn\'t like it.
So when it was decided that Aunt Eva would take care of me, I was pretty miserable.
It wouldn\'t have mattered if my nice Uncle Hideyoshi and George onii‐chan could have been there too,
 but I hated the thought of living all alone with Aunt Eva.
I had an honest talk with Grandpa about that, hoping that I could live with him.
However, Aunt Eva was very insistent that she should be the one to look after me.
Aunt Eva had no desire to remarry, so she said I was essential for the succession of the Ushiromiya family.
Aunt Eva felt very strongly about the House of Ushiromiya.
She firmly demanded to take charge of me right away, so that she could give me an education and lifestyle fitting for the successor.
Complicated negotiations with lawyers apparently took place.
{n}...But in the end, I was forced to go live with Aunt Eva.
After she took me in, Aunt Eva told me something.
You must bear all of the glory and history of the Ushiromiya family.
And in order to make you a fitting successor to bear that, your life from now on will be dedicated to studying like hell.
 Sacrifice the rest of your life for the Ushiromiya family.
......She was definitive about it.
At first, I thought she meant exactly what she said.
But I quickly realized that wasn\'t the case.
Because even then, in Aunt Eva\'s eyes,
 the one most fitting to be successor was George onii‐chan, who had passed away.
At my first meal, I was strictly instructed and interrogated about my table manners,
 and was forced to listen to her disparage Mom and Dad as though they had been neglectful in my upbringing.
I also received the same strict instructions regarding manners at my first party,
 and I was insulted in public for my clumsiness, and forced to endure insults to Mom and Dad as well.
After that happened enough times, I finally came to understand.
Aunt Eva didn\'t really want to make me the successor.
She thought that the one who was truly fitting to be the successor was George onii‐chan,
 ......and she couldn\'t forgive the fact that it was going to be me.
So I was disparaged in front of a lot of people.
 Humiliated.
And she made it known far and wide exactly how inferior I was to George onii‐chan,
 ......surely in memory of her dead son—
no, ...she must still have been mourning his death.
......However, that wasn\'t something I could endure.
{n}I couldn\'t possibly live together with Aunt Eva.
......I would be eternally suffocated, continually compared with her dead son.
Even as an elementary schooler, I understood that.
I ran away from the House of Ushiromiya, and tried to go to my grandpa\'s house.
However, Aunt Eva had already foreseen that.
...No, thinking back on it, she might have been luring me into escaping.
I was caught by the guards and brought back,
 .........and for being a coward who had disgraced the Ushiromiya family crest and attempted to abandon the Ushiromiya name,
 .........I was punished,
 .........in a way that makes my whole body shake and shiver just remembering it.
How should I describe what Aunt Eva was like when she punished me?
Frenzied?
 Gleeful?
......The anger and sadness of losing her beloved son, and well as her hatred and pain towards the fact that I was going to steal the headship her son was meant to inherit.
 And the dark pleasure of being able to let those feelings out on me.
......I was pummeled with all of those negative emotions at once.
Then, all of my free time and freedom was taken away, and I was put under round‐the‐clock surveillance.
I may have lived in a gorgeous mansion, and been dressed in expensive clothes,
 ...but my heart and my dignity were being trampled upon, and I was the Ushiromiya family\'s slave,
 ...its cattle.
Compared to that lifestyle, the derisive laughter of my classmates here even felt refreshing.
 ......It was no match for my heart...
After filling in almost all of the fields of the questionnaire with "nothing in particular", I folded it up and put it in my pocket.
......Because if I left it in the desk, I might "lose it" again.
After dropping it off in the box in the student council room during lunch break,
 I finished lunch by myself, as usual, and headed behind the school building, where no one was around.
......Only the time I spent by myself could protect me from the derisive laughter and whispered comments.
Since I was hated and didn\'t have a single friend, my time alone was the most kind to me.
After checking the surrounding bushes to see whether some malicious classmates were hiding and threatening my time of quiet,
 I finally relaxed the tension from my entire body, knowing that I had gained some true peace.
Then...I let out a sigh.
 ...It lingered, heavy, as though it was the first time I had breathed out today.
My previous favorite place behind the vegetable garden storehouse...
had been found out by my classmates, and now they would mess with me there, so this was my new lunchtime hideaway...
There was nowhere to sit behind the school building.
I crouched down against a wall in the shadow of the bushes, opened my bag, and took out a book with an elaborate, old‐fashioned binding...
Just glancing at it, you would probably think it was a religious book written in the Middle Ages or something.
But this isn\'t a book.
 It\'s a diary.
Of course, it\'s not {i:my} diary.
{n}.........There aren\'t any special things worth writing about in my daily life.
Every single day is just gray, ...cold, and dry.
{n}When nothing changes from day to day, there aren\'t any notable changes worth writing down.
This is......the diary of Maria onee‐chan, who I had been very good friends with.
She was three years older than me and a bit of a funny person, but Onee‐chan was always a warm, wonderful cousin.
She would always grab me by the hand and invite me to play some fun game.
......I remember that getting to see her was the most enjoyable thing about family gatherings...
Though I preface this with "for an elementary schooler", the handwriting that greeted me when I opened the diary was fairly accomplished,
 and while admittedly it had been written using every other line, the pages were dense with text.
Was she just hopelessly obsessed with jotting everything down in her diary?
{n}......Probably...not.
To her, writing her daily life down in a diary was probably like having a conversation with another part of herself.
So rather than a journal in which the events of her day were simply listed,
 Maria onee‐chan\'s diary was written like a letter to another Maria, telling her of the events of that day.
I had found this diary among her belongings after her death, and had secretly taken it home.
At first, I had felt that reading someone else\'s diary might be boorish, and had been satisfied to just keep it by my side,
 ......but I was unable to resist turning over a page or two, and slowly but surely I found myself reading through it.
And now, .........{i:she had become my only friend}.
I gently opened to the page with the bookmark.
"......Sorry to keep you waiting, Maria onee‐chan.
 ......Could you tell me more about your life...?"
At the same time,
 ......a very, very soft breeze blew, tickling the pages.
And I thought the open diary might have sparkled faintly.
......The weather is good today.
{n}Maria onee‐chan loves wonderful rays of sunlight.
So I\'m sure she\'s in a good mood.
On the open diary, ...no, in the world of the diary, Maria onee‐chan showed herself...
She had been nine, I believe, when she died.
 ......So her appearance was already younger than mine.
But I call her Onee‐chan, and in turn, she fondly calls me just Ange.
"Uu.
 Ange, you were slow getting here today.
 Was it packed at lunch......?"
"......Yes.
 It\'s always packed.
 Because groups of friends install themselves in the seats and stay there even after they\'ve finished eating.
 It\'s pretty fatal if you go to the dining hall late.
 ......I was on cleanup duty today."
"......Uu!
 I\'m fast at eating!
 The faster you eat, the more you can play!
 Uu!"
Maybe she noticed that I was still bitter about how that duty had been forced upon me, shortening my lunch break by a bit.
Maria onee‐chan brightly changed the subject.
Grateful for that consideration, I responded that I eat slowly.
Maria said something about how she\'d teach me the trick to eating fast, and cheered me up.
I read it in the diary.
 No, I heard it from Maria onee‐chan.
She was once ranked number 1 among the girls on the speed‐eating leaderboard in her grade\'s newspaper.
She had been very proud of that, but had apparently been a little disappointed that her mother, Auntie Rosa, hadn\'t praised her very much for it.
"Uu!
 Okay, so I\'ll start today\'s story.
 How far did we get yesterday?
 Uu?"
"Umm......
 This far.
 Up to when you got Sakutaro as a present.
 ......You promised that you would tell me about Sakutaro."
"Uu!
 Talk about Sakutaro!
 Sakutaro is...a reeeeally cute stuffed animal!
 I\'m sure you\'d like him too, Ange!
 Uu!"
"Yes.
 Tell me about that.
 ......The lunchtimes I spend listening to your stories are the only times I can feel relaxed at school."
"Uu!
 I\'ll talk!
 So about Sakutaro, umm, umm!"
Watching Maria onee‐chan, who\'s always in a good mood, makes my heart feel warm as well.
As I listened to her tale, I began to get absorbed into her world......
"Happy birthday, Maria.
 Sorry I got back so late."
"Uu!
 Good job with your work, Mama!
 I know you\'re busy, so, waited without crying even when you were late.
 Was good and waited, watching TV!"
"Yes, you\'re such a good girl, Maria.
 As a reward for waiting politely, you can order anything you want today.
 Of course, only as much as you can eat, okay?"
"Uu‐uu!
 Can I change my corn soup to onion gratin soup today?!"
"Yes, you can."
"Uu‐uu!
 It\'s 200 yen more, but can I even change it to prosciutto pizza?!"
"Yes, you can.
 {i:If} you really can eat it.
 ......But what the hey.
 It is your birthday, after all.
 I have to reward you for being a good girl and waiting so patiently."
"Uu‐uu‐uu!
 Then, then, can I have enchilada cheesecake for dessert?!
 And, and, the chef\'s choice fruit salad and kids\' french fries!
 Want to have a melon soda too!"
"Uu‐uu‐uu!
 I\'m a good girl, I\'m a good girl!
 Praised by Mama, uu‐uu‐uu{p:0:♪}"
"*giggle*.
 You\'re getting a little too excited.
 If you don\'t quiet down a bit, you\'ll disturb the other customers."
When Rosa gently admonished her, Maria stuck her tongue out and eased up a little.
 ...But it seemed that she was having a hard time repressing her excitement at being able to eat out with her mother again after such a long time.
Today was Maria\'s birthday.
Rosa always spent Maria\'s birthday at a wonderful restaurant.
When Maria had still been in kindergarten, they had sometimes invited other kids from the neighborhood over and had a party at home.
Rosa would make a wonderful cake, and homemade sweets, and decorate the house herself, making it a huge celebration.
But after they moved and Maria no longer had any friends in the neighborhood, Rosa had started splurging at expensive restaurants instead.
However, today, they were instead in a normal family restaurant.
It was also a little late in the day for a kid like Maria to eat there, even with a parent.
Rosa had actually gotten reservations at a fantastical place that Maria would absolutely have loved.
 Of course, she had also prepared a wonderful cake with Maria\'s name written on it.
......But Rosa just hadn\'t been able to finish up her work, and had been forced to cancel.
Since that had turned into a local family restaurant, Rosa felt a little indebted to Maria.
So she was prepared to spoil Maria a bit and let her have whatever she wanted tonight...
"......I thought you weren\'t a very big eater, Maria onee‐chan?
 Are you sure you\'re going to be OK asking for this much?"
"Uu.
 I can\'t eat very much, but I like it when there\'s a lot lined up.
 You know, when you have a birthday table,
 and it\'s all multicolored with red and blue and green and yellow, it makes you really happy!"
"...You\'re right.
 When a birthday table is colorful, it does make you feel happy, doesn\'t it?
 ......Birthdays at my place were no match for yours, Maria onee‐chan, but I remember the cakes we bought at the cake shop in front of the station were always gorgeous..."
Ange thought back to her own birthdays nostalgically.
Even though Dad was busy, he sometimes came home just to show up at my birthday party, and then went right back to his company.
I was sad at the time, but now I understand how important I was to Dad.
Of course, Mom also took very good care of me.
In particular, she always had a really good sense in birthday presents,
 and sometimes arranged for them several months in advance.
Even though we always sent an invitation to Battler onii‐chan, he didn\'t get along with Dad or something, so he didn\'t always come.
......So when he did come, I was really happy.
...The birthday parties when the whole four‐person family was together made for fun memories that I will never forget...
"Uu~.
 Your birthday looks like a lot of fun too.
 Battler and Uncle Rudolf are the life of the party.
 Noisy and laughing!
 Ah, Battler got covered in soda, ahahahaha."
Maria onee‐chan peeked into my happy memory.
It\'s kind of embarrassing looking at myself, sitting quietly there, wearing the origami helmet that Dad had made as a party trick.
In my hand was a paper gun that Battler onii‐chan had folded for me.
{n}...And Mom was taking a commemorative photo.
{n}It was the happiest moment of my life.
"But your birthday\'s just as good, Maria onee‐chan.
 So, you get him today, right?
 Sakutaro."
"Uu!
 Was reeeally looking forward to it.
 Was so excited the whole time, wondering when Mama would show me the wrapped present in the side of her bag."
"Sakutaro" is the name of the stuffed animal that Maria onee‐chan was to receive as a present today.
For quite a long time, Auntie Rosa had been making a stuffed animal to give to her as a birthday present today.
It was apparently to be a cute lion stuffed animal,
 and Maria onee‐chan had already given it the name Sakutaro even though she hadn\'t received it yet.
Today, she was looking forward to meeting Sakutaro even more than celebrating her own birthday.
Auntie Rosa ran a clothing design company.
It did actually seem to have a brand name, too, for what that\'s worth.
{n}......I think it was just called <Auntie Rosa>, in English...?
The slogan was supposedly "I can\'t forgive the way I was before today".
...Unfortunately, I\'ve never met anyone who knew of that brand name.
Maybe it wasn\'t that famous.
So, in any case, Auntie was pretty skilled with her hands.
{n}I heard that some of the clothing she wears she made herself.
So making a stuffed animal had to be well within her capabilities.
"......A hand‐made stuffed animal... That sounds kind of wonderful.
 By the way, why did you call it Sakutaro?"
"Uu.
 Actually wanted to call it "Sakura".
 But it\'s a male lion, so I was told to give it a boy\'s name."
"So I added a boy‐like "tarou" and called him "Sakutarou".
 And I forget when the "u" at the end went away!"
"Why "Sakura"?"
"Uu!
 Main character in an anime on TV~!"
There was apparently a popular anime at the time whose main character was a girl called "Sakura".
......The fact that she\'d simply borrowed the name of a character she liked was, how should I say it, as innocent and cute as you\'d expect from her age.
"Uu!
 Mama, Mama!
 Still no Sakutaro?
 Want to let Sakutaro join in my birthday too."
"Presents always come at the end, remember?
 If you open it now, it\'ll get dirty.
 Hold on until the meal is over."
"Then I\'ll finish eating quickly!
 Uu‐uu‐uu!"
As soon as she proclaimed that, she started tearing into her meal.
Auntie Rosa scolded her, telling her not to make a scene.
{n}It seemed that she had seen it coming immediately.
I had been thinking that, if I were as straightforward as Maria onee‐chan, that would probably be exactly what I would do as well,
 so it brought a kind of warm smile to my face when my expectations weren\'t betrayed.
In the end, Auntie Rosa succumbed to her daughter\'s eyes sparkling with anticipation,
 cleaned up the table, and took out the long‐awaited wrapped present.
"Happy birthday, Maria.
 ......I couldn\'t spend much time on it, so I couldn\'t make it very well..."
"Uu!
 If you made it, Mama, I\'m happy with anything!
 Uu‐uu‐uu!
 Sakutaro~, Sakutaro~, uu‐uu!"
Auntie Rosa spoke slightly humbly, but Maria onee‐chan was ecstatic even before opening the wrapping.
......I could really understand that feeling.
 It\'s not a matter of quality.
{n}Just the fact that it was a handmade present was more pleasing than anything.
"Can I open it?
 Can I open it?!"
"I\'d really prefer you to leave it until we get back home,
 ......but, just for a bit, okay?
 We\'ll just take a look and say hello, then put it back, alright?
 You can give him a proper greeting once we get home.
 We\'re in public, so you can\'t fool around, understand?
 Can you promise?"
"Uu!
 Promise promise!"
"So can I open it?
 Can I open ii~t?
 Mamaaa."
"Yes, yes, but just for a bit, okay?"
"Yaaaaaaaaayyyy...{p:0:☆}"
Before Auntie Rosa finished her sentence, Maria onee‐chan started unwrapping the present.
And straight away, ......yellow and orange peeked out.
What appeared was a slightly blank‐looking stuffed lion,
 with cute round eyes and a cute white chest.
It was about the size of a small pillow.
 It looked pretty big held by a short person like Maria onee‐chan, but it probably wasn\'t that large.
From the perspective of someone who didn\'t know better, it would probably look like something cheap bought from a department store or something.
But to Maria onee‐chan, it was her mother\'s handmade stuffed animal, the only one of its kind in the world, and irreplaceable.
"Sakutaro~, Sakutaro~!!
 *giggle*giggle*!!
 Cute cute, reeeeally cute...!
 Thank you Mama, thank you Mama, thank you so much for making such a cute stuffed animal for me even though you\'re so busy with your work...!!"
"...Please don\'t praise me so much, it makes me feel embarrassed.
 I couldn\'t take much time, so I couldn\'t make anything that good.
 I actually wanted to make one so big that you couldn\'t wrap your arms around it..."
"No, this is good!
 With this size, we can always be together.
 We can go out together.
 Sakutaro~, I\'m your onee‐cha~n, uryu~{p:0:☆}"
"It really is a cute stuffed animal.
 So this kid is your best friend Sakutaro."
"Uu!
 Can\'t go to school together, but we\'re always, always together at home and he\'s my best friend."
"You know, Sakutaro is verrry innocent and cute, and he\'s always nice to me.
 Cheers me up when I\'m feeling down, and plays a lot with me when I\'m feeling good!"
"So I\'m not lonely anymore.
 Not lonely when Mama is busy with work and I\'m all alone, and even if no one plays with me at school, not lonely at all.
 Riiight, Sakutaro~, uryu~{p:0:☆}"
......At school, Maria onee‐chan was in similar circumstances to me.
Compared to the other kids in her class, Maria onee‐chan\'s tempo was always a beat too slow.
Her impressionability and way of thinking about things were a little peculiar, ......and she was a little too idiosyncratic to blend in with them.
Her grades were low as well, and yet she was talkative when it came to her specialist field of the occult, which led to her being treated like a weirdo by everyone else in the class.
If she touches you, you\'ll be cursed... Stuff like that.
Everyone in the class acted like she was gross, made fun of her, and avoided her, it seems.
Boys who bumped into Maria onee‐chan...
would start wiping that part of them off against the other boys, as if they\'d gotten something dirty on them.
They would pick up her stuff between pinched fingers like it was something filthy and chase the other boys around with it.
As for the girls, they appeared to find even speaking to her unpleasant;
 they ignored her completely, giggling and sneering at her whenever she made a mistake.
"............It looks like bullying is the same in all eras.
 Humans really don\'t advance.
 Go extinct already."
"......I\'m sad to be bullied, but I think it can\'t be helped."
"It can\'t be helped...?
 Why...?"
"\'Cause, there\'s a rule that says, every class has to have one kid who gets picked on."
"......That\'s a horrible rule.
 I want to find whoever made that and hit them over the head with a brick.
 The corner of it, obviously."
"If I wasn\'t there anymore, I\'m sure a new bullied kid would be chosen in my place.
 By staying strong, I can protect them."
As she said that, she smiled faintly.
.........Maria onee‐chan\'s way of thinking really is unusual.
According to her, there is always a witch residing in the place called school.
No, she says that anywhere that a lot of people gather will most certainly have a witch residing there.
The witch tries to make the students perish by disease or accidents, so that she can steal their souls.
 She sometimes also corrupts the souls, leading them down a path of evil.
Maria onee‐chan told me that an angel came, not content to let that happen.
"......And the angel, she tried to defeat that witch.
 But the witch was powerful, and the fight continued for seven days and seven nights, but even then, it still wasn\'t over.
 The tired‐out witch asked for a truce, and proposed this."
"I\'ve heard this before.
 ......‘Thus far, I have made half of the students in the class become sick or injured.
 But in exchange, I have protected the remaining half of the students from sickness and injury."
"Therefore, if you will make just one member of the class a sacrifice to me, if you will make them "the bullied kid",
 I shall protect all of the other students from sickness and injury’,
 .........wasn\'t it?"
"Uu.
 The angel thought about it.
 Compared to half the class suffering misfortune, having only one person be the unlucky one would be much better.
 Plus, the witch was saying that she would protect the safety of all the other students, using her powerful magic."
"If there are forty students in a class,
 ......and the twenty victims are shrunk down to one, then nineteen people are saved.
 ......A truly logical proposal."
I wonder if this fairy tale has some kind of motif.
{n}If it\'s a creation of Maria onee‐chan, a nine year old girl, that would be pretty impressive.
"The angel decided to accept that proposal.
 So, through the single sacrifice, nineteen people were saved.
 ......So my role is important.
 The witch is protecting nineteen people."
"......Because of us becoming sacrifices?
 .........Well, I don\'t remember ever being thanked by those nineteen people."
...Maria onee‐chan\'s thinking is too compassionate.
The miserableness of our situations is very similar.
 ......And yet, there\'s a difference in our inner peace, just because of a small difference in our way of thinking?
"So then, aren\'t you sad, Maria onee‐chan...?"
"Uu.
 Not sad at all.
 \'Cause I\'ll be together with Sakutaro from now on.
 Right?
 Sakutaro?"
‘Uryuu! If I can be with Maria, I\'m happy too~!’
"Look, Sakutaro is saying he\'s happy too.
 Uu{p:0:☆}"
Maria onee‐chan held up the Sakutaro stuffed animal, playing both sides of the conversation herself.
I don\'t understand.
 ......But that\'s exactly why I want to reach Maria onee‐chan\'s level.
...It\'s what makes me so strongly interested in her tale and her words.
"Ange, is it tough because you\'re all alone......?"
"......It is tough.
 But, just the time when I can be with you like this is different.
 Because I\'m not...all alone."
"Then if Sakutaro becomes your friend too, it\'ll be even more fun.
 Uu!
 Okay, starting today, Sakutaro is your new friend!
 Right, Sakutaro~?"
‘Uryu?
 I am...Ange\'s friend...?
 Uryuu, Ange~!’
Skillfully moving the stuffed animal like it was a puppet, Maria onee‐chan made Sakutaro emote.
She was controlling him, but the charming way he waved his short hand and cocked his head to the side...
made it feel like he really was a new friend called Sakutaro.
Of course, if you were to look at it with cold eyes,
 you would only see Maria onee‐chan comforting mopey old me with a stuffed animal.
......But that stuffed animal had definitely been imbued with a soul.
The soul of Maria onee‐chan\'s love.
So I accepted the existence of a being called Sakutaro inside that stuffed animal.
"Come on, say hi to Sakutaro, Ange.
 Come on, you say hi too, Sakutaro~{p:0:☆}"
‘Uryu......?
 Is Ange...
...a scary person......?’
As Sakutaro timidly looked at me,
 he unexpectedly met my gaze, and hid behind Maria onee‐chan\'s back in surprise.
......Maria onee‐chan really is good at playing with stuffed animals.
"It\'s okay, Sakutaro.
 Ange isn\'t scary, she\'s a very nice girl.
 Uu{p:0:☆}"
‘...H‐hello.
 I\'m Sakutarou...
 ......Uryu......’
"*giggle*.
 ......Pleased to meet you, Sakutarou.
 I\'m Ange.
 I\'m glad to be your new friend."
I held out my right hand as though asking for a handshake,
 and Sakutaro\'s short hand was stuck out towards me, and lightly touched my index finger.
After all, the size is all wrong for a handshake between a human and a stuffed animal.
{n}This greeting by touching each other\'s fingers was our handshake.
"Uu{p:0:☆}
 See, now you two are friends!
 Two people\'s funner than one, and three people\'s funner than two.
 Uu!"
‘Uryu~!’
Maria onee‐chan had given the name "Sakutarou" to the stuffed animal she was going to receive on her birthday,
 and had warmed and expanded his existence in her heart for a long, long time.
Therefore, even before she had met him, his existence had been sublimated into a personality.
From the very first moment they met, the two of them were already friends.
Of course, I don\'t think anything could be as personified and loved as Sakutarou was,
 but that wasn\'t anything extraordinary in Maria onee‐chan\'s eyes.
She loved the things she owned very much, treating them just like friends or beloved pets.
Maybe it was partly that Auntie Rosa hadn\'t let her keep a pet,
 or maybe just her innate desire to treat things as though they were precious.
......Maybe it was that she was so isolated, she had been forced to find friends closer to home.
Because of all those various circumstances, this wasn\'t anything extraordinary from her perspective.
Yet even so, Sakutarou, ......no, maybe I should call him Sakutaro like Maria onee‐chan.
It was certain that Sakutaro was a stuffed animal,
 ...no, a friend, who was more loved than anything, or anyone.
"Hello... It\'s Mama.
 You\'re in a good mood, do you have a friend over?"
"Uu!
 Playing with Sakutaro!
 Listen what he said, *giggle*giggle*!"
It was already past nine at night.
Rosa had asked out of surprise since this wasn\'t an appropriate time for a friend to be over,
 but when she thought about it, Maria didn\'t have any friends who would come over to play, did she...
Even so, to think that she would have so much fun playing with that stuffed animal.
Rosa was very pleased that Maria had liked her birthday present so much.
"I\'m sorry.
 Mama just can\'t get her work finished...
 We\'re having a tough time with next season\'s lineup.
 It looks like we\'re finally starting to get noticed bit by bit, and I really want to somehow make an impact here that can meet their expectations..."
"Staying over again?
 Yep, that\'s okay.
 Do your best, Mama!"
"R‐really?
 Thank you, Maria...
 Thanks for understanding about Mama\'s work..."
Rosa was very surprised that Maria had accepted with such indifference that she couldn\'t come home.
Telling Maria that she would be coming home late or staying overnight had been a heavy burden for Rosa.
Maria would start crying about how lonely she was on the other end of the phone, and it took a lot of time and effort to calm her down.
To think that Maria would accept it in such high spirits...
Is this also thanks to Sakutarou?
...Rosa was once again pleased that she had given such a good present.
"I\'ll make sure I can come back by this time tomorrow.
 Let\'s eat dinner together tomorrow.
 You haven\'t eaten dinner yet, have you, Maria?
 Buy a bento at the convenience store and eat that.
 No sweets, and no soda.
 Make sure you get a receipt with your change, understand?"
"Uu!
 Shopping with Sakutaro, shopping with Sakutaro...!"
"H‐hey!
 Not Sakutaro, have him watch over the house!"
From Maria\'s manner of speech, Rosa got the feeling that Maria had been going shopping with that stuffed animal without her knowing about it.
Rosa\'s forehead creased, and after sourly telling Maria that she was absolutely not to, she hung up.
"Uu...
 Mama said I can\'t go shopping with you..."
‘Uryuu...
 Can\'t go shopping with Maria...
 Staying home alone...will be lonely...’
"Why did Mama say not to go shopping with you...
 Uu..."
‘Uryu...
 ......She must be...embarrassed for people to see you and me together...’
"......Embarrassed?
 Why?"
‘Mama often says not to take me outside.
 And she usually words it like, no, you\'re too old for that now...’
"Uu?
 But I\'m not embarrassed at all to be with you."
‘I am a lion, ...but I\'m a stuffed animal.’
"You\'re a lion and a stuffed animal, but you\'re my friend.
 So let\'s go out together{p:0:☆}
 Just when Mama isn\'t around, as a secret.
 Uu?
 Are you embarrassed too?"
‘I\'m not embarrassed, but......
...uryu, ...the people outside are a little scary...’
"So that\'s it!
 Okay, I\'ll make it so you don\'t have to be scared about going outside!
 Leave it to me, I\'ve got something useful...!"
Maria started fishing around her messy room.
Rosa often told her to clean it up, but she was just bad at cleaning up her room.
However, she knew more or less where everything was.
So much so that whenever Rosa would take it upon herself to tidy up, Maria would have trouble finding things.
"Found it!
 Look, look, Sakutaro.
 A knapsa~ck!"
Maria proudly held it up high.
Sakutaro looked at the gaping‐open knapsack and shifted uneasily...
‘Uryu...... Maria, you aren\'t saying......’
"Uu!
 This way, we can go shopping together, and you won\'t be scared!"
Maria held Sakutaro up, and started stuffing him into the knapsack.
At first, she tried to stick him in head‐first, but then he\'d be upside‐down and suffocate.
 So she pulled him out and tried pushing him in again, feet‐first.
‘Uryuu...!
 It\'s tiiight and craaamped and daaark.
 Uryuu!
 Mmggh.’
"See, it\'s alright.
 If you stick your head out, it isn\'t cramped and it isn\'t dark, so it won\'t be scary.
 And it\'s a good view.
 Uu!"
‘Uryu, you\'re right.
 ......Will it be okay for me to go shopping with you now...?’
"Yep, it\'s okay now!
 What should we get for dinner tonight?!
 Come on, let\'s go out, Sakutaro!
 Uu!"
"*giggle*.
 Looks like you\'re having fun, Maria onee‐chan."
"Yep, it\'s reeeally fun.
 Even things that would be lonely and boring alone all become fun with Sakutaro.
 Any {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} friend would have to go home when it gets late."
"But Sakutaro doesn\'t go home, so he can be with me all the time.
 He\'ll watch TV with me,
 be together even in the futon,
 and even hold my hand on scary nights with thunder."
"He\'ll even chase away the monsters in the closet and under the bed.
 Sakutaro is reliable!"
‘Uryu.
 I\'m a lion, so if there\'s any monsters that scare Maria, I\'ll show my courage and chase them away.
 Uryuu, {ruby:roar:gaooo}.’
They were so close that it made me a little envious.
I\'m supposedly older than Maria onee‐chan.
But I can call her nothing else; even now she stands above me like an older sister, and I am yet to reach her level.
...If only I had a friend close by like Sakutaro.
"But both me and Sakutaro {i:are} friends close by!
 We\'re aaallways right by your side.
 It\'s just that your magic is weak, so you can\'t perceive us unless you open my diary like this."
"......Perceive?
 You know some pretty difficult words, Maria onee‐chan."
According to her, this world is full of magic and spirits.
As natural and nearby as a light breeze.
"You don\'t normally notice or see the wind,
 but when incense or something trails smoke, you can see it, right?"
"......Right.
 And even if you can\'t see it, it is always nearby."
"That\'s it.
 Me and Sakutaro are always really close by you, Ange.
 Gods and spirits and guardians, they\'re always right next to us."
"But if you aren\'t conscious of them, you can\'t feel their existence.
 Like wind that can\'t be seen with the eyes.
 But they are certainly near us, and if the smoke called magic draws trails, anyone can see them."
I had thought that I could only meet Maria onee‐chan when I opened this diary.
But from what she said, she was always with me, and I could meet her at any time if I truly desired to.
"Along with the records of my life, I left a fragment of my own soul in my diary.
 So the power of my magic resides in this diary.
 But it\'s very faint, so no one other than you can detect it."
"......Only I...can tell?"
"Yep.
 After all, the power of a witch resides in you, just like it does in me!
 If you study hard, even you can definitely become a great witch in the future."
".........A witch.
 I wonder if that\'s fun."
"Uu!
 It is fun.
 If you do that, you\'ll be able to tell that me and Sakutaro are always by your side, even without opening the diary."
"And then every day will be so much fun!
 And then I can introduce you to all my other friends.
 And then every day you\'ll have a lot to do, and it\'ll be very lively."
"That might be fun.
 ......I do have the grimoire you left behind, Maria onee‐chan.
 I\'ll try reading it seriously sometime soon.
 ......And then I won\'t be all alone anymore,
 ...will I...?"
"Uu!"{n}{t}‘Uryuu!’
Maria onee‐chan and Sakutaro said that at the same time, happy that I had developed an interest in the world of witches.
With half of Sakutaro\'s face peeking out of the knapsack on her back,
 Maria walked through the late‐night shopping district in high spirits.
It was only to be expected given the time.
 Everyone in the shopping district was either a shop owner lowering the shutters on their shop, or an employee rushing, or else staggering, back home.
Amidst all that, Maria, in the best of moods as though she was hiking, probably stood out a great deal.
The occasionally passing employees glanced backwards over their shoulders at her with the eyes of someone seeing something out of place.
Office ladies giggled at the cute stuffed animal poking its head out of the knapsack.
The supermarket had been closed for a while by this time.
 However, the recently popular convenience stores stayed open until late into the night.
It was very convenient for Maria, whose mother\'s return was often later still.
Maria took the knapsack off her back, and hugging it close to her chest, she headed over to the sweet buns corner.
She pointed to each of the sweet buns she had eaten before, explaining to Sakutaro that this one was delicious,
 and that one was pretty good too.
 Sakutaro seemed to be enjoying it a lot.
"I\'m going to haaave...the three‐flavor bun!
 With just this one thing, you get to eat red bean jam and cream and strawberry jam!
 But sometimes it\'s green pea jam or white bean jam.
 There should be one kind of bean jam."
‘Uryuu!
 It sounds fun with all the different things inside.
 Uryu~!’
"And I\'ll also have a...fruit yogurt!
 There\'s fruit in it, but it isn\'t a sweet, right?
 Yep, I\'m sure Mama will be fine with it.
 Do you want one too, Sakutaro?"
‘Uryu?
 Can I......?
 What about the money?’
"Uu, no proble~m!
 Look, it\'s {c:86EF9C:{ruby:(5000 yen):Shotoku Taishi}}, uu!
 So I can buy you whatever you want too, Sakutaro.
 Let\'s eat together!
 Do you want a yogurt too?"
When Maria made to grab another one of the same fruit yogurt, Sakutaro tilted his head as if he was a little worried.
‘Uryu...
 But I can\'t eat a big one, so a little one is fine.’
"Uu.
 Then what about this small yogurt?
 It\'s 30 yen.
 That\'s cheap."
‘Uryu!
 That\'s good enough for me.
 Yogurt with Maria!’
"Yogurt with Sakutaro!
 Uu!"
Maria put the three‐flavor bun and the two yogurts into a shopping basket, and brought them to the register.
The man working the register, previously in charge of the tobacco shop that had been in this spot until last year, rang her up.
"I seem to be seeing you a lot at this time of day, little lady.
 You\'re a good girl, but next time come with your mother when you go shopping this late, alright?"
"Mama said it\'s okay, so it\'s alright!
 Mama always comes home late because of her work, but we aren\'t lonely.
 Are we, Sakutaro?"
‘Uryuu!’
"Really? That sounds tough.
 Here you go, I\'ll throw in a free soda."
The man working at the store took a can of leftover soda or something from behind the register and packed it into the bag with everything else.
"Thank you, mister!
 Uu!
 Isn\'t that great, Sakutaro?!"
‘Uryuu!’
Since she had been told not to buy soda, she couldn\'t take it back home.
So she decided to drink it on her way back, and not bring the empty can back home.
With the plastic bag with the sweet bun in it hanging from her elbow,
 and hugging the knapsack with Sakutaro in it with that same arm, the two of them walked home drinking the soda...
"......Uu.
 Yuzu and chili pepper soda tastes pretty weird...
 You want to try too, Sakutaro...?"
‘Uryu?
 .........Uryu‐uryu‐uryu, uryuu!!
 Pwhaaah.
 ...Uryuuuu, that was mean, Maria...
 Nasssty......’
"It sure is, uu‐uu."
Of course, it\'s not like she could actually make a stuffed animal drink soda.
She just put the can to Sakutaro\'s mouth and pretended to tilt it.
But it was great fun for Maria to share the taste of this weird drink that she had gotten for free with Sakutaro...
There was a huge moon in the sky.
At times, that moon had been clouded by tears when Rosa had stayed over at work,
 and Maria had thrown a tantrum and been scolded by her mother.
But this moon was very warm, and it seemed to watch over the two of them as they enjoyed their trip home by themselves...
Maria and Sakutaro.
 ......Ange watched the two of them go from behind.
"........................"
What a...heartwarming sight.
The sight of Maria onee‐chan and Sakutaro walking away together...
made it very difficult to remember the several occasions on which she had spent long nights crying because her mother hadn\'t come home...
......I couldn\'t admit this to Maria onee‐chan,
 ...but if I had been in the same position, even if I had given that stuffed animal the name Sakutarou,
 ...it wouldn\'t have been anything more or less than a stuffed animal.
Anyone can make a relationship which only distracts you from your loneliness.
But Maria onee‐chan was different.
{n}Sakutaro wasn\'t a stuffed animal or a toy.
......He was a real friend, and far from just distracting Maria from her loneliness,
 he changed the nights without her mother into a fun time where they could play all by themselves...
Was it because Sakutarou was a special stuffed animal?
{n}Because her mother had made it herself?
{n}Because it was very, very cute?
......Probably...not.
If there is a secret here, it doesn\'t lie within Sakutarou.
{n}...I think it probably lies within Maria onee‐chan.
".........Is this the power of magic you were talking about, Maria onee‐chan...?"
"Uu.
 To know magic is to notice a lot of friends right beside you who you never noticed before.
 It\'s as fun as having a bunch of new toy shops pop up all over the neighborhood!"
......If I, too, locked up in an academy without a single friend,
 ...had the same kind of power as Maria onee‐chan, I wonder if I could make my days just a bit richer.
I wonder if I would become able to honestly shed tears on the nights I feel like crying—and crack a smile when the nights are gray.
"Yep.
 You could.
 You can, Ange.
 After all, you also have the qualifications to become a witch."
".........The qualifications...to become a witch."
"I also have the qualifications to become a witch.
 So I still have a lot more studying and training to do."
"I know we\'ll become wonderful witches, flying in the sky on our brooms, and drawing rainbows with our wands, making candy fall from the sky.
 I know I can do it.
 And when I do, I\'ll show you too.
 It\'ll be like a scene from a wonderful dream."
Maria onee‐chan said that, making an absolute promise with her smile.
......There\'s no way we can become {i:witches}.
 But when I listen to her speak, I can believe that maybe...we really could.
Because the fact is......that on this troubled night, when not a single flower of a smile could bloom, her magic had certainly given birth to a smile.
"......I wonder if I can...
.........become a witch."
"You can.
 ......You got a little bit older, so your soul is slightly bound by gravity.
 So training might be tougher than for me."
"But you definitely can.
 After all, you\'ve already experienced a glimpse of magic."
"I have?
 ......Magic...?"
"Yep.
 Come on, look, I\'m not in this world anymore, but you\'ve summoned me, and you\'re talking with me."
".........This is...magic...?"
"Yep.
 You\'ve filled the fragment of my soul that I left in the diary with magic, keeping me revived."
"Didn\'t I just say it?
 You\'re able to reunite with me, and have a conversation, and show a smile every once in a while, so you must have some magical talent, Ange.
 Maria onee‐chan guarantees it.
 Uu!"
"...You told me just now, Onee‐chan.
 That you\'re actually nearby all the time, even though I\'ve been thinking that I can only see you when I open the diary."
"......If I had more of the power of magic, I could see that,
 ...and, just like now, ......I could have a conversation with you...?
 Any time...?"
"Yep.
 We can talk any time.
 I\'m always by your side to say good morning, and I\'m even there during class.
 Let\'s talk together during boring classes to take your mind off things."
"I can also be someone to talk to during meals, so let\'s always be together like this during lunch break."
"I\'m with you after school too, and of course, I\'m always by your side even when you return to the dormitory.
 ...It\'s just that {i:you never look at me except when you open the diary}."
"............Even if I close the diary,
 ...you\'ll be...
by my side, right?"
"Yep.
 I\'ll be there.
 So if you try to {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} me and try to talk to me, I can definitely answer.
 ......If you look hard and try to talk."
"............I\'ll...
......give it a try."
"It won\'t be easy, you know?
 It\'s not going to go great right from the start, okay?"
".........I understand.
 I\'m sure it won\'t be easy.
 ......But I...
......want to be like you, Maria onee‐chan........."
"Uu.
 Okay.
 .........Then look at me closely.
 Look hard."
"......Yeah."
"Practice slowly closing your eyes and opening them again.
 ...Don\'t start shutting them for a long time right away.
 Burn me into your eyes, then try to blend that onto the inside of your eyelids..."
".........Yeah,
 ......I\'m doing it."
"Once you can visualize me even with your eyes closed,
 .........without changing anything, slowly and softly close your eyes.
 .........Well?
 Still {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} me?"
"Y‐......yes.
 ...I think...I can probably {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} you..."
"Okay, open your eyes again for a second.
 .........Time for the real thing.
 Calm your heart, and close the diary.
 ......When you do, I might disappear for a little while."
"But calm your heart and don\'t rush.
 ......Then, try to blend me back from the inside of your eyelids, back into your eyes again.
 ...Slowly visualize me in the empty air.
 ......In the empty air...{y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} me."
".....................
 ......Okay, I can do this.
 ............Right,
 .........I\'m closing it,
 the diary."
"Uu."
Slowly.........
...I closed the diary.
When I closed the diary, ......a gray reality filled with dull air unfolded.
Of course, Maria onee‐chan\'s form disappeared.
......Give it all you\'ve got, have courage.
{n}...Take the first step into the world of witches.
I felt like Maria onee‐chan was cheering me on inside my heart.
Cheering me on?
 Really?
{n}Isn\'t that just what I\'d like to imagine...?
No, that\'s not it.
{n}I just convince myself that it is...and that\'s {i:why I cannot {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} her}.
Maria onee‐chan is always by my side.
 And even now, she\'s definitely there, cheering me on to do my best...
And I...can hear it.
 So I mustn\'t ignore it like it\'s my imagination or the inner voice of my own heart......
......Believe...
that Maria onee‐chan is there.
I mustn\'t doubt.
 ...I believe.
{n}Onee‐chan said she\'s always by my side.
{n}I must not doubt that...
But as I faced that empty space, that empty back wall of the school building,
 amidst those almost heartlessly boring rays of sunlight, calling out her name was so much easier said than done...
The chains of common sense which had clung to me until today sneered at me, telling me that calling out to the empty air was ridiculous...
It was almost like being told to take a step forward off the roof of a skyscraper overlooking a sea of lights.
......Maria onee‐chan was telling me.
{n}......That it\'s alright, that I can do it.
Stop thinking that you might fall, or that it would be foolish to take a step off a roof,
 ......and free yourself from those chains of common sense...............
"...............whew.........
 .........haaah, ............
 .....................Yeah..."
I steadied my breathing.
{n}I concentrated my mind.
Make the form of Maria onee‐chan you can see vividly on the inside of your eyelids...rise to the surface in the empty space before you.
.........Understand magic,
 ......and {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see}...Onee‐chan......
"............Maria...onee‐chan.........!"
"Huh?!
 Is someone there?!"
Suddenly answered by the sound of rustling bushes and a wild cry, I came to my senses.
Apparently I hadn\'t been the only one behind the school building.
{n}No, I\'d been so immersed in the world of the diary that I hadn\'t noticed that someone else had come afterwards.
I recognized a group of three beyond the bushes.
{n}...They were girls from my class.
It felt as though they had come behind the school building to gossip about someone or talk in secret.
I hurried out of that place.
Because if it became known that I had been alone in a place like this, mumbling to myself, it would probably create more things for me to deal with...
"......She said that, right? She did say that?
 "Maria onee‐chan" or something?!"
"Messed up... I think the nutcase is seeing ghosts or something."
"Pfff...*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!
 Ushiromiya‐san is so~ funny...!"
I could hear the shrill, loud laughter from behind.
Irritated and feeling that Maria onee‐chan had been made fun of,
 I left that place at a quick pace, and then a half‐run once I turned the corner.
......And I might have made it to Onee‐chan\'s world with just a little more time......
Frustrating, aggravating... Why does everyone get in my way...
{n}I\'ve never gotten in their way, not even once......!
I ran and ran, but it still felt as though I could hear their shrill laughs......"Rumor has it, Ange‐chan,
 that you jumped off the top of a building?"
"The groupies were getting annoying, so I thought I\'d give them the slip."
Ange and an old gentleman wearing an expensive suit were alone in a massive, modern conference room.
The conference room was equipped with all the latest equipment for presentations,
 while keeping intact a refined and composed atmosphere;
 that alone was enough to make abundantly clear the worth of the corporation that was its owner.
However, Ange couldn\'t have cared less.
Looking aloof from the world, she sat slovenly in one of the high‐class chairs for executives with salaries probably north of twenty million yen.
"And anyway, I knew they were remodeling on the lower floors and had a safety net, so."
Ange dismissed it with an offhand comment, but in reality, it had been a {i:miracle} among miracles.
She had shot through several layers of safety netting for the remodeling project,
 been caught by a multi‐colored banner adorning the atrium, slid down and off it,
 ...been softly caught by a final banner, landed on the ground without a scratch,
 and then left that place at a brisk walk... It put Hong Kong movies to shame.
"So you knew there was a net—it was still a 200‐meter‐tall skyscraper, y\'know.
 If things hadn\'t gone according to plan, there\'d be a real mess to deal with right now."
"......I figured that if I died, then that would be the end of that, more or less.
 Well, let\'s just say, I was testing my luck a bit.
 Put it down to the rashness of youth."
Ange shrugged coldly, as though saying that she\'d had enough of that topic.
At this, the old gentleman, who was looking at the world below through the window, burst into laughter.
"So you were testing your luck...!
 My, my, you truly are Kinzo‐san\'s grandchild.
 The nerve to entrust yourself to chance, to put your life in the hands of the gods and think nothing of it.
 ...The Chairman was also a person who could stake her life on a bet like it was nothing—wonder if this is all part of the Ushiromiya blood."
"......You really are going to be something big in the future.
 Take my advice.
 Why not put this running away from home act behind you and return to the Sumadera family?"
"I heard that Mom had a bad relationship with her family.
 I don\'t want to go to the house of people I first met at a funeral."
The Sumadera ({p:0:須磨寺}) family is my mom\'s family.
It\'s a bit of an old family from Kyoto, and unbelievably strict in a way you could never have imagined from the frank way Mom acted.
The only person in the Sumadera family I had been on good terms with was Grandpa, who was living separately under the guise of retirement.
Mom, too, kept up contact only with Grandpa,
 and had nothing to do with the rest of the family at all, nor they with her, to an ugly degree.
Even for me, Grandpa\'s house was the only part of the Sumadera family I ever went to visit.
Being young, I hadn\'t really understood it at the time,
 but I hear that Grandpa, as a man who married into his wife\'s family, was in an extremely weak position, and his relationship with Grandma was also bad.
...In fact, maybe you could even have said that he was hated by Grandma, and confined to the house.
It isn\'t hard to imagine that because she had a soft spot for Grandpa alone,
 Mom was probably also hated by the Sumadera family.
As her daughter, I was probably also hated quite a bit.
And yet, they had appeared for the first time at my parents\' funeral,
 shamelessly going on about how I\'d grown, like they could actually act like family after all this time...
After Aunt Eva died, all the wealth of the Ushiromiya family was inherited by me.
If they weren\'t after that, there\'s no way they\'d have been able to say such disgusting words.
"......Well, look, you\'re all alone now, it\'s not like I don\'t get why you\'d just quit caring."
"It\'s not not caring.
 Annoying Aunt Eva has kicked the bucket at last, and I\'m finally stretching my legs and taking a relaxing stroll, that\'s all.
 ......Everyone else is just making too big a deal out of it."
They\'re all just after the vast Ushiromiya wealth I\'m shouldered with, anyway.
They must think if they become my guardians, they\'ll be able to do whatever they please with that wealth.
Just how many people have tried to act like a substitute parent and get close to me?
"Ange‐chan, you know, if life\'s treating you rough, you can come talk to me anytime if you want some advice.
 I think of you as my true grandchild."
"...........................haah.
 ...Let\'s make that a no‐thank‐you for now.
 ...More importantly, let\'s get back on topic."
"Ange‐chan.
 Ask me as much as you want, but I\'m hiding nothing.
 The Chairman was the only one to survive Rokkenjima that day.
 And she gave up the ghost without saying a thing."
"I myself understand nothing.
 We\'re all in the dark, as they say."
The old gentleman was one of a number of corporate heavyweights who, after Eva had passed away, had been entrusted with the business group she had built up.
The one he referred to as "the Chairman", technically the former chairwoman, was Ushiromiya Eva.
His company had once had a friendly relationship with Hideyoshi\'s company,
 and he had been a close friend of both Hideyoshi and Eva.
For that reason, after Eva lost Hideyoshi, he had become the only person to whom she could reveal her true thoughts.
When Eva\'s heart had been torn by the loss of her family, and she had taken it out on Ange,
 he had also acted as a buffer between the two, so although Ange didn\'t trust him, she too found him an easy person to pay a visit...
"That crime,
 ...no, accident, I guess.
 If I call it a crime, I\'ll get in trouble.
 ...Sure, I had my questions, just like the rest of the public and the talk shows."
"......At the time of the accident, why was Aunt Eva in a place two kilometers away from the mansion, all alone?
 And on the night of a storm."
"At the time, Kinzo‐san was unsure as to who he would choose to be the next successor.
 ......Publicly it was to be the eldest son, Krauss‐san, but he wasn\'t well trusted by Kinzo‐san."
"......So, to fairly determine a successor from among the four siblings, he made this game‐like test called the riddle of the epitaph...?"
"Only officially speaking.
 ......Kinzo‐san probably planned to make Eva‐san the successor to the head from the beginning."
"He wanted to leave the family to Eva‐san, who unlike Krauss‐san was extremely diligent and brilliant, even at the cost of taking back his own rule that the eldest son would be the successor."
"...The new rule about giving the family headship to the one who solved the epitaph...
was probably nothing more than a farce so that he could snatch the position of successor away from Krauss‐san."
"What do you mean by...farce?"
"There was no need for anyone to solve that epitaph.
 Once it had been displayed for an appropriate amount of time, Kinzo‐san would just call Eva‐san, who he truly wanted to succeed him,
 {i:and give her the answer}.
 In other words, that itself was the proof of the succession to the headship."
"..................There hasn\'t been any mention of this on the talk shows, has there?"
"Well, that\'s because if you start going on about the succession of the head, it\'s gonna strengthen the murder theory.
 I\'m no fool myself.
 I\'m not gonna go out of my way to say things that could invite misunderstandings."
The way he told it went like this:
At the time, the head of the Ushiromiya family, Kinzo, diagnosed with little time left to live, was troubled over the problem of who was to succeed him.
Normally, the successor would be fixed as the oldest son, Krauss, as laid out by Kinzo himself.
...But in his later years, Kinzo began to think that Eva was more fitting to be head.
However, Kinzo, stubborn even to himself and obstructed by the title of successor that he had given to Krauss,
 searched for an {i:official stance} by which he could skip over Krauss and select Eva as his successor.
That official stance was the riddle of the epitaph.
The primary successor was still Krauss,
 but there was a new rule, saying that if someone appeared who could solve the riddle, they would be chosen as the successor to the head.
And on the day of what would probably be his final family conference, Kinzo had told Eva the answer to that riddle himself.
......In short, it was the same as proclaiming that Eva was the successor.
"On that day, Eva‐san was summoned by Kinzo‐san, and that was revealed to her.
 And so that she could succeed the head, he called Eva‐san to the hidden mansion Kuwadorian, known only to the head."
".........And the claim is that she escaped harm in that accident because she was waiting at the hidden mansion just beforehand?
 Maybe Aunt Eva just killed everyone and made it {i:look} like an accident so that she could steal all of the wealth,
 and {i:that\'s} why she\'s the only one who escaped unharmed."
"Well, that\'s what the papers are shouting about.
 However, I believe Eva‐san.
 ......I think there are several points that make her worthy of trust."
"For example...?"
"That ring of the Ushiromiya family head, which is on your finger as we speak.
 That ring is the only one of its kind in the world, which Kinzo‐san had specially made.
 And even the artisan who made it acknowledges that the object on your finger is, without a doubt, that ring."
The Ushiromiya family...Head\'s Ring.
That ring, with the heft of gold and the one‐winged crest on it,
 had diamonds adorning the pedestal, and possessed both stateliness and a sense of gaudy extravagance.
Kinzo had worn that on his finger, never removing it even for a moment.
The fact that Eva had it was apparently proof that Kinzo had acknowledged her as the successor to the head.
"Because Eva‐san did indeed have that ring,
 and, if you take into consideration that Eva‐san was indeed more capable, and that Krauss‐san was known to have made a fool of himself numerous times in the business setting,
 I cannot imagine that Eva‐san\'s story is completely made up."
"............Although there\'s also the possibility that she murdered Grandfather in order to steal that ring.
 And then, using some kind of trick, she massacred everyone and made it look like an accident."
"Ah, yes.
 It seems the papers are accusing her of massacring her entire family with the aim of keeping all the wealth to herself."
"It is true that Eva‐san was the kind of person to take drastic action when it came to the crunch.
 It could be possible......that she committed the only murders she planned on committing in her life to grab this chance to make the Ushiromiya wealth all her own.
 ............But you know, I don\'t think that\'s true."
"What\'s the second point making her worthy of that trust?"
"Eva‐san\'s family.
 Hideyoshi‐san and George‐kun.
 ......You might find this difficult to believe, Ange‐chan, but Eva‐san was a person who treasured her family greatly."
......He was right; I found it very hard to believe that, or admit it.
{n}But deep inside I knew.
Aunt Eva really had been a person who treasured her family greatly.
The root of her twisted personality had been nothing more than the sadness of losing her beloved husband and son.
Having been used as an outlet for all that emotion, I had no feelings of sympathy for her at all,
 ......but even so, it\'s not like I couldn\'t imagine that losing her entire family had dealt her an incredible shock sufficient to transform her personality.
"......You\'re saying that there\'s no way Aunt Eva, who loved her family, would have abandoned her husband and her son?"
"That\'s right.
 If Eva‐san really had been the culprit and massacred her entire family, making it look like an accident,
 ......her husband and her son would definitely be alive right now."
"She\'d have tried to wriggle out of it by saying her family was the only one in the hidden mansion by coincidence.
 If Hideyoshi‐san and George‐kun had both been alright, even I would have probably suspected Eva‐san."
"......It\'s impossible for me to believe that all that wailing Eva‐san did at Hideyoshi‐san\'s funeral was an act."
".........Both of those are circumstantial evidence.
 That isn\'t the same as physically showing Aunt Eva\'s innocence."
"Hahahaha.
 That\'s just unconstructive.
 Eva‐san was the only one left alive.
 And she says that is the truth."
"But no one can prove her innocence."
"Yes, that\'s right.
 And no one can prove that she committed a crime, either."
".............................."
"And the final point making her worthy of trust—is the police.
 After all, it was one hell of an incident.
 Pushed forward by a public in an uproar over the murder theory, the police must have investigated her thoroughly."
It\'s easy to feel something unnatural about the claim that Eva had escaped the accident by coincidence,
 because she and she alone had escaped to a hidden mansion.
Furthermore, at the time, Hideyoshi\'s company had been right in the middle of a takeover struggle, and had wanted a large sum of cash in order to buy off the big stockholders.
It shouldn\'t be too hard to find a motive there.
But as a matter of fact, en route to the family conference, Eva\'s person had been perfectly clean.
Nothing unnatural was found on her that could have been used to brutally murder her family and make it look like an accident.
The servants who escaped harm by being off‐duty on that day also stated that they hadn\'t seen anything strange regarding anyone related to the event, Eva included.
Putting all of that together,
 it could only be concluded that Ushiromiya Eva had headed to Rokkenjima for a normal family conference, no different from usual,
 and became involved in an accident...
"The police placed her under all that scrutiny, and they still couldn\'t find evidence that it was a crime.
 ......That was the police\'s conclusion.
 Doesn\'t that put an end to Rokkenjimagate?"
"......That just means that the police
 {i:couldn\'t find} the evidence of her crimes, doesn\'t it?"
"Oh, come on, you could go on forever that way.
 It becomes a Devil\'s Proof.
 To expose a crime, you just need to find the evidence.
 But what can you find to show someone\'s innocence?
 It\'s impossible to prove a negative fact."
"......Did Aunt Eva commit a crime, or did she not...
 Because we can\'t find the data to decide that, the truth will remain a mystery, in other words."
".........Well,
 to put it in the words you\'re hoping for, that\'s how it is.
 Even Eva‐san couldn\'t conclusively prove her own innocence."
"An unfortunate accident occurred on that island.
 And Eva‐san survived by chance.
 And that\'s literally all we know!"
"In short, as Eva‐san is the only survivor, it all comes down to whether you can believe her story or not."
"......I believed.
 What she told me about the ring, and her admirable love for her family.
 And the tears she showed at the funeral.
 Taking all of that into consideration, I decided I would believe her story."
"......But I don\'t believe it.
 If she wanted to steal the ring, there were probably many ways for her to do so, and no one knows whether her relationship with her family really was good.
 It\'s impossible to prove that the tears at the funeral were the real thing."
"......Anyway, in the first place, I {i:hate} Aunt Eva.
 So that doesn\'t exactly inspire me to believe her story."
"Hahahaha...
 How does one view the truth of the incident?
 You and I are at loggerheads on the issue.
 Even though the information we\'re given is exactly the same, we develop completely different opinions."
".........This kind of thing happens all the time in politics and economics.
 No matter the enterprise, it will always result in a division of opinions.
 Do you know why?"
".........No?"
"It\'s about whether you have love.
 ......Depending on whether you feel love for the other side, the way you see things is completely different."
"If a person you like gives to the poor, you can respect them, right?
 But if someone you hate starts donating, you fiercely protest that it\'s a publicity stunt or they\'re handing out favors."
"No matter what they do or don\'t do, you thank them if you have love and criticize them if you don\'t.
 That\'s how the world works."
"Can you believe Aunt Eva or not...
 ......You\'re saying that\'s the only difference?"
"Those who suspect her will probably take anything she does or doesn\'t do and view it as truly unnatural.
 And it works in reverse.
 ......As for me,
 I think that perhaps, except in extreme cases, truth in this world doesn\'t exist."
"No, even {i:if}...
even if truth {i:does} exist, whether you believe it or not is determined by whether or not you have love."
"......Can you really call truth "truth" if it isn\'t absolute?
 Even if Eva‐san had been able to demonstrate a physical alibi, would you have been able to believe it?"
"..........................."
He has a point.
...I hate Aunt Eva, so I\'ll probably deny all information beneficial to her,
 and maliciously interpret all neutral information.
......In other words, inside myself, the truth is already decided.
 And yet I\'m still unsatisfied, still searching for the "truth"—so what exactly is this "truth" I\'m searching for...?
"That\'s how it is.
 So no matter what you hear from me, as long as you still suspect Eva‐san,
 it won\'t change anything for you, not after all this time."
"Even if you got your hands on a piece of hitherto unknown information, I still don\'t think you\'d be able to reach the truth, not the way you are now, at least."
".........So I\'m incapable...
of reaching the truth?"
"Well, yeah.
 No matter what kind of new information or proof you find, Ange‐chan, you aren\'t gonna change your stance that Eva‐san is the culprit, right?"
"Then it doesn\'t matter what else you look into, it isn\'t gonna mean anything, is it?
 {i:The truth inside of you is already decided}."
"..........................."
"But if...
if you don\'t think of that as truth, and earnestly desire to arrive at the deeper, real truth, there is a single way."
"I believe I already mentioned that once, though.
 Know what it is?"
"......You mean...love?
 I don\'t really know what you mean by that."
"Right now, you are thinking about this while supposing that Eva‐san is the culprit.
 But that is like looking at things with one eye."
"With one eye, no matter how much you squint, you can\'t see an object in three dimensions, right?
 That\'s why you need another eye.
 Of course, in a different position from the eye you have right now."
"............You\'re telling me to look at things based on the supposition that Aunt Eva isn\'t the culprit,
 ...or else, that it actually was a real accident...?"
"Yes, yes, exactly.
 When you think about something, try to look at it from different perspectives.
 If you don\'t, you won\'t understand anything about how it really is."
"It\'s the same with newspapers.
 With only a single newspaper, you can only see things from the single viewpoint of the writer who wrote the article.
 Sometimes it takes reading multiple papers before you can process the information rationally and in three dimensions."
"......Without love, the truth cannot be {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen}.
 .........Mmm, that\'s got a nice ring to it, wahahaha."
Maybe he found it amusing that a cheesy phrase like that had popped out of his mouth.
{n}For a while, he laughed, looking pleased.
......By that, he was simultaneously declaring that he had told everything that he knew,
 and that it was about time for me to leave.
 Understanding that, I got to my feet.
"I understand your feelings now, Ange‐chan.
 You should do as you like for a while, until you\'re satisfied.
 ......You were six years old at the time.
 You lost your family before you could even make sense of it, and I fully understand you feeling like you still don\'t have closure."
"..........................."
"You may learn the truth, and you may not.
 Eva‐san may be the culprit, and she may be a victim."
"......I pray that you find the "truth" you believe in, Ange‐chan.
 A journey at such a young age may be a valuable experience."
"Thank you very much...
 ......I am truly sorry to be such a bother when you are so busy, Okonogi‐san."
"No trouble, no trouble.
 What are you going to do now?"
"Well, whatever works.
 ......I\'ve made appointments with several specialists and people related to the crime, so I plan to pay them a visit."
"I see.
 I hope you can find an answer you can accept."
At that moment, company president Okonogi\'s secretary came in, and handed him a memo over his shoulder.
He read it and looked between it and my face.
"......Ange‐chan.
 My apologies that this comes right after telling you to try going on a journey, but I have some information you should lend an ear to.
 ......It looks like you\'re in a bit of a nasty fix right now."
"People after my money?
 This is why money is stupid."
"Yes, but if you try to sell off the whole shebang and donate the entire sum to social welfare,
 those people already making plans for your fortune, you\'re gonna make their eyes pop out."
"Oh, so it\'s the Sumadera family.
 The arrogance of them trying to act like my guardians."
I have the precedent of Aunt Eva.
{n}Who would {i:ever} go under the care of the Sumadera family?
They probably want, as Aunt Eva had so often threatened in the past,
 to cut off my arms and legs, throw me in a warehouse, and suck the Ushiromiya family\'s wealth dry.
"A representative from the Sumadera family is coming here.
 They\'re saying to hand you over...no no, that they want to protect you."
"Representative, you say?"
"It\'s your aunt.
 Kyrie‐san\'s younger sister.
 She has said before that she thinks of you as a little sister."
"She must be kidding.
 At least call me a grandchild, you old granny."
"Judging from the context, it seems they\'re not planning on taking your wishes into consideration.
 I have a car waiting in the parking lot two stories underground.
 Go."
"......The Sumadera family is telling you to hand me over, right?
 Is it really alright to let me go?"
"You will definitely be someone big in the future, Ange‐chan.
 Let\'s call this a favor to be repaid upon your success.
 ...Go, quickly...!"
After bowing silently and deeply, Ange left that place at a dash.
After watching her leave, the secretary straightened her glasses and whispered.
"The Sumadera family told us to stall her...
 Is it alright to let her go?"
"We did stall her, more than enough.
 If they still don\'t make it in time, that\'s the Sumaderas\' error.
 ......I told Ange‐chan to run for it.
 And I informed the Sumaderas that Ange‐chan was here.
 Whether she\'s caught or not, neither one of them will blame me."
"......Everything in this world is...love, you see...
 It\'s alright, she\'ll escape.
 After all, she\'s the kind of kid who can jump off a building to lose her pursuers."
......Okonogi again looked down at the world below,
 and muttered "yeah, that\'d be beyond me..."
Ange was no fool herself.
She got off the elevator, and stepped out onto the third floor.
A taxi in the second level of the basement?
That\'s so overly courteous that it feels wrong.
 It\'s probably better to decline that.
But my enemies aren\'t fools either.
 They probably have control of not just the underground parking lot, but the first‐floor lobby as well.
This is such a massive building.
{n}Instead of getting anxious and escaping outside, maybe it\'s better to stay on the inside and wait it out?
No, that\'s no good.
 If they gain control of the security room in a modern building like this, I\'ll have nowhere to run to.
This entire building is like a massive dead end.
The third floor is the business floor.
 A girl like me clearly sticks out.
Trying not to stand out any more than I had to, I walked at a quick pace, searching for an emergency staircase.
 ......One running down the outside of the building would be ideal.
I found the door to the emergency staircase.
After opening that heavy door, I found the outside stairs I was hoping to see.
Once outside, I immediately encountered a man smoking a cigarette, who looked like an employee skipping work.
{n}After glaring at me, he quickly crushed up his cigarette and went away.
It looks like there\'s no one below.
{n}...If I\'m going to escape, now is my only chance...!
Just when I thought that, with an incredible squealing of the tires, a black car slid directly below me and came to a sudden stop.
......It felt from the tire sounds like there were several more of them, and this one had come here to block this path.
"......Not bad, Aunt Kasumi.
 Even your niece leaving by an emergency exit gets a car sent to pick her up."
Bam‐bam! The car doors opened forcefully, three men in black suits jumped out, and they looked up at the emergency staircase.
......Ahhh shoot, our eyes met.
"12, target found.
 Northwest side emergency stairs, third floor, send support."
"Ange‐sama!
 Please do not move from there!
 Forgive our roughness...!!"
The three of them began to clamor up the emergency staircase.
......They already announced that they\'re planning to be rough.
 This is pretty bad.
They\'ve probably been ordered to bring me back by any means, with one of my arms yanked off if necessary, just so long as I\'m still breathing.
Clankclankclankclank!!
 Their heavy, wild footsteps became a helix and began to rise from the lower floors, getting closer...!
In the entrance lobby of the building, a woman was walking forwards at a leisurely pace, with seven black‐suited guards in tow.
Seeing this ostentatious entrance, the security guards for the building ran up to them, asking if they had an appointment.
".........How typical of Tokyo people.
 You require a name to even understand the status of the person you are talking to...?"
"M‐my apologies...
 The policy at our company is for guests to take a securi—"
"......Back down, plebeian.
 I came because I was called by your president.
 Call Okonogi Tetsuro here.
 To think that he would call me here and then not welcome me... How typical of Tokyo people..."
"My apologies.
 Welcome to the Ushiromiya Group, Sumadera Kasumi‐san."
With his secretary behind him, Okonogi dashingly appeared from the elevator.
Even though both of them wore bold smiles, they were caught in a tension reminiscent of the smell of gunpowder...
".........Where is Ange?
 I came to collect my sister\'s darling, darling daughter."
"Strict observance of time is our motto here at the Ushiromiya Group.
 The former Chairman herself said that those who can\'t keep time can\'t keep contracts."
"......You call me all the way to Tokyo to be greeted by this mess?
 You let her go, didn\'t you."
"She got away...is the wording I would have preferred.
 We did stall her for quite some time, believe it or not.
 I\'m not surprised she smelled a rat.
 There wouldn\'t have been a problem if you had come on time, Sumadera‐san."
"This is why you provincials are such a hassle, you\'re never ever punctual.
 Wahhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!"
"............What did you say just now......?
 What did you say to me...?"
You couldn\'t sense any of Kyrie\'s sociability in the face of her younger sister Kasumi.
She wore on her face the arrogance of the ancient Sumadera family towards the ruined Ushiromiya family,
 ......as well as pride, because she didn\'t want anyone to notice that her family was declining so much that they couldn\'t ignore the Ushiromiya family\'s wealth.
Even at a glance, it was easy to understand why Ange hated everything about her aunt...
Kasumi couldn\'t stand even a slight insult, and while she still smiled, her eyebrows twitched.
At that time, one of the men in black suits behind Kasumi whispered to her.
"Ange‐sama has been found.
 We are dealing with her as I speak."
"......Oh, I\'m glad we made it in time.
 ......Thank you, Okonogi.
 It seems I can finally take my naughty niece home.
 ......I\'ve been so eager to have a nice long talk with that girl in my tea room that I already have the tools ready and waiting, you know.
 Ehheheheheheheh...!"
Clankclankclankclank......!!
As the violence of the sound drew a helix, it rushed up at me from below, threatening to swallow me up.
Of course, even if I fight them, I stand no chance of winning.
 Even so, if I run into the building, it\'ll be like jumping into a dead end of my own accord.
The enemies will increase in number with time.
 If I can\'t do anything here, I won\'t have any more chances to escape.
Then, three muscular black‐suits came into view below me.
One, two, three.
 Three people.
 In other words, everyone who had gotten out of the car.
If there had been just one of them, I might have been able to wait for the moment of arrival to dropkick him as hard as I could, which might have worked out.
 ......But it really is impossible with three of them.
Wait... Three, huh...
 ......Three...might be just about doable...
{n}......I can do it......!
"Whew.........
 ............haaaaAAAAHHH!!"
"Wh—?!
 Y‐you idiot, stop!!
 Look ooooout!!
 Uwaaaaaaaaaahhh...!!"
"01 calling 12, do you have her, please respond.
 ......What\'s wrong?!
 Respond!"
"Wh‐......what kind of person... Damn it......"
.........Nggghh...
 ......Ouchhh...
{n}Look, see... That worked out, didn\'t it? It\'s just {i:three}.
I\'ve already experienced much higher places, after all.
{n}I knew I could jump down {i:just three floors}...!
It\'s a good thing that the car they came in was right beneath me.
{n}Even if it wasn\'t as pleasant as a trampoline, it broke my fall, a little gently, a little roughly.
"......Well, that makes me feel wonderful.
 No one asked you to go and dent that badly."
Having broken my fall, the roof of the car now had a massive dent around my body.
I guess car roofs are more delicate than I thought.
{n}I don\'t think it\'s because of my weight.
Apparently, the three men on the stairs hadn\'t anticipated me jumping down.
Having realized that they had been outwitted, they were hurriedly rushing back down.
I have to run and escape while I have the chance.
{n}As I moved my body, the car roof made buckling and popping sounds.
But I had been naive.
 There was no way they\'d have all rushed up the stairs without leaving one person behind.
There was one black‐suit left in the driver\'s seat of the car that had broken my fall.
{n}He stuck his head out of the window, and when he realized that the thing that had fallen on him was me, he jumped out.
In a rush, I jumped off the roof, but his reaction was really fast.
 ......Either there was a massive reward for capturing me, or a harsh punishment for letting me get away.
"15, secured, secured...!"
"Owowowow......!!
 Ghhhh, get your hands off me, let GO!!"
I was mercilessly held down against the asphalt.
 I was being crushed face‐down, covered and pressed down on from above.
It was a hold without a trace of elegance, but it really was logical and left me absolutely no room for resistance.
I tried to push back with both hands, searching for a way to resist,
 but I was being pushed down solidly, and I couldn\'t even tear myself off the asphalt.
Then another car came, squealing its tires as it slid to a sudden stop.
Guess it\'s all over.
"Gyah!!!"
The man that had been crushing me let out a sharp cry.
 ......He had yelled close to my left ear, making it ring.
 What in the world?!
The black‐suit and I were unceremoniously rolled over.
After being turned face up, the first thing I saw was...an arm stuck out right in front of my eyes.
".........Amakusa...?
 Why are you here...?"
"Let\'s talk about that after we\'ve lost them.
 To the car, quickly, missy...!"
Amakusa grabbed my arm and easily pulled me up, spinning me around with himself as the center of gravity.
The thought that it was a little like a dance lasted only the few brief moments before he flung me through the open door into the driver\'s seat.
I climbed over the hand brake and slid into the passenger\'s seat.
{n}Pushing me through, Amakusa also got in and took up the driver\'s seat.
Since we had suddenly taken off while I was still on all fours, I had to kick and struggle around on the seat for a while, like a turtle flipped onto its back...
Amakusa checked the rear‐view mirror for cars in pursuit, but flew into the artery of the big city without lowering his speed in the slightest.
We sewed our way between cars one after another.
{n}Just like a chase scene in some action movie.
......Tossed about by his horrible driving, I had trouble getting myself reseated.
"Any injuries, missy?"
"All good.
 Humans are surprisingly durable.
 From now on, whenever I miss a down elevator, I\'ll just jump out a window instead."
"Hyahhahaha, looks like air dives are your hobby, missy.
 Still, I recommend that you bring a parachute next time."
"I\'ll do that, if I remember after jumping."
"Hyahhahahahaha, <cool>!"
He smacked the steering wheel, guffawing.
Need an explanation for this flippantly spoken man?
His name is Amakusa Juuza ({p:0:天草十三}).
He was originally one of Aunt Eva\'s guards.
 If I remember correctly, she hated him for being too jokey and too chatty.
He was especially young amongst the guards, but contrary to his outward flippancy, he had hopped from the 1st Airborne of the JSDF to the French Foreign Legion,
 placing himself in overseas private military companies and high‐class security companies one after another, making for a pretty incredible and unique career.
......But I heard that he ran off from both the JSDF and the French Foreign Legion, and that he\'ll be arrested if he enters France again.
{n}Both of these flippant episodes were very typical of him.
Apparently, the guards had been sternly told not to chat with me unnecessarily,
 but I recall that didn\'t stop him coming to take a pass at me.
Aunt Eva had particularly disliked that, and I believe she dismissed him right before she died.
"It\'s nice to hear that casual tone again.
 What have you been up to since getting fired?"
"Coaching people at Blackwater.
 I came back to this country for some time off, and President Okonogi offered me a high wage."
"......And you ran off again?
 What use is a man like that, I wonder."
"It doesn\'t count as running off as long as I come back by next week.
 I talked with him yesterday.
 I was told that you might attract some troublesome people."
"Sorry that it turned out to be exactly right."
"My name probably came up since I know you, and I\'ve got plenty of experience when things get crazy.
 Thanks to you, it looks like this\'ll make for a happy break along with some pocket money."
"......Okonogi‐san employed you as my guard?"
"He probably wants you to owe him one, missy.
 ......After I got the axe, President Okonogi helped me out a bunch, you see.
 He\'s got me right where he wants me, can\'t say no to him.
 Hyahha!"
"......Seems that if you let Okonogi‐san help you out, it\'ll be pretty costly in the future.
 ......So, where are you planning on taking me?"
"Wherever.
 I\'m employed until the weekend.
 Anything after that\'ll cost you extra."
"How much a day?"
"I\'ll cut you a deal for 50K.
 Plus expenses."
"If you stop cracking jokes, I\'ll double it.
 The period of employment is undetermined.
 It might be several weeks."
"...That\'ll be tough.
 I\'ll have to call the boss to get an extension on my vacation."
"I just want to investigate that day, more than anything."
"......Oh, you\'re talking about Rokkenjima?"
"Yes.
 What happened on that island twelve years ago?
 ......I want to investigate it with my own hands, and find a satisfying explanation."
"Will you really make any new discoveries at this point, investigating something that happened so long ago...?"
"You\'re right.
 Which is why this is a journey for my own self‐satisfaction.
 ......Once I\'m done, I\'ll just throw my hands up and go to the Sumadera family."
"......Didn\'t Aunt Kasumi say something about wanting to treat me to some {ruby:powdered tea:matcha}?
 Maybe I\'ll be made to kneel on some sharp wooden blocks and clutch stones or something while we drink."
"Damn that sounds freaky, hyahhahahaha...!"
"My apologies, we lost sight of her...
 A single man thought to be an associate assisted in her escape.
 Judging by his possession of a stun gun and his driving skills, he is no amateur."
"............I see. Thank you.
 .........I\'m disappointed, Okonogi.
 Shall I take this as your answer...?"
"Letting her get away was your screwup.
 Not my problem, I\'m afraid."
"............I\'d dearly like to treat you to some matcha in the near future as well.
 The next time you are in Kyoto, please do stop by.
 .........Let\'s go."
"Huh, leaving already?
 {c:86EF9C:You could have some chazuke before you go.}"
"..................*cackle*cackle*.
 ...Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho...!!"
Her back to Okonogi, she laughed at first lightly, but with an increasingly shrill and hateful tone, using that as a substitute for a sharp parting remark.
At the exact moment she stopped laughing, the look on her face changed dramatically to that of a {ruby:hannya:demon},
 but because her back was facing him, Okonogi never saw that expression.
Okonogi watched her go, laughing coolly.
{n}His secretary whispered over his shoulder.
"......Is that alright?
 Milady Ange is our company\'s primary stockholder.
 If the Sumadera family becomes her guardian..."
"I get it.
 But you know, we\'re the one‐and‐only Ushiromiyas.
 We can\'t let them take us lightly."
"......Still, looks like he outmanuevered them pretty well.
 ......Now we\'ll just let Ange‐chan do as she pleases.
 I\'m counting on you, Amakusa."
"......Kasumi‐sama.
 The getaway vehicle was a rental.
 The license plate on display was a fake.
 He\'s clearly a pro.
 They will probably abandon the car.
 Pursuit will be difficult.
 ......Should we have the police chase them?"
"............Let me see.
 Shall we have them search for a runaway daughter?
 They are getting paid with our taxes, so we must have them be of some use every once in a while.
 Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho............"
"You do realize I left the mansion defiantly insisting to Mother that she should leave it to me?
 Do you intend to embarrass me further still......?"
"It looks like I need to serve some matcha to every single one of you, doesn\'t it?
 ......Our underground tea room is cramped, so you\'ll have to wait in line, won\'t you......?"
"N‐no...
 We will search with everything we have."
"......Ahh, she really is a cute kid, just like Nee‐san.
 ......Especially that unrestrained, self‐centered side of her.
 ......Ahh, now I can\'t see her as anyone but Nee‐san."
"Ahh, I\'m truly looking forward to it.
 To think I\'ll be able to invite Nee‐san\'s daughter to my tea room......
 Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho......!!"
"......The Sumadera family sure moved quickly.
 Did Okonogi‐san sell me out...?"
"You\'re joking.
 He\'s my client.
 If he\'d sold you out, he wouldn\'t have hired me, right...?"
"...........................
 ...I guess that\'s true."
"......Ah, so that\'s why you got off the elevator at the third floor?"
"Having a car waiting in the underground parking lot was suspiciously well‐organized of him, you see.
 I thought that he might have sold me out.
 ......Although at this point, it\'s impossible to prove whether there was an ambush set up in the parking lot or not."
"Riiight... Damn, the poor guy.
 Looks like he didn\'t have your trust, missy.
 That car in the basement was mine."
"Huh......?
 He was talking about you...?"
"I freaked out when the elevator was empty.
 If I hadn\'t been able to listen in on their radio, who knows what would have happened by now."
"..................So...what?
 If I had obediently believed Okonogi‐san and gone to the parking lot,
 there would have been no need for me to do that jump off the third floor...?"
"Pretty much.
 Well, it turned out alright in the end."
"........................"
.........Well that\'s something.
If I hadn\'t suspected President Okonogi,
 ......I could have easily escaped without getting caught in a tough spot.
{i:"President Okonogi might have sold me out."}
No, because paranoia told me that it was better to suppose that he sold me out, I assumed and {i:decided} that he did.
Because I wasn\'t able to believe him,
 my truth, regardless of his truth, became "he sold me out"......
I thought back on President Okonogi\'s words.
Can you really call truth "truth" if it isn\'t absolute...?
Truth can change completely depending on whether you have love or not.
In the end, ......perhaps this thing called "truth" doesn\'t exist.
For each person who speaks of it, another truth is born from their interpretations—that\'s all there is to it.
If I can\'t accept something that indeterminate as truth,
 ......then where {i:does} the truth that I really want to find exist?
 ......And is that something that can be seen with the eyes?
I might be surprised to discover...that even if the truth is thrust in front of me,
 ......it may be something that I cannot {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see}...
"......Without love, it cannot be {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen}, is it..."
".........This fragment of yours is very lively.
 It doesn\'t bore me."
"You said to me.
 You told me to search for the truth of twelve years ago.
 ......But I feel like it\'s not really clear to me anymore."
"What isn\'t?"
"......What is truth?
 There are as many truths as there are people.
 There are as many interpretations as there are people.
 And those can be twisted by opinions and changed indefinitely.
 ......Is truth really that indeterminate and vague?"
"It is.
 ......Truth is indeterminate.
 It can be like a particle, or like a wave, and it can hold conflicting forms at the same time."
"You are free to believe that the cat in the box is alive, or that it is dead.
 ......But the truth is very delicate.
 It changes its appearance just by being observed."
"You\'re talking about that Schrödinger\'s cat box?
 .........Nonsense.
 If you open the box, you learn the truth.
 Debating what happens before you open it is armchair theorizing at best."
"Yes.
 And yet, in order to deny those armchair theories, you need to open the box.
 ......If a box cannot be opened, any and all ideas about its contents are impossible to disprove.
 In other words, truth."
".........As long as truth can\'t be denied, it keeps its form."
"That\'s right.
 As long as truth can\'t be observed, it keeps its form."
"So, any reckless statement can suffice as truth if it can\'t be exposed as a lie."
"Yes.
 ......Even if they contradict each other, endless ideas can exist as truth at the same time without being negated."
".........So even something as screwed up as my family being captured by the Rokkenjima witch and imprisoned twelve years in the past for all eternity...
can exist as truth as long as we don\'t know what happened twelve years ago..."
"Twelve years ago, on Rokkenjima, the witch called {f:5:Beatrice} wrenched open a space for "endless" imagination, and swallowed everything up into it, using it as a cat box.
 ......Everything in the unopening box is truth."
That\'s right.
 {i:We don\'t know what happened on that island}, so it becomes endless.
"......So long as it remains closed, that is.
 All I have to do is wrench it open."
".........But that box was closed up twelve years ago, and I don\'t even know where it is.
 ......Even if I were to visit Rokkenjima, just what would I be able to learn, there on that desolated island, about what happened twelve years ago?"
"Who knows?
 What could you learn, I wonder.
 .........In any event, that is something that can only be done by the person who is able to walk around freely in the world of 1998, twelve years in the future—
the final witch, {f:5:Ange Beatrice}."
"........................"
"{f:5:Beatrice}\'s game board spans the two days from October 4th to the 5th, 1986.
 In other words, this means that you are a piece who can move freely outside her game board.
 ......And even {f:5:Beatrice} cannot influence this future that lies outside the game board."
"......When you put it like that, it sounds like I\'m a pretty overpowered piece."
"The future of twelve years later in which you are placed certainly is distant.
 However, the further in the future a piece is placed, the stronger the power it holds.
 ......I told you, didn\'t I?
 Truth changes form when it\'s observed."
"Come to think of it, I\'ve heard something related to that.
 ......Even if one day, all of a sudden, a star in Centaurus were to explode,
 the light from that explosion would have to travel 4.4 light years, so it would take four and a half years to reach the Earth."
"It would.
 In other words, even if the sun in Centaurus has already died, people on Earth wouldn\'t be able to perceive that fact for four and a half years.
 ......Because no method of perception exists that is faster than the speed of light."
At the time we learn that the sun in Centaurus exploded...
...we Earth people will paint over our past four and a half years of history with a new truth.
{n}We will revise history with a new fact: that it exploded four and a half years ago.
However, for the four‐and‐a‐half‐year period until we learn that, despite the fact that it has already died,
 the mistaken truth that the sun of Centaurus still exists will be able to exist as truth.
The truth of the future wins out over the truth of the past.
".........That\'s right.
 By itself, the Rokkenjima accident...
would have given rise to nothing but suspicion of a murder plot revolving around Aunt Eva and the Ushiromiya estate."
"......But in the years that followed...
it was dramatized through the occult, and the plot was painted over as the Legend of the Witch."
Even though it was clamored over as a murder plot at the time of the incident,
 in later years, strange occult theories which claimed that it had been the work of a witch ran rampant, and began to paint over the truth of October 5th, 1986...
The murder theory will probably be forgotten over time.
......And only the more bizarre, impressive witch theory will continue to remain as superstition, and eventually, paint over the murder theory entirely.
"Yes,
 the false truth that exists before the light from an exploding star reaches Earth is a lot like the human murder theory."
".........The wine bottle with a letter inside that drifted ashore several years later, the "message bottle", began to retroactively paint over that theory with the occult witch theory."
"......That\'s right.
 No witch existed during 1986.
 The witch took control of Rokkenjima because she was "observed" several years later by us humans of the future, thanks to that message bottle...!"
"......A small revision is necessary.
 The witch could have existed even during 1986.
 As one of many endless possibilities."
"Certainly.
 Curled up in the cat box, which would disappear if observed.
 ......That\'s why the message bottle is so pernicious."
"...The witch tried to get out of the box.
 She made it so that she would be observed, weeding out all possibilities other than the witch theory.
 ......In other words, to make it impossible for herself to be negated, she negated all possibilities other than the witch theory."
".........Well, I\'ll be damned.
 So in other words, {f:5:Beatrice} satisfied the Devil\'s Proof with a frontal attack.
 And that was part of the witch\'s plan from the beginning."
"The message bottle is information observed in the future after 1986.
 .........It cannot be observed by {f:5:Beatrice} or Battler.
 ...It can only be observed by {f:5:Ange Beatrice}."
"......In truth, I didn\'t want to investigate the message bottle.
 ...After all, reading it would be like listening to the witch\'s side of the story.
 Since I\'ve been ignoring all that mad raving about a witch theory, I thought of it as nothing more than a waste of time."
"......But Okonogi‐san told me.
 You can\'t see things in three dimensions with only one eye."
"You mean that at the same time as looking at it from the viewpoint of denying witches, you must also look at it from the viewpoint of accepting witches?
 ......That is the correct way to think.
 The number of viewpoints is like a denominator.
 If the number of viewpoints is 1, the mystery in the numerator doesn\'t decrease in the slightest.
 However, the more your number of viewpoints increases, the more the mystery begins to be divided."
"I know that.
 ......The message bottle that washed up on a neighboring island several years after the crime.
 It passed into the hands of a dilettante.
 I\'ve made an appointment, just in case."
...I was able to hear Aunt Eva\'s side from Okonogi‐san.
Next...would be the witch.
 Why not, I\'ll listen.
{n}To what {f:5:Beatrice} has to say...!"Three months left to live.
 It was last year when you said that, Doctor Nanjo..."
"......I, I only spoke of what I had determined from his overall physical condition at the time.
 As a result, it has just worked out that this year, he has—"
"Despite the doubt being cast on whether Father can make it to the end of the year, the fact is that even now, he\'s still enthusiastically immersed in his occult research.
 And still you would say he has only three months left, Doctor?"
"A‐as I\'ve been saying, Kinzo‐san\'s—"
"Is it not a wonderful thing that our respected father still has his vitality?
 Out of parental respect, all of you desire to greet Father so badly that you scarcely know what to do with yourselves.
 So you cannot accept the fact that he will not see you."
"...Given that you have all begun to prematurely divide up the inheritance while the sun is still in the sky,
 I completely understand why it is that Father does not wish to see you."
"Y‐you\'ve got it wrong, Natsuhi nee‐san.
 ......We just, umm—"
"Not even Dad is immortal—he\'s gonna die {i:someday}.
 We aren\'t telling him to die. We\'re just saying that he will die {i:someday}.
 We\'re just talking together about how to prepare for that."
"And that is precisely what is so disrespectful!!"
"Stop it.
 You\'ll make your headache worse."
Krauss told Natsuhi, who had risen from her chair in agitation, to sit down.
Trying to smooth over the atmosphere, which had suddenly started crackling with hostility,
 Hideyoshi put on a cordial smile and motioned for everyone to calm down.
"......Natsuhi‐san, don\'t get us all wrong.
 Doesn\'t this country have a proverb, "a departing bird leaves the nest unsoiled"?
 So we\'re just talkin\' about seein\' that bird off.
 We\'re discussin\' this so we can see Father off cleanly when he eventually leaves on that inevitable journey."
"Hahaha...
 That\'s just like you, Hideyoshi‐san.
 Even though you\'re saying the same thing, you make it sound so intellectual."
"Yes, that\'s right.
 Unlike you, Nii‐san."
"Stop it.
 That won\'t get us anywhere.
 .........So like we\'re saying, Aniki.
 We can just forget all of this about the inheritance.
 It doesn\'t even matter if Dad hits us."
"To make a long story short, all we want is to meet Dad directly and say hello.
 Even if Dad says he doesn\'t want to.
 If he\'s locked up in his study, we\'ll borrow a key from Genji‐san if we have to.
 Right, Rosa?"
"...Oh, ...well, umm...it\'s not like we\'re forcing you...
 ......It\'s just...we haven\'t said hello to Father in such a long time."
"If his remaining life really is short, then there\'s even a chance we might never be able to see him again...
 ......Today might be our final opportunity to exchange words with Father..."
"Yes, just like Rosa says.
 You do realize that if he only has three months left, it wouldn\'t be odd for him to pass away any time now?"
"And you\'re telling us we don\'t even have the right to talk with him one last time?
 ......I think that is a bit much, don\'t you...?"
"......If the conversation you all intended to have with Father really was a greeting, I am sure he would see you gladly."
"But Father has already heard exactly what kind of disrespectful topic you have lowered yourselves to!
 Father would not be the only one who would prefer not to see you under such conditions.
 If you wish to blame anyone for Father not seeing you, you need look no further than yourselves, wouldn\'t you say?"
"Heheheh.
 Exactly.
 I should think you would be able to understand why Father doesn\'t wish to see your faces without racking your brains over it.
 Father has seen through all of your stringent financial situations."
".........What are you talking about?
 ...I don\'t have a clue what you\'re going on about, Nii‐san."
"Heheheheh!
 Do you think I don\'t know about all of your circumstances...?"
Eva and the rest realized that he had seen through to the dire straits they were in,
 and they entered into a back‐and‐forth argument, at first putting on a bold front and denying it,
 and then ultimately returning to the original point, and objecting by repeatedly demanding to be allowed to see Kinzo.
...The sweet smell of the black tea Rosa had gone out of her way to buy had been completely wasted.
The only good thing she could take away from this was that the children weren\'t here to see it.
......The fact that they had gone to play at the beach right after lunch was the sole redeeming aspect.
Eva was attempting to get violent with Krauss, and Hideyoshi and Kyrie had cut in between them, trying to calm both sides.
......Then, Kyrie sighed deeply and spoke.
"............I\'m sorry, Krauss nii‐san.
 I know I\'m an outsider, but I wonder if you would let me speak for a moment.
 I have a proposition."
"What is it, Kyrie‐san?"
"......First, and this includes my husband as well,
 for many years, we have made light of the efforts you have made by living with Father and taking care of him.
 ...Don\'t you think so?"
".........Well, I guess so.
 ...We\'ve got it easy since we get to go out into the world, but Aniki\'s been babysitting Father for decades now, and sure, that must have taken a lot of effort.
 ......I\'ll accept that, but what\'s your point, Kyrie?"
"We must acknowledge that Krauss nii‐san is Father\'s caregiver.
 ......Isn\'t that true?
 We have always feared Father, and have been pushing the task of taking care of him onto Krauss nii‐san.
 I believe everyone here would acknowledge his efforts."
"Wouldn\'t you?
 Eva nee‐san?"
".....................
 ......And so what?
 Nii‐san is Father\'s caregiver?
 Who is an outsider like you to decide things?!"
"O‐...OK, calm, calm.
 ......Kyrie‐san, what are you talking about?"
".................................
 ......Kyrie, please continue."
"We should be more grateful towards Krauss nii‐san and Natsuhi nee‐san.
 ......We should say thank you for always taking care of Father."
"It\'s because we have no feelings of gratitude that we have these unproductive clashes.
 ......Isn\'t that right, Krauss nii‐san?"
"Hoh.........now this is a surprise.
 I did not think you would be able to understand our efforts,
 which even my true siblings have not stopped to consider."
"......It is a natural duty for the successor to the Ushiromiya family head."
"Yes.
 It {i:is} a responsibility of the successor to the head, isn\'t it?
 ......And it\'s precisely because you take care of Father that we must acknowledge you as the successor."
"Excuse me!!
 Am I going to be consulted on this at any point?!!
 You outsider, what gives you the—"
"Wait, Aneki!!
 .........She\'s right.
 It\'s just like Kyrie says.
 You are the successor, Aniki, because you\'re taking care of Dad.
 It\'s just like you said."
"..................ah—"
"...............nn—"
Rosa noticed, and then Eva too.
Eva\'s barking demeanor towards Kyrie for advancing the discussion on her own disappeared in a flash,
 and she instead stared at Krauss and Natsuhi.
......Natsuhi couldn\'t understand that sudden change, and was slightly flustered.
"Krauss nii‐san.
 ......If you would accept just a few conditions,
 we won\'t ask you to let us meet Father again until he dies."
"Of course, we won\'t tell you to let us see him at the moment of death, either.
 ......We could even be absent at the funeral."
"......Oh?
 .........I haven\'t a clue what this is about.
 But very well, I will humor you.
 Tell me the conditions."
"First.
 ......The term successor to the head refers to the caregiver of the current head, Ushiromiya Kinzo."
".........Mhmm.
 Go on?"
"Second.
 The duty of the caregiver is to look after Ushiromiya Kinzo for the rest of his life.
 ......To make things simple, the caregiver\'s job is to care for him until his final moments.
 You were prepared to do that from the beginning, Krauss nii‐san, so there are no problems."
"Naturally.
 I have no objections whatsoever to either of those conditions.
 I am already carrying them out."
"Third.
 In the remote chance that the caregiver is neglectful in his responsibilities of supervision, he will be stripped of his rights as a caregiver."
With that sentence, all slack disappeared from Krauss\'s face.
{n}...Natsuhi alone was still having trouble understanding what it meant.
"......Hoh.
 And these "responsibilities of supervision" that the caregiver bears,
 ......just what exactly are they?"
"It means supervising so that Father can live in good health until the end of his natural lifespan.
 ......I\'ll go into more detail.
 In the case that Father dies anything other than a natural death, the caregiver will be stripped of his rights as a caregiver, and will lose his rights as successor to the head.
 In that situation, the next highest ranked, Eva nee‐san, is to be selected as the successor."
".........What...did you say......
 H‐how dare you speak such nonsense!!"
"Hohoh.
 My, my, a caregiver\'s responsibility is grave indeed..."
"However, people can die in many ways.
 For example, the old and infirm sometimes die by getting food caught in their throats.
 I have no doubt that this would ordinarily fall under the broad definition of death by old age."
"But with your argument, that would become a "death by accident", and I would be made to bear the responsibility as supervisor.
 ......This is unjustly disadvantageous to me."
"I don\'t have the slightest intention of splitting hairs in such a way.
 The kinds of things that I\'m imagining are just things the caregiver could have prevented beforehand by taking good care of Father and keeping their eyes on him."
"It may be the caregiver\'s job to carry food to Father\'s mouth, but whether he swallows it down or not is clearly outside the caregiver\'s responsibility.
 I have absolutely no problems with the case you raise, Krauss nii‐san."
".........Hoh.
 Then what kind of case {i:do} you imagine would cause the caregiver to be blamed for making a blunder?"
"For example,
 ......if he disappeared."
".....................
 ...............Hoh?"
"Father seems to be of sound mind right now,
 but he could lose the ability for rational thought and decision‐making at any moment, and it would come as no surprise."
"......He could wander around when you aren\'t looking and get into some kind of accident,
 ......or he could get lost in the forest and go missing, never to be found again."
"......Isn\'t this type of case clearly the responsibility of the caregiver...?"
"Father\'s mind is perfectly healthy!
 Of all things, what an outrageous...!"
"You might say that one day, suddenly, you saw Father go into the forest.
 You chased after him, but you couldn\'t find him.
 Despite calling the police and searching, seven years pass, unable to find him, and after that time a court declares him legally dead.
 I am trying to say that we won\'t accept that kind of series of events."
"......................................."
"When Father passes away, an autopsy must be carried out,
 and it must be verified that he died of old age in the most general meaning, within the bounds of common sense.
 ......A death for any other reason will be held as the caregiver\'s responsibility."
".........See?
 They\'re nothing more or less than the things you have already been toiling at up to today.
 They aren\'t strange conditions or anything of the sort, right...?"
"Y‐you are mocking us, insulting us!!
 I find it difficult to imagine why my husband must be coerced into a rule that disgraces him in this way!!"
".........Actually, I\'ve been suspecting it since last year.
 No, everyone here probably suspects it.
 Eva nee‐san, Hideyoshi nii‐san.
 Rudolf‐san, and Rosa‐san too.
 Everyone has suspected it the whole time, but it was so dreadful to imagine that no one actually said it."
"Heh.
 ......Heheheheh, hahahahaha...!!
 I see, so {i:this} is what you\'re trying to say?
 ......That Father is already dead, and that I have been hiding it!"
"......Yeah, that\'s right.
 This is one of the theories I thought of as the key to solving the final mystery in the previous game."
".........You mean the last one in the previous game,
 the mystery of who killed Doctor Nanjo?"
"Yeah.
 ......The witch definitely did say a lot in red.
 ...She mentioned the names of all 18 people and announced whether they were alive or dead, and stated definitively that there are no more humans than that.
 ......But with this theory, I can weave my way through that gap...!"
".....................
 ......I see.
 So this is one of the answers that don\'t cause those two to contradict.
 .........I see."
"You understand what I\'m getting at?
 ...You catch on pretty quick, don\'t you.
 It\'s nice that I don\'t have to explain."
"No 19th person exists on this island.
 But this gimmick lets us mix in an unknown new person X despite that.
 ......Basically, "the names of all 18 people" just have to not match "the 18 people on the island"."
"Exactly...!
 In red, the witch mentioned the names of 18 people one after another, and announced whether they were alive or dead.
 And on top of that, she declared that the number of humans on the island doesn\'t exceed 18.
 ......There was a single illusion in there."
It was never guaranteed that {i:the 18 names = the 18 people on the island}.
"When she named off all 18 people and announced who was alive and who was dead,
 she kept the name of the culprit X hidden, and instead mixed in someone who isn\'t on this island...!"
"By doing that, even though the culprit is on the island, she was able to leave him or her out of the list of the 18 alive or dead people!
 The person who was mixed in isn\'t on the island, so he doesn\'t count towards the total number of people on the island."
"Therefore, even though the culprit counts towards the total of 18 people on the island, it was possible for his or her name to not be listed!
 The two statements in red are completely independent, so this theory has no contradictions......!"
"The name which is used to hide the name of the culprit has several conditions to fulfill.
 ......First of all, it has to be someone who isn\'t on the island, and yet whom we believe to be on the island.
 ......Otherwise, she wouldn\'t be able to trick us."
"And it would be preferable for that person to be dead.
 ......After all, no alibi exists that is more perfect than death.
 Because the mystery at that point was based on the crime being impossible for all 18 people.
 ............Something like that?"
"Yeah, that\'s it...!
 And that person...
......was Grandfather.
 ......What Kyrie‐san is trying to say right now is just one simple thing."
"......We\'re being told that Grandfather is locked up in his study, saying that he doesn\'t want to meet anyone,
 ......but there is the possibility that he\'s actually already dead,
 and that Uncle Krauss is lying when he claims that he\'s alive...!"
That\'s right.
 Grandfather has been closed up in his room this whole time, and no one\'s seen his face!
Maybe he\'s already dead,
 and Uncle Krauss and the rest are conspiring together to trick everyone into believing he\'s alive...!!
"............If Kinzo dies, the distribution of the inheritance occurs.
 ...However, if Kinzo doesn\'t die,
 ......no,
 if he dies, but {i:it isn\'t announced}, the distribution of the inheritance doesn\'t occur."
"In other words, Uncle Krauss could have all of Grandfather\'s wealth to himself...!
 That\'s right, he\'s got plenty of motive!"
Sure, maybe a 19th person X really doesn\'t exist on this island.
But the person X did exist.
{n}......And that person was the 18th person!
"In other words, there were originally 17 people on this island, not 18.
 Then an unknown person X snuck in and committed the crime."
"......How\'s that, Beato?!
 Get your ass out here, I\'ve just solved the final, biggest mystery from the last game!!"
As Battler declared that forcefully, the crisp sound of clapping came out of nowhere, and their surroundings turned bright,
 becoming the usual witch\'s tea room.
"*cackle*, hahahahahahaha...!
 <Bravo, bravo>.
 I cannot deny the sense of it being long overdue, but in any event, despite your incompetence, you have managed to produce a single answer."
"Cessation of thought is possible even for a lump of concrete!
 So you have now finally evolved into a being with intelligence."
"......You could say that you\'ve finally taken a step forward from the crying creature that you were before, just licking my shoes and grinding your teeth.
 *cackle*cackle*!"
"......I can\'t believe I let this stupid wordplay make a fool of me in the last game.
 My lameness pisses even me off!"
"Alright, Beato, time for a repetition request!!
 Declare that Grandfather\'s included in the 18 people on the island, if you caaaaaan!!"
"Yeah, never in a million years.
 Because he\'s already dead.
 This is the end of your deceptiooooooooooon!!"
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*, ahhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!!
 Well now, what to do here.
 .........Shall I slice that in twain with the red truth?"
"No, no, it might also be good to hold back for now and let you get all excited.
 If I\'m going to push you off a cliff anyway, it would be much more interesting to lure you to a higher place first.
 *cackle*!"
As Beato sneered obnoxiously, it even looked to me as if she was still searching for the perfect expression to tick me off even more.
As though she was saying that the answer I had finally reached was entirely too ridiculous.
In contrast to my visible annoyance with the witch\'s attitude, Gretel had a blank and composed expression on her face.
...Almost as though she had expected the witch would act that way.
"........................
 I see.
 ...So just like Battler learns and grows, so does the witch."
"What\'s wrong, Beato!
 Quit stalling!!
 Can you repeat it or not?!
 Answer!!"
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*..."
"......Stop it, Battler.
 The witch won\'t answer so easily.
 ......As long as she doesn\'t think it will benefit her."
"What?!
 What do you mean......?"
"Because you\'ve been at the mercy of this "red truth" in the games so far, the witch has used it over and over again."
"But now, the situation is different.
 You are luring the red truth out, and are instead using it as your weapon.
 In a situation like that, there\'s no way the witch will keep firing off the red without reason.
 .........Right?"
"Gretel, or whoever you are.
 ...It seems that you are quite sharp, unlike Battler.
 I have welcomed in a fearsome enemy."
"That is correct!
 When Battler is expecting me to use the red truth, why do I have a responsibility to answer to his expectations?!"
"I have no such thing!
 I don\'t even have a crumb from that croissant you ate this morning\'s worth of responsibility to please yooooou!!"
"Y‐you bitch.........!!"
"Yes, yes, oh yes, that\'s the faaaaace!
 I started playing with the red truth just because I wanted to see that face!
 If I cannot witness that expression of yours, then I have no reason whatsoever to play around...!"
"......Heheh.
 You\'re just being a sore loser, aren\'t you?
 If you think you can just say a bunch of crap to trick me because you can\'t respond to my repetition request, it\'s not gonna work!!"
"Don\'t be so full of yourself!!
 An answer like that, I could cut into pieces with no trouble at all!!
 But I will deliberately refuse to speak in red.
 I will refuse to speak because that is what you want.
 Do you understand why?"
"............You just said it.
 You want to push him off at the sweetest spot.
 This ill‐natured witch is saying that she won\'t use the red anywhere you ask for it any more."
"In other words, she won\'t play along with your game of repetition requests any more."
"*cackle*cackle*!
 Exactly, exactly!
 Unlike Battler, everything goes quickly with this woman, there\'s never a need to explain!
 I will speak as I like with the red truth, at the time that I desire!"
"Yes.
 The use of the red truth is basically a {i:right} the witch has, to exercise as she pleases.
 It\'s not a responsibility that she has to fulfill at whatever time the human side desires.
 ...............But that depends on the details."
"......The details......?
 What do you mean...?"
"The witch has no responsibility to respond to your repetition requests.
 But when and only when your claim would destroy the witch theory, it {i:does} become her responsibility.
 Because in this court without a judge, that which is not refuted becomes the "truth"."
"......In just the same way that whenever you\'ve stopped thinking,
 and been unable to make a counterargument against the witch theory asserted by the witch, it has immediately become truth."
"Then, ...since she doesn\'t have a counterargument to my reasoning, that means it\'s right?!
 I\'m correct in my deduction that the culprit is the mysterious 18th person X, and Grandfather is already dead?!"
"......At least, until the witch argues back.
 Truth loses to new truths farther in the future.
 ......The tricky part is that even the timing of the counterargument is up to the witch."
"...In other words, maybe your reasoning just now is correct,
 or maybe the witch is holding off on arguing back even though you\'re mistaken."
"......Or else, the witch may be ignoring it because it doesn\'t shake the basis of the witch theory in the first place.
 The point is, we can\'t tell the difference at the current time.
 .........Is that more or less it?"
"*cackle*cackle*, *cackle*cackle*cackle*!
 Damn you, Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}, for throwing in such a troublesome piece.
 Thanks to that, I\'m losing all my lines!"
"The witch has learned to respond to your repetition requests at a separate time.
 ......Maybe you could also call it a "delay"."
"......G‐goddamn her......
 ...So even if I offer some mistaken reasoning, there\'s a possibility that Beato will intentionally let me flounder about without disproving it,
 and at the very end, after I\'ve built it up even more into some grand expansive theory, she can chop it off at the base,
 and turn everything over......?!"
A single piece of reasoning becomes a bridge to the next piece.
{n}Through my repetition requests, I\'ve been able to strengthen my position and advance bit by bit.
But thanks to that damned Beato learning this strange delay tactic,
 ......I can no longer confirm or deny my reasoning.
It\'s like I finally got myself a cane to help me search around in the pitch‐black darkness, and now I\'ve had it taken away from me.
 ......Now I\'m just...stuck, aren\'t I......?!!
"Now, now, Battler, if you make a despairing face like that, I won\'t be able to stop drooling, you knowwww{p:0:♪}
 From the beginning, that cane was nothing more than something I gave you because you were so ineffectual."
"This just means that you can finally challenge me without a handicap, right?
 Kuhhi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi!"
"......But that doesn\'t change the fact that repetition requests are one of Battler\'s methods for fighting back.
 As I already said, as long as it\'s something fatal that would destroy the witch theory,
 the witch is obligated to argue back, and therefore, to speak with the red truth."
"......While the timing of that counterargument is up to the witch, it must be performed eventually.
 .........Right?"
"Hmm, that would seem to follow.
 If I cannot deny the "tricks done by humans" theory Battler lays out by the time the game ends,
 Battler will use that as a reason to deny me, and it will be possible for him to proclaim his victory."
".........So, then, the "trick theory" laid out by the human side,
 in other words, his repetition requests, must be countered during the game, i.e., during the episode—we can view this as a restriction on the witch side to that effect?"
"That is so.
 ......Battler\'s goal is to show that he can explain with humans the entire pleasant game I have laid out on this island and deny me.
 If Battler succeeds in that, at that time, Battler shall become the victor of this game."
"Let me confirm the rules.
 ......Am I OK to interpret "the time the game ends" as referring to 24:00 on October 5th, 1986, going by the time of the Rokkenjima in the game?"
"There are no problems with that."
"If, at the time the game ends, the human side can assert a trick theory for all of the mysteries,
 {i:and} there is no counterargument from the witch side, then the human side can declare victory.
 ......Any problems?"
".........Let us be a little more rigorous.
 At the time the game ends, the witch side shall be given the opportunity to argue back."
"I\'ll set a time limit on that.
 One minute.
 If the counterargument is not carried out within one minute, victory will be declared."
"Then allow me to impose the same rule on you.
 At the time the game ends, the human side will be given one minute to counter the mysteries it has been given.
 If there is even a single mystery that has not been countered within that time, it becomes a victory for the witch side, and that game is over."
"......It would spoil things terribly to have the game stopped for lengthy consideration, you see."
"............Goddamn you both.
 Moving things along without me...
 But I more or less get what\'s going on.
 So even if my repetition requests aren\'t countered instantly, they must be countered eventually."
"Yes, that\'s right.
 ......And that must happen before 00:01 on October 6th."
"......But be careful.
 The witch only has to cut up a single one of your repetition requests.
 You can\'t declare victory unless you can solve all of the mysteries."
"Just as I can use the red,
 Battler, from now on, I will permit you to use the blue."
"When explaining my magical murders with human tricks, you can make declarations in blue.
 I will be under obligation to counter your blue with the red by the end of the game."
"Blue......
 ......So basically, I\'ll speak my repetition requests in blue...?"
"Not exactly.
 It was possible to use repetition requests for anything, no matter how trivial.
 But the blue is a little more restrictive.
 It is only valid if it denies witches on its own."
"..........................."
It\'s starting to get confusing, ...but it\'s more or less something like this.
Let\'s take one of the repetition requests I made during a past mystery as an example.
{n}"The number of master keys is five".
It had been claimed that there were only five master keys, so I made this request to confirm that the number really was five.
But since that by itself doesn\'t deny the witch, I can\'t say it in blue.
 So, in order to speak in blue, I would need to say something like this.
{i:"The actual number of master keys was greater than five.
 The culprit used one of those extra keys to get in and out of the room!"}
......And only then would the witch, who claims that it was a locked‐room murder with magic, be responsible for making a counterargument.
 In other words, I can\'t use it to demand that she repeats things in order to check the premises of my reasoning.
.........That will probably put me at a significant disadvantage.
Crap...
 It\'s enough to make me think that all those red declarations that Beato\'s been making to toy with me were extremely merciful......
"...Damn it.
 That means, even if I create a theory for a particular locked room and speak it in blue,
 if Beato denies it at the very, very end, I won\'t even have time to create my next theory...!
 This rule is awful... It\'s all disadvantage for me and me alone..."
".........Are you going to surrender before the fight begins again?
 Calm down.
 No one\'s said that you can only use the blue once for each mystery.
 Do you understand what that means?"
"N‐no.
 ......What does it mean...?"
"In the pitiful way you\'ve been fighting up until now, you\'ve made a single theory, gauged the witch\'s reaction,
 and if that one didn\'t work, you\'d then start making another theory.
 You won\'t corner a witch like that."
"Then how am I meant to fight......
 .........You don\'t mean—"
"Yes, that\'s right.
 ......You don\'t challenge the mysteries with an individual point.
 {i:You assault them with a wall}.
 You said yourself in an earlier game that that\'s what the attitude behind reasoning should be like."
Assault...with a wall.
 That\'s right, I said so myself before.
The act of trying to uncover the mystery by reasoning is like trying to shoot a distant target with an arrow.
Until now, I\'ve been shooting off a single flimsy arrow every time,
 asking the witch if I scored a hit,
 and then, once told that I missed, preparing my bow again, and shooting off another flimsy arrow.
There\'s no way I\'ll hit at that rate...
{n}Bullets might be a better example than arrows.
If you take one shot after another at a distant target with a handgun, you probably won\'t hit it easily.
......So how can you hit it?
If a handgun doesn\'t work,
 ......use a shotgun!
 Instead of a single bullet, blast her with "shot" filled with countless projectiles at once...!
Shot scatters, so it impacts a wide area.
 So it\'s very well suited for shooting small, fast targets like birds.
That\'s right, there\'s no rule that says reasoning has to be like a pistol, shooting one shot off at a time.
......Making a single theory and just hoping that it hits is like stopping your own thinking.
Blast away with a massive number of bullets, of pieces of reasoning, and make them impact like a wall, so you only need just one of them to find its mark.
"............Blue, huh...
 ......I get it.
 If your red truth is a razor‐sharp katana, then it looks like my blue is a shotgun.
 No, ......a machine‐gun with firepower enough to honeycomb witches."
"He that is always shooting must something something.
 *cackle*cackle*!
 That sort of crude analogy is just like you."
"The climax of a detective novel is always the same.
 ......The great and famous detective gathers all the suspects in one place, and unveils a single trail of logic which is proven correct in spectacular fashion."
"Almost like William Tell expertly shooting through an apple with a single arrow.
 That\'s why I mistakenly thought of it like a virtue."
......Sure, that probably would be magnificent.
{n}If I could shoot through the truth with a single guess.
But that isn\'t realistic.
Just look at real wars.
 Do I really think everyone pulls long guns out of the trench, aims reeeeeally well, and takes a single shot at a time at the other side?
They don\'t, right?!
 They fire rapidly, they fire all over the place, they pin down the enemy with a barrage!
Reasoning was the same way.
Because of that weird virtue, I had been stuck thinking that I could only take one line of reasoning at a time.
We humans can fire off countless guesses and possibilities!
Imagination is ammunition.
 Suspension of thought is a clogged barrel...!
{n}The pathetic way I\'ve been reasoning up until now is like a peashooter.
Incredibly awkward, like I\'ve been weakly firing off a shot, getting it denied in red, and then receiving the next bullet and reloading.
My "blue truth" that claims that human tricks are the truth...
...will overwhelm its target, the fantasy told by the witch, with all the firepower of my imagination...!
This is my...
Ushiromiya Battler‐style way of fighting...!
".........Thanks to you, I\'ve figured out the real way to fight.
 Thanks, Gretel!!"
"You\'re welcome."
"It\'s enough to make me think how pathetic I was before.
 ......Yeah, it\'s like Beato said.
 I\'ve had the benefit of a handicap up until now.
 I\'ll acknowledge that...!!
 New rule, understood!!
 I have my own way to fight!
 And I\'ll show it to you!!"
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!
 Excellent spirit, I like it!
 Then try using it right away, this blue truth of yours...!!"
"......I\'ll use it, all right.
 With this blue truth, I can break apart your witch theory, which states that only a witch culprit was possible because everyone had alibis!!"
"This is my truth!
 {p:2:Ushiromiya Kinzo is already dead}.
 {p:2:Therefore, the true number of people on the island is 17}!
 {p:2:By adding an unknown person X to that, it becomes 18 people}.
 {p:2:By supposing that this person X exists, the crime is possible even if all 17 people have alibis}!!"
"......In short, if you keep preventing us from meeting with Father, we will have to form the following theory.
 Simply: Father is already dead.
 But you are hiding that because you don\'t want the inheritance to be distributed. See?"
"....................................
 ...Ridiculous."
"Th‐that is correct, this is worse than ridiculous!!
 I have never been so insulted!!"
"It\'s even possible for us to force you to allow us to check whether he\'s alive or dead in the presence of the police.
 Isn\'t it, Eva nee‐san...?"
"......Y‐......yes...
 That\'s right, Nii‐san.
 We could come up with any number of excuses for it.
 We could easily set it up so that you have to arrange a meeting with Father under the supervision of a third party...!"
"Still.
 I think that would be very shameful for the Ushiromiya family."
"That\'s why I\'m making this proposal.
 The responsibilities and duties of the caregiver.
 A penalty in the worst‐case scenario.
 If you consent to that, we will be able to refrain from doing something like dragging Father outside."
"...Yeah, that\'s right, Aniki...
 Didn\'t you just say it...?
 You are carrying out your natural duties as Father\'s caregiver.
 Kyrie\'s conditions shouldn\'t be anything to worry about, right?
 Why the overreaction?"
"......Are you really that worried about having your position of successor dragged out from under you if Dad dies something other than a natural death?"
"Or whaaaat?
 Do you have an idea of some way Father could die other than a natural death...?"
"Of course I don\'t.
 ......I see, now I too understand how Father feels.
 What pitiful final years, unable to even die as he pleases."
"Yes, truly pitiful final years.
 ......And what we suspect is that those "final years" are already in the past."
"......You could completely clear this suspicion just by letting us meet with Father.
 ...So even after all this humiliation, you still won\'t allow us to meet with him, Krauss nii‐san.........?"
"................................."
"Father is probably already dead.
 You disposed of the body in absolute secrecy, most likely.
 ......And after taking all of the wealth for yourself as Father\'s agent,
 you will make it so that he "disappeared" and spend seven years making Father a corpseless member of the deceased."
"............I\'m sorry, please don\'t take it badly, alright?
 I\'m just playing detective here."
"H‐......how rude can one be!!
 You have no right to stay in this mansion!!
 Leave immediately!!
 I will never again permit you to cross the threshold of this house!!"
"It worked last year, but you\'ve used up your luck if you thought it would work this year too.
 ......Father is in a bad mood, so he can\'t meet with us?
 That was plenty suspicious last year, and yet you do it again this year."
"If you wanted to fake being Father\'s agent and grab up all his assets, you should have done it a little more speedily,
 and made him disappear without waiting for today\'s family conference.
 You really are naive, Krauss onii‐sama......"
"............I have no idea what you are—"
"However!
 ......If it is a fact that Father is in a bad mood,
 and you are preventing us from meeting him as part of your responsibilities as his caregiver, that is a very virtuous thing to do.
 In that case, if you just accept the conditions I\'ve provided, everything will be settled here and now."
".........After all, you care so greatly for Father, Krauss nii‐san.
 There\'s no way that Father will die in a manner that leads to trouble during the autopsy."
"Father hates hospitals in any case, so he\'ll pass away in his study, right?
 An autopsy will certainly be carried out in any event.
 ......The only way to {i:kill him without an autopsy} would be for him to disappear."
".........Kyrie‐san. I wonder if you would mind not bullying Nii‐san so much...?"
Eva rebuked Kyrie in an sickeningly kind voice.
...Considering the situation, that was impossible.
{n}Which is why it was so sickening...
"Nii‐san must have all kinds of situations of his own to deal with, as well as his pride.
 Even though it may be an obvious duty to Nii‐san,
 if we put it down on paper and even assign penalties,
 ...that\'s bound to be unpleasant for him.
 Don\'t you agree, Rosa......?"
"......Yes, that\'s right.
 .........We might have made light of Krauss nii‐san\'s pride as the eldest son too much.
 ......It might be a bit cruel to make him sign a memorandum regarding the duties of the caregiver as Kyrie‐san suggests."
"Yeah, I agree.
 You\'re doing a good job, Aniki.
 Taking that into account, all that stuff about signing strange papers and worst‐case penalties,
 it might be possible for us to consider skipping all that and just leaving everything to you."
"Y‐............you people............"
Not just Eva, but Rudolf and Rosa as well began closing in on Krauss, with unnerving smiles on their faces as though they had planned this beforehand.
They now understood perfectly how Kyrie had cornered Krauss, and exactly where she was prepared to compromise...
"......The memorandum regarding the responsibilities of the caregiver.
 You can make it so that you don\'t need to sign, and we will never demand a meeting with Father again.
 ......If you can guarantee that you are fit to be the caregiver even without the document, that is."
"Are you telling me.........to pay security money?
 Hehheheheh, hahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!
 This is ludicrous!
 Wahhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!"
"The security money, paid to Eva‐san, Rudolf‐san, and Rosa‐san, will be 3 billion yen each.
 As a deposit, you will transfer ten percent of that, 300 million yen each, before the year is out."
"9 billion?!
 I don\'t have that kind of money!!!"
"After Father passes away, you should be able to work it out.
 Our investigations have told us at least that much.
 And even the deposit of 900 million yen, you should be able to manage in your current financial situation."
"And it should even be possible for you to {i:borrow it from Father}, right?
 ...There\'s no need for this obvious charade."
"............H‐how unpleasant.
 Truly unpleasant...!!"
"I‐it is at that!!
 And it was disrespectful enough just with the discussion of Father\'s inheritance!
 Father is already dead?
 My husband is hiding that and keeping all the money to himself?!"
"I have had enough of this!!
 None of you are qualified to bear the name Ushiromiya any longer!!"
"Calm down, Natsuhi‐san...!
 And the rest of you, that\'s enough talk for now!
 Why don\'t we just leave it at that for the time bein\', huh...?!
 This is a big ol\' topic, and sudden, too.
 We might be gettin\' a little worked up ourselves!"
"Why don\'t we take a break for a while and cool our heads?
 Krauss nii‐san probably needs a little time himself.
 Right, Krauss‐san?"
"......Time...?
 And why would I need something like that?"
"OK, OK, OK!
 Look, deep down, none of us are actually thinkin\' anythin\' serious like that!
 It just seemed like you weren\'t goin\' to let us see Father no matter what, so we felt like makin\' a few bitter comments, that\'s all...!"
"And Krauss‐san, the things we said made you angry and you argued back on instinct, I know reeeeal well what that\'s like...!
 That\'s not how you really feel either, you\'re actually thinkin\' fine, I\'ll let you see him if you\'re goin\' to be that pig‐headed about it!"
"Right?
 Isn\'t that right?
 But after all we\'ve said, you just couldn\'t help gettin\' stubborn, and now you\'re havin\' trouble sayin\' it\'s alright to see him, that\'s all.
 Isn\'t that it?
 Right? Right?"
"......I‐...it certainly does seem that, like the rest of you, my husband has slightly lost his composure.
 ......We are firmly refusing only out of respect for Father\'s desire not to meet with you all."
".....................
 ......Hmm, that\'s right.
 It just started turning into another sibling fight like the old days, and I grew stubborn as well.
 .........Let us cool our heads."
"...I understand now how strongly you all desire to meet with Father.
 ...I will pass that on to him.
 .........I will find some way of convincing him so that he will see you.
 .........How is that?"
"......Right.
 I think it\'s alright to give Krauss nii‐san some time to persuade Father."
"Yeah.
 ......We\'re counting on you, Aniki.
 Please do a good job of persuading him so that he\'ll meet with us.
 After all, you\'re Dad\'s caregiver."
"About persuading him...let\'s set a limit on it to sometime tonight, alright?
 When tomorrow comes, we\'ll confirm Father\'s well‐being, even if we have to break down the door to his study.
 .........You have no problems with that, right?
 Nii‐san...?"
"......Do as you like.
 I see, it seems that I am not even given much time to persuade him.
 ......Come on, Natsuhi.
 We shall ask him to at least be with us for dinner."
"Y‐yes...!"
Krauss left the parlor accompanied by Natsuhi.
Once their footsteps disappeared,
 Hideyoshi breathed out heavily, and flopped onto a sofa, smirking...
"............Kyrie‐san.
 ...You are...a frightening person."
"Sorry for speaking out of turn.
 I apologize."
"......No, no, you cornered him in a different way from the original plan, but in the end, this was even better.
 ...Just like always, I have to bow my head to you..."
"But...can he really prepare 900 million yen......?
 We estimated that 750 million would be the most Krauss nii‐san could afford with his current financial situation...
 ......Isn\'t 900 million gouging him too much...?"
"It\'s alright if it\'s impossible for him.
 If we do something like lowering it to 750 million so Krauss nii‐san can save face, it will look like we\'re compromising and it\'ll be easier to settle, right?
 And if he really does come out with 900 million, that\'s even better."
"Nii‐san is probably having a strategy meeting with Natsuhi‐san about now.
 ......It will be truly interesting to see what kind of twisted logic our proud Nii‐san comes up with as an excuse."
"Convince Father......?
 There\'s no way he can."
There\'s no way to convince someone who doesn\'t even exist...!
"..................All my siblings have taken time out of their schedules to come here to this annual family conference."
Krauss and Natsuhi could be seen in Kinzo\'s dimly lit study.
Every once in a while, thunder could be heard, and the dimly lit room flickered with light.
 ......It seemed that the island would be closed off by the storm very soon.
"......Father...!
 Please, just this once, show those disrespectful people the majesty of the head...!"
"It\'s no good........."
The large figure standing by the window, his majestic back facing them,
 quietly yet forcefully...gave his answer.
His head was hung slightly, and he appeared to be trembling.
 ...Eventually, a mumbling laugh reached them from over his shoulder.
"Heh‐heh‐heh‐heh‐heh‐heh, hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah!!
 It\'s no good, it\'s no goddamn good at all...!!
 Wahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"
.........Three months left to live...?
 A senile old man not long for this world...?
{n}Just who are you referring to?
"Brain‐dead fooool!!
 Your siblings intimidated you, so you come crawling over here, is that it?
 You are a disgrace!!"
As Kinzo spun around and brandished his cloak, a blast of wind shook up the stale air inside the room.
That air pressure expressed clearly the majesty and willpower of Ushiromiya Kinzo.
It was no wonder at all that Krauss landed on his backside, as if that pressure had literally blown him to the ground.
As though showing consideration for Krauss, who looked as though his legs had been swept out from under him, Natsuhi also crouched down.
Then,
 ......with a thunk,
 ......and another thunk,
 Kinzo\'s footsteps approached with a heft that signified his majesty.
"F‐......Father........."
"Yoou fooooooooool......!!
 I heard it all from Kanon, just how pathetically your siblings made you dance like a puppet!!!!"
"F‐Father...!
 My husband is doing his best to protect your honor—"
Without lending an ear to Natsuhi\'s words, Kinzo extended his palm to Krauss\'s collar, as the latter sat on the floor.
...No, he curled up his fingers, leaving only his index finger out, and then, with that one remaining finger.........
he pressed hard into Krauss\'s collar,
 ......twisted it,
 ..................and slowly,
 with just one finger,
 ......he raised Krauss high into the air.
"...Truly, what a pathetic creature you aaaare.
 ......You even need your wife to speak in your defense?
 If you have an excuse, man up and show me you can give it yourself!!"
"Ggggg, .....................gahahhk......!!"
Krauss\'s feet scrabbled at the air.
Kinzo\'s brawny finger was choking him.
{n}He couldn\'t even open his mouth, much less talk.
However, even if he had been allowed to open his mouth,
 as he was now, there was no way he would be able to think up an excuse that Kinzo would accept...
Still, ......what incredible power he possessed...
{n}No one would call Kinzo an old man after seeing this superhuman strength...
"......Father...!!
 My husband, he has his own way of fighting...!!
 I beg you to forgive him...!!"
"............Natsuhii.
 ......Fighting is the process you undergo before you achieve victory.
 ......You cannot call it fighting if it ends in a loss."
"Just one word, we call that humiliation!!
 Wahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha, and {i:this} is my successor?
 Wahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha, wahhah{0}hahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hah{0}haaaaaaah!!"
As thunder roared, Kinzo laughed heartily as though there could be nothing more amusing.
And at the end of his laugh, he threw his feckless son away like he was scrap paper,
 slamming him against the wall...
"Ghaghh, ......uuuuuuuuunnghh......"
"My love, my love...!! Just breathe......"
Krauss slid down the wall, rubbing his throat in pain...
{n}Natsuhi ran up to him and cared for him...
But Kinzo showed no interest in the two of them,
 and he returned to the space near the window, as though he had been there the whole time, and looked up at the ominous thunderclouds.
"............I thought that as long as I could meet {f:5:Beatrice}, I would have no regrets in my life,
 but it seems that things won\'t go so smoothly."
"......It was promised from the beginning that nothing received from the witch would remain.
 However, the Ushiromiya name is not the property of the witch."
"......Who is fit to succeed that name?
 It seems that this alone must be resolved by my own hand.
 ......Rejoice, Krauss!!
 I have changed my mind."
".........F‐Father...
 .........Then you\'ll......?"
"I have no desire to have dinner with you cowards.
 However, I will attend the family conference afterwards!"
"F‐Father...
 Thank you very much......!"
"There, I shall make an important announcement regarding the succession of the headship.
 I will resolve your foolish quarrel myself!!
 Uuhhahahahahahaha, waaahah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah!!!"The door was forcefully flung open, and Rosa flew in with Maria.
"Is Genji‐san or anyone here...?!
 It doesn\'t matter who, someone bring us a bath towel...!!"
It was already a full‐blown typhoon outside, and it was starting to pour down hard.
{n}Though she had at least been using an umbrella, Maria had been in the rose garden amid all that wind and rain the whole time.
She had grown ice‐cold.
Maria had gotten into a minor fight with Rosa in the rose garden, and had been told to stay there forever.
......She had done as she was told, and had continued to remain in that spot even after the rain started.
Rosa certainly had gotten a little emotional and angry,
 but Maria\'s stubborn demands were probably more at fault.
......The cousins, who had unfortunately been witness to that exchange,
 were relieved to see the mother and child close to each other again.
Rosa towelled Maria\'s head dry.
 She seemed overcome with worry that Maria might catch a cold, but Maria herself was nonchalant.
"Are you alright?
 You didn\'t catch a chill, did you?
 Maybe we really should go back quickly and get a change of clothes..."
"Uu, I\'m fiiiine!
 And I\'m hungry, so food is better than change of clothes, uu!"
"Hahahaha.
 She seems fine, Auntie Rosa.
 She\'s gotta be alright if she\'s got that much bounce."
"It\'s a really good thing she had an umbrella.
 ......I was thinking she might be soaked to the bone.
 The fact that she was holding on to an umbrella is one consolation, at least."
"But Maria!
 Even if you\'ve got an umbrella, you have to get some shelter if it starts pelting down like this, got it?
 Little girls shouldn\'t ever let themselves get cold."
".........Uu."
"It\'s alright, Jessica‐chan.
 ......It\'s Mama\'s fault for telling her to stay there.
 I\'m really sorry, I\'m really sorry...!!"
"Uu!
 I\'m a good girl?
 Good girl for doing what Mama said?
 Stayed there even though it was cold, stayed there until Mama came!
 Uu‐uu!"
"Yes, you really are a good girl, Maria.
 You did exactly what Mama told you...
 You really did well.
 But next time, even if Mama tells you to do something, you find some shelter if it starts raining like that.
 Alright...?
 Promise Mama."
"Uu.
 Promise Mama.
 ......Uu{p:0:☆}"
As Rosa gently held Maria, they joined their pinkies together and promised.
Battler and the others could tell that by this bonding between mother and child, expressed through a single little finger,
 the warmth was starting to return to Maria\'s body.
"Kanon‐kun, thanks for the towel.
 That really helped."
"......Then, if you would excuse me."
Kanon bowed with a blank expression, as though he had done nothing that required gratitude, then left the parlor.
"......Alright, it\'s already dinnertime.
 Let\'s all go together.
 ......Maria, you can even have half of my dessert too for being so good."
"Uu!
 Really, Mama?!
 Uu‐uu, get dessert, uu‐uu‐uu{p:0:♪}
 Love you Mama, love you Mama!"
"Now now, Maria, don\'t jump around.
 Mama loves you too, Maria.
 Love you Maria, love you Maria."
"Me too, love you Mama, love you Mama!
 Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!"
"Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu{p:0:♪}"
Rosa and Maria looked really happy together.
 Even the cousins watching started to feel a somehow familiar warmth filling up their chests.
"......You know, that might be the age when you\'re on the best terms with your parents."
"It wasn\'t like that for me.
 Like Mom and stuff, always yelling at me to study, study, study."
"That\'s because they love their children.
 A parent\'s love isn\'t always gentle and indulgent.
 My mother was strict with me too, but by now I realize that it was because she treasured me so."
"Uu‐uu‐uu!
 Love you Mama, love you Mama!"
"Love you Maria, love you Maria{p:0:♪} So, shall we get some food?
 Let\'s be friends and hold hands."
"Uu!
 Be friends and hold hands!
 Mama and Maria, friendly friendly{p:0:♪}"
"Yes, that\'s right.
 Mama and Maria are friends.
 Forever and ever.
 I love you, Maria..."
"...............The hell was that?
 ...What happened?"
The sudden sound had come from the teacup Gretel had been holding, which had fallen and smashed.
".........Sorry.
 I was out of it for a moment.
 Sorry for dropping it."
The cup on the floor was broken into tiny pieces.
......Would it really have made such a sound and smashed into so many pieces just by being dropped from that height?
Even someone as obtuse as Battler could realize that she was in a bad mood over something,
 but he couldn\'t understand why she had suddenly grown so displeased.
When she made to bend over and pick up the pieces of the cup, Ronove appeared out of nowhere and stopped her.
"Please, you will injure yourself.
 Leave the cleaning‐up to me.
 Shall I bring you another cup...?"
"......No thanks.
 .........I guess a demon\'s black tea just doesn\'t suit my tastes."
"Hoh.
 To think that there is someone whose tastes aren\'t satisfied even by Ronove\'s tea.
 I must respect your discerning palate."
".........I\'m getting bored, so I\'ll go out for a bit."
"{i:Bored}?
 Wait a sec, but things are just about to get started.
 At this point, Maria\'s probably going to say that she got an umbrella and a letter from {f:5:Beatrice} again, you know?
 This is the critical part—"
"You\'ll have to excuse me.
 Sorry, someone clean up this mess."
"Leave it to me."
Without saying anything else, Gretel disappeared of her own accord.
 Her form literally melted and disappeared into thin air...
There had definitely been a displeased expression on her face.
But neither Battler nor Ronove, nor of course Beato either, could understand why her mood had so suddenly worsened.
All that remained was the fragrance of the black tea she had spilled...
.........It felt very unpleasant.
No, to be even more blunt, it made my skin crawl.
"Uu...?
 ......Why are you so irritated, Ange......?"
"{i:Why}?!
 Isn\'t it obvious...?"
"Uu.
 ...Not to me......"
Even Maria onee‐chan, with that blank expression on her face, ...irritated me.
I held my hands palms‐up in the empty air, and from out of nowhere, a single book landed upon them with a thump.
.........It was Maria onee‐chan\'s diary.
Even though there was no wind, the pages flipped and flipped without me turning them,
 and opened the door to Maria onee‐chan\'s world.
"......Why do you think that I\'m not happy, Ange?"
"............By thinking about it objectively."
"Objectively from your perspective, right?"
".....................
 ......Are you trying to say that the truth is different for me and you?"
"Truth changes its form depending on the observer.
 And observers from the future always overwrite that form.
 .........Ange, what do you want with my happiness...?"
".............................."
The pages of the diary were flipped through at greater and greater speeds...
{n}Then a brilliant light poured out from the depths of the diary, ......swallowing everything up and painting over it all with white.
".........Sorry, Maria.
 Mama has a mountain of work that needs to be urgently taken care of, so I\'m going to be confined to my workplace for a while.
 ......I probably won\'t be able to come back home until late at night the day after tomorrow."
"......Uu.
 ......Then, what about the promise to go to the movies together on Sunday......?"
"The movies...?
 Uhh—"
Judging by Rosa\'s tone, she had clearly forgotten that promise.
But Maria\'s response to that was an apology for asking...
............I\'m sorry.
Maria apologized for troubling her mother by asking that question......
".........I\'ll stay home.
 I\'ll behave myself and wait.
 ......I\'ll take a bath every day and change my underwear."
"...I know where the money is.
 ......I\'ll go to a different store every day.
 I\'ll make sure not to go out too late.
 If a policeman asks, I\'ll say I\'m running errands for Mama.
 ......I\'ll say it just like you told me to."
"...........................
 ......That\'s right.
 You be a good girl.
 If you\'re good, I\'ll buy you a present.
 Listen now.
 Go to bed by nine o\'clock.
 Make sure not to tell your teacher or any grown‐ups that Mama hasn\'t come home.
 Alright......?"
"..................\'kay.
 ......I will, so, Mama, work hard, okay?
 ......Work hard, finish your work......and come back as fast as you can..."
"I......won\'t cry during the night and annoy the neighbors anymore......
 ......So, come back soon........."
"..................
 ......Well then, I\'m busy, so I\'ll hang up now.
 ...Be a good girl and wait patiently.
 Don\'t do anything foolish.
 See you."
Click.
 ......Using a tone that indicated she was wrapping up the call, Rosa hung up the phone without waiting for Maria\'s answer.
Maria neatly set down the receiver and returned to the sofa.
{n}There sat the stuffed animal Sakutaro, who had been watching TV with her until a second ago.
Sakutaro was clutching the remote control to the TV.
{n}......She had turned off the TV temporarily because of the phone call.
He looked like he was asking her to turn the power on again because he wanted to quickly get back to watching TV.
"...............Sakutaro.
 ......Did you want to watch...TV?"
‘......Uryu?
 You don\'t want to watch anymore, Maria...?
 If the entertainers\' team gets all the questions right, they might turn everything around.
 Uryu~!’
".........No.
 .........That\'s enough...TV."
Again, ......Mama\'s busy with her work and isn\'t coming home.
Mama usually has a lot of overtime and doesn\'t come home until late.
......She has to socialize or something for work, so she comes home having drunk a lot of alcohol, even though she can\'t handle it,
 and with a pale face, she goes straight into the shower and then to bed.
And even on the weekends, she says she has overtime or has to stay over, and almost never comes home.
......This has been happening often recently, saying she has a big job lined up or something...
......The picture I did my best on during art class got laughed at by everyone,
 but I wanted Mama to look at it properly at least...but once again, I won\'t be able to show her.
And talk about the time when everyone pushed the cleanup onto me, but I did my best by myself and got praised by the teacher.
And talk about when I went shopping, and the man at the shop said he\'s always impressed by me and gave me a free can of coffee.
And there\'s the card I wrote and secretly hid under Mama\'s pillow,
 because I wanted to encourage her when she comes home from working so hard.
"...............And there\'s more, there\'s...so much......I wanted to talk about."
‘.........Mama is working really hard at her job.
 She\'s working with all of her strength so we can eat every day.’
"......Hate jobs.
 ......Mama should just quit that stupid job."
‘A job is an important thing for adults to do.
 ......It lets you eat food,
 buys clothes,
 pays for school lunches,
 and pays the deposit for summer camp.
 ......It\'s all because Mama works and earns money for you.’
"..............................
 ...Don\'t need food.
 Don\'t need clothes.
 Don\'t need school lunches and don\'t want to go to summer camp.
 ...It\'s not like any of the groups will let me join in."
‘Uryu......
 ......Just now, on the phone, Mama promised that she\'ll buy you a present for when she comes back from work, right?’
‘I think Mama made that promise because you\'re important to her, Maria,
 and she feels bad for making you lonely.’
".........I don\'t know."
‘Uryu!
 She definitely wouldn\'t do that if she thought you were a pain or annoying!
 ......She wants to stay by your side all the time as well.’
‘...She also finds it painful and sad that she can\'t.
 ............I remember when Mama spent the whole night by your side, crying.’
".........Yeah.
 ...Didn\'t understand why Mama was crying, ......but seeing Mama like that was so sad,
 ...and I couldn\'t do anything but stay silent by her side."
‘I remember the last thing Mama said then.
 ......She said thank you.
 .........She said that just by being by her side, you were her only ally in the whole world.
 ......Uryu, do you remember?’
"Yeah...
 .........You\'re my only ally in the whole wide world,
 ......she said."
Sakutaro set the remote on the table, crawled up onto the sofa,
 sat on my lap, ...and spoke to me while gazing into my eyes.
‘......I\'m sure Mama\'s just like you, Maria.
 .........Where the designs Mama draws are the only ones laughed at by the clients.
 ......And her company is the only one that has annoying jobs pushed onto it by other companies.’
‘Mama is the president, so she has to take care of everything all by herself.
 ......And her company is the only one that never gets to join in with the business of other companies.’
‘.........You\'re Mama\'s only ally, remember.
 ......If even you tell Mama to quit her job, ......in the whole wide world, where would Mama\'s ally be.........?’
"...............uu...
 .........Sakutaro......"
‘The only person I have in the whole world is you.
 ......And the only person Mama has in the whole world is you.
 .........What about you, Maria?’
"......I have Mama...and I have you..."
‘Then you aren\'t lonely, at all!
 Uryu!’
".........Uu."
‘Mama is busy with her work, so she can\'t be with you very often, but please, don\'t blame her for that, Maria.
 ......In exchange, I\'ll always be by your side, and I\'ll be there forever and ever. ...............So don\'t cry, okay...?’
‘.........Uryu...
 Me being with you.........can\'t stop you feeling sad......?’
"............uuu, ......uuuuuuuuuuu, Sakutaro...
 ......uuuuuuuuu!!
 UwaaAAaaAaahhh, waaAAahaaaAAahaaahhh..."
.........From the holes in Maria\'s heart, which she had been doing her best to seal up, ...drops of sadness finally dripped down.
 ......Drip, drip.
 Plop, plop.
......Sniff, sniff, drip, drip, plop, plop.
Even though weekends where Mama doesn\'t come home aren\'t that rare a thing.
......Even though this night wasn\'t especially more painful or sad than any other.
......Maria\'s tears poured down.
‘Uryuu...!
 Don\'t cry, Maria...
 I\'ll always be with you...
 Even if you\'re going to cry, I won\'t.
 I\'m a lion cub, I can\'t cry just because I\'m lonely.
 ......I want to cry too...but I\'m {i:not going to}...!’
"Why won\'t you cry, Sakutaro...?
 You still won\'t cry, even when it\'s this lonely and you can\'t hold back the tears...?"
‘Uryu.
 But if I cry, who will make you feel better...?
 So I\'m not going to cry.
 Because I want to make you smile.’
"If I smile, ......will Mama come back......?"
‘When she does come back and you greet her with a happy face, ......I\'m sure she\'ll feel the same.
 Uryu.’
"......Mama...will be happy......?"
‘Uryu.
 And then, I\'m sure, it\'ll relieve her tiredness from work as well.
 And then, I\'m sure, she\'ll get in a good mood earlier than normal, and play with you a lot.’
".............................."
‘When you come home and Mama\'s waiting for you there, and she\'s in the kitchen in a good mood, don\'t you feel really happy?
 It\'s definitely the same for her.’
"......If I stay here, being happy......she\'ll be happy too?"
‘Uryu!’
Sakutaro nodded deeply with his big head.
{n}No more tears could fall from Maria\'s eyes.
......Because if she greeted her mama with a tear‐stained face, her mama would probably get sad too.
‘You know this already, Maria.
 You can\'t use the magic that creates smiles if you aren\'t smiling too.’
"......Yeah.
 ......I know.
 So I won\'t cry anymore."
‘Hey, Maria.
 I have an idea for how we can have a fun time.
 ......Uryu, can I tell you?’
"......What is it?"
‘Mama won\'t be coming back until late night Sunday.
 Why don\'t we have a pajama party in secret, without Mama ever knowing?’
"Pajama party...?"
‘Until you get tired late tonight, you can play with me while eating candy and drinking soda in bed.’
"A pajama party.
 ......Yeah, that sounds fun.
 ...I don\'t have to go to bed at nine?
 Mama won\'t get mad at me for not going to bed?"
‘This is a secret between you and me, only for when Mama isn\'t around.
 So, until you get sleepy, let\'s spend the whole night having fun together.’
‘Let\'s eat jellybeans and try to guess what color we\'ll get next.
 Let\'s split open peanuts and try to guess {c:86EF9C:which half is the grandpa}.’
‘Let\'s search for treasure in the closet.
 And more, so much more!
 I wonder what it\'ll taste like if we mix orange juice and melon soda.’
"Uu.
 Wanted to try that once, but asked Mama if it was alright and she got mad."
‘Uryuu!
 Let\'s try it out in secret from Mama{p:0:♪}
 Tonight, let\'s play a lot, laugh a lot, and blow away our tears with happiness.
 Don\'t worry, with me here, it\'ll definitely be fun!
 I\'ll make you happy for sure, Maria.’
"Yeah... Yeah.
 I know it\'ll be fun with you here.
 It\'ll definitely make me happy.
 Thanks, Sakutaro.
 Won\'t cry anymore.
 Let\'s have a super fun time together, make ourselves super happy, and say welcome home with a smile on our faces when Mama gets back."
‘Uryuu!
 Let\'s play and play tonight and get in a really great mood{p:0:♪}
 Let\'s play a lot in a secret party that we can only have when Mama isn\'t here.’
‘If we\'re lively enough, I\'m sure plenty of friends will come to play from Wonderland and Looking‐Glass Land.
 We\'ll have so many friends at that point that there simply won\'t be time left to feel bored.
 Uryuu!’
"Uryuu!!"
......And then I started my pajama party with Sakutaro, and had fun until late into the night.
I played by sticking my hand into the bag of jellybeans without looking, and trying to guess which color I would pull out.
......Sakutaro had good intuition and got it right a lot.
{n}Partway through, I also achieved the brilliant feat of guessing right four times in a row.
The game where I split peanuts open and tried to guess which half would be the grandpa...
was easier than guessing the color of the jellybeans, so I got it right a lot.
Sucking my salt‐covered fingers was bad manners, but that was the yummiest part.
I like both orange juice and melon soda on their own.
I hoped that by mixing those two favorite drinks, there might be a flash of light like alchemy,
 and a new drink that no one had ever tasted before would be created.
I got excited about how, if it turned out really delicious, I\'d call it Sakutaro Soda and sell it.
But, unexpectedly, it had a weird and disappointing taste.
{n}And the color was somewhat dull and boring.
...Maybe I shouldn\'t have been surprised that orange and green mixed together would make this.
 ......Too bad. I imagined that it would become a sparkling pineapple color.
But, it was an awesome, awesome, fun night.
If I\'m having this much fun, maybe Mama will start wanting to come home too, and unexpectedly appear at the front door.
......So I got the feeling that Mama might suddenly come home,
 and went to the front door many times to check, but there was no way Mama would be able to come home when she was this busy with work.
But rather than a feeling of loneliness,
 I felt just a little disappointed that I couldn\'t invite Mama to join in on such a fun late‐night party.
Next time, I\'ll do this when Mama is around, and let her join in.
Even some things that I don\'t think are yummy, Mama says are delicious,
 so she might say that Sakutaro Soda is really yummy.
When Mama comes back tired, I\'ll serve her some.
And more than anything.
......I wanted to at least write about this fun night in a letter, and tell Mama about it.
Hoping that these strong feelings of happiness would reach Mama too.
Hoping that when Mama comes home exhausted from her job, which is always so tough for her, I could share this happiness with her.
Hoping that when Mama comes home late Sunday night, almost certainly tired,
 I could make her even just a little brighter by sharing this happiness......
I softly placed that letter on Mama\'s desk.
{e:070:To Mama.
{n}Good job with your work again today{p:0:☆} Some of my happiness for you to share.
{n}{m:-5:―}―From Maria}
Then, I decided to give a present to Sakutaro for proposing this wonderful night.
A small red scarf that I had found when searching for treasure in my closet.
When Maria was still very young, her mama had knitted this tiny, tiny, red scarf for her.
"Maria" was embroidered on it with knitting wool.
......She softly wrapped that scarf around Sakutaro.
It really suited him, accenting his yellow with red very well.
‘.........Uryu.
 ...Does it suit me......?’
Sakutaro looked embarrassed as he wore his first present ever.
......Yeah.
 It really suits him.
"Uu.
 Sakutaro, thank you so much for everything.
 It was so fun tonight.
 I can\'t even remember why I was crying.
 ......Let\'s always stick together, okay?
 And let\'s always play and laugh together."
‘Uryuu!
 Love you, Maria!’
"Me too.
 Love you, Sakutaro."
After playing so wildly, my room was a mess.
Maybe I played a little too much.
......But I\'m tired for today, so let\'s sleep together now.
 And tomorrow, we\'ll clean up together and welcome Mama with a clean room.
 ......Okay? Sakutaro?
Uryuu{p:0:♪}
"......See?
 See how happy I...no, see how happy me and Sakutaro are?"
"..................
 Is this your happiness, Maria onee‐chan...?"
"Yep.
 I am happy."
"......Even though you were looking forward to that movie so much, and Aunt Rosa promised that she\'d definitely take you, she completely forgot."
"She just happened to forget because she was so busy with work.
 ......Even if she had remembered, she couldn\'t have done anything about it with her work."
"Whether she remembered or not, Mama would spend the night at work in either case.
 She couldn\'t go to the movies.
 .........Whether she remembered the promise or not is insignificant."
......There\'s no way that\'s insignificant.
After all, ......when Aunt Rosa replied "The movies?" on the phone,
 it was obvious that she had completely forgotten her promise.
And when she heard that, Maria onee‐chan\'s mood definitely darkened.
"Well, ......like you say,
 even if Aunt Rosa had remembered her promise, you wouldn\'t have been able to go to the movies in the end."
"......But even so.
 ......To think that your mother just forgot her promise to spend one of her few days off with you, ...it\'s sad.
 I\'d be angry."
"..............................
 ...Yeah.
 It was sad.
 Because even if she had remembered, we wouldn\'t have been able to go to the movies."
"......But after that, I had a very, very fun night with Sakutaro.
 You must\'ve thought that pajama party looked really fun too, Ange."
"...........................
 There\'s no way that would be fun."
"...I mean, all of that messing around you did that night,
 ......was just you intentionally making a frenzy out of nothing so you could forget that you were lonely and that your mother wasn\'t coming home."
"That\'s not true.
 Really did have a fun party with Sakutaro."
"No, you didn\'t!
 You were just so sad, and you hated your mother so much for forgetting her promise, that you made a mess of your room...!!"
"...............Where was something like that ever written in my diary?"
"It isn\'t {i:written} anywhere!
 But......by reading in the gaps between every line, I can tell how you felt!
 You didn\'t have a good time at all that evening!"
"And you stayed up late when you were told not to, broke the strict rule about not eating sweets outside of snack time,
 ......and when even that didn\'t bury your sadness, you went wild in your room, .........and made a mess of it, isn\'t that all...?!!"
"And after you made a mess of your room and were all tired out,
 .........all you did was claw at the bed sheets and cry yourself to sleep...!"
".........It is written in the diary that Mama probably forgot her promise about the movie,
 and that I stayed up late having a pajama party with Sakutaro, ......and made a mess of my room searching for treasure."
"Yes.
 And that.........can only mean one thing, can\'t it?!
 You were starving for Auntie Rosa\'s love...!
 And Aunt Rosa always put her work and her public image first, always keeping you on the back‐burner...!"
"That\'s why it makes my skin crawl!
 Because I know just how superficial Aunt Rosa\'s words of {i:love} for you are!!
 You should realize this yourself!"
"So......how can you say that you\'re happy?!
 I don\'t {i:understand} that......that part of you, Maria onee‐chan!!
 Even at this age, I can\'t understand it at all...!!"
"How aren\'t you sad?
 How is it that you can experience a reality filled with misfortune and call yourself happy?!
 I can\'t do it, I can\'t understand it...!!"
"...............You are a sad kid, Ange."
"I don\'t get it!!
 Why are {i:you} pitying {i:me}?!"
".........Even though a "fact" about a really fun pajama party is written in my diary,
 .........when it\'s observed by a different person, it looks like that same "fact" takes a different form, huh."
I remembered talking about this with {f:5:Bernkastel}.
Truth is indeterminate and changes its form every time it\'s observed.
{n}By the way it is perceived, ...in other words, depending on the person who perceives it, a single truth becomes different truths.
And truths of the past are painted over by truths of the future......
"In this diary, I wrote that what happened that night was very, very fun."
"......You described the events of that night as something very happy."
"And yet, when you read the diary, you read the events of that night as very, very sad."
"......Even though you described it as happiness, I read it as something different."
"Stop it."
"................................."
"This...tells of a happy night.
 .........This is...the "truth" of that night.
 Please, don\'t take this happy truth,
 ............and paint over it with a new and different truth."
"............Does this make you......happy, Maria onee‐chan?"
"Yep.
 Happy.
 .........That\'s why I feel so sorry for you, because you can\'t feel happiness in the same situation."
.........Both she back then, and I now, have the same friendless and lonely situation.
And Ange......accepted the lonely truth as the lonely truth.
 But {i:she}......painted over the lonely truth with a happy truth.
Ushiromiya Maria took the sad truth...
...and changed it into happiness.
That...
...is the only, and yet all too large, ...difference between me and Maria onee‐chan.
And at the same time as being unable to accept it,
 ......another part of me is jealous of that power.
"Yeah.
 ......That\'s right.
 It is "power".
 ......With that power, I was able to become happy.
 And without it, you can\'t."
"That.........power,
 ............what is it............?"
"I didn\'t know what to call that power either.
 ......At this point in time, at least.
 ...Eventually, I would be taught its true form."
"......I\'ll talk about it later.
 On a later page.
 .........So then, so then, late Sunday night.
 With a present, just like she\'d promised, Mama came back......"
".........I\'m back."
"Mamaaaa, welcome hoooooooome!!"
‘Uryuu!!
 Mama came back, Mama came back!’
Waiting to greet Rosa, as she returned home all tired out,
 was Maria, holding Sakutaro, in an unbelievably good mood.
Rosa\'s worn out expression was surely due at least in part to actual fatigue,
 ......but also partially because she was sick and tired of having Maria cling to her and loudly whine and sob after being left alone in the house for a few days.
However, when she was welcomed by an unbelievably happy Maria,
 ......and discovered unbelievably that her fears had been unfounded, Rosa couldn\'t hide her surprise.
"Wh‐......what\'s going on, Maria...?
 You\'re in a great mood, aren\'t you...?!
 Is someone here...?!"
It was strange enough to make Rosa think that a friend might have come over, and that she had come back home in the middle of them having a good time playing together.
But there were no other shoes by the entrance.
......Even though Maria was in such high spirits, she was home alone.
At first, Rosa was suspicious that this unexpectedly good mood might have some kind of unwelcome underlying cause,
 but that really was a needless fear, ......and it really did seem to be that Maria had actually stayed at home in a good mood.
.........Even if Rosa\'s heart had been as cold and hard as a rock, ...after being welcomed with a smile like this...
...Rosa started to honestly accept that smile, and a smile rose to her own face automatically.
......In that smile, you could see none of the weariness caused by being unable to return home for several days.
Maria kept talking about what a fun time she\'d had playing with the stuffed animal Sakutaro.
Rosa really hadn\'t imagined that the stuffed animal she\'d gifted her would be liked so much, and she couldn\'t hide her pleasant surprise.
"I see.
 So you and Sakutarou were having fun watching the house together.
 Well done, Maria.
 I have presents for you and Sakutarou for being so good."
‘Uryuu!
 Presents!
 Presents!’
"Uu!
 I wonder what they are, I wonder what they are!"
Maria started jumping around with Sakutaro.
There were two presents.
 One was a Western cake assortment.
It contained different kinds of Scotch cakes.
 It looked to be of very high quality.
But Maria was more interested in the other one.
{n}The other one was an even bigger box, and it was pretty heavy.
"Open it and have a look.
 They might become new friends for you and Sakutarou, who knows?"
"Wowwwwwwwwww...!
 What\'s this!
 What\'s this?!"
Inside, laid there like chess pieces, were about twenty small ceramic animal figures.
Squirrels, rabbits, small birds, dogs and cats.
{n}And they were all holding musical instruments.
In addition to them, there was also a panorama‐style background.
{n}A forest scene was drawn on it.
{n}Little woodland animals were all gathered around a forest clearing, and they looked like they were having a good time.
Rosa set it up on the table.
......And when she then lined up the ceramic figures like chess pieces in front of it,
 .........it became a band of forest animals.
"Isn\'t it wonderful?
 I saw it in the store window, and I was taken with it at a glance.
 This is a present for you for being such a good girl home alone, Maria."
"Uuuu!!!
 Thank you, Mamaaa!!!"
"Isn\'t this amazing, Sakutaro?!
 Look how many more friends we have...!
 It was just like you said, Sakutaro!
 It was true, we had a fun and lively time, and we {i:did} get more friends...!"
‘See, didn\'t I tell you?
 Look, we have more friends, look, we have more friends!
 Uryu~{p:0:♪}’
Relieved that her gift had been appreciated,
 Rosa suddenly remembered that she was filled with several days of weariness...
"Mama, you really worked hard...!
 You should go take a shower.
 If you take a hot one, I\'m sure your tiredness will go away.
 Want to take a bath?
 I\'ll choose what to put in the bath today!"
"Thank you.
 But it\'s already late, so you get ready for bed.
 Mama\'s tired, so I\'ll just take a shower and go to bed right away.
 I have to get up early tomorrow."
"Yep, okay!
 Here, Mama, I\'ll take your coat off for youuu."
"No, really, I can do it myself...
 ...Ahh, thank you."
"Your coat is full of smells from outside.
 ......Uu?
 Oh, sorry, dropped something.
 I\'ll pick it up, okay?"
When she had taken Rosa\'s coat, a receipt or ticket stub or something had fallen out.
...It had been in her mama\'s pocket, so it was probably important.
Maria hurriedly picked it up...
It looked like a ticket for a Green Car or the Shinkansen or something.
............Atami?
 Maybe it\'s that place famous for its hot springs...?
Just then.
 ...A razor‐sharp sound shattered the warm atmosphere.
Instead of the Rosa who had been there just a second ago, enjoying a gift with her daughter and full of weariness after returning home for the first time in several days,
 .........there stood a completely different person, who looked exactly the same, but had the most terrible of expressions on her face.
...In her hand was the ticket stub that Maria had picked up.
{n}...She had stolen it from Maria\'s hand in an instant.
After a few seconds\' delay,
 ...by the pain of her hand that had been hit,
 and her mother\'s expression,
 Maria realized that she must have done something wrong.
But she didn\'t know what she had done that had gotten her in trouble.
......It was probably because of that ticket‐stub‐like thing.
Was she not supposed......to touch it.........?
Even though she had tried so hard to welcome her mama with fun and happiness,
 ...she had touched something important to her without asking, and had ruined that pleasant atmosphere...
......So Maria apologized immediately.
"S‐......sorry........."
"............nh.
 .................."
Even though she must have heard those words of apology, Rosa\'s expression actually darkened.
...Maybe those words had been undesired?
Maria didn\'t know what to do, and cautiously watched to see how her mother would act...
Then, even though it should have been such an important ticket stub,
 Rosa crushed it up and hurried off to her room...
Maria......didn\'t really understand what she had done wrong......
".........Uu......
 ......I must have...
......done something I shouldn\'t have......
 ...That paper must have been something important for Mama\'s work.
 And I touched it without asking..."
‘Uryu......
 ...You didn\'t do anything wrong, Maria.........
 ...So look how happy we are tonight as well.’
"Yeah.
 ...Happy."
‘And when Mama takes a bath and clears her head, she\'ll go back to being the normal, nice Mama.
 So you mustn\'t worry about it.
 Uryu.’
"You\'re right......
 Mama\'s tired too, after all.
 ......Uu, mustn\'t worry about it.
 We\'re so very happy tonight."
‘Uryu.’
"..................Please stop.
 ...I can\'t bear to watch this."
"......Ange, I think you\'re looking for happiness in the wrong way."
"You\'re the one who\'s wrong!!
 How can you call this happiness...?!!
 It\'s too...painful for me even to watch it anymore!!"
"What is...?
 That Mama suddenly got mad?
 .........That happens sometimes when people get tired.
 ......Condemning a person because of a momentary misplaced emotion isn\'t very adult of you, Ange."
"......I can\'t believe I\'m hearing this from a nine‐year‐old...
 But that\'s not the problem, is it?!
 That ticket stub you picked up was clearly strange!"
"How?
 There was nothing strange about it, and it has nothing to do with the happiness of that night..."
"Aunt Rosa called you saying she\'d be staying over at work because of her job, right?!
 Why Atami?!
 Isn\'t that what you call a vacation?!"
"It means she left you behind and went on a vacation, doesn\'t it?!
 And you normally don\'t go on a vacation by yourse—"
"Even if that was a ticket for Atami,
 that alone doesn\'t make it proof that Mama lied and went on a vacation, does it...?"
"She lied on the phone, changed her expression like that and grabbed it from you!
 What more proof could you want...?!!"
".........It might be from a business trip long ago, right?
 Or maybe she just happened to pick up some trash or something and put it in her pocket.
 It might even be a receipt from someone who works for her who went on a business trip."
"...In that case, it was important for her work.
 It wasn\'t a toy, so I can understand why Mama took it away.
 ......This evidence you\'re talking about is nothing more than circumstantial evidence.
 Imagination and delusions.
 ......I don\'t know why you\'re interpreting it so that my relationship with Mama is bad."
"I\'m the one who doesn\'t understand how you can interpret it in a way that\'s so convenient for Aunt Rosa!!"
".........You really are a poor child, Ange.
 .........There are fragments that could make you happy,
 so many of them, scattered all about your feet, and you can\'t find them."
"......Instead, all you find are the unhappy fragments, and you keep getting hurt over and over.
 ......That\'s why you get scared of being hurt,
 ......and you can\'t start even looking for happiness until after you\'ve finished making sure that there\'s nothing around you that could hurt you."
"..................When I talk with you, Onee‐chan, it gets hard to tell which one of us isn\'t making sense."
"You know what?
 There are lots and lots of both happy and unhappy fragments, and the world is full to the brim with both kinds.
 So people who can\'t find happiness right beside them won\'t be able to find it no matter where they go looking.
 ......Like Tyltyl and Mytyl searching for the blue bird."
"............Yes.
 The story did have that moral."
"You\'re the complete opposite, Ange.
 You\'re searching for a world without a single unhappy fragment.
 But even that\'s the same as the blue bird.
 So you\'ll be unable to find your own happiness for all eternity."
"............Battler is Hansel, is he?
 Isn\'t he the blue bird......?"
"......Give it a rest already.
 .........In any event, I got the point that a night of happiness was wasted because of a single scrap of paper that fell from a coat."
"It\'s scary, isn\'t it?
 That a single scrap of paper could do that.
 ......In that case, maybe the power to get happiness back can also lie in a single scrap of paper, don\'t you think?"
Just when she had finally been able to bond with Maria after so long......
Rosa\'s face twisted with a mixture of anger, sadness, and a fierce self‐hatred as she flew into her room and closed the door.
.........Maria\'s "sorry" had stuck into her chest more sharply than any knife.
Then,
 ......she noticed a cute envelope placed on her study table.
It was probably something that had come with a girls\' magazine.
.........To Mama.
 Some of my happiness for you to share, it said.
She took it, .........hesitated, opened it, ...and read what was inside.
....................................
Then, after dotting the surface of the paper...
with two large tears...
......she flew out of the room,
 hugged Maria from behind as she headed for the bathroom,
 .........buried her face into her daughter\'s back,
 ......and cried.
And, realizing that she was the one who should truly be saying sorry,
 ...
...
...
...
she apologized to her.
And when Maria asked why,
 she gave no answer......
".........See.
 Already made up.
 .........A little thing like that was absolutely nothing to worry about, because of the friendliness between Mama and me."
"........................
 .........Your happiness is...too painful for me."
"......I do understand your feelings more or less, Ange.
 ......Until I realized my "power",
 ...even I was just like you, a sorry child who could only find fragments filled with misfortune."
"............What is this "power"?
 This power that I don\'t have, but you do.
 ...And are you saying that me not having it is the reason I have misery and you have joy?
 .........Just what is this {i:thing} that you can\'t describe except with an abstract word like "power"......?"
"Yeah.
 That is what you want to know, isn\'t it, Ange?
 ......That\'s why you\'ve been reading my story all this time."
"............Of course I\'ll teach you.
 The secret to that power.
 ......And I did teach you about it long ago, when you were little, you know...?
 Did you forget...?"
"Don\'t worry, you\'ll be able to remember.
 ......Now I...
......no, she.
 She will teach you."
"............She......?
 Who\'s that?"
{a:c:
"I shall teach you in {f:5:Maria}\'s place."}
".........B‐
............{f:5:Beatrice}..............."
"The "power" that {f:5:Maria} has, but you do not."
"Yep.
 The "power" I have, but you do not."
{m:-5:―}―{i:That}...is magic.
Maria and Beato said it together.
 And then they started giggling because they\'d said it at the same time.
......It was an innocent behavior, which seemed somehow unlike Beato.
Black tea was arranged on a table in a peaceful garden,
 and Beato, Maria, and Sakutarou, who was sitting on Maria\'s lap, were having fun chatting...
"............Hoh.
 I see, so he is called Sakutarou.
 And your best friend, you say!"
‘Uryu...
 It\'s nice to meet you, my name is Sakutarou...’
"Uu, Sakutaro is shy so he\'s nervous right now.
 It\'s okay, {f:5:Beatrice} is my wonderful friend too...!"
‘Uryu.
 Are your friends my friends...?’
"Yeah!"
‘Uryu. ......Then I\'m {f:5:Beatrice}\'s friend too?’
"Yeah!"
‘Uryuu!’
"......Maria, do things like this happen frequently for you in your everyday life?"
"Uu?
 Things?"
"Is breathing a soul of magic into inorganic matter and giving it life in this way...
a commonplace practice for you?"
"......Uu.
 Sakutaro isn\'t inorganic matter, he\'s a lion cub."
‘Uryuu!’
"Hmm......
 ......A stuffed animal makes for an excellent vessel.
 Therefore, when it is spoken to by an innocent child without toxin, it is not uncommon for a spirit to take up residence within, in an attempt to respond to them."
According to {f:5:Beatrice}, when a child "plays with dolls",
 the dolls sometimes gain an actual will and converse with them, in rare cases even moving on their own.
However, the power that they can imbue into such a vessel is very weak due to their innocence.
If even a tiny bit of the toxin from a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}\'s common sense gets involved, and tells them that there\'s no way a doll can talk or move,
 it instantly reverts to being an ordinary non‐speaking doll......
"However, ......this...Sakutarou stuffed animal of yours is different."
"Uu!
 Sakutaro is a stuffed animal, but he\'s not just a stuffed animal!"
‘Uryuu!
 Lion cuuuub!
 Ga‐...ga‐......uryuu!’
"Sakutaro is a lion cub, but he\'s still a kid, so he can\'t say {ruby:roar:gaooo} sometimes.
 Uryu‐uryu‐uryu{p:0:♪}"
‘Uryu‐uryu‐uryuu!’
{f:5:Beatrice} let out a sigh of admiration as she gazed at Maria, playing around with Sakutaro at the table loaded with tea.
".........How incredible.
 This "Sakutarou", with a core of a cloth‐and‐cotton vessel, has completely manifested into the human world.
 He has his own character, talks with his summoner freely,
 {i:and even moves by his own will}."
"......And what is most surprising is that you did not summon him by name as a being from another world,
 but created him out of the sea of zero."
After that, Maria boasted to Beato that Sakutarou wasn\'t her only friend, and that when she went home, there would be plenty more of them.
She claimed that there were other similar stuffed animals and dolls who, like Sakutarou, could talk and move of their own will.
It was something natural to Maria.
 It was {i:natural} for stuffed animals to talk, move, and become her friends of their own free will.
......When she heard Maria speak of this in that way, {f:5:Beatrice}, as a witch, felt a respect bordering on awe.
"............Maria.
 Without a doubt, that power of yours is magic."
"It\'s magic......?
 But I\'m still a witch apprentice, I\'m not able to use magic yet..."
"Not so, it is magic indeed.
 .........You may be an apprentice since you are unable to use it in full awareness of that fact,
 ......but even so, what power this magic has!
 The manifestation of your friend Sakutarou is excellent proof of that."
"Many...festation...?"
"Mm.
 In your case, it may even be fitting to call it creation.
 ......A piece of inorganic matter that would have no soul at all in another\'s hands has had a soul imbued into it through your magic."
"Furthermore, you are using strong power to keep it tethered to the human world.
 ......In this era so filled with the toxin that denies magic, maintaining the magical power necessary to manifest a being to the degree that it can exist as an independent life‐form is not easy even for me."
It isn\'t hard to create soulless beings in any number.
{n}However, creating a being with a soul is very difficult.
{n}...Beato declared this definitively.
".........Don\'t really understand what you\'re saying, Beato.
 You\'re saying Sakutaro is amazing...?"
"I am saying that you and Sakutarou both are marvelous.
 ......You may feel proud.
 ...Yes, that which Kinzo desired above all else seems to dwell most strongly within you."
"Don\'t have a clue why you\'re praising me so much.
 Ri~ght, Sakutaro?"
‘Uryu~!’
"......What is truly admirable is not only that you have caused a soul to reside in a stuffed animal.
 It is the fact that by that act, you have changed your own worldview.
 ......Your power to create something from nothing is beyond exceptional."
"......It is simple to make a hundred from one.
 However, creating one from zero is not easy.
 ...When you become a full witch, you may not only be a match for me, but might even grow into a Great Witch that I must acknowledge as superior."
"The Witch of Origins, perhaps.
 .........I, too, am greatly looking forward to your future."
"Uu!
 Beato said I have talent as a wi~tch!"
‘Isn\'t that great, Maria?!
 Uryu, Beato...thank you for praising Maria.’
"*cackle*cackle*!
 There is no need to thank me, Sakutarou.
 That red scarf truly suits you.
 And I am envious of the talent of your master that enabled her to create a friend like you."
‘Uryu~!
 Thanks for complimenting my scarf.
 I got it as a present from Maria.
 I really like it.’
"And its size is truly as if it was created just for you.
 ......Yes, in light of this, I see that I must also give my new friend some kind of present."
"Uu?
 Beato, you\'re giving Sakutaro a present......?"
"A gift from a witch must be something with magical power, of course.
 In that case, so that your friend can remain your friend for all time, and so that you can have even more fun playing with him..."
"I shall give Sakutarou my magic power.
 It should allow him to achieve an even stronger manifestation."
"Uu?
 I\'ll be able to have much more fun playing with Sakutaro...?
 How?"
‘Uryu......?
 What could it be, Maria...
 Is it something scary......?’
"Don\'t worry.
 Beato won\'t do anything scary.
 Right, {f:5:Beatriceee}?!"
"Mm.
 I am certain that he will like it.
 .........Let us see then...yes, in order to achieve a stronger manifestation, a stronger image will be necessary.
 .........Well, now, what to do.
 Hmmmmmmmmmm..."
Beato folded her arms and thought about what she could do to please them the most.
And at that moment, there appeared...
......the form of yet another witch.
{n}It was Beato\'s master, {f:5:Virgilia}.
{f:5:Virgilia} truly was a Great Witch.
...Since Maria already thought of Beato as a Great Witch, this person Beato called a Great Witch must have been a Great Great Witch.
According to Beato, not even she could hold a candle to this witch when it came to magical power.
"My, my.
 I {i:thought} I heard some cheery voices.
 What a fun tea party this seems to be..."
"Oh, Master.
 Perfect timing.
 I want you to take a look at this lion cub.
 I hear he\'s Maria\'s new friend."
"Hoh‐hoh‐ho.
 What an adorable little lion.
 ......I wonder if he can greet me?
 Hello, nice to meet you...?"
‘U‐uryuu!
 I, I\'m Sakutarou.’
Sakutaro got back down onto Maria\'s lap, and greeted {f:5:Virgilia} with half of his face poking out over the edge of the table.
...He seemed to be very nervous since this was a witch that even Beato called Master.
"Hoh‐hoh‐ho.
 What a lovely name.
 ......As a reward for giving such a good greeting, here\'s a sweet for you."
After waving her hands about, {f:5:Virgilia} held the palm of her hand upwards, and made a movement as though lightly grasping some of the air.
Then, she held that closed fist out in front of Sakutaro.
............And when she opened it, there lay one of those individually wrapped cough drops.
‘Uryuu?!
 It\'s candy, Maria, oh wow, oh wow...!!’
"Uu!
 Isn\'t that nice, Sakutaro?!
 Make sure to thank her."
‘Uryu.
 Thank you very much for the candy.
 ...*bow*.’
Even though {f:5:Virgilia} was a Great Great Witch, she still treated a stuffed animal like Sakutarou to an elegant greeting.
"Still, Master, cough drops? Are you someone\'s granny or something...?!
 Can\'t you at least pull out some strawberry‐milk candy~?"
"How mean.
 Perhaps I won\'t give you candy anymore?"
"Kuhhyahhyahhya, sorry, sorry.
 .........Well then, Maria.
 Take out your grimoire.
 And, of course, your writing tools."
"Uu?
 Okay, taking it out.
 Are we writing something?"
"......Oh? What\'s happening now?"
"I will use a magic I learned from you, Master.
 .........Magic to make a resident of another world manifest into a vessel."
"I think that by applying that, I may be able to further strengthen the power manifesting this friend of Maria\'s.
 ......I want to give that as a gift to Maria and her friend."
"I see.
 ...It shouldn\'t be that difficult for a being that has already manifested.
 That seems like it will turn out to be a wonderful gift.
 Well then, I shall offer what modest help I can."
"If you shall be signing for this magic personally as a witness, Master, that is greatly encouraging...!
 Rejoice, Maria.
 This shall be a wonderful gift...!"
‘Uryu...?
 What\'s happening...?
 It isn\'t scary, is it?
 Is it...?’
"Don\'t know.
 But don\'t think it\'s scary.
 ......Wonder what it is. Exciting, huh?"
Beato borrowed the grimoire from Maria\'s handbag and majestically riffled through the pages.
......Then, finding an empty page among those with magic circles drawn on them, she flattened the book out.
And after staring at Sakutarou with a smirk, she suddenly started darting her pen across the page.
......It was something like a written proclamation made by witches to a higher‐order world.
Magic, which would take effect by {f:5:Beatrice} writing it and {f:5:Virgilia} giving her signature as a witness.
Maria didn\'t understand what Beato was doing at first, but partway through, she figured out the wonderful magic power of this document, and her eyes began to sparkle...
‘Uryu?!
 Uryu?!
 What is it, Maria, what\'s she drawing?!
 Uryu‐uryu?!’
Sakutarou was on her lap, so he didn\'t know what was being written up on the table.
......But even if he had seen, Sakutarou probably wouldn\'t have understood.
"It\'s amazing, Sakutaro!!
 Wait a bit, almost done, almost done!
 Beato that\'s awesome, Beato that\'s awesome!!"
".........When it comes to writing documents of power, this child\'s talent is splendid.
 I expect you could even work as a secretary in the netherworld."
"How is this...?!
 It should be passable...!"
After she had completed the thing she had been so intensely concentrating on, Beato looked over the document again from a distance.
......It seemed she was fairly satisfied with her work.
And Maria, upon also peeking in at it, let out a cry of wonder.
"......It\'s amazing, Beato!!
 So cuuute!!
 Uu‐uu‐uu!!"
"By the name of the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}, I hereby acknowledge Sakutarou, {f:5:Maria}\'s child.
 .........Master, if you would sign as a witness!"
"Yes, yes.
 ......By my name, I stand witness to and acknowledge this oath.
 .........It is done."
{f:5:Virgilia} signed, completing the proclamation.
It was a powerful document that proclaimed to the beings of a higher world that Sakutarou had most certainly manifested in the human world.
Sakutarou, created by Maria, had received the recommendation of the two witches {f:5:Beatrice} and {f:5:Virgilia},
 and in this very moment, the higher world had accepted his existence.
......That was the great magic of manifestation.
According to Beato, it was apparently an incredible stroke of luck that {f:5:Virgilia} had been here.
Because the power residing in the proclamation would change drastically depending on the number and the ranks of the witches signing it.
{f:5:Virgilia} in particular had many friends in the higher world,
 so her signature gave the proclamation a power with which Beato\'s couldn\'t even compare.
"By this proclamation, I accept thee, Sakutarou, as an individual with thine own sense of self.
 And I welcome thee as a friend in accordance with the treaty of Mariage Sorcière.
 Henceforth, Sakutarou, thou art our common friend."
"And as a gift, I shall bestow upon you a form appropriate to that status.
 Accept it."
With the grimoire still opened to the page with the proclamation, she turned it around and handed it to Maria.
Maria showed it to Sakutarou on her lap.
When Sakutarou beheld that proclamation,
 ............in his body made of cloth and cotton,
 he felt something hot and bright begin to dwell.
Even as he looked around, nervous at this sensation that he had never felt before, that power strengthened,
 ......and eventually, a bright light completely swallowed him up...
‘Uryu......?
 Uryu‐uryu‐uryu‐uryu......!’
And when that light disappeared...
............There, Maria\'s friend Sakutarou held a new form, and {i:existed}.
"Uu‐uu‐uu!
 You\'re cute, Sakutaro!
 Reeeeally cute!"
‘Uryu...?
 Uryuu...
 Does it really suit me?
 It isn\'t embarrassing......?’
"Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho.
 It is a very lovely form, Sakutarou‐chan."
"I felt that the scarf was his charm point, you see.
 And the ears!
 Animal ears are nice indeed, truly cute!
 Allow me to nibble at them later.
 *cackle*!"
"Thank you, {f:5:Beatriceee}!!
 Thank you so much for the wonderful present!!"
"There is no need for thanks.
 This is merely an expression of my respect for your wonderful magic and your friend."
".........And now that you have reached this level, it would not be odd for you to graduate from an apprentice at any time.
 Starting today, I shall initiate you in even newer and more fun forms of magic."
"......From this point forward, you may call yourself {f:5:Maria}, the Apprentice Witch of Origins."
"What\'s the Witch of Origins...?"
"Mm.
 It is the title of a witch who seeks to become a Creator.
 Right now, you are just an Enchanter, possessing only enough strength to breathe magical power into the small objects around you."
"......But after one thousand years of training, it is not unthinkable that you could create not just your own {i:system} of magic, but even a galaxy."
"......The talent of the Witch of Origins is very rare.
 Even though everyone has it when they are young, no one can continue to hold onto it.
 ......This title is also proof that you have not lost your untainted heart."
"Uu!!
 Witch of Origins, wow!
 I\'ll become one!
 I\'m the Apprentice Witch of Origiiins!"
‘Maria, that\'s so cool...!
 The Witch of Origins, wow, awesome, uryuu!’
"Eventually, you will probably be able to call yourself by the title of a full witch—Lady {f:5:Maria}, the Witch of Origins.
 ......It may be a good time now to give not only Sakutarou, but you as well, an appearance fitting for your rank."
".........There.
 I shall give a proper outfit for one who, while an apprentice, is worthy of calling herself a witch."
When Beato waved the pipe that was her wand,
 many gold butterflies appeared out of nowhere, grouped around Maria, and granted her a wonderful dress.
Endowed with both cuteness and majesty, it was indeed a fitting article of clothing for the girl who would eventually take the name of the Witch of Origins...
"Oh wow...!!
 Awesome awesome awesome awesome!!
 So cute, so cute!
 I want to show these clothes to Mama too...!!
 Can\'t I?"
"The full dress of a witch must not be shown indiscriminately.
 Such a thing is worth more if you reserve it for those most grandiose occasions.
 *cackle*!"
And then, the Great Witch, the witch, the witch\'s apprentice, and their new friend Sakutarou, had a lively time enjoying their tea together......
".........See?
 Look how happy I am.
 And look how fun this is."
"..........................."
"Please, don\'t be afraid of being happy.
 Becoming happy isn\'t the same thing as accepting your current misfortune.
 It means creating a new happiness within your current misfortune.
 That is the Magic of Origins."
"......I...didn\'t want to acknowledge my current world.
 ......I couldn\'t abide accepting such an isolated and painful world.
 ...That\'s why, even though I was entranced by your world, Maria onee‐chan,
 ......I couldn\'t cross the final line."
"............I\'ll teach you.
 About my Magic of Origins.
 No, I taught you before, right?
 And you used to be able to use it.
 Did you forget......?"
"..........................."
"You were also a witch apprentice, Ange, with your name entered into Mariage Sorcière, weren\'t you?"
"............Yes.
 So I was.
 .........Mariage Sorcière,
 ...that takes me back.
 ......I also had my name entered in there at one point, didn\'t I...""Yes, I will never forget it.
 It happened in April of 1987.
 I received a certain strange request from a friend."
"......A large collection of books, the former possessions of a very rich man, were being sold at auction,
 and it was thought that some of them might have been extremely valuable from an archeological and folkloristic perspective, as well as in an occult sense,
 so this friend wanted me to take a private look at their value."
"..................\'87.
 Half a year after the crime on Rokkenjima."
"Correct.
 Those books were explained to have escaped the disaster on Rokkenjima.
 I was told that the owner of the island, {nobr:Mrs. Ushiromiya} Eva, had put them up for auction."
They appeared to be at a high‐class restaurant.
 Ange and a middle‐aged man were sitting across from one another in a pair of secluded and quiet seats.
Amakusa could be seen by the restaurant\'s entrance.
{n}He was probably keeping a lookout for pursuers from the Sumadera family.
The scholarly seeming man across from Ange spoke politely, but with enthusiasm.
He hadn\'t so much as touched the food in front of him, which communicated effectively the passion with which he was speaking.
He was a professor at a certain university, known in particular as an authority on Western folklore.
However, among his life works, that was only the one with the most acceptable public face.
His true life work...
was the study of Western occultism, Western magic, alchemy, and all else falling under the umbrella of "the occult",
 as well as demonology.
In short, he was one of the people best positioned to understand the details of Kinzo\'s research...
"First, what I learned by appraising the books was that {nobr:Mrs. Ushiromiya} Eva had absolutely no education in folkloristics,
 and that the original owner of the books, {nobr:Mr. Ushiromiya} Kinzo, was without doubt one of the top five authorities on demonology in Japan."
April, 1987.
A major city antique shop came into possession of a large quantity of ancient texts thought to have a high historical value.
The texts had been entrusted to them by Ushiromiya Eva, who had requested for them to be put up for auction on her behalf.
At the time, everyone thought that Eva had succeeded the Ushiromiya family and obtained all the wealth for herself as the only survivor.
However, at that point, barely half a year had passed since the accident, which was not enough for the rest of the family to be legally declared dead in absentia, even given the extraordinary circumstances.
Because of that, Eva was thought to have been in a very tight spot financially, unable even to collect from her family\'s life insurance.
It seems that she tried to sell everything of value,
 and even the books kept in Kuwadorian, her location when she escaped harm, became a target of this.
And when the authorities in the field gathered at the request of the antique shop to appraise these documents—which were later called "the Ushiromiya Library"—they were given the shock of their lives.
"At least speaking from the perspective of occultism,
 the shock waves that discovery sent throughout the world were comparable to the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls."
"The reason for this is that the "Ushiromiya Library" even included some extremely important documents...
which had been known to exist for more than a thousand years, but had never before been found."
The so‐called "romantic" side of the occult, epitomized for example by alchemy, never ceases to stir an intense fascination in dilettantes.
Even now, it is whispered that in various places around the world, a great number of "magic books" of historical value...
might be in the secret possession of very wealthy lovers of the occult, unannounced to the public.
The prime candidates for this are said to be items such as Leonardo da Vinci\'s notebooks, which are particularly popular among dilettantes.
It is said that approximately five thousand pages of the notebooks currently exist, and over ten thousand have been lost,
 but some researchers believe that a large part of this lost portion may be being monopolized by certain dilettantes and millionaires.
It is said that because of this, even now,
 dilettantes who can\'t help but seek these spare no expense to search around for quietly hoarded‐away and unannounced notebooks...
There is probably no doubting that Ushiromiya Kinzo was himself one of those dilettantes.
It is unknown what Kinzo went through to obtain these,
 but undoubtedly he must have spent his vast wealth like water, to buy them off other rich people with the same hobby as him.
The discovery of that huge number of books at the end of the 20th century, books so valuable that dilettantes were filled with the desire to hoard them away,
 and their subsequent release to the public, gave the entire world a massive shock...
"Due to this incident, the name Rokkenjima became known across the world.
 And at the same time, the world also received a shock at the very high probability that, due to the accident on Rokkenjima, a large amount of undiscovered books of even greater value had been lost."
"...After that discovery, the names of Rokkenjima and the Ushiromiya Library were certain to remain in our memories for all time."
......Our memories.
 That "our" probably meant the occult neck of the woods with the same hobby as Kinzo.
This incident caused the name of Rokkenjima to develop an important meaning within the world of the occult.
Certainly, there had been a lot of reporting about the accident on Rokkenjima, but it hadn\'t been on an international level.
However, this incident circled the globe,
 taking the image of Rokkenjima as a small island in the Izu archipelago, and painting it over as a demonic island with a mixture of riddles, suspicion, mystery and the occult.
In other words, until Kinzo\'s library was leaked to the public by Eva,
 Rokkenjima had been nothing more than a nameless island that no one thought twice about,
 ......and it definitely hadn\'t been a witch\'s island.
However, when knowledge of the Ushiromiya Library spread across the world, Rokkenjima\'s image immediately took on an occult twist.
"And so, what happened next was that matter with the message bottle.
 It is what turned that island into a witch\'s island.
 A nameless island in the Izu archipelago began to transition into an occult island, and then into the island of the mysterious witch, {f:5:Beatrice}."
"You could say that, lacking either the Ushiromiya Library or the message bottle, the Rokkenjima Witch Legend would never have been established."
"......A message bottle."
"Yes.
 A form of communication to an unspecified target by throwing an empty bottle with a letter sealed inside into the sea."
"It is famous as a way of sending an SOS from a deserted island, but because of the influence of famous foreign detective novels,
 it has also become known as a method of confessing the truth after one\'s own death, like a time‐delayed will.
 The Rokkenjima message bottle was certainly the latter."
"......This is the thing everyone says a fisherman on a nearby island picked up?"
"Correct.
 We learned that a young fisherman on Shikinejima had picked up a wine bottle with a letter in it.
 This young fisherman happened to keep it out of curiosity.
 It was only later, when Rokkenjima fell under the global spotlight due to the Ushiromiya Library, that he announced his discovery."
"Is there any chance that it was a fabrication made by the fisherman?"
"Of course, we weren\'t able to deny that possibility.
 The notebook pages in the wine bottle had the signature of a certain member of the Ushiromiya family.
 A girl named Ushiromiya Maria.
 However, from the handwriting found on her former belongings, it was ascertained that the handwriting in the letter belonged to a different person."
".........A different person\'s handwriting......?"
"Correct.
 At the very least, I believe there can be no doubt that it was written by a person more skilled at writing and of a greater age than her.
 There was a very high likelihood that it had been written by someone else using her name.
 Therefore, at that point in time, the contents of those notebook pages were thought to have very low credibility."
However.
Later on, a sensation was created when it came to light that on the day of the accident, a similar message bottle had been recovered from the surrounding ocean by the police in their search for evidence.
"It seems that, due to evidence from the surrounding area and the intact state of the bottle\'s seal, the police had decided that its likelihood of being a hoax was low,
 and that it had been cast out no earlier than a few days before the accident.
 And the handwriting for both matched.
 This caused the credibility of the notebook pages discovered by the fisherman to rise."
"As for the message bottles\' contents, magazines and the like seem to have been reporting on that repeatedly, but do you require an explanation all the same?"
"......No.
 I know about it, more or less."
Several sheets of notebook paper had been stuffed into each of the two wine bottles.
They were extensive accounts, written in a diary‐like fashion by some unknown person calling themselves Ushiromiya Maria, of the events of the day of the accident and the day before.
And it was these that prompted the beginning of the "Witch Legend Serial Murder Case",
 and "the mystery of the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}".
"These bizarre diary‐style accounts describe the Ushiromiya family members, pinned to the island by the typhoon,
 becoming caught up in a ritual for the resurrection of a witch, and being killed one after another in inexplicable ways."
"And at the end, the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice} revives, and swallows everything up into the Golden Land.
 ......They were written almost as though {i:this} was the complete picture of the events of that day."
"Additionally, the state of things on the island at the time is also depicted in immense detail,
 and former servants who once worked for the Ushiromiya family have given testimony that the pages were definitely written by a person who knew the inside details of the island."
"......So, those strange fantasy novels, the occult boom that started with the Ushiromiya Library,
 and the fact that the truth remains shrouded in darkness—the combination of all three of these factors is what created the legend of the Rokkenjima witch...?"
"Correct.
 Already more than ten years have passed since the incident, and it still attracts the interest of occult enthusiasts across the world."
"No, in fact, you could say that it has become {i:increasingly} deified as time has passed.
 There are still many enthusiasts who try to land secretly on the shores of Rokkenjima even though that has been prohibited."
"......Could there be another message bottle that has still not been discovered?
 And what really happened on that island that day?
 There is still much to discuss, oh yes."
As though he had finally remembered that he had been going on and on for some time, the man took a sip of water.
......His potage was now cold, but it seemed that the man\'s hunger had already been blown away.
"......If I remember correctly, I heard that the fisherman\'s pages and the police\'s pages had completely different contents."
"Correct.
 Due to that, the appeal of the Rokkenjima mystery increased even further.
 Inside each of the two bottles was a diary‐style account describing the events of the day of the accident and the day before.
 However, while they both cover the same two‐day period, the contents are completely different."
"As though one is true and one is untrue.
 Or perhaps both are untrue.
 ...However, the beginning and the end alone {i:do} match in both."
"At the beginning, the 18 people including the relatives are sealed up on the island by the typhoon.
 And at the end, everyone dies, the Golden Witch revives, and everything is swallowed up into the Golden Land."
The contents of both message bottles described the events of the two days of the accident.
But the details were completely different.
Both diaries outline a serial murder following the epitaph of the witch, but the order of the sacrifices, the manners of their deaths, and even the "tale" of the two days are different.
However, both depict the same ultimate conclusion: everyone dies and the witch revives.
"Since the only survivor, {nobr:Mrs. Ushiromiya} Eva, remained silent about what happened on that island,
 the events of that entire two‐day period are shrouded in darkness."
"These two diaries presented not just one, but {i:two} theories to wipe away that darkness.
 You could explain those two days with either diary.
 However, we don\'t know which is correct, or even if there is anything correct contained within them."
{m:-5:―}―Schrödinger\'s...cat box.
If it isn\'t denied, even fiction can be truth.
Through the media, these notebook pages had of course been shown to Eva as well, but in the end, she never broke her silence......
"Who sent the message bottles...and why?"
"Do you remember the magazine that put together a special issue for the crime\'s tenth anniversary? They covered that question in extensive detail.
 It seems that their theory is the one that garners the most support today."
"But it is rather dull.
 ......What happened on that island, on that day?
 Considering this question is the real thrill of the Witch Hunt."
"Witch Hunt...?"
"Yes, the Rokkenjima Witch Hunt—it\'s the name of a group of enthusiasts endeavoring to explain the truth of that crime from an occult perspective."
"From the Ushiromiya Library to the mysterious two‐day period, the legend of the Golden Witch and more, discussion of the mysteries that surround Rokkenjima is flourishing even today among enthusiasts."
"For the ten‐year anniversary, an international convention was held in New York.
 I was there participating as well, representing Japan!
 I was able to have a variety of interactions with zealous overseas Witch Hunters."
"Witches are a very popular category overseas.
 The age span of the participants was truly vast, stretching from elementary schoolers at the bottom, all the way to famous cultural figures at the top!
 Even in Japan, in recent years, we\'ve finally—"
......You probably don\'t need any more explanation, but he is one of the most famous Rokkenjima Witch Hunters in Japan.
After that, he just kept continuing on excitedly all by himself, even though I\'d never asked.
As I swirled the thin film on my potage with my spoon, I shrugged my shoulders and sighed.
......Maybe it really had been a waste of time to research about the message bottle.
No, if there was one thing I\'d gotten out of this, it was the knowledge that those pages, supposedly written by Maria onee‐chan,
 had actually been written by a different person faking her name.
And that person had taken it upon themselves to write an occult story, put it into a bottle as though it was the truth, and throw it into the sea.
...This raised questions for me.
Why did they go to all the trouble of writing so much in order to prepare a suspicious letter like that?
With a message bottle, there would be no guarantee that it would ever pass into anyone\'s hands.
If their luck had been bad, it could have sunk in the ocean and never been seen by anyone.
And even if someone were to pick it up, they might have thrown it away without even thinking twice about it.
......Why did they entrust their confession of the truth to the sea in such an uncertain method?
And why did they write up multiple different tales?
If there had been one message bottle, claiming that its story was the truth would be reckless, but not impossible.
However, because there were two, that made both of them doubtful.
If someone was plotting to make out those two mysterious days to be the work of a witch, that was really superfluous.
And because there were two, it suggested that an undiscovered third one, or possibly even more, might exist.
......In other words, the two having differing contents was making it even harder to take either of them at face value.
But despite their differences, the contents of the two matched in that both tales told of a witch.
Does that mean that this is what the writer wanted to tell us.........?
......I can only imagine that this was a crime committed for pleasure, by someone who wanted to create an illusion of a witch.
But 17 people excluding Aunt Eva lost their lives, and a vast inheritance—and maybe even ten tons of gold—changed hands behind the scenes.
It just doesn\'t make sense for the confession coming at the end of all that to be this fantasy about a witch.
I don\'t need to hear the magazines\' reasoning to find it extremely doubtful whether the message bottles really are "diaries".
......After all, the amount of writing was massive.
 It\'s hard to imagine that someone actually caught up in the middle of a serial murder like that would have been able to calmly write it down.
In that case, it\'s probably more realistic to say that these diaries were written slowly over a long period of time before the day prior to the accident.
In which case, .........would that mean that everything on Rokkenjima was {i:premeditated}, and prepared for over a long stretch of time...?
...The fact that Aunt Eva left this world without saying anything is...detestable.
She definitely told me on her deathbed.
She definitely said that her reason for not telling me the truth was because it was the best way of harassing me.
......Ah, by now I\'m painfully aware of it.
Of all the things Aunt Eva did to harass me, this was probably the last and the greatest.
...............But now that I start to think of it this way, it\'s pretty doubtful that Aunt Eva is the true culprit.
Of course, this isn\'t because the handwriting in the message bottle differs from Aunt Eva\'s, or anything like that.
......It\'s because in both discovered tales, Aunt Eva was included among the victims.
If the writer of these diaries was the culprit...
......then maybe Aunt Eva had also been one of the targets to be killed.
Aunt Eva had survived because {i:something had gone wrong}.
.........Because of my hate for Aunt Eva, I had believed until now that she {i:had} to be the culprit.
But the existence of the message bottles...
......was making me suspect that the mastermind was a far more profound and unknown person than her...
I looked at the clock.
 I\'d asked everything I wanted to.
{n}Time to go.
As he continued to speak fervently, I volunteered that I wanted to bring this discussion to a close.
He seemed to be aware that he had gotten excited and talked too much, so he accepted this without resistance.
"Thank you very much for today.
 I\'m glad to have had the opportunity to hear your valuable stories."
"......No, no.
 It was truly a joy to be able to welcome a young lady as a new friend of the Witch Hunt.
 I have many precious documents that I couldn\'t show you because of this change to a different venue.
 I should be glad to show you them at the next chance we get."
"Thank you, Professor.
 ............Could I ask you one more thing?"
"Yes, what is it?"
"Professor, what made you interested in witches...no, in occultism and demonology?"
"I must admit, being asked that is somewhat embarrassing.
 ......Simply put, I used to think that if only I could use magic, I wouldn\'t be beaten by the big school bully,
 and this childhood fantasy of mine went straight on to become my life work.
 Because the primitive yearning for power unknown is as universal today as it ever was in the past."
"Professor, if you could, would you want to become a witch?
 Do you still dream of being able to use magic at will?"
"But of course.
 Even though, at this age, I understand rationally that there is no such thing,
 I find myself unable to forget my child‐like dreams of flying in the sky and turning scrap iron into gold.
 ......Hahaha, if you would, please keep this a secret from my students."
".........If I told you that actually, I {i:am} a witch,
 would you believe it?"
"Hahahaha.
 It\'s my pet theory from my few experiences with women that they are {i:all} witches."
Ange snorted at the old professor, who was undoubtedly an earnest scholar, and unlikely had any experiences with women at all.
"Oh, yes.
 And one final question.
 ......Professor, have you seen the original message bottle itself?"
"I have indeed."
"In that case, are you also well acquainted with the handwriting?"
"Of course.
 I am not a specialist in that area, but at least when it comes to the handwriting of the message bottle, I am proud to be the most knowledgeable in Japan."
At that point, Ange set a book on the table with a thud.
"............And this is?
 I have never seen it before."
He prided himself on his thorough knowledge of all literature related to Rokkenjima, but he looked bewildered at this binding that he had never laid eyes on before...
Ignoring him, Ange silently flipped through the pages, opened to one of them, and showed him.
On that page was a handwritten paragraph beginning with "To my dear witch apprentice".
......And at the end, there was a signature in {ruby:katakana:capitals} that said "{f:5:Beatrice}".
"Wh‐what is............"
The instant he glanced at it,
 his face went pale.
 ......She knew the answer before asking, but Ange asked it aloud anyway.
"Does the handwriting in the paragraph on this page match the handwriting in the message bottles...?"
"W‐well, uhh...... I wou—I would have to take this home and investigate it in detail to, to...
 ...P‐pardon me for asking, but what in the world is this book?!
 Where did you...?!"
The man stretched out his hand, but Ange nimbly pulled it out of his reach.
{n}...As though telling him not to touch it with his filthy hands.
"Thank you.
 Just that reaction is all I need.
 Thank you very much for today.
 ......Here is the reward I promised."
As she stood up, clutching Maria\'s diary,
 Ange casually tossed a wad of ten‐thousand‐yen notes wrapped with a band of paper onto the table.
As she turned her back to him and made to leave, the man raised his voice as though clinging to her.
But Ange never stopped walking.
"I, I beg you...!!
 What in the world is that book?!
 I don\'t need a reward, just, please, show me that book...!!"
"......Both you and I are fellow Witch Hunters, but it looks like we aren\'t pursuing it at the same level.
 You\'re entertaining yourself with the outside of the cat box.
 And what I want to know about is the inside of the cat box."
"......And this book is the key to opening it.
 It\'s too good for you.
 Well then.
 <Goodbye, gentlemen>. <Have a nice day>."
"P‐please, wait...!!
 {i:Sumadera‐san}...!!!"
His voice didn\'t reach her.
 She had already joined up with Amakusa and gone into the car......
"Did you find anything?"
"......At the very end.
 I was right.
 The one who wrote the message bottles was {f:5:Beatrice} herself."
"Now that\'s <cool>.
 So it\'s settled, is it, the witch exists?"
"Who knows.
 .........Mind if I sleep?
 I\'ll bet that prattling professor gets lost in his own little world in lectures and has kids falling asleep left, right, and center."
"Sure, sure, take a rest."
".........Still, that went really well.
 That guy believed I was Sumadera until the very end."
The Sumadera family had cast out a net beforehand over any people Ange might try to contact.
They had offered a reward for anyone who could detain Ushiromiya Ange if she appeared.
Ange had foreseen that and {i:snatched it away}.
She had called herself Sumadera, and after skillfully tricking the man by saying her own subordinates would set up an ambush, she had taken him with her.
So when the Sumadera pursuers reached the professor\'s house, there was no longer anyone there...
"According to the family, a young man and woman calling themselves Sumadera visited this morning,
 took the professor out with them, and still have not returned.
 ......There is a chance we were outmaneuvered."
"..................What a bad child that Ange‐chan is.
 ......I wonder if that craftiness is from Nee‐san\'s blood.
 ......To think that she would casually take on the name Sumadera after saying so often how she\'d hate to call herself that..."
"............Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho.
 ...The professor should be returning soon.
 When he does, we must serve him some tea..."
"...Ye‐...yes.
 Understood."
"..................I wonder if she thinks she\'s leading me around by the nose.
 She is such a naughty child.
 ............*giggle*giggle*, ......hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho{0}ho{0}ho{0}ho{0}hohoho!!"
With a demonic look on her face, Kasumi violently stamped her heel.
I\'ll teach you.
{n}About my Magic of Origins.
No, I taught you before, right?
{n}And you used to be able to use it.
{n}Did you forget......?
You were also a witch apprentice, Ange, with your name entered into Mariage Sorcière, weren\'t you......?
".........I also...joined in as one of the witches, didn\'t I..."
I closed Maria onee‐chan\'s diary and flopped down on a very high‐class‐looking bed.
Since I had fallen into a pretty deep sleep in the car, it was taking longer than usual for drowsiness to set in, and I had been spending a long time reading the diary as I waited for that.
This was a super‐expensive hotel in the city.
 ...Expensive hotels that are often used by the rich and famous have an abnormally strong duty of confidentiality, out of concern for their various circumstances.
This made it a very convenient place for Ange, on the run from her pursuers.
The idea that runaways spend their nights hiding in cheap hotels is a commoner\'s way of thinking.
......For Ange, who possessed all the wealth of the Ushiromiya family, the life of a runaway was truly comfortable.
Of course, as a man, Amakusa was in a separate room despite being her guard.
 Ange was using the bedroom of the suite, while Amakusa was lying down on the living room sofa.
...Amakusa said something about how the sofa here was more comfortable than his own bed recently.
 Poor guy.
When I looked at the clock,
 ......I saw that it was almost 2 a.m.
Still not getting sleepy.
 ............I sighed deeply.
Even though there was no wind, I suddenly got the feeling that Maria onee‐chan\'s diary had fluttered open.
......Then, Onee‐chan appeared.
{n}Her form was no longer the normal one that I knew.
...She was wearing the dress that {f:5:Beatrice} had given her after acknowledging her status as a witch.
".........If you don\'t get some sleep, it\'ll be tough tomorrow, you know?"
"If I were a witch too,
 ......I could use magic, right?"
"...Yep.
 Could.
 I taught you, didn\'t I?
 How to use it.
 ......And you were able to, once."
"...............I remember.
 ......I\'ve started wanting to."
"Did you get lonely...?"
"..................Not really.
 ......It\'s not like having a different pillow every night is that tough."
".........The first step to magic can be loneliness, or boredom,
 or any reason as small as that."
"Even killing time until you get tired?"
"Yep.
 I\'m happy that you remembered about magic one more time."
..............................
......It\'s been quite a long time since I last used magic.
At one point, with Maria onee‐chan\'s introduction, ......I touched a corner of it, and opened the door a tiny bit.
So, ......I should still remember that sensation.
"......Right now, your magical power has declined significantly, Ange.
 ...If you don\'t stick to the basics, it\'ll be hard, okay?"
"Sure.
 ...............Checking all directions.
 Quiet space secured."
"What about Amakusa‐san?"
".....................
 ............He\'s sleeping."
After opening the door to the living room a crack, I could see the blanket caterpillar on the sofa roll over in its sleep.
"......With your magical power as weak as it is now, the anti‐magic power is affecting you too much.
 ......Not just the sight of people,
 but voices, sounds, and even the presence of people will get in the way of your magic."
"......Sever those completely.
 Like how ancient magicians shut themselves up in ateliers to preserve their isolation."
"I remember.
 ......The very existence of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s blocks magic.
 ...Therefore, the very act of showing magic to humans is the sign of a high‐level witch..."
Obtain a quiet space for yourself alone.
{n}......That should cover it for the preparation of a space to use magic.
".........Next is the vessel.
 ...Right now, that\'s as important for you as a bicycle having training wheels—no, a chain."
"...........................
 .........These would...
.........obviously...
not be possible, right..."
Ange rubbed her own head.
...She was wearing hair accessories with pink beads attached.
They felt a little childish for Ange\'s style, but she had never taken them off for a single day.
"..................Yeah.
 .........That really is impossible for you right now, Ange.
 ...If you had practiced every single day since then,
 you might have become able to summon him by now."
"........................
 If I were to start training now, how long would it take?"
".........It\'s said that a year of witch training as a child is worth ten in old age.
 You\'ll need a strong resolution."
"You mean like Ushiromiya Kinzo?
 ............So private tutoring from a young age is important for piano, violin and magic."
"Your power has weakened since the time you were first able to use magic, Ange.
 ...Don\'t overdo it, and stick to the basics."
After regretfully rubbing the things on my head one more time, I let it go.
Then I started fishing through my knapsack.
{n}...Looking for anything that might make a good vessel.
"? ...Ah......"
"............Wouldn\'t this be perfect for a vessel?"
"It\'s been so long since I saw that.
 ......Yeah.
 I think even as you are now, you should be able to summon that one.
 ...And she has no master now.
 It should be possible for you to become her new master, Ange."
Among the things that looked like good vessels, I took the one I thought might possess the strongest magical power,
 and set it on the side table near the bed with a clunk.
It was......a shady‐looking stake‐shaped weapon embellished with an occult design.
A stake of the "Seven Stakes of Purgatory", used by witches to offer sacrifices.
In the course of their search for evidence, the police had collected a large amount of junk.
{n}After the investigation had finished, this had been faithfully returned to the Ushiromiya family.
......I found something there that I had seen in the illustrations in Maria\'s diary, and took it home with me.
".........Originally, the Seven Stakes of Purgatory were a seven‐piece set.
 ......Poor girl.
 She\'s the only one left now."
Onee‐chan smiled, looking lonely...
I pulled another book out of the knapsack.
......This was another old‐fashioned, blatantly occult‐related book.
But this, too, was a book to be written in.
{n}It was one of Maria onee‐chan\'s elaborate notebooks.
This one was not a diary.
{n}......It was a grimoire, which she had written as a witch.
The Seven Stakes of Purgatory were {f:5:Beatrice}\'s furniture.
{n}Created by her and employed only for her sake.
But since {f:5:Beatrice} was a witch of Mariage Sorcière, they could also be employed by {f:5:Maria}, who was a witch of the same alliance.
For that reason, the method of summoning the Seven Stakes of Purgatory and how to handle them was written about in great detail in Maria onee‐chan\'s grimoire...
And...
as another person with her name in the same alliance, I was also permitted to employ them.
".........This stake is...
.........which of the Seven Sisters?"
"Their characteristics are well described in my grimoire.
 ...The Sisters of the Seven Stakes really hate it when you get their names wrong.
 Remember their names well before summoning them."
A colossal number of pages telling of the Seven Stakes of Purgatory.
{n}...They described the seven sisters in great detail.
......Yes.
 Quite a long time ago, I think I learned these pages almost by heart.
The more I read it, the more I start to remember...
By the illustrations and identifying characteristics written in the grimoire, I could tell that the stake in my hand was the "Stake of Mammon".
In the past, I had been summoning them without any vessel, because I never had any stakes.
......So this was the first time I had gotten a good look at any of the seven stakes, not just Mammon.
"Mammon.
 The fifth sister.
 Presides over the deadly sin of greed.
 ......What an incredible kid."
"Greed also controls aspirations, the desire to improve oneself, and the strength to live.
 It definitely doesn\'t mean only bad things.
 ......She\'s rude, but she\'s a girl who tries really hard."
"......Yes.
 You could say that without desire, there\'s no reason to live."
For a while, I heightened my concentration and digested the information that was written about Mammon.
......The more the summoner knows about the target that\'s being summoned, the better...
 Knowledge brings about magical power.
......I began to fill my head with knowledge about Mammon, and build the necessary amount of magic power for the summoning.
"......Grimoires are a little bit interesting, aren\'t they.
 Maybe much more interesting than reading some crappy novel.
 ......And it really takes me back, somehow."
"For a grimoire, it is demanded not only that you understand the text, but that you expand the world from the gaps between the lines,
 and give birth to a world from the illustrations, creating things in various ways."
"......The power to create.
 For someone who has that, such as you, a grimoire should be more interesting than any book.
 ...I\'ve always known that you\'d be able to understand that."
"............I think that should be enough knowledge of Mammon for now.
 .........Yeah.
 It\'s come back to me, more or less.
 ...I\'ll give it a try."
"Take care.
 ......In preparation for the worst, use my talisman.
 ......You are not protected by the treaty of the alliance now.
 That Mammon can be a little aggressive at times.
 ...She {i:may still bear a grudge}.
 Be careful."
"Yeah.
 ...I think I\'ll wear it."
The Seven Stakes of Purgatory, as furniture for sacrificial rituals, are treated as beings inferior even to weapons.
But that is only when it comes to demons.
{n}To {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s, even furniture is something to be feared.
I fished through the knapsack again,
 took out a bracelet charm with a scorpion medal that I had gotten from Maria onee‐chan long ago, and put it on my arm.
......I had no need for something like this in the past.
{n}But I need insurance...
".........It\'s alright.
 That is still endowed with a sufficient amount of magic defense.
 As long as you have it on, I\'m certain you\'ll be fine."
Maria onee‐chan\'s magical power, in particular the power she could put into charms, was enough to earn even {f:5:Beatrice}\'s admiration.
......While it would only have looked like something cheap to a human who couldn\'t understand magic,
 its magical worth was incalculable.
"..............................
 Come, arise.
 Forgive the sin.
 ...One of the Seven Stakes of Purgatory.
 Mammon the Covetous."
.....................
I concentrated my mind.
{n}I made the anti‐magic toxin that filled my body zero.
Imagine an vast, untainted space.
{n}......Doubts and common sense all resist magic.
Make the resistance zero, and erase the burden towards magical power......
..............................
{n}......Inside my head was the image of a vast space.
It was a nighttime world where I floated in the air and the neon stars on the ground sparkled.
A world where the stars that should have covered the heavens were drowned out by the light from below, and the stars covered the ground instead.
In the world of a vast night sky with no obstructions,
 ......I imagined the wind blowing through freely.
Just then,
 ......in that room where no wind could blow,
 ......the free nighttime wind whirled around.
That long‐forgotten sensation raced through my entire body.
{n}............The unique feeling of exultation felt when using magic.
From Mammon\'s stake, held out in my hand, I gradually began to feel a pale light.
The cyclone gyred around the stake.
{n}......The hefty stake floated a bit into the air.
"............Wonderful.
 ...Looks like the gap in your training hasn\'t stolen your talent."
"......Come, arise.
 Forgive the sin.
 ...One of the Seven Stakes of Purgatory, Mammon the Covetous.
 ......Show yourself to me......"
I slowly raised my hand, and as I brought it higher than my head,
 almost as though it was being sucked upwards by it, the Stake of Mammon likewise floated high up into the air, ......and gradually began to shake.
Its shaking grew faster and faster,
 .........and then it burst.
With a speed faster than the eye could follow, it flew around, violently rebounding off the walls of the room.
{n}......The terrible sound of it jumping from place to place bore down upon me, trying to make me flinch.
......But I mustn\'t lose my mental concentration.
Then, the stake, which had been flying around at an incredible speed, finally restrained itself and faced me.
......It was in the air, just a few centimeters away from my forehead...held back by the defensive barrier created by the scorpion charm.
It was trying to break the defensive barrier, eating into it with incredible power, but Maria onee‐chan\'s barrier wouldn\'t be broken so easily.
"...............No good...
 I can\'t bite through it......"
The stake muttered hatefully.
......You could probably say that I had been saved thanks to the scorpion charm.
Without that, my way of killing time until I got sleepy would have become a way to kill time for all eternity.
When Mammon\'s stake realized that it was unable to gouge me, it gave up gracefully, and changed its form from that of a stake into that of a person.
In her usual shameless outfit which I would never be seen walking outside in.
{n}Although you could say it suited her, in a demonic sort of way.
".................Ange‐sama, is that you?
 ............That\'s some pretty shabby magical power.
 ...Are you really Ange‐sama?"
"It\'s been a long time, Mammon.
 ......Have you been well?"
"...........................
 ...And here I was convinced that furniture which has already fulfilled its function would just be left to rust away in a closet.
 ......So, what kind of sideshow is this?
 You aren\'t going to say that you\'re my owner, are you, Ange‐sama...?"
".........Yep.
 Ange is your master."
"Lady {f:5:Maria}...
 .........I am ashamed.
 Was that barrier just now yours?"
"Yeah.
 I thought that as Ange is now, she might just fall to you.
 I lent her a talisman."
".....................
 ......If I am told by Lady {f:5:Maria} that Ange‐sama is my master, I can hardly refuse.
 .........Ange‐sama, I am yours to command.
 Given that my assistance is required...is it a new ritual?
 New sacrifices...?"
"Of course, that\'s only if you\'re willing to handle me yourself and get your own hands dirty."
".........That role isn\'t one I\'m looking for anymore.
 .........All you have to do is just talk with me, like you used to."
"...................................."
"........................"
".........Heheh.
 ...Yes, if that is what you desire.
 Furniture is furniture because it is used.
 It is an honor just to be summoned.
 Ange‐sama."
Mammon had a slightly complicated smile on her face.
......She had accepted Ange as her new master because Maria had told her to,
 but it looked like she hadn\'t gotten over her discontent at working for Ange with her frail magical power.
Or perhaps she had some other reason for hating Ange,
 ......but for now, it seemed that she couldn\'t disobey Ange despite her discontent.
".........So?
 What should I do?"
"I don\'t know.
 .........Just be lively.
 Like old times."
"With all due respect,
 I think this liveliness you speak of is probably the bustle from when we sisters are together.
 It may be difficult by myself.
 ......Perhaps it slipped your mind?"
"......Yeah.
 The Seven Sisters {i:were} really lively when they got together.
 ......But with your magical power now, I think summoning Mammon is the best we can hope for.
 The stakes for the other six have been lost."
"My apologies, Lady {f:5:Maria},
 but I believe it may not be impossible to summon the Seven Sisters via my own stake.
 ......If Ange‐sama is to employ me, I would hope that she has at least that much power......?"
Mammon giggled.
......Apparently, she wanted me to summon the other sisters without a vessel.
I see.
 Unable to be satisfied with being summoned alone, she asks for the other sisters to be summoned as well.
...I get it—greed.
 Yes, she was like this back then, wasn\'t she......
.........Bliss for furniture is when it is used.
 Being used, no matter how roughly, is furniture\'s joy.
Not only that, but no matter how much care you might treat them with, if they are not given a job, that would give them the greatest anguish.
Mammon spoke as though to provoke me, but what she wanted was for me to summon the other sisters somehow and rescue them from the world of nothingness.
.........Why not just be honest and ask me to, then?
{n}Demons really are difficult.
".........Ange.
 Don\'t overdo it.
 Just being able to summon Mammon is more than enough rehabilitation."
"Oh, I\'m rehabilitated after just one?
 I\'m just killing time anyway.
 .........Alright, Mammon.
 In for a penny, in for a pound.
 I\'ll call as many as I can for you."
"Really......?!
 Niiice, Ange‐sama!
 Alright, go go go!"
Even though she had said it, it seemed that Mammon hadn\'t really expected to be able to ask this of Ange.
She hopped around, badgering Ange to summon the other sisters.
......The consumption of physical and magical power used to call Mammon alone was considerable.
{n}...It will probably be pretty tough to do six more.
......I\'m in awe of the magical power of those who reach the level of being called witches, because those people can summon these sisters with no more than a snap of their fingers.
"Mammon, don\'t make Ange overdo it.
 She still isn\'t back to form yet..."
"Whaaaa?!
 Ange‐sama said that she\'d summon everyone!"
Actually, I only said that I\'d call as many as I could.
{n}......Guess this is greed.
"Don\'t overdo it, Ange.
 You should rest for today.
 You\'re tired enough."
"It\'s alright.
 I\'m just killing time anyway.
 Let me get tired enough so I can just keel over."
......This time there\'s no vessel.
I\'ll have to strengthen the image solely from the knowledge in the grimoire, and manifest them just with that.
I held my hands out into the air, replaying in my head the sensation from when I had summoned Mammon......
Come on, I know all of the Seven Sisters personally.
 ......Remember, in the past,
 ......the times I talked with them.........
Once again, ......the power of magic began to fill me up.
 It radiated as a faint, and yet distinct pale blue light from both of my hands......
"Ange‐sama...!
 Keep it up, keep it up, do your best...!
 Hey, Lady {f:5:Maria}.
 Ange‐sama will definitely summon everyone, right?
 The Seven Sisters will get to be reunited again, right?
 Right?!"
"Yeah, I\'m sure of it.
 ......But there\'s no guarantee that it will happen tonight."
"No, Ange‐sama can do it, I just know it...!
 Please, Ange‐sama...!
 Start from the youngest sister, Asmo...!"
".........Asmodeus.
 The seventh sister.
 ...............OK.
 I\'ll call them in order starting from the youngest."
A strand of hot sweat dripped down from my forehead.
{n}......This really does put one hell of a strain on you.
The pale light in this space......began to form into the vague outline of a girl...
".........Come, arise.
 One of the Seven Stakes of Purgatory, Asmodeus the Lustful..."
There was no vessel.
 ......However, with the strong core conviction that she definitely did exist there, ......I began to crystallize her form...
Her outline became distinct, .........and the form of the youngest of the Seven Sisters, Asmodeus, was finally created.
"Asmodeus the Lustful, right here......
 .........Where is this?
 Am I alive......?"
"Asmo...!!
 I\'m so glad!!"
"Mammon nee‐san!
 ......Where in the world is this?
 Who summoned me?"
"Ange‐sama did...!
 Ange‐sama said she\'d revive all of us...!"
...No I didn\'t.
"Ange‐sama, thank you!
 Next is Belzie...!!
 Do Belzie please...!"
"......Beelzebub.
 The sixth sister.
 ......Beelzebub the Gluttonous.
 Come, arise..."
If I just keep on like this, ......I wonder how many I can summon.
{n}If I lose my concentration,
 ...that\'ll probably be it.
The pale light made an outline, .........and formed into Beelzebub.
"Beelzebub the Gluttonous, right here......"
"Belzieee!!"
"Ange‐sama, awesome, awesome!!"
Mammon and Asmodeus jumped on Beelzebub, celebrating their reunion.
......Summoning three people at once.
 ...My head was throbbing.
Without resting, I summoned the next one.
"......Come, arise.
 One of the Seven Stakes of Purgatory, Belphegor the Slothful..."
"Belphegor the Slothful, right here.
 .........My, ...to think that I would still be needed..."
"Belphe‐neeeeee!
 I\'m huuungryyy!
 I mean—I\'m so glad to see you again!!"
"To think that the Seven Sisters would be able to meet again...
 Ange‐sama, we are truly thankful!"
"Keep it up and do Satan‐nee next!
 And Levia‐nee and Luci‐nee...!!"
".........Yes,
 ...I know.
 ......So please, try not to be so loud.
 ......Doing four people at the same time...
...is pretty...tough..."
"Ange, don\'t push yourself any more than this.
 You did a great job summoning four of them after such a long time."
"...Stop it, Mammon.
 Our summoning is placing a heavy strain on Ange‐sama right now.
 Ange‐sama, I beg you not to push yourself too hard..."
"No way!
 Ange‐sama promised!
 She said she\'d play with all of us again!"
...No I d—...
"Didn\'t you!
 Ange‐sama!
 You said we\'d all meet again!
 You promised we\'d be able to see each other again soon!"
"........................"
".........You\'re right, .........I did.
 ......I didn\'t promise anything about when "soon" would be, ......but I certainly did...promise."
"So keep that promise!
 If you don\'t, I\'ll never forgive you for forgetting it until today...!"
"..................
 ......Come, arise.
 One of the Seven Stakes of Purgatory, Satan the Wrathful..."
My mind was starting to get hazy...
 ......But...I\'ll call.
I may have forgotten those days.
{n}I may not have thought of them as anything but sadness and loneliness.
......But certainly...the short time I spent with these girls...
...was, without a doubt, fun.
"Satan the Wrathful, right here.
 ............What the hell are you people doing!!
 Do you realize how much it\'s burdening Ange‐sama just for us to have an idle chat?!"
Satan, who had apparently figured out the situation immediately after being summoned, yelled out in a loud voice, telling her sisters off.
......That loud voice made my consciousness fade again.
"We are furniture that has been permitted rest by {f:5:Beatrice}, furniture that has finished its duty!
 Not content to be graced with the opportunity to once again be of some use, you are putting a burden on your new master—this is a DISGRACE to furniture!!
 Erase yourselves RIGHT NOW!!"
"Yes, it\'s like Satan‐nee says.
 I\'ll erase myself.
 And you all vanish too.
 In this moment, that is the best way for us to be of use to Ange‐sama."
"No way.
 Not until everyone gets summoned!"
"No way for me too!
 I\'m hungryyy!
 I mean—we only just met up again, I don\'t wanna go back already!"
"Don\'t be so selfish!!
 Come on, hurry up and vanish!!
 Come on, Asmo!
 Disappear right now!!"
"Waaaah, Satan‐nee\'s bullying me...!
 It\'s always me first because I\'m the youngest, it\'s not faaair!"
".........Ahh, they really are lively.
 ......They never make you.........bored......"
"That\'s enough.
 You\'ve surpassed your limits for now, Ange."
"......You\'re...
...right...
 ........................"
This situation where I had summoned five of them, and they were messing around as they pleased,
 was placing far too heavy a load on me currently, with my meager magic power......
......This is...............it......
As my consciousness grew distant, I collapsed onto the bed.
......Have beds always felt this soft......?
{n}........................
It seemed that the sisters were still squabbling together as much as they liked.
......For a way to kill time until drowsiness comes to get me,
 ......this will do............
Feeling something warm and nostalgic in the sisters\' liveliness, I sank into a world of deep sleep.........
At the entrance to my dream world, I felt Maria onee‐chan,
 ......and Sakutarou, waiting to receive me.
"...............
 You worked hard.
 ......And...good job."
‘Uryu.
 ...Welcome back, Ange...’
......Welcome back, huh...
 Then I should respond like this.
............Glad to be home.........That\'s right.
 Just once in the past, I underwent training in order to step into the world of witches.
I accepted that the only power which could save me from my sad, painful days at Saint Lucia Academy...
was the thing called magic, and I received Maria onee‐chan\'s introduction to the basics......
"...............Imagine...a vast space......
 ......The scenery when I looked down at the base of the mountain, from the rest stop at the peak......"
".........Like this......?"
I projected that scene from a memory into my mental world.
......Normal little girls get over their admiration of magical girls during elementary school.
Training in absolute earnest to use magic at this age......I have to say, I\'m embarrassed of myself.
But even that embarrassed emotion felt pleasant to me now.
Right now, I was learning mental concentration from Maria onee‐chan in order to use magic.
But it wasn\'t going very well.
 ......It was about as hopeless as going to a person who can wiggle their ears,
 asking them how they do it, and expecting to learn anything at all from their demonstration...
It seems that you need to imagine a vast space to gain the mental concentration for using magic.
So I remembered the time from my younger days when my family had gone on a small vacation,
 and I had looked down towards the base of a mountain from a viewing platform at a rest stop on the peak—and I tried painting this scene in my mental world.
"No, still far too small.
 Imagine a much, much wider space.
 And create your very own mental world."
"Your image is still far too foggy.
 There\'s no temperature in the air, and there\'s no wind.
 No smells either.
 The world is still very thin.
 ......You can leave those for later, so for now, just imagine a wider space."
‘Uryu.
 ......Why do you have to imagine a wide space?’
"From the time they\'re born, {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s have inside them a toxin that blocks magic.
 If you don\'t purge yourself of that toxin, you can\'t use magic well.
 ...One effective method of achieving this is to imagine a vast space."
".........Just now, I thought of the world as seen from the window of an airplane, but that didn\'t work either.
 ......A world more vast than that,
 ......I can\'t even imagine."
‘In that case, Maria, why don\'t you just tell Ange about the vast world you have...!
 Won\'t that make it easy for Ange to imagine as well?
 Uryu!’
"......That\'s right.
 And I\'m interested in the kind of world you imagine when you use magic, too, Onee‐chan.
 ...I\'ll use it as a reference as well."
"Uu, won\'t work.
 The mental world must be vast and isolated.
 A world with absolutely no obstructions other than yourself."
"......Which means, if you tell someone about that world, it won\'t be isolated anymore.
 So you can\'t reveal your mental world to anyone.
 So if you manage to draw up a good mental world, you have to keep it a secret only for yourself."
‘Uryu...
 Maria\'s a meanie‐face...’
"Thanks, Sakutaro.
 I guess there are no shortcuts in training.
 ......I\'ll make an effort.
 It\'s alright, I\'ve been given plenty of hints."
‘Uryu...!
 Do your best, Ange...!’
I had come to think that there was no way I could be saved by something like magic.
{n}After all, magic doesn\'t exist in this world.
{n}That kind of thing should be nothing more than a fantasy, a delusion, a daydream.
......However, Maria onee‐chan had shown that she could fill her own world with happiness using a power that was impossible for me.
I had been looking down on that happiness as an empty happiness.
......I had been denying it all, thinking that because I didn\'t accept magic, I couldn\'t accept the happiness that came from it either.
But Maria onee‐chan\'s world grew happier and happier.
In the past, I had disparaged it, calling it painful to look at.
But......that might have been nothing more than jealousy.
{n}It was time for me to admit that.
And doing so was my first step in my search for happiness...
A vast space.
 A dry wind that can blow unobstructed by everything.
{n}......Let me feel that wind blowing through my hair.
......Oh...yes, even the ground might block me as I am now.
Then I don\'t need it.
............Push the ground away, downwards, downwards.
In other words, ......it was as though I had floated up, leaving the ground far behind.
After pushing it further and further downwards,
 ...the ground grew foggy and faint, ......and for the first time, I began to feel the sky.
.........Then, I understood its vastness.
In that instant, I felt the vivid wind pass straight through my body—in other words, blow through without any resistance.
"....................................
 ......Yes.
 Maintain that sensation."
"......Yes, I can feel it.
 ......I can tell that I\'ve been......released from all hindrances."
‘You did it, Ange, you did it, Ange...!
 You\'ve taken your first step into the world of witches...!’
"..................This is...the world of witches......?"
"Yeah.
 So, let\'s try practicing the magic that you\'ve always wished for, Ange.
 .........Magic to summon friends.
 ......Magic to create allies who will save you from your loneliness, and thereby bring you happiness."
‘Will Ange also be able to summon friends like me?!
 Uryu‐uryu!’
"......As Ange is now, it\'s still far too early for her to summon a friend of your caliber from the sea of zero.
 ......For now, let\'s just start by practicing with friends that are easier to summon."
".....................
 ...What will we begin with...?"
"Because you are a witch of Mariage Sorcière,
 you are also permitted to use those who are employed by other witches in the alliance."
"......For example, Sakutaro is my friend, but since you\'re in the same alliance, Ange, he\'s your friend too, and you can summon him.
 ......You wanna try summoning Sakutaro one of these days?
 When you\'re feeling all alone and it\'s really getting you down, I\'m sure Sakutaro will cheer you up."
Oh, right.
 You could call Sakutaro a being employed by Onee‐chan.
So as a witch in the same alliance as Onee‐chan, it\'s also possible for me to summon Sakutaro......
I met Sakutaro\'s gaze.
......What a joy it would be to have him just be sitting there by my pillow,
 so he could talk to me a bit on lonely nights.
"......If I call out, will you appear,
 ......and talk to me......?"
‘Uryuu!
 I\'m looking forward to you summoning me!
 Uryu‐uryu‐uryu!’
Looking happy, Sakutaro playfully pressed and rubbed his head against me like a cat.
Suddenly getting this cute younger brother......left me feeling a bit confused, a bit embarrassed, and a bit happy.
.........Unable to understand why I hadn\'t been able to honestly accept this feeling, I felt tears well up in my eyes.
"Okay.
 ......I\'ll give it all I\'ve got, Onee‐chan."
"Then let\'s try and practice.
 .........Let\'s try summoning the furniture of a witch from the same alliance—{f:5:Beatrice}."
"............{f:5:Beatrice}\'s...furniture."
Hearing {f:5:Beatrice}\'s name mentioned gave me a slightly strange feeling.
When it came to the crime on Rokkenjima, the public had made a lot of noise about it being a witch\'s sacrificial ritual or something like that.
......And that witch was {f:5:Beatrice}.
So {i:if} the culprit of that crime was a witch,
 ......it would mean that this very woman was the culprit who took away my family.
However, according to Maria onee‐chan, {f:5:Beatrice} was a good witch.
If I held negative emotions towards {f:5:Beatrice},
 she would get mad, argue with me and call me mean, and refuse to talk to me for a while.
......Onee‐chan was my only close friend right now.
...So to avoid worsening the mood of my close friend,
 I had decided to think of {f:5:Beatrice} as nothing more than Onee‐chan\'s magic master...
......And anyway, my belief is that the crime was a murder plot hatched by Aunt Eva.
......Someday I\'m definitely gonna bring that all to light.........
"Ange.
 Obstructions are mingling inside your body again."
".........Sorry, I lost my concentration.
 ...One more time..."
Onee‐chan is really something...
{n}She instantly noticed that I was being overcome with idle thoughts.
After shaking my head just once, I reimagined the wind blowing through the vast sky...
"............The Seven Sisters of Purgatory?
 That\'s a pretty creepy name."
"But they\'re very energetic and fun girls.
 They might become your new friends, Ange.
 ......I\'ll summon them first.
 Watch."
Maria onee‐chan lifted both hands up to the level of her head, and quietly unified her mind.
......The state that I could not attain without meditating for a long period of time, she reached in the span of a few quick breaths.
Then, a pale blue light began to gather in her palms, .........and one by one, the girls began to show themselves.
One, two, three.
 Four, five, six, seven...
The way they were summoned one after another in a line was overwhelmingly impressive.
......Incredible.
 The Seven Sisters of Purgatory, ......just like the illustrations in Onee‐chan\'s grimoire...
The younger sisters were behind the eldest, Lucifer, who saluted Onee‐chan.
"The Seven Sisters of Purgatory, right here...!
 Lady {f:5:Maria}, it has been quite some time."
"Yep.
 Long time no see.
 Are you all doing okay...?"
"We furniture are furniture because we are used.
 I consider it an honor from my very heart to have been summoned again for the first time in a long while!"
"Kyaa{p:0:♪} Sakutaroo!
 It\'s been so looong!"
"You look as deli—I mean—cute as ever~!!"
"I\'m fi~rst!!
 Kyaa, he\'s so fluffy, squishy, and cuuu~te!"
"A~h!!
 Let me hug him too, let me hug him too~!"
‘U‐uryuu!
 Can\'t brea~the!
 I won\'t run away, so let me go, everyo~ne!’
"Hey!!
 Are you trying to break Lady {f:5:Maria}\'s furniture?!
 Just get away from him, hugging is prohibited!!"
"......And yet you\'re the one who looks like you want to hug him the most.
 *snicker*."
"Wh—?!
 I, I don\'t have any i‐interest in something so...fluffy and...squishy and...cuddly, okay?!"
"Hey!!
 Be silent in the presence of Lady {f:5:Maria} and Ange‐sama, you cretinous sisters!!"
They were so energetic...
{n}The sudden burst of activity as soon they appeared left me stunned.
And even greater than that was my surprise that the innocent Sakutaro was on such good terms with the Seven Sisters.
"......That\'s unexpected.
 To think that Sakutaro would be so loved by such a dangerous bunch of people."
"They\'re fellow members of the same alliance.
 There\'s nothing to be scared of, you know?"
"But if Sakutaro were to do something to upset them, it looks like they could finish him off in an instant..."
"It\'s alright.
 The witches of the alliance and their furniture are all friendly with each other.
 So Sakutaro can play without worrying.
 ......Of course, that goes for you and me too, Ange."
One of the treaties of Mariage Sorcière.
{n}"Mutual nonaggression and noninterference".
Member witches must respect each other\'s magic and creations.
Even the sisters, who were normally extremely combative and dangerous, interacted with fellow alliance members as friends.
So to the Seven Sisters, Sakutarou was a common friend.
He was loved by all of the Seven Sisters, and they were even trying to steal him away from each other.
This scene as they all surrounded him and loved him was actually a bit charming.
"......I see.
 They\'re fellow members of Mariage Sorcière."
At a glance, you\'d think that Sakutaro\'s easygoing atmosphere and the Seven Sisters\' unsettling one would be like water and oil.
 They looked like they\'d never be compatible.
And yet, they were interacting in such a friendly way, as if it was completely natural......
If all the peoples of the world could be joined in this wonderful alliance,
 ......I wonder if the whole world could immediately become friends.
"All you Seven Sisters, listen.
 Right now, Ange is in the middle of magic training.
 So I want all of you to lend her your power."
"Certainly, Lady {f:5:Maria}.
 ...But what specifically?"
"I will move the magical power manifesting you from me to Ange.
 I want you to stay close by her all the time in that state.
 All you have to do is talk with her and stuff like that."
".........My apologies,
 but with Ange‐sama\'s magical power, I suspect that it will not be easy for her to continually summon all seven of us around the clock..."
The oldest sister, Lucifer, gauged my reaction as she advised this, speaking reservedly.
...In short, she was saying that the burden might be too heavy for me at this point in time.
"That\'s the kind of training it is.
 Ange has more talent and magical power than you all imagine.
 I think it\'ll be a little bit tough, but I think it\'s worth it for Ange to take this challenge as she is now."
"......Ange.
 I will now switch the magic power manifesting them over to you.
 ......Basically, you\'ll be in the same state as if you\'d summoned them yourself."
So what Maria onee‐chan was trying to say was something like this.
To keep the Seven Sisters manifested, you are burdened continuously with a significant amount of magical power.
......Maybe you could say it was like training while wearing weighted wristbands.
‘Uryu......
 Doing all of the Seven Sisters will be pretty tough......
 Isn\'t that asking a lot of Ange all of a sudden...?’
"Thanks, Sakutaro.
 But this is my training to become a witch.
 I want to give it my best."
......The seven of them certainly do seem boisterous.
 But even if they\'re doing it for the sake of my training,
 having them be with me will surely distract me from my loneliness, at least a little.
I understood it would be an ordeal, but before anything else, I wanted to give it a shot.
"Don\'t overdo it if it gets tough, alright?
 And everyone, if Ange looks like she\'s having a hard time, tone it down for her."
"Certainly.
 You got that, people?!"
""""""Yeeees, Onee‐samaa!""""""
"Well then, Ange‐sama.
 We, the Seven Sisters of Purgatory, will now become your furniture.
 .........Lady {f:5:Maria}, if you would."
"Yeah.
 ......Okay, Ange.
 Can we start?"
"......Sure.
 ...I\'m a little nervous."
‘Uryu...
 This might be tough all of a sudden...
 If you feel like you\'re getting a headache, lower your magic power right away......’
"Okay, I\'ll move the source of magic power over to you now, Ange............"
"....................."
"...............gh—"
Instantly, the inside of my head felt very heavy.
......This is......
yes,
 .........it\'s tough...
Until then, the inside of my head had been used only for myself.
{n}It was almost like it was now also being used for seven other people.
......Their mere presence there, blinking, or even letting out a single breath, was placing an enormous weight on the inside of my head...
"......Lady {f:5:Maria}.
 My apologies, but I fear that the burden of all of the Seven Sisters at once might be too great after all."
"I, ......I\'m alright.........
......ack........."
"...Mmmm...
 Maybe it\'s no good after all.
 You\'re using all of your energy to manifest them.
 If it\'s such a burden that you can\'t balance it with your everyday life, there\'s no point.
 I mean, this is a little...unrefined for a witch."
‘Uryu...
 I said doing so many all of a sudden was impossible...
 Everyone, disappear a little bit and make it easier for her...’
"Yes.
 It seems it would be better to lower the number of people.
 ......Asmo, erase yourself."
"Me agaaain?
 I\'m opposed to youngest‐sister‐bullyi~ng!!
 Start from the top every once in a whi~le!"
"But that would mean {i:I\'d} have to disappear {i:second}!
 No no noooo!"
"Don\'t make a ruckus, Asmo and Levia‐nee!!
 That kind of disturbance will put even more strain on Ange‐sama!!"
"The noise you\'re making is straining her as well, stupid Satan!!"
"Eek!"
".........aah, .........ack......
......gah........."
The Seven Sisters started arguing over who should vanish first.
 ......All the energy of that fight became a burden, imposing an even greater headache upon Ange...
In the end, they decided the order with rock‐paper‐scissors, and they began to disappear—one of them...two...three.
But even at that level, Ange was still far from comfortable.
In the end, I was finally able to calm my breathing once six of them had erased themselves.
With my magical power, forget the Seven Sisters, just one of them is my limit...
"......Aaa~aah, this way it\'s not the Seven Sisters, it\'s just me.
 You\'re not very dependable, Ange‐sama."
Mammon, who had won her way through the rock‐paper‐scissors and received permission to remain until the end, complained.
‘Uryu...
 Mammon, you mustn\'t say such a thing...
 Ange is still just starting her training.
 ......Are you okay, Ange?
 Is your headache okay...?’
Sakutaro stretched on his tiptoes and did little hops trying to pat Ange\'s head.
Watching this, Maria scratched her head, acknowledging that this sudden training had been too difficult.
"Uu.
 Maybe that was a little too austere.
 This much is no problem at all for me, though.
 The more friends you have, the more fun it is, after all."
".........Now I\'m even more aware of how incredible you are, Onee‐chan..."
According to Maria onee‐chan, when you reach her class, you can even summon enough people at once to make up an orchestra.
And yet she calls herself a witch {i:apprentice}—that\'s awe‐inspiring...
"Are you alright?
 Ange‐samaa?"
"...............I\'m sorry...
 It looks like summoning you is the most I can do."
"Well, I guess I\'m alright with that.
 After all, of all the Seven Sisters, I get the role of Ange‐sama\'s furniture all to myself.
 ......What do you think, Ange‐sama?
 Will I be a burden by myself?"
"No, I can manage you alone somehow..."
"Great!
 Then please train a lot and cultivate a lot of magic power.
 And someday, please let me serve you as one of the fully assembled Seven Sisters.
 Promise?"
After checking that there was at least nothing wrong with her own manifestation,
 Mammon immediately returned to a good mood, and tried to make me promise to work even harder.
Yes, I can see the greed in her.
{n}...But maybe you could also call it positivity.
"......Yes.
 I promise.
 ...I have to be able to do at least that much someday."
"Thank you, Ange‐sama!
 Until that day, I, Mammon the Covetous, will serve you without fail...!"
My headache finally abated, and I relaxed both hands, which had been clutching at my head.
{n}Then Mammon stuck out her hand, and helped me to stand back up...
‘Uryu?
 ......Ah.
 ......Maria, Ange, look at the time.
 You\'ll get told off if you don\'t go back to the room now.’
".........Huh?
 ............Oh..."
I hadn\'t expected Sakutaro to talk about the time.
{n}......I was brought back into reality.
As though the light had disappeared from it, the vast world sank into the darkness,
 .........and I was in a tiny, tiny bathroom stall, sitting on a toilet...
Onee‐chan\'s grimoire was open on my lap.
I looked at the clock.
 ......It was almost 8 p.m., time for lights out.
If I show up late for the roll call before lights out, not only do they make an annoying fuss about it, but it causes trouble for my roommates and floormates as well.
......I couldn\'t care less about causing them trouble, but I\'d rather not have to deal with the annoying interference that would come as a result...
Hahh............
 That\'s the end of my me‐time for today.
 I\'ll go to bed, wake up, tomorrow will begin, and another long, long, gray‐colored day will repeat again.
I closed the grimoire and rose from the toilet seat...
Onee‐chan appeared again and spoke.
"......Come on, Ange.
 You\'re forgetting your training.
 ............Take Mammon with you."
I\'d forgotten.
 ...The moment I\'d returned to reality, I\'d stopped manifesting Mammon...
One more time, I created a strong image of the existence of Mammon in my mind...
"Sheesh, you\'re so mean, Ange‐sama.
 Erasing me suddenly like that...!
 At this rate, you\'re going to find it pretty hard to call all of the Seven Sisters, you know!"
"............I\'m sorry.
 I got careless."
"It\'s been a super long time since I\'ve manifested in the human world, so I\'m interested in absolutely everything.
 I\'m feeling a little bit excited.
 Where is this?"
".........The Saint Lucia Academy dormitory.
 This is a stall in the communal bathroom.
 ......Each room has its own bathroom, so no one comes here.
 It\'s quiet, and perfect for reading books."
"In this dorm, you have to hide in a toilet stall even to read a book?
 Do they burn them or something?"
..................
I have a double room, so my roommate is always there.
{n}Our relationship is strained, and it feels like I\'m always being ignored.
{n}......The atmosphere\'s bad, so it\'s really not a place I can relax.
And it\'s good for her as well—as long as I\'m not there, she can go all out, call her friends and have a chatting party.
It\'s more convenient for her too if I don\'t return until just before lights out.
There\'s also the library, but the group that uses that as a meeting place is constantly whispering about me.
So I don\'t like to go to the library either.
......During lunch, it\'s the bushes behind the school building.
{n}During the night, it\'s the stall in the communal bathroom in the dorms.
Those are the only hideaways where I can be given peace...
I opened the door to the stall, ......and went out.
I turned around, signaling with my eyes for Mammon to come with me.
"............I\'m not sure I really understand, but I get the point that you find it pretty hard to call this place comfortable.
 Let\'s hurry up and get out.
 I hate the air here."
"Really?
 .........You can\'t breathe this easy anywhere else."
When I left the bathroom and exited into the corridor,
 because it was near lights out, all the girls who had gone to play in other rooms were dashing back to their own.
When it came time for lights out, we had to change into uniform pajamas that we hated and called prison clothes,
 line up in the hallway, and go through the dorm leader\'s roll call.
......If by some chance someone were to be late for this,
 we would be made to take collective responsibility, and all of us floormates would have to undergo a punishment that went by the name of volunteer work...
As long as I took care to avoid this, the girls would disregard me coldly, but they wouldn\'t get in my way.
......That alone was enough for me.
Mammon looked at the passing girls and the furnishings of the dorm with interest.
......Without paying her any particular attention, I hurried back to my room.
In front of my room was my roommate, who had already changed into her prison clothes, chatting with some girls from the room next door.
When they noticed me hurrying back, they blatantly changed the topic of their conversation.
They lowered their voices, stealing glances at me.
I acted like I didn\'t notice, went into my room, changed.
{n}And hurriedly went out into the corridor.
Everyone was already lined up.
".........Hey, this is weird.
 Isn\'t this a school for rich girls?
 It\'s like a prison.
 This is dumb."
"It is, isn\'t it?
 I think so too.
 And you could say the thing that makes it even harsher than a prison is that you don\'t get out early for good behavior."
......After bitching for a bit, I noticed.
Having someone to listen to your complaints...
...feels surprisingly good.
Fortunately, Mammon\'s form can only be seen by the summoner, me.
{n}And of course, there\'s no need to speak out loud for this conversation.
All I have to do is speak inside my mind, so no one can listen in.
.........Magic, and the friends created by it,
 ......might actually not be so bad.
"These guys, all of them look so scrawny.
 It\'s like they\'re not even alive.
 Kyahahaha."
"Stop it.
 If they happen to see you, it\'ll be pretty bad..."
"Humans without a fragment of hopes or dreams are like a lump of anti‐magic.
 They\'ll never be able to see me.
 They\'re inferior life‐forms who can\'t even see.
 *giggle*giggle*!"
".........Are you alright being around so many {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s with that anti‐magic toxin?"
"I\'m fine as long as you continue to manifest me, Ange‐sama."
"......Although, you probably have to keep concentrating to do that, so there\'s a chance you\'ll neglect your daily life.
 ......Look, aren\'t you being called by that girl you\'re sharing a room with?"
"......Huh?
 .........Ah—"
"Ushiromiya‐san, are you listening?
 It\'s us two on duty next week—I wanted to have a little talk..."
......Probably about pushing a few more chores onto me.
{n}My roommate, who normally would never even look me in the eye, was smiling at me unpleasantly.
But I\'ll have a much easier time having the weekly duty pushed onto me and doing it alone, rather than being forced to do it with her.
That\'s a small price to pay to have her continue to ignore me...
Yet after the shameless excuses,
 she transitioned into pushing a completely different point, insisting on flipping the issue on its head, as if I should have come forward and done it of my own initiative.
......One of the special traits of this academy is that it\'s full of girls who don\'t know how to ask a favor.
"......What\'s {i:her} problem?
 She pisses me off.
 I\'d love to just gouge her right in the forehead."
"Yes.
 I\'ll take you up on that sometime."
...........................
 ......Yeah.
 Having a friend nearby all the time to complain to......makes me happier than I thought it would.
The Seven Sisters really were lively when they were all gathered together.
......I\'m sure that just watching them mess around would be a lot of fun.
......I\'ve decided. I\'ll do all I can to quickly gain the magical power to summon all of the Seven Sisters at once.
And then I\'ll keep training, more and more and more,
 ......and summon...
......the thing that I really want to summon.
".........?
 What is it that you really want to summon, Ange‐sama?"
Mammon noticed my conversation with myself inside my head, and asked about it blankly.
I hesitated over whether to talk about it, but then thought that it wasn\'t anything to hide, and told her.
"..................My family.
 .........Dad.
 Mom.
 Onii‐chan."
"So you mean, the souls of the dead...?
 Calling forth a resident of another world is called "summoning", but calling back the souls of the dead is "resurrection", and they\'re completely different.
 ......Resurrection is supposed to be very high‐level magic."
I know.
 ......So much so that even Maria onee‐chan can\'t do it at all.
 But that\'s the thing I most want to call with magic.
......I\'ve been warned that it\'s a very difficult high‐level magic.
{n}...So great that, in the worst case, I might not necessarily reach that point even after training for my whole life.
Furthermore, I have no vessel.
 A vessel is something vital for making magic succeed, whether it be summoning or resurrection.
Because I don\'t have one, .........what would already have been difficult magic instead became hopeless.
That\'s right.
 I have nothing to remember Mom or Dad by.
However, ......by an extraordinary coincidence...
{n}I do have something to help me remember Onii‐chan.
And that\'s.........this.
"......That hair accessory with the pink beads?
 What {i:is} that? Sorry to say it, but it looks a little cheap for you."
"Long ago, without telling Dad,
 I went with Mom to see Onii‐chan, and we went to play at an amusement park.
 ......This is a prize from the crane game there."
I know it\'s something cheap, I realize that it doesn\'t match my style, and I get that it\'s too childish.
......But this hair accessory is the only thing that makes me feel as though Battler onii‐chan is by my side.
The inside of the glass case...
had been filled with plastic capsules packed with fun‐looking things.
It seemed that each of those capsules had some kind of cute little object inside.
The game was to grab those with the crane, ......but I was young, and it was too hard for me.
No matter how many times I tried, I didn\'t even get close.
Mom told me that whatever was inside was probably cheap anyway, and we didn\'t even know what it was,
 so there was no point in getting all upset over it.
But whether it was something cheap or not wasn\'t the issue.
 ......The process of grabbing happiness with my own hands...
felt very important and sacred to me.
So I wanted that capsule with its unknown cheap little object more than anything.
Then, Battler onii‐chan came over after finishing with a game where you shoot soldiers with a gun,
 ......and had a go in my place.
...The happiness that was beyond my reach, Onii‐chan stretched out for with his longer arms, and he grasped it for me.
......Onii‐chan really was coordinated.
{n}Apparently he often played at the arcade with his friends.
After only one or two attempts with the crane, he grasped that thing on the other side of the glass that I hadn\'t even been able to touch,
 .........and dumped it into the exit chute.
When Onii‐chan tossed me that capsule,
 I remember feeling like I could count on him for {i:anything}.
For the next several days, I felt like the capsule was too precious to open up.
Then, one day, I finally opened it.
......And when I did, what revealed itself from inside was this pink‐bead hair accessory.
Since that day...
this has been a symbol of Onii‐chan.
My young mind thought that getting that four‐person family together, with Battler onii‐chan included,
 was a precondition for a happy family.
So I wanted Onii‐chan and Dad to make up quickly.
......In my own way, I had made this hair accessory a charm to bring my whole family together.
 That\'s why I always used to wear it.
Because I wanted to feel my reliable, funny, and wonderful onii‐chan by my side all the time,
 and give him a place in our house.
"But......my memories of Onii‐chan...are so distant.
 ......I can\'t do it as easily as Maria onee‐chan created Sakutarou from a lion stuffed animal."
"......One day, I will learn the high‐level magic to revive the souls of the dead.
 And the only key, the only vessel, that can make that successful...is this."
"...........................
 ......I see.
 I did feel an incredible magical power from that hair accessory, and that explains it."
"Magical power...?
 Magical power resides in this thing of Onii‐chan\'s...?"
"Maybe I should say that you are imbuing it with that power.
 ......Your strong desire to call your brother to you is giving you magical power."
"......Resurrection certainly is a high‐level magic,
 but there can be no mistake that you are steadily and unconsciously climbing the stairs towards that magic."
"............I\'m glad.
 It\'s nice to hear someone other than myself acknowledge that."
Your own effort isn\'t something that you can observe by yourself.
In that sense,
 ......even though these words came from a dangerous demon girl who governs one of the seven deadly sins,
 ......they made me very happy.
"Well, I can\'t guarantee that you will attain the magic of resurrection before your life is over.
 ......However, your power as a witch will be proportional to the height of the mountain you dare to climb."
"If you don\'t lose heart, I\'m sure that one day you\'ll be able to rival even our former master,
 {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, as a Great Witch."
"......I wonder if I can.
 Become a Great Witch and revive Onii‐chan,
 ......no, my family."
"The Witch of Resurrection, Lady {f:5:Ange}...!"
"Kyaah, how wonderful!
 A Witch of Resurrection is a very rare kind of witch.
 Having a witch like that as my master would make me pretty proud.
 Actually, I\'d love for that to happen.
 Because furniture\'s worth is also proportional to the rank of its master!"
"Please zip right on by {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama and become a Great Witch like the world has never seen!
 On behalf of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory, I support you from the bottom of my heart! Kyaha!"
...............I\'d thought that if a magical friend were to appear for me too, I\'d like a cute kid like Sakutarou.
But even this fifth sister of the frightening Seven Sisters who govern the seven deadly sins was enough to calm my heart this much all by herself.
......Maria onee‐chan probably knew this long ago.
 That\'s why she recommended the world of witches to me over and over and over again.
And I kept on stubbornly rejecting it......
I should have given in and started my training as a witch sooner.
A year as a child compares with ten in old age...was it...?
At this point, I find my past self deplorable for wasting precious time doing nothing but complaining.
Long after I turned off the lights and slipped into bed, Mammon continued to talk to me beside my pillow.
......I promise.
 One day, for sure, I\'ll develop a magical power that can summon the Seven Sisters.
 And I\'ll let them have a lively and fun time.
The seven of them make a single whole.
 ......None can be left out.
Family must be together.
{n}I must......bring them together.........
"...................................."
My awareness began to return slowly.
I hadn\'t been able to stand watching Aunt Rosa and Maria onee‐chan\'s relationship,
 ......and had run away from Beato and Onii‐chan\'s game, hadn\'t I...
......I\'ve got to go back.
I\'ve got to go back, support Onii‐chan, and quickly bring him back from this world and its crazy witch games.
Because as long as I\'m here, ......I\'m not permitted to call myself Ange.
......Suddenly, I felt someone\'s presence.
When I turned around, .........there stood Mammon.
"Gretel‐sama.
 {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama says that if you do not return soon, it will become a hindrance to the progression of the game.
 I beg that you return swiftly."
"............Thanks.
 ...I\'ll go back now."
"Isn\'t it great?"
"What is...?"
"You being able to meet Battler onii‐chan."
"..................Sarcasm?"
"If it sounds that way to you, you can take it that way if you want?"
".........I\'m sorry.
 I should accept it literally.
 ...Yes, it is.
 Even in this screwed‐up world, being able to see Onii‐chan makes me happy from the bottom of my heart."
"And you\'ll win against {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, for your onii‐chan\'s sake...?"
"Yes.
 ......Can\'t have him playing around in a world like this forever.
 ......It\'s about time for him to return home.
 That\'s why I came to call him."
"...............Please do the best you can.
 Although I can\'t support you, seeing as my current master is {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama."
"I know.
 Until October 5th, 1986, ...you are {f:5:Beatrice}\'s furniture.
 And eventually, you become my friend."
"And eventually, you throw that friend away.
 After all, ......ng, .........ghkh..."
Mammon moaned as if she had bit her tongue, staggering as she clutched her chest.
 Apparently, the rule applies to people other than me as well.
"Are you alright?
 That\'s pretty...painful."
".....................
 ......I do apologize.
 G‐...Gretel‐sama."
"That\'s alright.
 Thanks."
".........?"
"I\'m happy.
 That I was able to meet Onii‐chan.
 That\'s the answer to your original question.
 .........Well, let\'s go back.
 If I grumble too much, you\'ll get in trouble with your current master."
"Yes.
 Thank you for understanding.
 Well then, th"
"..................Mammon?
 ............Huh?"
I\'m sure Mammon had been about to say "Well then, this way..."
But......she stopped dead, as though the film had been torn off.
It looked like she had suddenly frozen.
...Then I noticed.
 She wasn\'t the only thing that had frozen.
{n}......Even the air and floating bits of dust had frozen in place.
A world where it seemed like even time itself had frozen.
......Yes.
 It resembled what would usually happen just before {f:5:Bernkastel} appeared.
But the atmosphere was different somehow.
 Then I understood.
.........It wasn\'t {f:5:Bernkastel}.
{n}...It was the other witch.
"How are you doing, Ange...?"
"...............{f:5:Lambdadelta}.
 ......The rule doesn\'t apply to you, I see."
"Duh?
 Rules exist to bind others.
 What kind of idiot would bind themselves with them?"
{f:5:Bernkastel} is a witch who supports me, ......but this girl is different.
This witch supports {f:5:Beatrice}.
{n}...In other words, she\'s on the side of the enemy.
But there\'s some kind of difference between her and {f:5:Beatrice}.
There\'s something elusive about {f:5:Lambdadelta}\'s existence, and {f:5:Bernkastel}\'s as well.
 ......How should I put it... Maybe like they\'re beings from a higher dimension...
In any event, I\'m still unsure about how to deal with her.
......The only thing that I\'m certain about is that she is my enemy.
 ...No, just knowing that might be enough...
"So, ......do you have some business with me?"
"Kinda.
 I was listening in on your conversation and it started to get a bit interesting.
 I thought I\'d let you hear something good."
"You\'re supposed to be my enemy.
 I can\'t think of any reason for you to tell me something that would benefit me.
 ......So the moment I start listening to you, I lose.
 Goodbye, <see you next time>."
"Don\'t get the wrong idea.
 My opponent is Bern, not you.
 ......So it is possible for there to be a topic that benefits both you and me."
".....................Sorry,
 but I don\'t feel like listening."
......That said,
 I probably won\'t be released from this frozen time until {f:5:Lambdadelta} is happy.
......That itself might be proof that she\'s a higher‐dimensional being than me.
{n}I haven\'t been given the option of not listening to her.
About the only thing I can do is strengthen my mental guard, and try not to be shaken by anything she says.
She\'ll probably either try to make me believe something disadvantageous to me,
 or threaten me...
"*giggle*giggle*.
 Seriously, you don\'t need to get so defensive.
 I just came to fix your misunderstanding.
 ......Well, actually, no.
 I came thinking I\'d tell you about the lie {f:5:Bernkastel} told you."
".........{f:5:Bernkastel}.........lied?"
"I\'ll bet Bern made it sound like, if you defeated Beato, your big brother would come back?"
"..................
 Who knows.
 ...I don\'t have any intention of talking about it with you."
My brother coming home...
{n}I hadn\'t been promised anything that dream‐like.
It was a promise with considerably low prospects, where I could end up with maybe one person and only if I was lucky.
But that\'s enough for me.
......Since I was promised an eternity of isolation,
 this faint but still non‐zero chance was like a blindingly bright beacon to me.
"In a way, that promise of Bern\'s wasn\'t a lie.
 ......If that\'s what Bern promised, then I\'m sure that if you defeat Beato, Battler and your parents will be released and come back to you."
"Then there\'s no problem, is there."
"............Seriously?
 .........That girl, you\'d never think she was that cruel, you know?
 {i:To deceive you on purpose}."
".........How are you saying I was deceived?"
Shoot...
I\'ve let her take the initiative.
...But I won\'t be released until I lend an ear to her story.
 ...So it\'s something I\'ll have to hear anyway...
Even though I realized that I could be on the verge of falling into a trap, I urged her onwards.
"What year is it now?"
"......You\'re talking about the world of the game board?
 ...In that case, it\'s October 4th, 1986."
"That\'s right.
 So, if you win against Beato, then on October 6th, when the typhoon has passed, the people who were trapped on the island will return.
 ......On October 6th, 1986, that is."
"...............So what?"
"How was your October 6th, 1986?
 ............You were at a relative\'s house, weren\'t you?"
......I had been at the house of the only Sumadera my mother trusted—Grandpa.
.........We got a call.
While I was playing with building blocks in the tatami room, we got that call...
After watching to see that I had remembered,
 ......{f:5:Lambdadelta} smiled unpleasantly,
 ......and spoke.
"WELLLL?
 ON YOUR OCTOBER 6TH, 1986, DID BATTLER ONII‐CHAN COME HOOOME?"
"...................................."
Even though I didn\'t understand what I was being told, I noticed an unpleasant sweat seeping out all over my face...
......Aaah, I don\'t understand.
 I DON\'T UNDERSTAND.
{n}......What is this witch......saying.........?
"Okay, so, it\'s like...
 If you defeat Beato, Battler {i:will} certainly be released.
 And yep, he\'ll probably return home.
 To his home in 1986."
"I mean, he would, right?
 Battler is imprisoned in the two days of the 4th to the 5th of October, 1986.
 Obviously he\'d return to the next day if he was released, right?"
"......And who are you?
 A person from 1998.
 You\'re Ushiromiya Ange of the year 1998 in which {i:Battler did not return}.
 Get it?"
"............What...are you talking about?
 .........If my family came back home on October 6th, ...that would be wonderful, wouldn\'t it?
 I would come home from Grandpa\'s house right away.
 And then we\'d meet.
 ......And everyone would live happily ever after..."
"Yes.
 Ushiromiya Ange probably would be able to reunite with her family.
 ......{i:The six‐year‐old Ushiromiya Ange from 1986} would, right......?"
".........Who am I?"
"Ushiromiya Ange.
 An eighteen‐year‐old one."
".........No, that\'s not it.
 You aren\'t Ushiromiya Ange.
 ......You\'re a witch\'s piece with that name.
 Strictly speaking, a completely different person, with the name {f:5:Ange Beatrice}.
 ......Get it?"
I\'m...starting to think I don\'t......
.........Huh?
 ......Huh?
 ......Who...
......am I?
 ............Huh?
"......And thaaat\'s why I think Bern\'s cruel.
 No, I think she\'s a meanie.
 It\'s not like she hasn\'t had that experience herself."
".........Am I............
......somehow...
......being tricked.........?"
"Ah, but please don\'t blame Bern, okay?
 After all, depending on how you look at it, she isn\'t lying."
"......If you defeat Beato, your family will be returned.
 Returned to Ushiromiya Ange.
 ......But she probably didn\'t say that this Ushiromiya Ange would be you, right...?"
Was it like that... Was it like that......?
{n}What did {f:5:Bernkastel} say to me, again......?
Your assistance is needed.
 ......Your family needs it.
{f:5:Bernkastel} had started by saying that.
Then I had responded.
{n}If I save them, does that mean my family will come back?
{n}......And how had {f:5:Bernkastel} answered that, again......?
Umm, umm......
{m:-5:—}—I cannot promise that.
Uh, umm......!
{n}That kid did promise me.
{n}In exchange for accepting this fight...!
{n}Yes, this is what she said!
{m:-5:—}—In exchange, I will search for the fragment with the ideal world that you wish for,
 the world where your family comes home.
............Yes, that\'s right.
 ......She only said she\'d search for it.
{n}She didn\'t say she\'d find it.
 ......But I\'ve been...prepared for that from the beginning.
Even so, ......she did promise that as long as I didn\'t give up, there was a faint chance of it happening......
And, ......in the end, she said this.
{m:-5:—}—I\'m giving you a chance for revenge.
 ...In exchange, I promise to find and bring you the happiest resolution that it is possible for you to receive.
".....................
 ......I\'ve known it was a tough bet from the very beginning.
 ......After all, I have no family in my 1998."
"If I could have a small chance of shaking that certain zero,
 ......that alone would make it worth it for me.
 I was warned beforehand that even if I succeeded in my revenge, it might be a wasted effort.
 ......So, .........umm............"
"Yes, there\'s no lie in that part.
 Beato\'s game board is perfect.
 No matter what moves you make,
 the chances of Beato losing are so slim that it\'s doubtful you could even dream of it happening once in your life."
"In other words, that chance of winning is so absolutely virtually zero that it could be regarded as infinitely close to zero.
 So it\'s not really Bern\'s fault that she had to say it in such an evasive manner."
"......But I can say for sure that she was tricking you when she let you get your hopes up.
 \'Cause, I mean, even if you managed to overcome the astronomical odds and win,
 the person your family would return to is not you."
"It\'s the six‐year‐old Ange that exists in this 1986—the rightful Ushiromiya Ange.
 Not {i:you}."
"......Even so, Bern will still probably go around billions of fragments, searching for the most acceptable world for you.
 And didn\'t she tell you?
 That she planned on bringing it to you as a present, but wasn\'t able to find it?"
"............She did......"
"Hehheheheheh, *giggle*giggle*giggle*...!!
 Finally starting to realize...?
 There\'s no reward waiting for you in this battle."
"No, to the contrary, if you defeat Beato, her game board will disappear.
 Then {i:you, as a piece, will disappear as well}."
".........There\'s no goal you\'ll be capable of appreciating—such a thing is {i:utterly}...
.........no.
 I\'ll proclaim it upon my name.
 Upon the name of the Witch of Certainty, the Witch of the Absolute, {f:5:Lambdadelta}!
 I proclaim, {i:with absolute certainty}, that such a thing does not exist...!"
".....................No........."
"That\'s Bern\'s lie.
 ......Or should I call it speaking in riddles?
 She made you misunderstand and think that there was some salvation for you.
 I came to clear that up."
"...............So,
 ......no matter how I fight,
 no matter what victory I secure,
 ......my family won\'t come back to me.........?"
"No, they won\'t!
 For {i:certain}!
 Oh‐hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho!!
 The Witch of Certainty is telling you it\'s for certain!"
"Do you know how incredible that is?
 There have been several ancient kings who dedicated historical buildings to me because they wanted me to give them certainty!
 And I\'m generously giving it to you as a present."
"Isn\'t this so lovely, cute and marvelous?
 Ohhh‐hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho!!
 Buuut!
 I do have one nice little proposal for you."
.........Not good.
{n}...I\'m getting completely swept up......
I knew I shouldn\'t have listened, ......and now the witch {f:5:Lambdadelta} is starting to suck me in......!
"My opponent is Bern, not you.
 I said just now that it\'s possible for there to be a subject that benefits us both.
 I\'ve been saying since the beginning that that\'s what I want to talk about.
 So listen to me.
 You have no choice but to...!"
"..................Alright, I\'ll listen...
 I\'m listening......
 ......I\'m listening, okay, are you happy now?!!"
I finally lost control over my emotions and exploded from the inside.
I don\'t have a clue anymore.
{n}......I believed that I was Ange.
But at some point, I stopped being Ange.
That\'s right, I\'m {f:5:Ange}.
 Not Ange...!
Who am I?
 I\'m not my parents\' daughter, nor my brother\'s little sister.
 .........I\'m just a piece......in a witch\'s game...!
"There\'s no need to be so pessimistic.
 ......I mean, think about it, okay?
 Right now, you\'re together with Battler onii‐chan."
"While it\'s true that you can\'t tell him your name,
 you\'re at least positioned as his ally in a game of fighting against witches,
 ......and you\'re able to be with him for all eternity.
 ......Get iiiiiit......??"
.........Frustratingly,
 .........I do...
In other words, .........as long as Onii‐chan keeps getting a draw in this game, it will be repeated forever.
Continuing to draw means the game will continue for eternity,
 and it means that I, a game piece, can remain with Onii‐chan.
......But if Onii‐chan wins, or else loses, and the curtain closes on the game...
"You, a piece, will disappear."
".............................."
"What is the happiness of a game piece?
 ......Nothing more than being played with in the game.
 It doesn\'t come when the game\'s shut in the closet, gathering dust, right?"
......In the past, the Seven Sisters of Purgatory said it as well.
 Furniture\'s happiness is being used, not being stored away.
That\'s right.
 ......I am now...
.........the witch\'s...
......furniture.
"Lemme change the subject a bit, \'kay?
 ......Actually, I {i:want} this game to continue as a draw for all eternity.
 An unending game is an eternal cage.
 ......An absolute locked room, which will never open for all time, and which will finally make Bern surrender."
"......The thing is, Beato does want to win, in a way.
 By making Battler surrender.
 But that\'s actually a problem for me."
"I mean, if the game ends, the locked room will fall apart.
 ......So I\'m going easy on Battler to a certain degree, to make sure that he doesn\'t surrender."
"Don\'t worry, okay?
 When Battler starts surrendering, I\'m even supporting him and stuff."
".........The only thing is,
 I get the feeling Beato is faintly starting to realize that.
 ......I think she\'s starting to realize that her victory in this game might not come for all eternity."
"But we\'re okay there, \'cause, she\'s the Endless Witch.
 Beato\'s stupid, so she optimistically thinks that even so, she\'ll surely win eventually,
 and just has to repeat this game on and on endlessly until that happens."
"Blonde‐haired girls are almost always stupid, *giggle*giggle*!"
".........Then, in this game of witches,
 .........there\'s no such thing...
as victory or loss......"
"I won\'t let her win.
 And I won\'t let her lose.
 With certainty!"
"......Bern realizes that.
 So she found you to be the most powerful piece for breaking that deadlock, and threw you in.
 To bring this game to an end, you see?"
".........To bring this game...to an end......"
"When it ends, what role do the pieces have?
 .........I\'ll state it clearly.
 Your existence is a contradiction.
 ......Your reason for existing is to bury yourself in the darkness and despair...!"
My goal is to defeat Beato and release my captive family.
......And yet, even if I succeed, I won\'t be rewarded.
"You cannot lose.
 And you won\'t be rewarded if you win.
 ......So I\'ve brought you a third choice.
 And that choice will allow our interests to align."
............Continuing the draw...forever.........
"Yes.
 ......As long as they continue to draw for all eternity, this world will not collapse."
"......What is this world?
 .........It is the world of the game with the witch.
 A world where Beato and Battler fight forever."
"......And at the same time,
 it is a world where you can be with Battler forevermore......!!"
"..................uu...
.........uu
......ah
............"
My brain turned to mush.
I could feel the chaos pouring from my eyes as a hot liquid...
{n}The heat of it......felt like it was going to burn my face...
"Think about it......
 {f:5:Ange Beatriceeeee}...
 Since {f:5:Bernkastel}\'s goal is to end the game and end the world where you and Battler can interact, why should you be on her side...?"
"......That girl was tricking you, you know?
 She made it look like you might be saved if you became her piece.
 But I won\'t deceive you there!"
"......So I\'ll say it, {f:5:Ange}.
 Become my chess piece.
 Unlike Bern, I won\'t offer you false rewards that you\'ll absolutely never receive."
"As long as you become my piece, and help me so that this game is {i:certain} never to end,
 I\'ll grant you a {i:certain} promise, upon my name, that this world will {i:certainly} continue!"
"That\'s not all.
 I\'ll add on a bonus, too.
 The rule that binds you.
 .........I\'ll clear it away for you.
 Well, of course, that\'s only after you\'ve sworn to become my piece, alright?"
My throat......made a heavy, loud gulping sound......
Aah, I shouldn\'t have listened......
 If I hadn\'t listened, I could have remained an innocent little sister, praying for my brother\'s victory.
......But I might be different now.
...I might have degraded into a witch\'s furniture,
 .........satisfied merely to be by Onii‐chan\'s side......
"......I\'m not telling you to betray your brother, alright?
 If it looks like Battler\'s gonna lose, you can save him with all you\'ve got.
 ......On the other hand, when Battler closes in on Beato too much, I just want you to hold back a little,
 ......and that\'s all I\'m asking, okay?"
"Don\'t worry, there\'s no need to go so far that you\'re actually betraying Battler.
 ......Battler can\'t win against Beato alone.
 That\'s why Bern threw you in, right?
 ......As long as you don\'t lend a hand, Battler will be unable to win against Beato for all eternity."
"See?
 See how eeeeasy it is?
 ......*giggle*giggle*, hohhohohoho, ahhah{0}haha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah!
 Kah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah, kyaaa‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah!!""Heyyyy!!
 That\'s miiine!
 Give—it—back!!"
"Nonono, I\'m gonna eat i~t!
 Asmo, Asmo, pass!"
"Kyaahahahaha!
 Levia onee‐sama, over here, over here~!"
I wonder where they swiped it from.
{n}They were fighting over a donut or something, playing around really loudly.
"HEY!!!!!
 Ange‐sama is reading, can\'t you be the slightest bit quiet?!"
"And yet you\'re the loudest one, Satan, silence yourself!!
 You cretinous sister!"
"Y‐you\'re louder than me, Lucifer onee‐sama!!
 I‐is there something you want to say to me?!"
By now, I was used to the fights between the eldest and the third‐eldest sister.
 It\'s a bit funny how they\'re both a little hesitant even though they\'re so quick to anger.
They might be surprisingly similar.
"Heh heh.
 You ordered us to be noisy, but this is surely too much.
 Should I make them lower the volume a little?"
"............You can all mess around all you want.
 It\'s a hundred times more pleasant than the shrill laughter in the classroom."
"Ange‐samaa, hurry up, next paaage!
 You read really slooww!"
"You like to read, Mammon?
 You look like you\'d be the most averse to such ordinary things."
"Mammon\'s domain is greed.
 ......That also includes a thirst for knowledge.
 But she tends to want to keep that knowledge all for herself, so when someone gives her a book, she\'ll sometimes burn it after reading it so that no one else can—please watch out for that."
"I like knowing things that no one else knows.
 I like being able to do things that no one else can do.
 So I like studying and practicing.
 Because I want to keep wisdom that no one else knows about all to myself."
As Mammon said that, her eyes sparkling,
 she stared transfixed at the open page, reading through it again.
You could see the greed that made her even more intent than me on devouring that page.
As you can see, my magical power was now much stronger compared to the first day I summoned them.
I was now at the point where I could summon all of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory at once and still calmly read a book like this.
This place, although I couldn\'t recall {i:where} it was, was a quiet and calm street‐side bench.
The reason that I couldn\'t remember the location of this place was that at the time I visited it, I was very young.
......Still, I remembered the day we\'d walked here, and how much fun it was.
Mom, Dad, ...and even Onii‐chan had been there—
it was a memory of a very rare and very happy day when all the family had actually been together...
The people walking by every once in a while weren\'t noticing me.
{n}They were just pleasantly ignoring me and passing by as normal.
I wasn\'t even the slightest bit embarrassed by the Seven Sisters\' shameless outfits,
 because it wasn\'t like they were actually being seen by anyone.
In fact, I\'d gotten pretty used to them.
 Just so long as they didn\'t make {i:me} wear one.
I was sitting on a stylish bench, memorizing a timeline for world history.
......In an academy system where everything is based on collective responsibility, there\'s no tolerance for dunces.
It seemed that I was lowering the average grade for the class considerably.
According to those extremely intellectual girls,
 if I alone improved my grade, the average would rise drastically.
......They had been kind enough to show me with a graph drawn with colorful pens on a B4 sheet of drawing paper.
...Just thinking of the effort it must have taken to draw that was nauseating.
But I\'d already spat out all of those complaints.
 ......I\'d already used those girls to vent all my furious anger and sadness.
The Seven Sisters...
were sometimes outraged,
 sometimes compassionate,
 and sometimes shared in my sorrows.
......I was truly happy to have friends with whom I could share those emotions.
It\'s said that they were originally furniture that existed to carry out {f:5:Beatrice}\'s cruel sacrificial ritual.
......If that sickening occult message bottle was to be believed,
 ...it seemed that several among them even attacked my family.
But I didn\'t believe that, and it would be pointless to question them about it.
They\'re furniture, so all they do is respond to their master\'s requests.
Even if they really had attacked my family, I couldn\'t hate them.
......The one I really hated...
...was the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}.
{n}.........Or else the one at the very center of Rokkenjimagate,
 Aunt Eva.
"......Ange‐sama, hurry up, next page."
"Oh, sorry.
 .........I\'m tired.
 Mind if I take a break?"
"Kyahaha!
 Ange‐sama says she\'s having a break!"
"Let\'s play, let\'s play!
 Ange‐sama, let\'s plaaaay!!"
When they noticed that I had interrupted my studying, the most energetic youngest sisters gathered around me.
That wasn\'t all.
Even Maria onee‐chan and Sakutaro showed themselves.
They had probably been very close by, but they must have hid themselves so that they didn\'t interrupt my studying.
‘Uryuu!
 Ange~!
 How\'s studying? How\'s studying?’
"Kyaaah!!
 Sakutaroo!!
 How are yooooouu?!"
"Wait a second!
 Let me fluffle him tooooooooooo!!"
"You snooze you lose, aren\'t we always telling you?!
 Kyaa, so cute, so cute!"
‘Ukyuuu, you\'re crushing meee!
 Uryuuu!’
"Your luck ran out when you showed up when all of the Seven Sisters were gathered.
 Now accept your fate and be fluffled."
"Come on!
 Do you always have to treat him like this?!
 I apologize on behalf of my stupid sisters...!"
"Ahahahahaha.
 Sakutaro\'s happy to meet all of you too.
 ......Well, Ange?
 How\'s your studying?"
"Thanks.
 Well, not bad."
"They were nice enough to pass me a printout of the test from another class who took it earlier.
 Their beautiful sense of solidarity is enough to bring tears to my eyes.
 ......Well, at least I\'ll do a little better now for putting the timeline into my head."
‘Uryu.
 You sure are good at studying, Ange.
 You\'ll be able to get a lot of points, uryu~~.’
"Good work.
 I was completely useless at studying, so I\'m jealous of you for being able to get a good score when you study hard."
"You\'re joking.
 English, Latin, knowledge of the occult—
you\'re much more amazing for being able to learn all of that by heart."
"I can remember anything when studying magic, but can\'t remember anything boring I have to study.
 So it doesn\'t help at all for tests."
"Well, I\'m sure your occult knowledge would have been a bit like that, but your English and such must have translated into good grades, right?"
"In the first year of elementary school, on a Japanese language test,
 there was a question where I was given a picture of a gun and four squares, and it said to write its name in the four squares.
 Wrote "rifle"—{ruby:ra‐i‐fu‐ru:{p:0:ライフル}}—and got it marked wrong."
"Why?
 It fits."
"It was supposed to be {ruby:te‐p‐po‐u:{p:0:てっぽう}}, the Japanese word for gun.
 Got told that it was wrong \'cause you don\'t learn katakana in first grade."
"......I didn\'t really get it,
 so from that day on, on tests, I wrote everything in hiragana.
 But got in trouble with Mama for some reason.
 Got in trouble with the teachers too."
".....................
 ...You probably picked the wrong country to be born in, Onee‐chan."
"Then I\'d have liked to have been born in a country of witches and go to a school of witchcraft.
 Uu."
‘And then you might have had a whole lot of even more wonderful magic friends!
 Uryuu!’
"Uu{p:0:♪}
 But it\'s not like I mind it now.
 After all, I can use a lot of magic, and I have a lot of magic friends, too.
 All I need is Sakutaro."
‘I\'m not the only one!
 There\'s also Sakusuke and Sakukichi, the animal band, Shimoda‐kun the seal, Sanae‐san the rabbit, Piguo‐kun the pig, and plenty more!’
......Incredible.
 Onee‐chan\'s friends just keep increasing in number.
Every time I ask, the list of her friends\' names grows longer.
{n}But there\'s no doubt that Sakutaro is her best friend.
...I\'m a little jealous of her for having such a close friend.
"......How are they?
 The Seven Sisters.
 Are you getting along with them?"
"Those sisters are really energetic.
 ......They sometimes say worrying stuff, but they aren\'t bad.
 ...What I really wanted was to get a cute kid like Sakutaro, but now, I think being with these girls is more than enough."
"*giggle*.
 If you learned my Magic of Origins more, I\'m sure you\'d be able to create just the kind of friend you\'d like, Ange.
 As it is, creation is still a little too hard for you."
"There\'s a difference between creation and summoning.
 ......And...resurrection is different still."
"...............
 So your greatest wish really is to revive your family...?"
"Yeah.
 ............I have a vessel for it.
 This."
"Yes.
 ...I\'m sure that hair accessory will become the key to summoning Battler someday.
 ......The rest is up to your training, Ange."
"Although not knowing how long that\'s going to take makes me cry."
‘Uryu...
 Stay strong, even if it\'s tough...
 If you don\'t give up, it will definitely definitely happen someday...’
"I\'m sure I\'d feel a lot more at ease if someone would just give me some proof of that."
‘Uryu!
 Then I\'ll guarantee it!
 No doubt about it, someday, you\'ll be able to make your wish come true!’
"......Thanks.
 I\'m happy even for consolation."
‘It\'s not consolation...uryuu.’
"Stop it, Ange.
 That kind of emotion will become the anti‐magic toxin.
 The feeling that your dreams will definitely come true is the best seed that buds into magic power."
"............
 ......You\'re right, sorry, Master."
"You need to be a bit greedier, Ange‐sama.
 Go however far for the thing that you desire!
 Never give up until you get it! That\'s the willpower you\'re lacking!"
‘Uryuu!
 That isn\'t true, Ange is doing her best...!’
"Thanks, Sakutaro, Mammon.
 Crying about it won\'t help anything.
 There\'s nothing I can do except hang in there.
 I\'ll try hard.
 Grit my teeth.
 And I\'ll definitely make my dreams come true.
 For certain."
‘Uryu!
 You\'re awesome, Ange, do your best!
 Mammon and I will support youuu!’
"Yes, we will.
 The greedier our master is, the more our worth will increase."
"More importantly, Ange‐samaa!
 We have ten whole people here, sooo..."
"We were thinking, maybe we could all play {c:86EF9C:shiritori} together or something!"
"Penalty if you lose!
 Let me nibble your ea~rs!"
"Come {i:on}, is there anything inside your head other than food?!"
"Please forgive my cretinous sisters\' imbecilic proposals...
 Is it really alright for you not to return to your studying about now?"
"No, no, nooooooo!!
 I waited so long for you to finish studying, you gotta play with us, you gottaaaa!"
"I don\'t think it\'s a bad idea.
 I would suggest that playing every once in a while is a good way of exercising the mind."
"............Your domain was sloth, right, Belphe?
 What you\'re saying sounds reasonable, but you\'re actually being sneaky, aren\'t you?"
"Heh.
 My apologies.
 ......You are a diligent one, Ange‐sama."
"If it\'s okay with you, Ange, I\'d like to play with everyone, too.
 All noisy together.
 It\'ll definitely be fun."
‘Uryuu!
 Ange, Ange, let\'s play, let\'s play!
 Let\'s all do shiritori!’
"In that case, let\'s start from Sakutaro\'s "uryu".
 .........What does the next word have to start with in this case?
 "Ryu"?
 "Yu"?"
"If it\'s "uryu"?
 ...............I wonder.
 Maybe it really would be "ryu"?"
"......It\'s rare for a word that ends weirdly like that to come up."
"Okay, I\'m first then!!
 I\'ll start from "ryu"!
 A {ruby:ryuuzu:"watch ste~m"}!"
"I wanted to be the one to speak first!
 {ruby:ryuuto:"Lute"} would have been so much more wonderful!"
"‘Zu’?
 Feels like we keep getting tough ones.
 ...Wait a sec, what order are we going in?
 Who\'s next?"
‘Uryu.
 I don\'t think it matters who.
 Whoever thinks of something first.’
"Huh, that sounds fun.
 The person who can say the most wins?
 It\'s fast‐talking shiritori!"
"OK, I\'ll go, then!
 "Zucchini"!
 {ruby:ninniku itame:"Garlic stir‐fry"}!
 "Mekabu and pasta"~!
 All of them delicious!
 Kyaha, I said three!"
"Belzie takes three points.
 ......Can you use conjunctions?"
"If you could use "and" then anything would work!!
 That last one doesn\'t count!
 Minus one point!!
 Start over at "me"."
"Okay, my turn.
 {ruby:merenge:"Meringue"~!"}
‘‘Ge’??
 ...U...u...
...uryuu!’
"{ruby:gesuidou:‘Drainage system’},
 {ruby:umetatechi:"reclaimed land"},
 {ruby:chikashitsu:"basement"}.
 Something like that?"
"Onee‐sama, those are all pretty unrefined words, *giggle*!"
"S‐so what, why don\'t you try following up with something refined, then!!
 Anyway, that\'s three points for me.
 The next one\'s "tsu", alright, "tsu"!"
"Never played such a weird shiritori before.
 Uu‐uu!
 Fun!"
‘Uryuu!
 I don\'t get it at all, but it\'s fun.
 Uryuu!’
I\'d played normal shiritori before, but this kind of weird shiritori was a new experience for me.
The Seven Sisters, who would be lively enough just on their own; Maria onee‐chan; Sakutaro; and me.
I was now surrounded by friends that were just so fun.
......The courage to accept a world of magic, a world of witches...
...That alone wouldn\'t change the fact that I was locked up in an academy,
 without a single friend in my class.
But I was having such a fun and merry time regardless.
.........I\'ll become a witch like Maria onee‐chan.
And someday, I\'ll add my family to this happy circle.
Mom, Dad.
 And Onii‐chan.
......If possible, George onii‐chan and Jessica onee‐chan, too.
 And my other relatives.
I\'ll call everyone, everyone here, without a single person missing, ...and we\'ll all be gathered together.
"......That is my...dream.
 ......Yes,
 and until I make it come true, I\'m definitely not going to lose heart."
"I\'m sure you\'ll become a Great Witch, Ange‐sama.
 As long as you believe that.
 We Seven Stakes of Purgatory will always serve by your side until that day comes."
"You\'ll be there...?
 No matter how long,
 ......you\'ll lend me your strength?"
"Of course.
 After all, I\'m your friend, right, Ange‐sama?"
"........................
 ......Yes, you are.
 Let\'s always stick together and play together.
 Today, and in the future...forevermore."
"Until the day you can make your dream come true."
The lively, ten‐person game of shiritori,
 cut off from time alongside the street, under the forever bright warmth of the sun, continued without end......
".........What. The. Hell. {i:Seriously}, Ushiromiya‐saan?"
".............................."
......In the end,
 I wasn\'t able to make a very good grade on my test.
I had thought I\'d memorized things, in my own way,
 but if you could manage anything by cramming all night like that, no one would worry about tests.
"Normally, when you know the questions beforehand, you\'d ace it easily, right? Easily!"
"It\'s true that we didn\'t go so far as to write the answers into the blanks for you.
 We thought you\'d have the sense to study at least that much."
"Oh my God!
 No frigging way. This is... God almighty...!
 They\'re almost all wrong, aren\'t they?
 Did you really actually study for this?!"
"..................More or less..."
"This isn\'t what you call more or less, Ushiromiya‐san.
 ......My mind is reeling from how horrible this is."
"O Lord.
 Please forgive her for getting a miserable grade on such an easy test,
 and plummeting the average score for the entire class...!"
"*giggle*giggle*giggle*, *cackle*cackle*cackle*,
 ahahahahahahaha."
......The same test had been given to another class first.
{n}They had managed to get hold of that test paper, so the average score for this test was unusually high.
Enough to obscure my slight improvement.
However, ......there were some things that I couldn\'t make an excuse for.
If I had spent that entire day studying like mad, I might have been able to get a slightly higher score.
......But I hadn\'t gone that far.
After all, after that on that day,
 ......I had spent the time having fun playing shiritori with the Seven Sisters, Sakutaro, and Onee‐chan.
As expected, the winner had been Maria onee‐chan.
{n}She had been a strong player because of her various bits of random knowledge.
Sakutaro had gotten the penalty.
He had spent the whole time cheering for everyone else\'s answers,
 and had completely forgotten to think of any himself.
......Because of that, he got dogpiled by the Seven Sisters and had his ears thoroughly nibbled, didn\'t he?
"Excuse me, are you listening, Ushiromiya‐san?!"
"..........................."
They were surrounding me, twittering like small birds.
{n}Annoying, smelly.
On the outside of that circle was Mammon, a weary expression on her face...
"This school is as messed up as always.
 If their own grades are good, shouldn\'t they be more than happy?"
".........It\'s probably because of that collective responsibility thing.
 Instead of worrying about their own grades,
 they\'re more concerned about how embarrassing it is for the class average to be low."
"Or maybe it\'s because they really really hate the volunteer work they\'re forced to do as punishment."
"So in other words, they aren\'t studying because they want their grades to be good,
 but because of collective responsibility and because they hate volunteer work?"
"......They\'re jealous and embarrassed.
 They don\'t want to be inferior to anyone, and they don\'t want to be humiliated.
 That\'s the only feeling that drives them to study."
"What noisy people. If they want to study, why can\'t they just do it themselves?"
"In the end,
 without collective responsibility and volunteer work, they\'d have no desire to study.
 ......How foolish it is to study without knowing the meaning of studying."
"Wow, these guys are so annoying and stupid!
 Stop disturbing Ange‐sama\'s precious lunchtime!"
"Waaah, I hate these guyyyys!!
 Just go awayyyyy!!"
"I\'m huuungryyyyyy!!
 Disappear already, waaaah!!"
"..................
 .........I\'m sorry, everyone.
 I wonder why {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s are so despicable."
"It\'s probably because, instead of working hard themselves,
 forcing you to put the effort in is the easier way for them to greedily boost the class average.
 ......Humans are all greedy.
 And they\'ll burden others with that to make things easier for themselves."
"...We\'ll eventually be reunited with them on the Mountain of Purgatory.
 When they get to the fifth terrace, they better watch their step..."
Mammon controls the fifth terrace of the mountain that reaches to Paradise: Mount Purgatory.
......Given that she herself was promising them this, we can probably be sure that after those girls die, their journey to heaven will not be an easy one.
...No, in fact, why don\'t they just go to hell.
The class committee had applied to the student council to use a classroom during lunch and after school.
The purpose of use was for a class study group.
 A wonderful little gathering so that they can all collect around me and make me study. I\'m overjoyed.
Which meant that every day, I would have all of my lunch and three hours of my afternoon stolen away from me.
The academy and its student council, with its motto of student self‐government,
 instantly approved of this pleasant activity that the students were taking up of their own initiative...
In other words, I would no be longer able to escape after school by leaving the classroom...
After school, the first class study group meeting started right away.
Would they open a textbook, then kindly and carefully explain so that even I could understand it?
 Of course it was nothing like that naive fantasy.
After school in the classroom, around a dozen of my classmates crowded around my desk.
First, before we started studying...
Why were my grades so bad?
 What was the reason?
{n}It was decided that we couldn\'t start until I could clearly answer those questions, become aware of the problem, and show remorse for my actions.
......Of course, there was no way I had an answer to a question like that.
They had avoided me like the plague up until now.
 And they had rejected me and kept me at a distance so as not to include me in their communities.
So I had been avoiding their communities myself.
 There shouldn\'t have been any conflict between us that way.
So even when they formed this community intent on raising the class average,
 I obviously kept well away from it.
Even if I had tried to join in,
 they would probably have ignored me, just like they had always done in the past.
"If you\'d just have asked, we\'d have taught you as much you wanted.
 Wouldn\'t weeeee?!"
"""We wouuuuuuuld!!!"""
Such enthusiasm.
 ......I\'d had enough of their ex‐post‐facto pretenses of charity.
"Ushiromiya‐san, the thing that\'s bad about you is you\'re lacking a cooperative attitude.
 You only think about yourself—it\'s that selfish way of thinking that\'s the problem."
"Those who gather in Saint Lucia\'s place of learning shall have a cooperative heart.
 It is written right there in the student handbook, you know?"
"I think if you have a cooperative attitude,
 that\'s what gives birth to the desire to study together and contribute to the entire class.
 I think {i:that\'s} the most fundamental thing that you\'re lacking, how about you?!"
"Heeey, have you been listening to us?!
 We\'ve gone to all the trouble of staying after school to have this talk {i:for your sake}, you know?!"
.....................
The tears of gratitude are pouring down.
Of course, they didn\'t like that.
"This way, it almost makes it look like we\'re bullying you", they scolded me.
Fortunately, I\'m normally all cried out anyway.
{n}If I\'m told not to cry, I can hold it back.
First, I was to write a letter of remorse and read it out loud.
Of course, they meant today.
The class president politely applied to the student council and the staff room for an extension on the use of the classroom.
......Apparently it was accepted right away.
Which meant that, starting now, I would be forced into self‐criticism here for at least a full five hours......
{m:-5:―}―I, Ushiromiya Ange, caused trouble for my classmates by getting a low score on my test.
"That\'s not iiiiiit!!"
"You getting low grades and causing us trouble isn\'t the root of the problem, right?!"
"It\'s a cooperative attitude, a cooperative attitude!!"
"Come ooon!!
 Why do we even have to guide you on how to write a letter of remorse?!"
Their abusive jeers flew about one after another.
I followed their "guidance" and put the eraser to it.
{m:-5:―}―I, Ushiromiya Ange, caused trouble for my classmates by not having a cooperative attitude.
"Hey, wait a sec, it\'s pointless if you just write whatever we say!"
"Do you even frigging know what "remorse" means?!"
"It\'s pointless if you don\'t write it in your own words, pointless!"
"I\'ve always thought you were a bit strange, Ushiromiya‐san, but you really are an odd one!
 *giggle*giggle*giggle*!"
Even following their guidance didn\'t change the jeers much; in fact, now it felt like they were mocking me more as well...
In this way, over the following several hours, without rest, without being allowed to go to the bathroom,
 of course without being permitted to have dinner, and while being continuously insulted...
......I was coerced into writing a document which humiliated myself......
And as it passed nine at night, ......I was told to stand up and read it aloud.
The contents...
...were smeared black with tears and eraser marks.
It certainly was my handwriting,
 ......but it was like a list of soulless letters,
 whose contents I couldn\'t even remember.
Everything had been copied down according to their guidance.
So while I had been the one to write the letters, they weren\'t my words.
I was being coerced into writing it down, and even coerced into reading it aloud.
.........I was surprised to find that even after all this time, in addition to ignoring someone and hiding their things,
 there were still other ways, like this, to bully people......
"Come onnn!
 Hurry up and read it out!!"
"Look how many people are staying this late just for you, Ushiromiya‐san.
 How about a little gratitude?"
"Isn\'t the fact that she doesn\'t feel gratitude for that indicative of her not having a scrap of cooperative attitude?"
"It\'s alright, Ushiromiya‐san.
 We\'ll always be with you from now on.
 Why not study with us and remake yourself?
 Okay?"
"*giggle*giggle* “Ahahahahaha “Kyahhhya{0}hya{0}hya{0}hya!!””"
Still surrounded by them, I stood from my seat......and dropped my gaze towards the blackened page.
And then......I began to speak those humiliating words,
 but right away, jeers flew at me saying that they couldn\'t hear and to speak up.
...............I can\'t read this.
I had no idea...
that being forced to read a paragraph humiliating me would be so painful.
My throat shook.
 My fingertips shook.
 ......The paragraph of humiliation written in my own handwriting made my eyes burn with a hot liquid.
So my world blurred and twisted.
The girls surrounding me all appeared warped.
......I saw them warped into exactly the impression I had of them.
In other words, ......this was the correct view.
Beyond that twisted crowd of people, ......I could see my friends.
Compassion could be seen in all of their eyes.
".........Ange, .........stay strong..."
‘Uryuu.........’
Maria onee‐chan and Sakutaro were looking at me with sad eyes.
{n}Perhaps because they realized that even cheap words of compassion would hurt me.
......They kept alternating between trying to say something, and hanging their heads.
"What the hell\'s wrong with these people...!!"
"They\'re such dirtbags!
 Really pisses me off!
 What\'s so fun about ganging up on Ange‐sama and tormenting her?!"
"The resentment of not being able to spit out their jealousy.
 Anyone would do, just as long as they can spit it out.
 They\'re the worst."
"Ange‐sama!
 In this kind of situation, going mad with rage for the sake of your own honor is perfectly acceptable!!
 Anger is an appropriate emotion and an appropriate reaction!
 If you don\'t get mad now, when {i:are} you going to?!!"
"Stop it, don\'t stir Ange‐sama up with cheap anger!!
 If Ange‐sama could do that, she would have done it already!!"
"...............If the situation could improve by you getting angry, then that is what you should do.
 However, objectively speaking, that would only serve to aggravate the situation further.
 ......It may be humiliating, but the wisest thing to do now is to withstand it."
"Ahha!
 You really are a sloth, Belphe‐nee!
 Screw that, I can\'t stand this!!
 I can\'t forgive them!!"
‘...E‐everyone, settle down...
 You\'re putting a burden on Ange...’
"A burden?!
 What are you talking about? Is this the time or place to be calm?!
 We furniture are not so cruel as to be able to coolly watch our master being humiliated!!"
"Ange‐sama!!
 You have no obligation to read such a humiliating essay!
 If you can\'t let out a cry of rage, then at least throw that insulting message onto the floor!!"
"You don\'t need to trash‐talk them, you don\'t need to yell so loud that they bend over backwards!
 Just throw that notebook on the floor with all your might...!!
 That\'s all you need to do to show how strong‐willed you are!!"
"Don\'t be so irresponsible!!
 I told you already!
 If Ange‐sama could do that, she would have done so long ago!!"
"Nothing will be resolved by the eruption of momentary emotions.
 Why don\'t you understand that doing that will only worsen the criticism Ange‐sama is receiving?!"
"Waaaaaaaaaaaaahh!!
 Why is this happening to Ange‐sama when she didn\'t do anything wrong?!"
"Not letting her eat dinner, and making her stay so long after school! I hate iiiiiiiiiiiiit!!"
"And it\'s not just tonight, it\'s tomorrow and the day after too!!
 Give me a break! I can\'t bear this humiliation!!"
"Excuse me!! Are you actually listening to us?!"
Someone tugged at my hair.
{n}......I was pulled back into miserable reality.
...I was no longer even permitted to listen to the Seven Sisters expressing my inner thoughts on my behalf.
My hair was lifted upwards, one of my hair ornaments came off, and I heard it bounce and then roll on the ground.
......No one picked it up.
To the contrary, they casually avoided it as though something filthy had come rolling towards them.
I tried to follow it with my eyes, but my hair was tugged upwards again.
"Why is it that you\'re {i:never} listening, even though we\'re trying to have a real serious talk with you?!"
"In one ear and out the other, is it?
 Or maybe we\'re talking to a brick wall?!
 Get a grip, alright?!"
"Are you really conscious of the trouble you\'re causing all of us?
 You better not be about to say you just wrote that grudgingly because we told you to!"
"Until you can really feel remorse by yourself, this seriously isn\'t gonna end, get it?!
 It\'s not just gonna be today.
 This is seriously gonna keep on going tomorrow and the day after, you got that?!
 I\'m warning you, don\'t push your luck with us!!"
"Like, more to the point, what are you even still alive for?
 Could you guys go on like this?
 If it were me, I\'d just die!"
"Yeah, I could never live this way!
 Think about it, just by being alive, you\'d be getting in other people\'s way all the time, right?
 If it were me, I definitely couldn\'t live on!"
"Yeah, yeah, I\'d die too.
 If that\'s better for the world, I\'d die on the spot! Wouldn\'t yooooou?!!"
{a:c:
......Then die.}
"Ange‐sama......"
"Kill them all, immediately!!
 Lucifer, did you hear me?!"
"Huh?! ......Ah..."
"You Seven Sisters of Purgatory are incredible furniture that can massacre mere {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s in a flash, right?!
 You\'re always boasting about it to me!!"
"Then do it!
 Kill them all right now!!
 Right here, right now!!"
".........But..............."
For some reason, Lucifer\'s speech faltered.
"......Why?
 What\'s wrong?!
 You\'re certain‐kill furniture that can fly around faster than the eye can see, and instantly strike through the hearts of the witch\'s enemies, aren\'t you?
 And I am giving you an order as your master!!"
"Carry it out right away!
 Kill them!!
 KILL THEM AA{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}AALL!!"
"........................A‐Ange‐sama......
 ...Please, calm down......"
If they had immediately followed my brutal order, and left corpses strewn all around me...
......I would have been ready to rue my own reckless actions of stealing human lives so readily—I was ready to regret and feel remorse, just as they had wanted me to.
I was prepared to go through that.
And yet, Lucifer just let an unsure expression rise to her face, and didn\'t move to carry out my order.
..................I was aware.
Of course I was.
 ......Vaguely.
{n}No, that\'s not it.
 ......I {i:knew} it from the very beginning.
I knew, didn\'t I......that magic was all empty......
"......The Seven Sisters of Purgatory? Yeah, right...
 ......Worthless, worthless...
 ............I knew it from the very beginning......"
"............A‐......Ange‐sama...
 ............{nobr:g—...{m:-5:———}—}......!!!"
I glared into the worthless Lucifer\'s eyes.
...And it seemed that pain accompanied that stare.
{n}As though she had been struck by a horrendous headache, Lucifer clutched her head with both hands.
But it looked like she couldn\'t tear her eyes off my glare.
{n}......So the pain assaulting her grew more and more intense.
"......................................."
"Guhgggg, a......ghhhgaaa, agaa.........!!
 Ahghhk!!!"
You are useless, useless......!!
 I HATE you!!
 Disappear...!!
 {i:You\'re nothing but a delusion inside my head}...!!!
Hopelessness and disappointment.
 Resignation and a dream\'s end.
 A cracking sound, like you\'d hear from a frozen lake\'s surface during a fierce winter, rang out just once.
Simultaneously, Lucifer\'s form, tormented by violent pain, stiffened in place and grew cloudy.
......It was almost as though a beautifully polished glass window...
had been heartlessly smashed and turned white from the countless cracks.
And that was an accurate analogy.
 At some point, Lucifer\'s form had turned into a glass ornament of the same shape.
Countless fissures ran through it from the inside, and the head and arms fell to pieces as it crumbled to the floor.
"Hiiyii?!!"
"L‐Luci‐nee...!!"
"............Who\'s the second sister...?
 Leviathan?
 Carry out my order.
 Kill them all right NOW!!"
"W‐well, um!
 ......Err, Ange‐sama...
 ......Please calm your heart and listen...
 We, umm,
 .........{m:-5:——}—...
mmgwaaGHHggggggah{m:-5:—}—
GAHAGH!!"
I\'m not looking for excuses or back talk or a reply.
{n}......I want nothing more than a swift confirmation of my order to eradicate the girls who are humiliating me.
If you\'re going to say anything else, there\'s no need for me to listen until the end.
After Leviathan turned white from the vast number of cracks throughout her whole body,
 frozen in a bent‐backwards pose, she toppled over, and her fragile neck, hips and arms broke into separate parts.
It would have been less brutal if they had just smashed to smithereens instead of retaining their original form.
So the fact that I had left the two of them partially intact...
made the remaining younger sisters shake even harder...
"......Why won\'t you listen to my orders...?
 Why?
 WHY?!!"
"M‐my apologies...!!
 H‐here, under the current conditions, the anti‐magic power is...e‐extremely strong...and—"
"{i:What}.
 You can\'t do it because {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s are here? {i:That\'s} your logic?
 Isn\'t killing {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s what you {i:do}?!
 If you can\'t do that, then WHAT USE are you as furniture?!!
 DIE!!!"
"Hiii—!!"
"P‐please, spare me, Ange‐samaaaaa......ah,
 nghk,
 ghhgaaaah, khack!!"
As she clutched her head with both arms, Satan also turned white and fell down face first.
The neck really did seem to be the most fragile part.
{n}Her head broke off weightily and rolled over to Belphegor\'s feet.
"You can\'t do it because there are too many {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s?
 Then if I were to call them into the shadows later one by one,
 you\'re saying you guys could make a bloodbath of all of them?"
"......With your current magical power, it may be easy for you to converse with us.
 However, you still lack the training in magical power to manifest us in front of all of the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s here...!"
"I deeply understand your anger, but even if you could use us to attack,
 murdering everyone here would only make the situation worse...!
 I do think it humiliating, but please, if you could control your anger for the time being—"
".........ggg, gah,
 ......ghhhhh...ggg...gaHAGHHH!!"
"...............Will I get the same answer from the remaining three...?
 Going to tell me you can\'t do it because the anti‐magic power is too great?
 Going to tell me you can\'t do it because my magical power is too weak?"
"......Then I won\'t ask you to kill all of them.
 Let\'s see you just kill one.
 Right here, right now...!!"
As Asmodeus and Beelzebub held each other, they crouched down, cringing in fear under my glare.
......If they had been able to obey my order, they would probably have carried it out immediately.
{n}And yet, here they were crouching down.
......Empty.
 Sad.
 And pathetic......
That\'s right—I knew it.
 These girls can\'t touch reality with even a single one of their fingers......
"N‐...no, no...!!
 Belzie, I\'m scared, Belzieeeee!!"
"Ange‐sama, spare us, spare us...!!
 I don\'t want to diiiiiiiieee!!"
"Die, useless furniture!
 Why are you guys even alive?
 Why are you alive when your lives are worthless?
 You could just die.
 Die, please.
 Drop fucking dead!!
 Do you think there\'s anyone stupid enough to leave furniture lying around without a use?!"
""HiiiIiiI!!
 {m:-5:———}—gaaahh!!!""
"P‐please stop, Ange‐sama!!"
"......What is it, Mammon?
 Will you be the only one to fulfill my order?
 Of course you will.
 You\'re my best friend.
 ............You alone will do what the others wouldn\'t...
and {i:kill them}!"
"............A‐as you are now, Ange‐sama, ......even if you use us, you\'re not capable of committing murder!!
 It is the duty of furniture to help with things its master can do...!"
"Things that even the master can\'t do, we can\'t do...!!
 Do you hate these girls, Ange‐sama?
 You hate them, don\'t you?"
"I understand why you want to kill them, really, I do!!
 Alright, in that case, let\'s go ahead and kill them, Ange‐sama!
 If you will stain your own hands with blood, then we, the Seven Sisters of Purgatory, will go along with you however far! However far!!"
"......I\'m......asking you guys.........because I can\'t do it myself, aren\'t I......
 ......Isn\'t being able to do things I can\'t...the thing that makes you furniture?!!"
"Yes, we are furniture.
 Furniture to be used...!!"
"Please, go ahead and use us to kill!
 You\'ll be the one killing, Ange‐sama!!
 If you\'re saying that you want to kill, then go ahead, be my guest!
 No need to hesitate, please, go and carry it out right now!!"
"And once you have that level of mental resolve,
 once you\'re prepared to dirty your own hands—then, we will help you!
 But you haven\'t reached that stage!!"
"Pft, .........heheheheh, ahahahahaha...
 Ahahahahahahahaha, don\'t speak, you furniture.
 You DELUSION!!"
"I get it already, don\'t make me say it all out loud.
 ...You guys can\'t do anything.
 You are nothing more than my delusions, illusions, daydreams...!"
"I haven\'t had a single friend from the very beginning.
 You\'re just a phantom, a pretend friend lonely old me created inside my heart, aren\'t you?
 I knew that—from the very beginning!!!"
"Ahhahahahahahahahahahaha!!
 Yes, that\'s right!
 We\'re a fantasy inside your head, got a problem with that?
 Yes, it\'s truuue!"
"We\'re just imaginary friends,
 created to soothe lonely, lonely Ange‐sama\'s heart because she doesn\'t have a single solitary friend, wanna say something about it?"
"If you want to look at reality, just look at it.
 Stop looking at us and go back to being yourself over there, completely boxed in and bombarded with abuse!!"
"Go on then, go on, back you go, back to reality!!
 Just call on us only when it\'s convenient for you and pretend you have friends,
 set us on your enemies when you don\'t have the guts to dirty your own hands, and deny and erase us once you realize that\'s not gonna work!"
"Yes, I\'ll leave with a shriek of anguish just like you want, go ahead and enjoy it!!"
"Just copy the jeering that you\'re being bombarded with right now,
 and do the same to us to get it off your chest."
"That too is the duty of furniture!!
 Getting slammed against the floor when someone\'s pissed off is also a chair\'s important duty!!"
"If by that trifling service we manage to absorb our master\'s bad mood even for an instant,
 there can be no greater honor for furniture.
 Kill me, deny me, your first and final friend...!!!!!!!"
At the end, Mammon had a derisive expression on her face,
 ......but for some reason it looked like teardrops had scattered from her eyes.
Mammon, Beelzebub and Asmodeus smashed to pieces and rolled across the floor......
‘.........U‐......uryu..................’
"..................
 Come over here, Sakutaro.
 Ange is just a little agitated right now.
 ......So you mustn\'t get close."
‘What about the others?
 Are the Seven Sisters alive?
 Did they die...?’
"......It\'s alright.
 It looks very gruesome, but those are the remains of their vessels after they were forcibly evicted from the human world.
 They\'re shells that have been shed."
"......So it\'s alright.
 They\'re probably deeply hurt, but they\'re safe.
 They\'re all alive.
 I\'m sure we\'ll be able to meet them again someday."
‘Uryu...
 ......Thank goodness..........thank goodness............’
"......Ange, you violated the treaty of Mariage Sorcière.
 ......Doing such a horrible thing, ......even though witches of the alliance must respect and accept one another......
 They were all your precious friends......"
"No witches\' alliance has anything to do with this.
 Magic friends? Give me a break.
 .........I killed them, erased them.
 I smashed the Seven Sisters!"
‘Uryu......that\'s so cruel......so cruel.........’
"......Just give it a rest with this playing witches thing.
 .....Please.
 Maria onee‐chan and Sakutaro, I want you to disappear by yourselves.
 .........Because even amid my delusions, ......I don\'t want to kill or erase you."
‘W‐...we aren\'t delusions......
 We\'re your friends, Ange... Uryu.........!’
Sakutaro sobbed those words as he hid behind Maria onee‐chan.
.........Sakutaro doesn\'t exist.
Sakutaro is also...a delusion Onee‐chan created to distract herself from her loneliness.........
‘U‐......uryu, .........it hurts, ......it hurts, Maria......
 ......Why? Why...?
 Uryu.........uryu.........’
"Stop it.
 Denying my friend is the one thing I will not permit."
The same power that had smashed the Seven Sisters was probably eating into Sakutaro as well.
......But Maria onee‐chan was apparently protecting him with some other power.
So Sakutaro\'s form didn\'t break or scatter.
Onee‐chan glared at me sharply.
{n}......A serious expression that she had never shown me before.
"Sakutaro is my furniture.
 You cannot erase him, Ange.
 ......That you would try to deny him regardless is the greatest contempt you could show a witch."
"Sakutaro never existed in the first place.
 He\'s just a lion stuffed animal.
 Just a phantom you personified in the delusions inside your own mind!"
"Uu!!!
 That\'s not true!!
 Sakutaro is my friend!!
 He was a stuffed animal once, but now he isn\'t!!"
"No, he\'s a stuffed animal.
 A stuffed animal made of cloth and cotton!
 He can\'t move or talk by himself!
 You\'re just talking for him like a ventriloquist!"
"Is that what you call magic?
 Is that what you call a witch?!
 Is that what you call......a friend?!
 I can\'t accept that!!"
‘........................Uryu......
 .........Am I...
......not me......?’
‘......Am I......just a stuffed animal that...
can\'t really talk and...
.........not your...
...friend...
............after all............?’
‘U......ryu.........’
As though plagued by a high fever, Sakutaro weakened bit by bit.
As he clung to Onee‐chan\'s body, he did all he could to continue standing,
 ......but his body began to slip down bit by bit...
As he did, Onee‐chan held him, and screamed at me as tears streamed down her face...
"Uuuu!!
 Stop iiiit!!
 Don\'t burn Sakutaro with the anti‐magic toxin!!
 Don\'t bully him!!
 Don\'t insult him!
 Don\'t deny him!!!!!"
"*giggle*giggle*!!
 Maria onee‐chan, you\'re weeeeird!!
 There is no Sakutaro~!
 Stuffed animals are stuffed anima~ls!"
"I learned from Mama that they\'re made of cloth and cotton~!!
 There\'s no way they can walk or tal~k!!
 *giggle*giggle*giggle*, *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!!"
‘.........Uryu........................u...yu...............’
"Sakutaro!!
 Sakutaroo!!!
 He\'s not a stuffed animal, he\'s not a stuffed animal, he\'s a friend!!
 Uuu!!!
 Waa{0}aAA{0}Aa{0}a{0}aAa{0}a{0}aahhhh!!!!"
"*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!
 *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!
 I don\'t wanna play with stupid animals, let\'s all play outsi~de!!
 I\'m bored with animals no~w!!
 *giggle*giggle*giggle*!!"
"NO, you\'re not my friend any more!!
 Uu!!
 Why would you say that, I hate you I hate you I hate you I hate you!!
 I HATE YOU!!"
You\'re not my friend!!
 I won\'t let you be one of us witches anymore...!!
Upon my name, the Apprentice Witch of Origins {f:5:Maria},
 I hereby expel the apprentice witch {f:5:Ange} from the Mariage Sorcière Alliance of Witches......!!
.........And then.
...Those tranquil days of mine, now merely a waking dream, came to an end.
At this point, it\'s unverifiable.
No one can verify whether that really was magic, and those really were my friends,
 or else whether it was all nothing more than a daydream.
......I, the sole observer, concluded that those girls were a figment of my imagination.
......So that became the truth.
Perhaps, further in the future, I will observe it again, and when that happens, maybe I will acknowledge that it wasn\'t a dream,
 ......that the Seven Sisters really were my friends, and that along with Maria onee‐chan and Sakutaro,
 they did everything they could for me in my isolation.
..................Something so vague is neither the truth nor even an illusion.
Maybe the reality that\'s here and now is the only real world, with the real me.
Where is the real me?
The person standing among the girls\' shameful remains resembling broken glass sculptures,
 breathing harshly and shoulders heaving, ...that is not me.
The place {i:I} am......is over there.
The one boxed in by a crowd, the one being subjected to constant verbal abuse, ...the one hanging her head, with clearly red eyes.........
......The me over there,
 .........isn\'t {i:that} the real me......?
I won\'t...dream...anymore.
{n}Because there\'s nowhere...for me to run.
I\'ll...go back.
 ......I\'ll return myself...to the cage made of flesh......
"Hey!!
 Are you listening to us?!
 Standing there hanging your head forever won\'t solve anything, you know?!"
"..............................
 ......I hear you."
"Ah, you finally answered.
 Are you thinking that this\'ll end eventually if you just stay silent, or that we\'ll forgive you if you cry, or something like that?!
 We\'re asking if you are aware!
 We\'re asking if you are aware of the trouble you\'re causing those around you...!!"
.........I...slowly nodded.
 ...I admitted it.
I admitted that I had been spending my time in a waking dreamland, trying to remain separate from the others in my class.
......Those "friends" who had spoken to me with such kind and hopeful words,
 yet who couldn\'t offer me any help at all now in the moment I truly wanted it—
to move on from them and to sully them,
 ......I admitted it.
"...I, Ushiromiya Ange, caused trouble for my classmates by not having a cooperative attitude.
 The reason for it is nothing more or less than my excessive inferiority complex towards all of my classmates because of my inability to study.
 And.............................."
".........there\'s no point in me being alive."
Starting there, I was no longer reading the paragraph they had made me write.
......It was my...improvisation.
 And...what was in my heart.
They also noticed that it wasn\'t what they had anticipated,
 but while they did frown, no one spoke.
So I continued.
"......That\'s right.
 There was no point in my life continuing.
 ......I was meant to have been taken with them on that day in 1986.
 ......And yet, I was the only one who didn\'t get to be taken."
"......Why am I here, I wonder?
 ...This isn\'t the world I\'m meant to be in.
 ............No one will save me here."
"...For a time, ......I felt as though the fictional friends I created inside myself would save me.
 But those friends were nothing more than a delusion, ......and they did no such thing.
 After all, this isn\'t a fantasy world—it\'s the real world."
".........So, in short, ......up until today, ......I\'ve been living in a daydream.
 ...Averse to my real classmates, I lived only by interacting with the friends in my delusion.
 .........Just now, I split up with those friends.
 And here I am."
"............I have no family.
 I\'ve discarded my friends.
 ......There is no longer anything left for me."
"......Why haven\'t I died?
 One of you asked me that just now.
 ...I think you\'re absolutely right.
 Why.........am I alive, I wonder?
 ..................I should have been dead............in 1986.
 ...No, I did die then, I\'m sure of it."
"But even so, ............my soul that was killed is still locked up inside this cage of flesh.
 So I\'ll ask this of one of you.
 If no one responds, ......I\'ll do it myself."
"Someone,
 .....................please let me die."
I spoke that sentence, and looked around.
Dumbfounded girls.
{n}Shocked girls.
{n}Girls who looked like they didn\'t know what this kid was saying.
And, after a small delay,
 more and more girls with faces that said "Is this kid alright?"
Whisper whisper.
 Mutter mutter.
 And then, giggle giggle.
.........When I ordered my friends in my daydream to kill, they couldn\'t do it.
And so,
 I asked real {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s to kill,
 ......but of course, these girls can\'t do it either.
......In other words, both daydreams and reality are the same.
Doesn\'t that mean that everything, absolutely everything, this world included...
{n}............is all a daydream?
Then......what\'s the problem.
After all, ......on that day when I lost my entire family, ...I already died.
......All the days since have been the delusions of a wrongful survivor—delusions of a life flashing before my eyes.
Once I understood that, ...............it felt like all the scenery surrounding me began to twist and bend slightly.
.........Ah.
{n}...I\'m finally going to.........wake up.
{n}...I\'m going to be released...from this world of waking dreams.
I felt my consciousness sliding away.
......That\'s alright.
 Fade further and further away, ............and take me to my family......
Therefore, no matter what unfolded in this twisted, faded world, I paid it no mind at all.
I saw the crowd get pushed aside as a teacher stepped in.
Perhaps a teacher doing the rounds happened to notice a strange disturbance.
The teacher was vigorously shouting something, moving to protect me.
......Upon seeing that, and learning that an ally had appeared for me, even if only one,
 I felt my awareness return very slightly.
..................
......The only ones who can save me in the real world...are real {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s.
Never again.
 ......Never again will I seek salvation from daydreams.
.........This is the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} world.
The only ones who can save a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}...are other {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s......
"...........................
 ......Yes.
 If that\'s what you think, then that\'s your world, Ange."
‘......Can Ange...
...become happy this way.........?’
".........If Ange believes that is the only way to become happy, then it is the only way.
 ...If she cannot accept the blue bird in the cage for what it is,
 ...then she must go and search forever."
‘Uryu......
 ...Maria, are you......breaking off relations with Ange.........?’
"..............................
 ......No, nothing like that.
 I only did that because it was what Ange wanted.
 ......We witches are sometimes persecuted.
 However, we are always close by.
 ......And our aid will surely be sought."
‘......Will the day come.........when Ange will play with us again......?’
"It may be that it never comes, and we will simply be forgotten.
 ...In the human world, they call that growing up, or moving on.
 ............Still."
If Ange just remembers, we will always be by her side.
......And until then, ......we will be waiting...........................................
‘........................Uryu...
 .........Maria, ...answer me......’
"..........................."
‘.........Uryu...
 ......So I really am...
...a stuffed animal...?
 ......I\'m made of cloth and cotton,
 ......so there\'s no way I can...
talk......?
 ......Is that why...
...I can\'t talk to you.........?’
Sakutaro looked up at Maria sadly.
Maria\'s face was covered with tears, and she looked as though she had even lost the emotion of sadness......
"............Uu.
 ......I can hear you, Sakutaro.
 ......You aren\'t a stuffed animal made of cloth and cotton.
 .........You\'re my...friend.
 ..................Hate Ange.
 ......Uuu{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}uuu......"
‘Uryu... I\'m sorry Maria, I\'m sorry Maria......!
 Uryu......!’
Sakutaro felt regret.
 By freezing her heart, Maria had finally been able to escape from her sadness.
...By speaking up and calling her back, he had caused her to become overwhelmed with sadness again...
Sakutaro tried toddling up to Maria and hugging her, then letting go,
 gazing at her appearance uneasily and trying it again, lost as to how he could bring Maria\'s spirits up.
......He might have looked a little humorous doing that.
As a result, that was able to divert Maria\'s feelings from sadness......
"Sorry.
 .........More crying won\'t help anything."
‘You got in a fight with Ange, but you still have a lot of friends, Maria...
 Not just me.
 .........You have everyone else too.
 Sakusuke and Sakukichi, the animal band, and many, many more......’
Maria looked at the many stuffed animals around her pillow, which were gathered together as though they were having a conference.
‘......They\'re all...worried about you, Maria.
 They\'ve all been discussing and discussing how to cheer you up, you know......?’
"....................................
 ......They won\'t......go away...like Ange...?"
‘They won\'t.
 We\'ll always be together.’
".........Really?
 You\'re all only with me at home.
 Can\'t go out together when Mama\'s with us, and can\'t go together to school."
‘We aren\'t allowed to go to school, so you\'ll get in trouble if the teacher finds out.
 But if no one finds out, we can be together at any time.’
"......Sakutaro, you\'re big, so you\'d be found."
‘Then you can take some of the kids that are small enough to walk around with.
 ......For example...what about them?
 If you take the friends in the forest band,
 ......look, they\'re small, so they can hide in your pocket and go to school with you.’
".........There\'s a lot of them in the band.
 Can\'t fit them all in my pockets."
She gathered all of the forest band pieces that were scattered across her bed.
There were about as many of them as pieces in a chess set, so it would probably be impossible to fit them all in her pocket...
‘In that case, you can just take friends that you\'re especially close with.
 ......Why don\'t you take the four rabbits, the ones you\'re closest to in the forest band?’
"......Four could fit in my pocket.
 ......Yeah.
 This way, they won\'t be found."
‘So this way, you won\'t be alone even at school, Maria.
 Those kids will be with you even where I can\'t go.’
"...............Yeah.
 ......Maybe...won\'t be lonely that way.
 ......Maybe I can hold out......until I get home from school..."
‘As long as we aren\'t found by the teacher or Mama, we can be with you at any time.
 So let\'s be together forever, play together forever.
 We definitely won\'t leave you all alone, Maria.
 Uryu!’
Maria\'s expression finally regained a little of its brightness.
......That\'s right.
 Thinking about it, my world didn\'t start out with Ange in it.
Even without Ange, everyone was together and it was fun.
So it\'s weird to suddenly get sad just because Ange\'s gone when she was the last to come in.
...All that\'s happened is that I\'ve returned to the world right before Ange entered it.
{n}......So there\'s nothing to be sad about.
"......Yeah.
 Not lonely.
 Sakutaro and everyone else is with me."
‘Uryuu!
 Loooove you, Maria...!’
"I won\'t let any more {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s come into my world.
 ......Mariage Sorcière is an alliance only between me and {f:5:Beatrice}."
"......Even Beato opposed letting Ange join in the beginning.
 .........It\'s alright this way.
 Ange was still too young."
‘......Until you can be friends with Ange again, I think it\'s okay to forget about her for now.
 Just wait until you\'ve regained your high spirits, and then play with her again.
 Until then, all of us will be by your side.’
".........Thanks.
 ......Sakutaro, ......everyone."
Then, I once again regained my former world.
{n}I regained the world where I wasn\'t lonely, and where I was surrounded by many friends.
As always, I didn\'t have any {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} friends at school, but my magic friends were always with me.
Even during class, I could hear the rabbit band hiding in my pocket talking together and giggling, and they sounded like they were having a lot of fun.
Just listening to that added a lot of color to those lonely school hours.
I made sure that my other friends, too, were always with me, as long as Mama and the teacher wouldn\'t find out.
When Mama told me to go play outside, I would secretly pack Sakutaro and Sakusuke and the rest into my bag, and play together at the library or somewhere.
And when Mama was late coming home and I went shopping for dinner, I always went with them.
The men working at the convenience store were always nice to Sakutaro.
{n}Sometimes they even gave me two extra things for free, one for me and one for Sakutaro.
Whenever Mama found out, I would get in trouble for bringing Sakutaro and the rest outside.
Whenever the teacher found out, I would get in trouble for bringing toys to school.
The toxin must be strong in Mama and the teacher.
 That\'s why Sakutaro and the others just look like normal stuffed animals to them.
After all, the men at the convenience store say hello to Sakutaro.
.........Not all {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s are worthless.
 There are a ton of people who, unlike Ange and Mama and my teacher, can say hello to magic friends like I can......
"Oh, Maria‐chan.
 Welcome.
 Is your mama late coming home tonight too...?"
"Yeah.
 ......But Sakutaro\'s with me, so I\'m not lonely.
 Right, Sakutaro?"
‘Uryuu.
 It\'s not just me today.
 Other friends are also with us.’
"Oh, other friends?
 What kind of friends are with you today?"
"Today, the rabbits from the forest band are also with me.
 ......Look, they\'re in my pocket."
Maria began to line up four ceramic rabbit dolls on the register.
As the owner of the shop looked at them with a smile, he signaled a part‐timer with his chin.
The sign on the other register that said "closed" was taken down, and the part‐timer called out for everyone to move over there.
All of the people in line behind Maria formed a new line over there instead...
"Yes, I see.
 You sure have a lot of friends, Maria‐chan.
 But I hope your mama comes home soon."
"Uu.
 Mama is busy with work again, so she\'s staying at the company.
 She\'s very busy lately.
 ......She hasn\'t even been able to get much time to talk to me on the phone."
"But I\'m not lonely!
 I have Sakutaro and all the rest!
 Right?"
‘Uryuu!!’
"All of the rabbits in the band are with me too.
 Look.
 Kyuu‐kyuu{p:0:♪}"
"Is kyuu‐kyuu the sound a rabbit makes?
 Come to think of it, I\'ve never heard one."
After smiling at Sakutaro, who was poking his head out of her knapsack,
 she played around with the rabbit band on the register, making them frolic around.
Even as he gazed at this heartwarming sight, the shop manager had a slightly pitying look on his face.
......This was apparently a family without a father, and where the mother had to work hard and couldn\'t come home very often.
On top of that, it looked like this girl didn\'t even have any friends.
As he watched this girl play around happily with her dolls and claim that she wasn\'t lonely despite everything,
 he couldn\'t help but feel a kind of compassion.
And actually, this wasn\'t limited to him alone.
 Maria had become very famous in this shopping district...
"Maria‐chan, you should eat some oden every once in a while.
 You won\'t grow if you don\'t eat your eggs and fish paste."
"Uu?
 Can\'t get a cream roll...?"
‘Uryu.
 You need variety or you won\'t get big.
 How about oden for today?’
"Uu.
 ......Okay, I\'ll have oden."
"Yep yep, that\'s the ticket.
 Why don\'t I stick a whole bunch in there.
 Want mustard?"
‘Uryuu.
 I can\'t handle spicy things......’
"Alright, I see.
 Then, you make sure you don\'t let it spill on the way home.
 Best eat it while it\'s hot."
"Uu.
 Thank you."
She had planned on getting some sweet pastries for dinner like usual, but since oden had been recommended to her, she would be having that tonight instead.
Letting someone else determine the menu makes for an unexpected and interesting meal.
......Very often, Maria had to decide on her own what to have for dinner, so it was easy for the menu to get a little one‐sided.
 So it felt fun to look forward to a meal she hadn\'t anticipated...
‘Uryuu!
 Thanks for giving us extra, mister!’
"Send my regards to your other friends at home.
 No nibbling at it on the way home, now.
 Go straight home and eat it there."
"Uu!
 Thanks, mister!!"
Maria held the bag with the oden container high for all to see......
".................................
 .........Huh......?"
‘......Uryu?
 What is it, Maria?’
".........The key isn\'t in my pocket."
Standing in front of the door to her house, Maria searched and patted all over her body.
{n}......The key to the house wasn\'t there.
She always methodically put it in the same pocket.
 So there was no way she had put it in another pocket, but she searched her whole body just in case.
......It really wasn\'t there.
‘Did you drop it when you took your wallet out......?’
"No.
 Definitely felt it when I took my wallet out.
 Also definitely felt it when I checked my pocket on the way home."
"......It was there until partway.
 Didn\'t drop it!
 Uu‐uu‐uu...!"
The late autumn wind had been made bearable by the thought of the heater that was waiting at home,
 but now that Maria had lost her key and had no idea what to do, she was really feeling it.
But no matter how hard she searched, she couldn\'t find her key.
 She turned out all her pockets, and even tried taking off her jacket and hitting it, but to no avail.
......Of course, she also turned the knapsack Sakutaro was in upside down, but no key came out.
".........Uu.
 .........Uu‐uu‐uu!!!"
Something that should have been there...wasn\'t where it was supposed to be.
{n}Why isn\'t the key there, when I didn\'t do anything wrong?
......Why isn\'t it?!
{n}Why?!
 Why...?!!!
Maria stamped on the ground, cold and frustrated and angry...
{n}The bottom of her foot throbbed, but even so, it didn\'t lessen her frustration.
......Before long, bitter tears were pouring down her face.
"......Uu.
 ......Uu!!
 Uuuu!!"
It wasn\'t her fault.
 So it was someone else\'s.
But Maria didn\'t know who that someone was, and could do nothing but continue to let out a moan of anger.
‘......Uryu......
 You must have dropped it partway...
 Let\'s look for it, okay?
 Let\'s go back the way we came and search, okay...?’
"......Uu...
 I was excited to buy oden, ......and I got eggs and stuff for free......
 Can\'t eat it while it\'s hot......
 .........Uuuuu!!!"
‘...Maria......I know it\'s frustrating, but let\'s search, okay...?
 It\'s no one\'s fault... Let\'s search...’
Maria finally lent an ear to Sakutaro\'s words, and began to plod back the way she came.
......The wind was colder than it had been, and felt like it was blowing in through the gaps in her jacket to spite her...
‘Uryu...
 Let\'s watch our feet closely and search, okay...?
 And then let\'s get home quickly, and eat oden while getting warm by the heater, okay?
 I\'m sure it\'ll taste good.’
".........Uu.
 ......Not here.
 ......Uu.
 ......Not here..."
As Sakutaro encouraged her, Maria searched for the key...
But she made it all the way back to the convenience store where she\'d bought the oden.
{n}......She hadn\'t found it.
Just in case, she asked the man at the convenience store whether they had found a dropped key,
 but they hadn\'t found anything.
......One more time, she returned home, paying close attention to the area around her feet.
{n}But still—she didn\'t find it.
She was no longer frustrated enough to stomp her feet.
{n}......But hot tears dripped down her face.
The oden was stone cold.
...Even though the man at the shop had said to eat it while it was hot, she hadn\'t been able to.
......He had given her so much extra stuff for free......
‘......Uryu......
 Don\'t cry......
 ......Mama isn\'t coming back tonight.
 ......Let\'s do our best to search......’
".........Why can\'t I find it...
 ......Uuuu............uuuuuuuu!"
‘Maria, don\'t cry...!
 Let\'s do our best to search...!
 .........Maria......’
Maria was no longer able to hold back her tears.
Sobbing, clutching Sakutaro, and with the oden bag in her hand, she returned once more down the road she had come by.
Perhaps because it was now later at night, and more houses and stores had turned their lights off by now, it was even darker and harder to search than before.
......And, once again without finding the key, she returned to the convenience store.
"Maria‐chan,
 ......you still can\'t find your key...?"
"...Uu...
 ......Key, ......gone..."
"Your mother was away for the night?
 You can\'t get into your house without a key?"
"Uu......
 ......Can\'t get in......"
"Well, that is a pretty pickle...
 Did you try going to the police?
 It might have been handed in."
"...............Mama said not to talk to policemen, even if they start talking to me."
"Hm? Now why on Earth is that?"
"................................."
It was probably because Rosa felt guilty for making such a young girl as Maria watch over the house by herself,
 and because she knew that this was not socially acceptable.
So she had indoctrinated Maria into changing the stores she bought things at so that she didn\'t catch the eyes of adults,
 and saying no more than a greeting to policemen, even if they talked to her.
Maria had obediently done as she was told.
Instead of considering why she had to do that,
 honestly obeying because her mother had told her so was far more important to her.
But the manager of the convenience store probably didn\'t think of it that way.
......Naturally, seeing such a young girl being forced to watch over the house alone,
 and so frequently, would cause anyone to worry......
......And then.
 After making the round trip between her home and the store once more, and arriving at the convenience store for a third time...
...a policeman was there.
"That\'s the girl.
 ......Maria‐chan, did you find your key?"
".........Uu...
 ......Can\'t find it......"
"What\'s your name, little girl?"
"........................"
The policeman asked her name, but Maria didn\'t answer.
"Did your mother tell you not to talk with policemen?
 Hahah.
 Don\'t worry, no need to be scared of me.
 Have you eaten dinner yet, little girl?"
".........Bought it, but can\'t get into the house, so I can\'t eat it."
"What\'s your mother doing?
 Is she not coming home today?
 Is she working?"
"..................Uu."
"Do you know how we can contact your mother\'s work?"
"........................"
Maria hung her head limply.
......She didn\'t understand why the policeman was getting mad at her.
No, he probably wasn\'t getting mad at her, but if this reached her mother\'s ears, she would definitely be in trouble.
Even if she didn\'t understand the reason why she would be in trouble, she at least understood that much.
But the policeman wouldn\'t let Maria go.
{n}And her head was swimming from hunger.
The policeman noticed that, and it was decided that they could talk as they ate in the police box.
......I was taken to the police box.
 I had my oden heated in a microwave oven, and there were even {ruby:shio daifuku:salty rice cakes} and hot tea brought out for me.
I\'d been told not to talk to policemen,
 ......but as I answered questions about Sakutaro, I started to feel like he wasn\'t a bad person, and...
...I wouldn\'t be able to return home anyway, so I didn\'t know what to do, so...
.........I told him Mama\'s work phone number,
 ......which I wasn\'t supposed to tell anyone, and was told to use only in a very, very serious situation.
In the tatami room inside the police box, as I ate the oden that was so hot it felt like it would burn me,
 I watched the policeman making the phone call, and lazily thought, "......aah, I\'m probably going to get in trouble..."
"............Is Mama...going to be mad at me.........?"
‘......Uryu.........’
He must have been listening to the phone ringing for a very long time.
 With the receiver up to his ear, the policeman looked up at the clock and grumbled.
"............Maybe they aren\'t picking up because their business hours are over.
 ......Hmmmmmm.
 ......Ah.
 Hello?
 Hello?
 Is this Auntie Rosa Co., Ltd.?"
"This is the Komatsugawa Police Department police box in front of Senbonzakura Station.
 Is President...umm, {c:86EF9C:Udaikan}...no, sorry, President Ushiromiya‐san available?
 ............Yes.
 ......Whaat?
 {i:Vacation}?"
"Yes.
 The president\'s off for three days starting yesterday.
 Umm, perhaps I could be of assistance...?"
"Oh no no no, that\'s quite alright.
 So, do you know where she may be?
 Have you heard how she can be contacted, by any chance?"
"Uhh, ......would you mind waiting for just a moment?
 ...............Hey, anyone know where the president\'s taking her vacation?
 How to get hold of her?"
"Heard she was going for all‐you‐can‐eat crabs in Sapporo with her boyfriend.
 Lucky girl, cold places are great for bringing a couple closer together, don\'t you think?
 Haven\'t heard how to get in touch with them."
"Okie‐dokie.
 ......Uhh, hello.
 I hear she went to Sapporo, but I\'m not sure about how to reach her.
 ......Can I take a message?"
"Hmm, I see... That\'s awkward.
 Well, if you make contact with her again, could you tell her that we called?
 Yes, that\'s right."
......After that, I was taken to the police station, which was bigger than the police box,
 and they said I could spend the night there.
And they asked me all kinds of things about myself.
A lady who called herself the district welfare officer came by and asked about various things.
And she said to me, "You poor thing".
{n}When I heard that, I learned for the first time.
"............Am I.........a poor thing......?"
‘......Uryu......
 That\'s not true... You\'re happy, Maria......’
"...............Uu..."
And......Rosa came back.
Maria was told to go to her room,
 ...but on her way back from the bathroom, she hid by the entrance to the living room and listened in on the exchange.
The person who had come to visit...was the female district welfare officer who had asked Maria various questions the other day.
"Don\'t be so pushy!!
 Maria\'s heart is too innocent and delicate, so if there was an insensitive kid there, she could be hurt!!
 Please stop your unwanted meddling!!"
"But in that case, ma\'am,
 if the child is so delicate, why leave her home all alone?
 Shouldn\'t a mother be there for her child?"
"I am here for her as much as I can be!!
 I have no idea what makes you think I need ordering around...!!"
"Really?
 She is very well known in this area, you know.
 They say that your daughter frequently goes out at night to buy things and eat.
 Everyone was worried and looking out for her."
"How do you know that was my child?!!
 Children are a dime a dozen around town!!
 Don\'t just assume that it\'s my Maria!!"
"Kids sometimes walk around outside at night, don\'t they?!
 How can you prove that all of those are my child?!"
"A girl holding a lion stuffed animal often came around to eat dinner and buy things.
 She was very famous around the shopping district."
"Everyone treated Maria‐chan with care out of concern for her.
 Sometimes, people even escorted her home, thinking the streets might be dangerous at night."
"Y‐you can find lion stuffed animals anywhere!!
 It was none of their business, escorting her home!!
 Are they thinking of kidnapping her or something?!"
"Don\'t fuss over Maria!!
 Maria is my child.
 I am raising her!
 I have absolutely no intention of putting her in some strange institution!!
 Stop your needless meddling!!"
‘U‐......uryu......
 Does that lion stuffed animal...
...mean me......?’
"......It\'s alright.
 I\'m the one who\'s in trouble...
 It has nothing to do with you, Sakutaro......"
Maria hugged Sakutaro, continuing to watch her mother fearfully...
"I, I also wish I could be with Maria every day!"
"But I\'m a single mother, so I have to work!
 I may not look it, but I\'m a president of a company, and I bear the responsibility for my employees\' well‐being!!
 I\'m busy with my work all year round, there\'s no time for me to rest!!"
"{i:Really}?
 But you\'ve been off work for the last three days, haven\'t you?"
"I, I have not been off work!
 I\'ve been staying at my company for several nights working!!
 There\'s a mountain of matters to be taken care of that the other unreliable employees can\'t handle!!"
"Why are you lying like that?
 The people at your company told us that you were taking a three‐day vacation, you know?
 You went to Hokkaido with your boyfriend, right?
 Leaving your daughter by herself for three whole days...!"
"I, I don\'t know anything about any boyfriend I don\'t know anything about Hokkaido!!!
 Why are you coming out with all this nonsense?!
 Why, why?!
 Do you have any proof?!

 What\'s wrong with you, don\'t just start butting in on someone else\'s family matters!!"
"I love Maria, I have my own way of loving her, so just keep your mouth shut!!
 I didn\'t go on a vacation, I was working the whole time, I was working!!"
"I was trying to finish things up at work with all my strength, all my strength because I wanted to see Maria as soon as I could!!
 I stayed at the company working and working and working and working and working, working and working and working and working!!"
"I don\'t know anything I don\'t know anything, I don\'t know anything about Hokkaido, don\'t come in saying all this!!! Uuuaaaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}AAa{0}a{0}aAA{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}AAHHH!!!
 Please, just go!!
 Just go!!!!!
 What is wrong with you?!?!
 Just go!!
 JUST GO{-}O{-}O{-}O{-}O{-}O{-}O{-}OOO!!!"
Rosa raged, her hair flying wildly.
She stood up with such force that her teacup fell over,
 and far louder than that noise was the sound of her beating the table with both hands.
When faced with this rage that could accurately be described as wide‐eyed derangement,
 the female welfare officer couldn\'t help but be taken aback.
......And the same went for Maria, who was secretly watching this from the hallway.
She had seen her mother enraged several times before.
{n}But she had never seen her go this berserk with anger.
Seeing this, Maria was sure.
{n}......This was no longer her mother.
It was some other evil being that was possessing her mother\'s body...
And then, the evil being discovered her.
{n}Maria learned that she was being reflected in the evil being\'s eyes.
Her mind went blank, and she felt as though her field of vision was racing off into the distance......
After fiercely closing in on Maria, Rosa mercilessly bore down on her small shoulders,
 ......and dropped her gaze onto the stuffed animal Maria was holding: Sakutaro.
".........Maria.
 Even though I told you so many times not to bring that outside,
 ......you brought it with you, didn\'t you?"
‘U‐......uryu.........
 I‐it\'s not Maria\'s fault......
 I said I\'d come with her......’
"Th‐that\'s not true......!
 I brought Sakutaro on my own because I was lonely...!
 So Mama, it\'s not Sakutaro\'s fault...!!"
‘Uryu...... Maria.........’
"It\'s not Sakutaro\'s fault!!
 It\'s not Sakutaro\'s fault!!"
The brunt of Rosa\'s anger was aimed, not at Maria, but at the lion stuffed animal Maria was holding.
......A girl came shopping in the middle of the night, always clutching a lion stuffed animal.
Because of that, she had become well known in the shopping district...
"I,
 ......I,
 ...I told you not to take stuffed animals with yo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}ouuu!!!
 Why—!!
 Can\'t you—!!
 Listen to what Mama says!!"
"Why?!
 Why, why?!
 Why can\'t you follow Mama\'s ru{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}ules!!"
With every single word, she stamped her heel and banged furiously on the wall.
......Admittedly, she wasn\'t making direct contact with Maria.
However, the violence of that harsh sound certainly beat against her.
"M‐Ma\'am...... Stop that......!!"
"Let go!!
 I said let go, damn iiiiiiiiiiiit!!"
The welfare officer had come back to her senses and put Rosa in a full nelson.
But the instant Rosa was touched, she went wild, furiously throwing the welfare officer off.
......She hit the table and fell to the ground.
 A teacup on the table smashed on the floor, making a violent sound...
‘M‐......Maria didn\'t do anything wrong......!
 It\'s my fault!
 So don\'t scold Maria......!!’
"I\'m the one who brought Sakutaro...!!
 It\'s not Sakutaro\'s fault!!
 It\'s not Sakutaro\'s fault!!
 So don\'t look at Sakutaro with those scary eyes!!
 Don\'t look at hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiim!!"
‘Don\'t scold Maria...!
 Don\'t scold Maria...!!
 Uryuuu!!!’
"........................Wh‐.........what in the...
 Just what do you think you\'re doing?"
"Did you...also play with dolls like that......outside?
 Did you do it in front of the people at the store......?"
"........................
 Then OF COURSE they remembered yoooooooou,
 THINK a little, you idiot!! Why are you such a DUMBAA{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}AAASSS!!!"
"Answer me honestly.
 When you went out shopping, you always walked around with that stuffed animal without telling Mama, right?"
‘.........U‐......uryu.........’
"Stop using that weird stuffed animal talk!!!
 Speak with your own words, not a stuffed animal\'s!!!"
"S‐Sakutaro isn\'t a stuffed animal!!
 He\'s my friend!!
 Don\'t call him a stuffed animal......
 Dooo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}oon\'t!!"
"Yes, yes, fine, Sakutarou, it was called Sakutarou!
 You took that Sakutarou doll with you all the time when you went shopping, without telling Mama, right?"
"Y‐......yeah..............."
Maria admitted it honestly.
If she hadn\'t admitted it, then Sakutaro would have said something to take the blame,
 so by admitting it right away, she was protecting her small friend.
"Only Sakutarou?
 Any others?
 ......You haven\'t...been bringing weird things to school too, have you...?"
"......M‐Ma\'am!!
 This is not your daughter\'s fault!
 Stop this interrogation at once!"
"You bite your tongue!!!
 I am talking with my daughter!!!
 ......Alright, Maria, look at Mama when you talk.
 What\'s the answer to Mama\'s question?"
"U‐......uu......
 ......Not just Sakutaro.
 ......All the rabbits too......"
".........Do you have them with you now......?"
"Uu........."
Maria fished around in her pocket,
 ......and pulled out those four ceramic rabbits with her tiny hand...
The rabbits were her precious friends, who could go to school with her in Sakutaro\'s place.
But when Rosa saw that, she shook her head slightly as though dizzy...
In Maria\'s {c:86EF9C:communication booklet}, a note had been written that Maria was apparently bringing toys to school and playing with them,
 and it requested Rosa to give her home instruction to try to prevent this.
But Rosa had dismissed the teacher\'s comment as faultfinding, and on the contrary, had phoned the school to make a complaint of her own.
...Saying that there was no way her child would bring toys to school.
For nearly an hour, she had shouted at the vice principal to stop making false accusations about her daughter.
......To a certain degree, the school grasped that Maria was a pitiful girl.
They knew that the small toys she brought in were her only friends.
......So they had done their best to overlook it.
But when the other students caught sight of them,
 some of the boys started complaining that only she was allowed to bring toys, and the school had racked their brains on how to cope with this......
They had tried to gently send a warning by way of the mother,
 but after Rosa\'s overreaction, even Maria\'s teacher had decided to overlook it.
.........But now Rosa knew.
She had been the one who was wrong, ...and her daughter really had been bringing toys into school.
.........And the school...
had seen the sorry sight of her bringing toys into school and playing with them as her only friends.
To Rosa, who knew her daughter was a little different from normal children,
 having this peculiar side of her daughter exposed and found fault with was more unbearable than anything.
.........So she howled.
 She raged.
The welfare officer tried to cut between Rosa and Maria again,
 but she only met with Rosa\'s wrath again.
Rosa once again threw the woman off with a face like a demon,
 and when even that failed to curb her anger, she stomped on the ground over and over again so forcefully that it seemed she might break through the floor.
Then, after seeming to come back to her senses for just a second,
 .........she suddenly froze her rough breathing, and asked Maria.
"........................
 ......Maria.
 Those rabbits in the band, are they your close friends?"
"U‐.........uu........."
"I see.
 I\'m glad you have a full four friends."
As she said that, Rosa took one of the rabbits from Maria\'s hand.
Then, she shoved it in front of Maria\'s eyes so she could see it very well.
......It was a cute little doll, like a chess piece, of a rabbit holding a trumpet.
She slowly lifted it into the air.
......Of course, Maria\'s and Sakutaro\'s eyes also followed it......
And then, with a speed that the eye couldn\'t follow, she hurled it against the wall.
"Eek—!!!!"
‘...............!!!’
She had half‐imagined that this worst possible thing might happen.
{n}So she instantly realized what had been done.
......So Maria let out a short, despairing scream...
It was in pieces.
It had been small and sturdy, but not enough to accept her mother\'s fierce rage.
".........Because you didn\'t listen to what Mama told you, one of them broke.
 From now on, every time you disobey something Mama says, I\'ll break another one.
 ......Remember that!!!"
"You......you call yourself a mother after doing something like that?!!
 You think you can do something like that without hurting your daughter?!"
"Hurt {i:Maria}?!
 I\'m hurting too, you know?!
 Who\'s gonna take responsibility for {i:my} wounds?!
 Weeeell?!
 WHOOOOOOOO!!!
 I told you to bite your tongue!!!!!"
"S‐stop it, Mama......!
 It\'s my fault...!
 Don\'t get mad at this lady......!"
‘It isn\'t Maria\'s fault... It\'s mine......!
 Don\'t get mad at Maria...!
 Uryu, uryu‐uryu‐uryu, uryuuu!’
"I, .........I told you to stop playing make‐believe with that stuffed animaaaaaaaal!!
 In the first place, it\'s disturbing, a stuffed animal is your friend? Just how old are you this year?!
 How old?!
 Weeelll?!"
"This is just a gross, crappy stuffed animal made of cloth and cotton!!
 Is this the only kind of friend you have?!
 If you have enough time on your hands to play make‐believe friends with this monstrous stuffed animal, go out and make some real human friends instead!!"
"Why is it that time goes on and on and you still can\'t make any friends?!!
 That\'s why your class always treats you like a weirdo and makes fun of you!!
 Cut it out, give it a rest, get ahold of yourself already!!
 Grow up from this stuffed‐animal play!!"
‘Uryu......
uryu.........’
"I said...stop playing make‐believe...with that stuffed animaaaaaaaal!!"
"Aaah!!
 Mama, Mama!!
 Give him back!
 Give Sakutaro baaaaaaaaaaack!!"
‘Uryuu!!
 Uryuuu!
 Uryu‐uryuu!’
Mama grabbed hold of Sakutaro\'s head, and snatched him from me...
{n}Then.........she smashed him against the wall, over and over.
‘Uryuu!!
 It hurts, it hurts, ow‐ow‐ow‐ow...!!’
"Fucking STOP!!
 Fucking STOP playing make‐believe with this stuffed animal!!!!!
 It\'s because of this stuffed animal!!"
"That\'s why you can never make any friends!
 That\'s why you\'re the only one in your class who sticks out like a sore thumb, and gets treated like a weird kid!!
 I should never have given you a stuffed animal like this!!
 I should never have given you this disgusting stuffed animal!!"
"Stop iiiiiiiiiiiit!!"
"Give Sakutaro back, give Sakutaro back!!
 WaaaA{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}A{0}a{0}a{0}AahHH!!
 Sakutaro is my friend!!
 My best friend!!
 I don\'t need anything else if I just have Sakutaro!
 So give him back!!
 Give him baaaaaaaack!!"
......For some reason, my frantic request just added oil to the fire of Mama\'s anger......
As I pulled on Sakutaro trying to take him back, Mama pushed my arm aside,
 and in a bizarre way, she stuck her fingernails on both hands deep into Sakutaro, twisting him......
The red scarf, which I had carefully wrapped for him every day, came undone and fell to the floor...
......Sakutarou, who had been so, so precious to me......
He was crumpled, twisted, torn at with fingernails so much......
He was twisted in pain...
his face grimacing...
so sadly.........
Then Mama\'s fingernails...
...found a stitch on the neck
......and tore it...
......With the fingernails of both hands
......she tore him apart............
In that instant,
 .........Sakutaro\'s yellow cloth,
 .........and the cotton inside, ...burst apart......
It looked almost like moist cotton candy......
‘......U‐...............ryu.....................’
"...kutaro............?"
‘......Ma......ria.........’
".........Sakutaro............"
‘U......ryu......{m:-5:―――}’
"...............kutaro............"
‘{m:-5:―}―...... . . .   .         ’
".........ta...ro........."
‘’
...
.........The crumpled yellow cloth and the cotton candy that was flowing out were thrust right in front of my eyes.
Then, ......through Mama\'s face, the evil being...stated it clearly.
"{i:Sakutarou is dead}."

"{f:5:Maria}...... ......{f:5:Maria}.........
 ...Do not cry......"
"{f:5:Beatrice}, {f:5:Beatrice}...!!
 Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!
 Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!"
"Sakutarou was a good friend...
 As long as you do not forget that, he will always be with you...
 So do not cry..."
"Bring him back to life!!
 You can use a lot of magic, Beato!!
 You can bring Sakutaro back to life as well, right?!"
"............A‐about that......
 ...Of course, if Sakutarou had been my furniture, it would be easy.
 However, Sakutarou is your furniture.
 ......That makes it difficult for me."
"Difficult but not impossible, right?!
 Bring him back to life!!
 Bring him back to life with the Endless Magiiiiiic!"
".........Hmm...
 ......To tell the truth...
 Sakutarou\'s vessel was a stuffed animal Rosa made herself, correct...?
 That Rosa has denied Sakutarou.
 ......A life that is not permitted by its own mother cannot exist..."
{f:5:Beatrice}\'s words were feeble.
...Because she knew that, no matter what the excuse,
 it wouldn\'t be enough to calm Maria and make her accept it.
But she had to communicate the painful truth to her disciple and close friend.
.........She had to tell her the fact...
...that even with all of her own magic, even she could not revive Sakutarou.
"As long as you continue to strongly believe in Sakutarou\'s existence, his soul will not disappear......
 So, {f:5:Maria}, ...please, do not be sad...
 Even now, look, ...you must believe that Sakutarou is smiling right over there......"
"No!!!
 No
 no
 no!!
 You have to bring Sakutaro back to life!!
 No no no!
 WaaA{0}AAa{0}a{0}a{0}aAAa{0}a{0}aAa{0}aAahhhh!!"
"Give up...!!
 There is no magic to revive Sakutarou...!
 You must strongly believe that even in spite of that, Sakutarou will continue to exist as your close friend...!!
 That power will become magic...!"
"That\'s not magic, that\'s not magic!!
 You have to bring Sakutaro back to life...!!"
"Can\'t you do it because Mama made him herself?
 Why did Mama make Sakutaro?
 Wasn\'t it to give him to me as a present?
 Wasn\'t it to make him my friend?"
"But why...did Mama make him herself...and break him herself?
 Why did Mama create him herself, and try to break him herself?
 Don\'t get it, don\'t get it!!"
"Hate Mama, hate Mama...!!
 Can\'t stand it, can\'t stand it, it\'s too much, it\'s too much...!!
 Want to twist Mama up like she did to Sakutaro...!
 Want to stick my fingernails in and tear her, turn her into cloth and cotton!!"
"Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!
 Can\'t stand it, I can\'t stand it, {f:5:Beatriceeee}!!
 Waa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhh, Sakutaroooooooo!!!!"
From the darkness behind Maria\'s back, two massive jet‐black arms crept out,
 coiling around Maria as she sobbed in anger.
Then massive fingernails stuck into Maria\'s chest and stomach......
Maria could not see them.
{n}......But Beato could.
Anger and sadness without any place to go will tear you apart.
......Beato knew that.
 She could see that.
Yes.
 ......In the end, those massive arms were Maria\'s own.
Those fingernails slowly started to dig into her chest and stomach......
......With their immense size and strength,
 those arms would probably tear Maria into bits easily......
But Maria herself couldn\'t notice.
Drowning in a sea of her own tears, ......she couldn\'t notice that her own arms were trying to tear apart her own chest......
"Can\'t stand it, can\'t stand it...!!!
 If Sakutaro can\'t be brought back to life no matter what, ......I want revenge!!
 Want to make the same thing happen to Mama!!
 Want to make her suffer the same thing as Sakutaro...!"
"{f:5:Beatrice}!!
 Teach me magic for that!!
 Teach me magic to get back at Mama...!!"
".................................
 ......Are those your true feelings?"
"I\'ll kill Mama!!
 I\'ll kill her!!
 No, that\'s not Mama!
 It\'s the bad witch possessing Mama!
 I\'ll kill the witch Mama!!
 Uuu{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}uuu!!"
"........................
 ......Very well.
 I shall give you that power.
 ......If you, beautiful of heart, shall otherwise be torn asunder by your own hand...
...then I find your heartless mother, who brought such suffering upon you, considerably more deserving of such a fate."
"...............I shall teach you.
 ......Of the abyss in the world of witches, of the depths where no light reaches......"
"Uuuuuuuu, Sakutaro, Sakutaro...!!
 I hate everyone, I hate them, I HATE THEM!!
 Hate Mama, hate Ange!!
 Hate everyone, EVERYONE!!
 Uuuuuuwaa{0}a{0}aaAAA{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}AAAAHHH......!!"I had been trying to take a nap, ......but the boat really was shaking bad.
I gave up on sleeping and went up onto the deck.
{n}I was welcomed by the shining sun and a strong sea breeze...
Up on the deck, Amakusa was doing some stretches.
......He probably has a lot of time on his hands too.
{n}It\'ll still take a while longer to reach Niijima.
It would only have taken on the order of half an hour by airplane, but there was the chance that the Sumaderas\' net extended over Niijima airport.
The harbor would probably be the same.
 For that reason, I had obtained a boat that would let me land while avoiding the harbor, with no questions asked.
I\'d bumped into a cheery boat captain,
 treated him with generosity, and he had decided to help me out, amused......
"Still going to be a while?"
"I just asked the captain, and it sounds like it\'ll take a full two hours more.
 Well, beggars can\'t be choosers."
".........The weather sure is nice.
 Feels like I\'ll burn."
"Going to read on the deck?
 You\'ll damage your book."
Amakusa apparently got that idea because I was clutching Maria onee‐chan\'s diary under my arm.
I\'d been reading it as I tried to fall asleep, which was why I had come back up still carrying it.
"How\'s it going?
 Think you\'ll be able to find the truth of Rokkenjima from Maria‐san\'s diary?"
"............Who knows.
 No matter how much I investigate what happened on that island, it won\'t make for anything more than a theory.
 There\'s no truth written in the message bottles or Onee‐chan\'s diary, just a fairy tale with a witch walking around.
 ......I\'m stuck."
"Looks like you\'re just going to have to bank on what you can get out of the relevant people on Niijima."
"I imagine the Witch Hunters have subjected them to endless questioning, so I\'m pretty sure I won\'t find any new facts."
"Hehhaha...!
 So even though your hopes are that low, you\'re willing to spend a half‐day trip on a boat to go to Niijima anyway! You really are fickle."
".........It\'s like a journey of self‐satisfaction, so that I can say "I investigated".
 I\'m not so naive as to seriously think that I can unlock the truth of twelve years ago."
"When you\'ve finished with your self‐satisfaction, what do you plan to do?"
"Who knows.
 Haven\'t thought about it.
 .........I\'ll go to Niijima, ask some questions of people related to all this.
 ...Then, after going to Rokkenjima in the end and leaving some flowers, my journey will be over."
.........Several days had already passed since this journey began.
After being told by {f:5:Bernkastel} on the roof of that building...
to search for the truth of twelve years ago, I left on a journey akin to trying to grasp a cloud.
At the time, I felt something mystical about it, and I remember feeling as if I might be able to grasp some kind of miracle at the end of this journey.
......But several days are enough to bring a person back down from that high.
As I stood on the roof of that skyscraper that day, my heart had nowhere left to go—it was completely dead.
......Wanting from the bottom of my heart to be released from the cage of my body and rise into the sky,
 ......I crossed the fence in order to die.
Maybe experiencing the desire to die and actually stepping forwards, throwing my body down...
caused some kind of mystical experience inside my head, making me think I had received a message from a witch.
.........The more the excitement from jumping down lessened over time, and the more I came back to my senses, the more this journey lost its meaning.
But I\'d never considered suspending this journey just because of that.
If I stopped this journey, it would mean acknowledging that the message from that witch was an illusion.
And I felt as if that meant throwing away the promise the witch had made,
 and any chance that someone from my family might come back.
So, I\'m continuing this journey because I want to believe in that illusion.
I don\'t seriously believe that this journey will change anything.
{n}......I\'m even free to end it at any time.
 It\'s up to me to choose where the final destination is.
In the end, this journey is only for my personal self‐satisfaction......
"............Self‐satisfaction, is it.
 It sounds bad when you say it out loud, but I think that actually, that\'s life."
"......Heh.
 If that\'s the answer you reached after crawling across the line between life and death in the mercenary business, that\'s probably pretty deep."
"Don\'t just laugh it off.
 What I\'m trying to say is that there\'s no {i:self} about it—in this world, the only one {i:capable} of satisfying you is yourself."
Amakusa continued stretching as he spoke.
{n}In an annoyingly eloquent way.
Hearing it told to me as though from a teacher made me instinctively want to resist, but what he was saying was extremely sensible.
".....................
 ......That may be true."
"People work hard when they want to satisfy someone.
 ......In most cases, that someone is their parents.
 Children learn how to work hard because they want to be praised by their parents.
 .........Of course, that\'s why I never learned."
"Sorry, that\'s not what I intended to say."
"......What I want to say is that self‐satisfaction is {nobr:A‐OK}.
 No matter who praises you, it\'s meaningless unless you yourself are satisfied.
 ......Turning it around, even if no one praises you, that doesn\'t matter as long as you\'re satisfied yourself."
".........Self‐satisfaction and self‐improvement contradict each other, so we\'re usually taught that the former is bad.
 Your argument is kind of a breath of fresh air."
"The anguish of the human world comes when you want to satisfy someone, you want recognition, but you don\'t know where to put the effort.
 I had a time like that too."
"I wanted recognition, but I didn\'t know what I wanted recognition {i:for}.
 And since I didn\'t know what I was meant to put effort into, or how much, or even who I wanted to give me that recognition,
 I did a lot of crazy things."
"And the answer you reached......was self‐satisfaction?"
"It sounds bad, but that\'s how it is.
 Rich is the one who is content with what they are, they say."
".........If I\'ve decided this is the life I\'m happy with, no one has any right to tell me any different.
 It\'s the same for your life, and for this journey.
 No one has any right to object other than you yourself."
"You are the only one who determines the meaning and worth of your journey.
 If it turns out to have been a meaningful journey for you, then that\'s more than enough."
"...........................
 .........I thought you were the kind of guy who never takes things seriously, but you really do say some weird things every once in a while.
 I\'ll bet you think saying things like that every now and then will make you a hit with the ladies."
"You\'ve got me all wrong.
 That\'s not why I said it.
 .........It looks like you want to be alone.
 I\'ll be over with the boat captain.
 Please, take your time."
It seemed Amakusa had decided I was in a bad mood.
{n}......Although I didn\'t feel that way myself.
Maybe he had just finished a set of stretches and wanted to cool off in the shade.
The sea winds were strong, but not enough to take the edge off the rays of the sun.
Amakusa disappeared.
 Only I remained.
".........Self‐satisfaction is life, he says."
"That\'s just boring.
 Life is nothing without greed."
I noticed that Mammon had suddenly appeared, her full hair streaming out in the wind by the prow of the ship.
"It\'s true that a life of greed would be fun.
 But unlike you, {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s have a limited lifespan."
"If a person remains greedy for eternity, that means that they have desires even in the last moment before they die.
 Having desires means that there\'s something they want.
 Something they don\'t have, some way they aren\'t complete."
"......I\'m sure it\'s tough to die when you can\'t think of yourself as being fulfilled.
 So I\'m sure self‐satisfaction is actually necessary."
".........I see.
 Then beings with lifespans need to make that kind of compromise?
 Our masters always had very long lifespans, so I\'ve never thought of it."
"I wonder if {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s live so that they can be satisfied.
 ......If so, to seek nothing is probably the easiest way to live.
 ...Yes, it makes sense why greed is one of the seven deadly sins."
"*giggle*.
 Your praise honors me."
Apparently that counted as praise in Mammon\'s eyes.
{n}She turned and gave a graceful curtsy.
"Ange‐sama.
 Do {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s live so that they can be satisfied at the moment of their death?"
"......It must be pretty tough to be somehow incomplete at the moment of your death, right?"
"If so, then {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s live only so that they can have a satisfying death.
 They live so that they can have a better death.
 They live to die."
............Wow, that\'s a hell of a thing to say.
{n}...Yes, I should have expected that from a demon stake.
However, her words might be the truth.
 Humans suffer because they aren\'t whole, and live only to be made whole.
That might be the same, in other words, as a desire to die—to die while whole.
"I have no argument against that.
 ......People live in order to be content.
 And they hope to die while still content.
 So, not knowing how to make yourself content, make yourself complete, is very tough."
"How does a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} do that?
 Make their life complete."
".........Receiving validation, acceptance.
 That they\'re happy."
"If it doesn\'t matter who accepts you, then I\'ll do it myself, if you like."
"Yes, that\'s just it.
 .........People don\'t know whose acceptance they need."
"So, searching for that person to accept them is the journey of life?
 Hmmmm."
"It sounds strange, doesn\'t it?
 Whether you find acceptance or not, it shouldn\'t change your circumstances.
 ......And yet, if you find acceptance you\'ll be whole, and if you don\'t then you won\'t."
"...It\'s almost like the blue bird.
 ......Even though the blue bird is already in the cage, you can\'t notice it, so you have to go out on a journey searching everywhere."
"What the heck.
 Kyahhahaha.
 Human lives sure are stupid."
"That\'s right.
 Amakusa really hit on something.
 ......Rich is the one who is content with what they are...was it?
 I don\'t know where that proverb came from, but it\'s deep."
"......In short, if you won\'t be fully content unless you have someone\'s acceptance, that\'s the same as not being able to accept yourself.
 ......Turns out the ultimate self‐fulfillment begins with self‐acceptance."
"Well, of course.
 Because if you can become aware that you\'re fulfilled, there\'s no need for anyone else\'s acceptance.
 Just by taking notice of that small little thing, a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}\'s foolish lifelong journey can be ended easily."
"Then they can spend the rest of their life effectively, playing and having a good time.
 A {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}\'s life is so ridiculous, kyahhahahaha!"
Mammon\'s choice of words was bad, but it was surely the truth.
If most of a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}\'s life...
is a journey wishing for someone\'s acceptance so that they can achieve a satisfied death...
.........then the moment they realize that the person to accept them is not someone else, but them themselves, they can end that pointless journey.
Humans who have finished that journey can probably spend the rest of their lives as they wish with their heads held high.
......How sublime, how praiseworthy would that be.
"You know,
 it seems Amakusa\'s on pretty bad terms with his parents.
 ......Makes sense, right?
 Amakusa\'s in the kind of trade that any sane parent would want their kid to wash his hands of."
"Why does it matter?
 If he\'s enjoying it."
".........Exactly.
 That\'s what it comes down to in the end.
 Your worth as observed by others doesn\'t matter."
"If your existence is firmly accepted by you yourself, that\'s enough.
 ......If you can live with confidence in yourself, surely you can accept and find satisfaction in any kind of lifestyle."
"I\'m sure Amakusa will eventually eat a stray bullet on the battlefield and get seriously injured.
 ...He might even die."
"But I don\'t think Amakusa will think of it as unfair.
 I\'m sure he\'d cackle about how that too is life."
"What a great way to live.
 I\'m enchanted."
"......Pitiful {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s who can\'t accept themselves...
wander about searching for it their whole lives, doing nothing but grumbling and complaining, unable to come to terms with anything, ultimately dying while still unfulfilled."
"......How pitiful.
 Compared to people whose lives drag on without any purpose,
 Amakusa is more likely to eventually die by the roadside, but I think he\'s much more noble for living his life with his chest stuck out."
"Maybe the enlightened are the winners in life?
 If you can come to that realization even a little sooner, you\'ll be able to put that much more of your life to good use."
.........At those words of Mammon\'s,
 ......I finally came to terms with a certain fact.
I had......described her as an abnormal kid, a little strange.
However,
 ......that wasn\'t the case.
She had simply...
......finished that journey faster than anyone else, and taught herself to keep her own chin up and live with confidence.
".....................Maybe {i:that\'s} what made Maria onee‐chan...so amazing.
 She had already reached that point at the age where she was only just about to begin elementary school."
Other people like us, looking at her life from the outside, couldn\'t call it happy by any standard.
But even though such days were engraved in her diary,
 ......the entries always finished up by saying it was a happy day.
Even though you can catch glimpses of her mother\'s lack of love for her,
 in spite of that, she believed that her mother did love her.
The mother\'s love that didn\'t exist, she created herself, filling her world with love.
Others observed her as an unfulfilled, pitiful girl,
 ......but she told herself that she was fulfilled, and accepted herself how she was.
And so, she was happy that way.
It\'s easy to observe that as something pitiable and sad.
 But to her, that was an outsider\'s opinion, and didn\'t matter in the slightest.
The only important thing was whether or not this was happiness {i:to her}.
It\'s just like how, when people who live in the city point to the lifestyles of those in the country,
 and lament the inconvenience and feel sympathy for them, it\'s really just misplaced kindness.
If those who live there are satisfied with what they have, that\'s more than enough.
".........I\'ve finally realized something.
 ...I realized it just now.
 ......I did something horrible to Maria onee‐chan.
 .........And to all of you, and Sakutarou as well, on that day."
"................................."
"The question of whether magic exists, or not.
 ......That\'s not up to other people to decide."
"It\'s up to you yourself.
 Whether magic exists to Maria onee‐chan is a problem for Maria onee‐chan to decide, and not for me."
"......And yet, when I was young, I said it, that day.
 I told her there\'s no way magic exists, ......and I hurt her."
To me, magic doesn\'t exist—but that\'s {i:my} world.
{n}Denying Onee‐chan\'s world as well just because of that was totally barking up the wrong tree.
"Mariage Sorcière is the witches\' alliance Maria onee‐chan created.
 I was invited into that, and invited to become a witch with her."
"I thought it was a fun new game, and I went along with it for a while.
 ......But, because of the cruelty of youth,
 I got tired of it half‐way through.
 And then......with sharp words, I tore her pure and innocent heart apart."
"......At that time, we must have gotten into a huge fight.
 I forgot about it right away, but it was unforgettable for her.
 ......After all, to her, magic was a natural power that emphatically existed,
 and she believed that she\'d be able to share that with me."
"......Magic, to Maria onee‐chan,
 was a power by which she could give the world a happy interpretation, ......no, which could {i:make} everything happy—it truly was a magical power.
 She just wanted to share that with me too."
"The young me tore those feelings apart.
 ......So she closed herself up in a shell, believing that no one could understand magic with her."
".........If so, then Lady {f:5:Maria}\'s life‐journey wasn\'t over after all.
 If she had accepted herself, there would be no need for her to feel down just because you denied her."
"Onee‐chan was young.
 She still hadn\'t reached the same kind of philosophical viewpoint as Amakusa.
 ......Ahh, and that explains it perfectly.
 Why the witches\' alliance called Mariage Sorcière was necessary."
{m:-5:―}―An alliance where each accepts that the other is a witch.
"...That\'s right—I\'m pretty sure that was the first article in the agreement of Mariage Sorcière.
 ......Witches of the alliance must accept each other and respect each other.
 That is the deepest and the only meaning of the witches\' alliance......"
Maria onee‐chan wanted to share with me the secret laws for making the world happy, called magic.
But I was young.
 And she was too.
......I hurt her with innocent cruelty.
".........On that day, I said it, ...those reckless words.
 To all of you and Sakutarou.
 I said there\'s no way you exist."
"I\'m offended.
 We accept that we exist ourselves.
 We\'re not like {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s, with their souls half‐asleep.
 ......‘I think, therefore I am’."
"Whether you accept or deny magic, the existence of the magic called the Seven Stakes of Purgatory...is therefore a fact.
 ......As long as we accept ourselves, to borrow your words."
"It truly would be violence for another person like me to deny that.
 .........I\'m sure that would be like having your true mother yell "I wish you had never been born",
 no, "get out of my life"."
......Even after being slammed by all those words,
 ......Maria onee‐chan\'s magic...
......made her believe in her mother\'s love.
Sakutarou, her magic friend, always encouraged her.
......He kept saying that her mother loved her, that she was coming home late because of her work,
 and that she would definitely bring back a present.
Even after Maria learned the fact that it really wasn\'t because of work, magic still kept her believing that.
So by believing that her mother loved her, by accepting herself,
 she filled her world with love and peace and serenity, ......and established it perfectly.
"What happened twelve years ago, ...what happened to my family.
 ......This was...not a journey to search for that."
"............Then what is this journey?"
"It was a journey......to apologize to Maria onee‐chan for what happened that day."
".............................."
"I don\'t know why, but that\'s what I think.
 ......If I hadn\'t hurt her that day,
 .........the incident twelve years ago might not have occurred.
 ......That\'s what I think."
I have no basis for it.
 I don\'t have a clue how hurting Onee‐chan would be connected to that mysterious incident several years later.
But for some reason, I can\'t imagine that there is no connection.
A witch caused that incident.
And the culprit is the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}.
And {f:5:Beatrice} was part of the Mariage Sorcière Alliance of Witches.
I had horribly hurt the other witch of that alliance.
I had hurt her by saying that magic doesn\'t exist.
.........And that\'s why, several years later, an inexplicable crime by a witch occurred,
 and that two‐day period which can\'t be explained with anything but magic was thrust in my face via a message bottle.
"......I\'m sure that I\'m not unrelated.
 .........I don\'t know.
 It could be chance, it could be fate.
 .........For some reason, I\'ve just started thinking that way on this journey."
"And your basis?"
"None.
 It\'s just what I\'m thinking."
"Hmmmm......
 The Japanese sure are interesting.
 Even if they\'re the victim, they feel as though they did something wrong, and apologize for no reason."
"......I could understand if you said "I hate {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama for stealing my family!" or something,
 but you really are an odd one, feeling guilty for no reason and apologizing."
"Of course I hate {f:5:Beatrice}.
 I couldn\'t continue this journey without that feeling."
"But it\'s alright for me to find another purpose to this journey.
 There\'s nothing wrong with me adding the goal of apologizing for past sins onto this journey for revenge on a witch of twelve years prior.
 I can at least go to Rokkenjima, apologize for my reckless remarks, and offer flowers."
"......No, .........there\'s something better than flowers.
 And I think that would be more fitting for Onee‐chan."
I stood up, and, ignoring my hair being blown about by the sea breeze, I concentrated my mind......
I lifted my palms up to the height of my head, ......and imagined a vast space......
"............Ange‐sama..............."
"......Quiet.
 ........................"
"......Come, arise.
 ......I am the witch apprentice, {f:5:Ange Beatrice}.
 ......Though I was excommunicated, I was once a member of the same alliance, and you are dearly missed furniture who played with me.
 Answer to my call........."
It was hard to tell in the middle of the day, but a faint blue light gathered around the palms of my hands.
.........Then,
 .........I revived Sakutarou\'s form.
It truly was long‐missed, that figure.
His cute ears, his bright‐red scarf.
......It came off easily, so Onee‐chan faithfully re‐wrapped it all the time, didn\'t she...
"......Sakutaro......
 ......Recognize us?
 Do you know who we are...?"
‘...Uryu......?
 Uryu......?
 Mammon...?
 Ange.........?’
With a sleepy face, as though waking up from a long slumber, Sakutarou looked all around him as he spoke.
"It\'s been a long time, ......Sakutarou.
 I\'m pretty sure this is the first time I\'ve summoned you with my own power.
 ......And now, I\'m the only one who can."
‘..................Uryu......’
Those words might have been a bit cruel.
{n}Sakutarou\'s face clouded over...
"In the past, I denied you.
 .........Now that I have summoned you,
 ......that means that I have accepted your existence."
‘.........Is it okay......?
 Is it okay...for me to be summoned into your world......?’
His eyes were slightly frightened.
......It was only natural.
 I, who had played with him like a friend before,
 had one day suddenly denied him and tried to burn him with the anti‐magic toxin.
It was only natural that he was scared......
"I apologize.
 For that day.
 .........To you too, Mammon.
 And to the rest of you."
At some point, ......the rest of the Seven Sisters had gathered on the deck.
No, they are there at all times.
 Always by my side.
As long as I accept that it\'s okay for them to be there, they will appear anytime.
"You certainly do exist.
 Lucifer.
 And Leviathan.
 And Satan.
 And Belphegor.
 And Mammon.
 And Beelzebub.
 And Asmodeus.
 ......And Sakutarou too."
"......Is that alright?
 Ange‐sama, you are one who is challenging {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.
 ...Is it alright for one in a position of denying witches to accept us?"
"About whether magic exists or not in my world, sorry, but let me put that question on hold.
 It\'s not like I myself have accepted the existence of magic."
"......Yet you accept us? How do you explain that contradiction?"
"Because magic exists for people who believe.
 Even if I don\'t.
 If someone believes, then magic will exist in that person\'s world."
"That will not be interfered with in any way, whether I believe in magic or not.
 No, it must not be interfered with."
"That person just needs to hold their head up high and believe in their own magic.
 And I will accept that.
 So it isn\'t strange at all for you guys to exist."
".........That\'s quite the rationalization...but, an interesting interpretation, I would say."
"What you\'re saying, Ange‐sama, is probably a Devil\'s Proof."
"A Devil\'s Proof......?"
"After all!
 To prove the existence of demons, you just need to bring one with you..."
"But denying the existence of demons is impossible!"
"Kyahha!
 And we are here.
 That means that whether Ange‐sama believes in magic or not, our existence is unshakable."
‘......Uryu?
 The anti‐magic toxin...
.........is disappearing...
...from Ange......’
"Y‐you\'re right......
 ......But she\'s in a position of denying magic......so why......?"
"That\'s probably......
......because I learned respect and acceptance.
 Now, ......I might be able to understand...
...the depths of Maria onee‐chan\'s magic......and {f:5:Beatrice}\'s."
In the past, I insisted that I didn\'t believe in things like magic,
 that something like that couldn\'t exist—I acted like I had my eyes tightly shut and couldn\'t see anything.
But now I\'m different.
 I get the feeling I can look right at the thing called magic, and close in on its true nature......
"......How frustrating.
 It\'s truly rare to find a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} so free of the anti‐magic toxin in this day and age.
 And she has such an uncommon genius for being a witch..."
"That\'s right.
 ......If Ange‐sama tried to become a witch now,
 ......she could grow to be a Great Witch, maybe even at {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama\'s level."
"Even so, she is our master, and has accepted our existence.
 ......Most likely, Ange‐sama will be our final master.
 Let us think of this as our final service, and apply ourselves to the fullest."
"......Bleghh.
 I just can\'t sta~nd that Ange‐sama still doesn\'t believe in magic herself."
"......Ange‐samaaa, please believe in magic too~.
 Feels like a waste to finally have a master and have it not be a wi~tch."
"Even though you have outstanding talent which could make you one of the greatest of witches, your goal is to slay them.
 It\'s such a shame."
"......Well, that\'s her life, her way of living,
 and if that\'s the way she\'s decided her world is going to be, there\'s nothing we can achieve by complaining."
"Thanks for understanding me.
 Yeah, whether magic exists {i:to me} or not,
 that\'s up to me to decide.
 Whether magic actually does exist somewhere in the world or not, you see?"
When I think about it, the world is so vast, ......and yet so small.
Billions of people live on the Earth.
{n}But I probably won\'t meet even one percent of those people.
Even so, I will speak of the world.
{n}Without knowing even one percent of the world—I will speak of "my world".
"I\'m not qualified to deny the laws of a world I don\'t know.
 ......So just because magic doesn\'t exist in my world, I can\'t deny that magic exists in a world I don\'t know."
"That makes it a true Devil\'s Proof.
 No, maybe it\'s more like "when in Rome, do as the Romans do"."
I can be confident in the world I know.
 So even if my world {i:is} denied by a complete stranger who doesn\'t know a thing about it, that\'s nothing to worry about.
And in the same way, just because I don\'t know another world,
 that doesn\'t make me qualified to deny it.
"Which is why,
 regardless of whether there is magic in my world or not,
 ......I cannot deny the magic Maria onee‐chan taught me."
‘Uryu!
 After all, even if you\'ve never seen it,
 ......magic exists!’
"Yes.
 That\'s why, as I\'ve already said,
 ......your existence, as friends of the Mariage Sorcière Alliance of Witches,
 cannot be denied by me or anyone else."
I proclaimed the most important part again.
............Even though the sea breeze and the crashing of the waves were noisy, it was a time of silence.
Both Sakutarou and the Seven Sisters of Purgatory......reflected upon my words.
And, probably, I did too.
Does magic exist or not—
{n}Do witches exist or not—
I reflected on the fact that, while ignoring what the answer was within my world, ......I had declared openly that I would accept their existence, despite it being a contradiction.
‘Thank you, ......Ange.’
"If you will accept that much, perhaps one day, witches could also—
 ...No, that was a foolish question.
 You already have a clear answer to that question."
"Sorry.
 I do accept that witches might exist somewhere in this world.
 But {i:my} world will not waver."
"......You won\'t accept witches or magic.
 You\'ll definitely expose the truth of Rokkenjima.
 ......Right?"
"Yes.
 That is my world.
 Even if a witch really does exist, I won\'t accept her in my world.
 No matter how much that witch tries to court me."
"Your position is to slay witches.
 ......And I now understand well that you have not the slightest wavering in that feeling!"
"We are your furniture, the Seven Sisters of Purgatory...!
 We will always be by your side.
 We will always be waiting for the day that we can be useful...!"
"Although, since you don\'t believe in magic, we can never be anything more than someone to talk to."
"That\'s enough for now.
 We\'ve been left room to exist.
 For that alone, we should thank and accept Ange‐sama."
"In short!
 All of uuuuus..."
‘Can be together again......
 Uryuu!!’
"Kyaaah!!
 Sakutaroo!
 Let me fluffle youuuuuuuuu~!!"
As Sakutarou was overcome with emotion and tears came to his eyes, the Seven Sisters closed in and mobbed him.
......They were also celebrating a long‐awaited reunion.
Because they were granted permission to exist, they can exist here without doubt.
No—they can exist even if I don\'t permit it.
Because I accepted them, they {i:showed} their reunion\'s joy {i:to me as well}.
As I watched over that scene, .........I reflected on the meaning of this journey of mine.
".........I wonder if everyone will forgive me this way."
"You\'ve done enough.
 We are furniture.
 Just being summoned,
 just being allowed to be by your side makes us happy."
‘Uryu...!
 Ange, thank you very much......!’
"......Come to think of it, why was I able to summon Sakutarou?
 ......No, it\'s the other way around.
 Why wasn\'t Onee‐chan able to summon Sakutarou?"
Maria onee‐chan had despaired, thinking that Sakutarou had died.
Which told me that she hadn\'t been able to summon him like this anymore.
In the past, Onee‐chan said it was more advantageous in a summoning to have a vessel.
However, a vessel is like training wheels, and it shouldn\'t be absolutely necessary.
......In other words, even if the stuffed animal lion that was Sakutarou\'s vessel didn\'t exist, it should have been possible to summon him.
......In fact, for that matter,
 it\'s a little doubtful whether summoned beings even have the concept of life and death.
Moreover, Sakutarou was an especially important friend to Maria onee‐chan.
She should have been able to strive hard to summon him one more time.
It certainly was sad that the original stuffed animal vessel had been torn apart,
 but why was he "dead", and why couldn\'t she summon him again......?
‘...That\'s because...
at that time, Maria saw my stuffed animal get torn,
 and she {i:decided}
 that I had died.’
"It\'s the same as the existence of magic.
 ......If, in Lady {f:5:Maria}\'s world, it becomes a fact that Sakutarou died,
 then Sakutarou cannot exist in her world."
‘............Uryu......’
The shock of having her beloved stuffed animal torn apart...
had left a wound in her heart serious enough to prevent her from ever again summoning her irreplaceable close friend.
{i:In Maria onee‐chan\'s eyes}, Sakutarou had died.
So even if Sakutarou could exist like this to me, he could not exist before her.
‘I......was always together with Maria......
 ......As she cried, I was there the whole time right beside her, telling her not to cry......
 ......But my form, my voice, ......nothing of me would reach her......’
Sakutarou hung his head, looking sad.
"......After that incident, the nature of Mariage Sorcière rapidly began to change.
 Before then, the alliance was a peaceful thing."
"But after the incident, it grew full of shadier things, focusing on how to curse people you hate.
 ......Onee‐chan\'s diary began to show a clear change."
A diary is a mirror that reflects one\'s heart as it is.
It probably showed the personality called Maria die,
 and be reborn as the evil witch personality {f:5:Maria}.
As she filled the diary with hatred and sadness, ......her heart surely was not fulfilled.
Because she wasn\'t fulfilled, she had no choice but to fill it with hatred and sadness.
And while still unfulfilled, she met with death.
......I wonder if her unfulfilled soul has a hole opened in its chest from sadness even now,
 and continually wanders, tears dripping down and calling Sakutarou\'s name......
.................................
"...............You......are needed by Onee‐chan."
‘Uryu.........’
"What can I do to revive you in Maria onee‐chan\'s world?
 If I can learn how to do that, I\'ll be able to save Onee‐chan.
 ......That is the method of atonement I am tasked with.
 What can be done to revive you?"
‘......My vessel had a very important meaning to Maria......’
"The vessel.
 ......So, if we could revive the lion stuffed animal..."
‘But......
 ......Mama Rosa made my stuffed animal herself, so only Mama Rosa can make it......’
Even inside the diary, Maria onee‐chan had asked this of {f:5:Beatrice}, and had been refused for the same reason.
The magical significance of a stuffed animal being unique and handmade is very large.
Then, if we could make the same thing once more......
But Aunt Rosa is already gone from this world.
{n}We can never make the same thing again.
"......Was there ever another identical stuffed animal made, or anything like that?"
"He is a stuffed animal made for Lady {f:5:Maria}\'s birthday present, and is the only one in the world.
 ......A handmade and unique vessel.
 That\'s why it conceals a great magical power."
"And......if lost, it will never be obtained again.
 It will not revive..."
‘.........Uryu.........’
......Maria onee‐chan knew that,
 so when she saw that stuffed animal, unique in the world, be torn apart,
 .........she despaired.
Because it was a stuffed animal unique in the world,
 and it permitted her no compromises such as simply buying another, ......she despaired from the bottom of her heart......
"......But Sakutarou is right here.
 Even without a vessel, he\'s here.
 I accept that, and so he firmly exists in my world."
".........Even if Maria onee‐chan doesn\'t accept him, that fact cannot be denied.
 Right...?"
"Logically, that\'s true,
 ......but I think using the same logic to make Lady {f:5:Maria} accept him could be difficult."
‘......Maria.........
 ......I\'m not dead...
 I\'m right here.........
 ......Uryu......’
"I\'m sure that on Rokkenjima,
 ......I\'ll be able to be reunited with Maria onee‐chan.
 And, ......no matter what, I\'m going to revive you inside Onee‐chan, and let you be reunited too."
‘Can you do that......?’
"It will probably be hard.
 ......Just like how, after being invited into the witches\' alliance, I rejected it without understanding what it meant,
 she might also reject your existence."
".........But I\'ve got to do it.
 That\'s the only way I can atone for my sins."
"............Ange‐sama......"
"What is waiting on Rokkenjima?
 And what will happen, what will I be able to achieve?
 ......Although maybe nothing will happen at all."
‘........................’
"That island, which was the beginning of everything, will be the final destination of this journey.
 .........As your master, I must bring all of you witch\'s furniture with me...
...and {i:I must return} to the witch\'s island—to Rokkenjima."
Even though the rays of the sun had been so strong, at some point clouds had started to hang over us.
The spray hitting my cheek might not all be coming from the crashing waves.
"Ange‐san.
 It looks like a light shower is coming.
 Shouldn\'t you be going down?"
Amakusa called out to me, with an expression of surprise that I was still here.
When I looked up, I saw that the island\'s silhouette had gotten much larger.
{n}We might reach land very soon.
I remembered that the weather report had mentioned scattered rains.
The sky wasn\'t dark enough for rain clouds.
{n}It\'ll probably be just for a short time.
Even if the rain was light enough not to be a bother,
 ......having rain start to fall as we approached the island felt like some kind of fate.
It was probably raining on October 4th, 1986, as well.
{n}I was approaching the Rokkenjima of that day, ......and not just in distance......
I went back down with Amakusa.
Amakusa was carrying what looked like a quite large and heavy golf bag.
It was something Amakusa had brought back from god‐knows‐where after we split up for a day.
{n}......I wasn\'t going to inquire as to its contents, but it\'s hard to imagine that they\'re anything peaceful.
".........I\'m deliberately not going to ask what\'s inside, but it looks heavy."
"Why is it that these are so heavy?
 A French instructor taught me something interesting about that once."
"He said that they {i:should} be heavy.
 .........After all, a human life is heavier than the Earth.
 So these should be even heavier."
".........It\'ll be nice if you don\'t have a chance to use them."
"That would be nice."
Amakusa set the golf‐bag‐like luggage down heavily beside him.
A two‐propeller aircraft touched down on the runway.
{n}With the weather in these conditions, it could not have been a pleasant flight.
{n}Everything after this flight had been suspended due to the weather.
Cutting through the drizzle as she traversed the runway, Sumadera Kasumi entered the lobby with two black‐suits as guards.
The four black‐suits who had been waiting inside the lobby stood up and respectfully lowered their heads.
"""Kasumi‐sama...!"""
"Propeller planes do shake awfully, don\'t they......
 I never want to fly in one again."
"We have a car prepared!
 Please, this way."
They went into two luxury cars that had been rented...
"......Ange should be heading for Rokkenjima.
 A deserted island—how truly convenient.
 .........You have prepared the tools, I hope?"
"Yes, ma\'am......!"
The black‐suit in the passenger seat lifted a heavy bag that had been by his feet onto his lap,
 opened the zipper wide, and showed Kasumi the contents.
Inside were several blocky objects wrapped tightly in silver aluminum foil.
......He peeled one open to show her.
Out peeked a black, blunt, automatic pistol......It was already approaching ten at night.
{n}The typhoon had already engulfed Rokkenjima.
Even the rose garden that had looked so beautiful during the day...
was now being beaten down upon by the fierce winds and resisting with all its might, undulating and trying to keep the flowers from blowing away...
Heading for the guesthouse through that rose garden, led by Shannon, were Battler, who was holding up an umbrella; Jessica; and Maria, who was sleeping on George\'s shoulder.
"It\'s just to the guesthouse, we could make it there on our own...
 Shannon‐chan, it\'s OK, go back and rest."
"Oh, no, accompanying you is also my duty..."
"The family conference is going on inside, and my mom and Genji‐san are on edge, that\'s the thing.
 If we\'re too considerate to her, they\'ll get the wrong idea and think she\'s slacking off."
"That\'s right.
 Just graciously accepting her offer will actually cause her less trouble.
 ...Thanks, Shannon."
"Not at all.
 ......Certainly, as Milady says, it is very tense inside the mansion today.
 Coming with all of you has allowed me a breath of fresh air, and taken some of the stress off me."
"The family conference, huh.
 .........They went to all the trouble of chasing us kids out, so they\'re probably having a pretty damn nasty discussion."
"Probably.
 I\'m sure there\'s nothing we can do to help out.
 Just making sure to stay out of their way is the best way for us to be useful, I think."
"Feh......!
 You can bet your ass they\'re just going on about money money money again."
"...They act like they\'re so rich most of the time, but when it comes down to handing out cash, they start hemming and hawing.
 Why can\'t they just be generous and split it evenly between everyone?"
"Ihihi.
 That\'d be awesome.
 It\'d be great if I got a share too.
 \'Cause if I got some as well, I\'d split it with Shannon‐chan right away."
"Th‐thank you very much...
 That\'s alright, but I appreciate the offer."
"You aren\'t materialistic at all, are you, Shannon?
 Normally, girls of your age have plenty of things they want to buy."
"Yes.
 But none of the things I want can be bought with money."
"Ooh!
 So ungreedy!
 If you lined up all the things I wanted, all the gold in the world wouldn\'t be enough."
"Nothing you can {i:buy}, she said.
 I wonder what these "things that can\'t be bought" that Shannon wants a~re.
 Any idea, George nii‐san?"
"W‐well, I wonder.
 I guess only Shannon would know."
"I, ...I don\'t know either."
George and Shannon looked down with their faces red.
Battler had also heard the details, so he knew what Jessica was teasing them about.
"George‐aniki is someone even I can respect.
 I think you\'ve met a really great person, Shannon‐chan."
"Yeah.
 I can rest easy knowing Shannon is in good hands."
"St‐stop teasing.
 It\'s a serious issue for us.
 More importantly, what about you, Jessica‐chan?
 Have you been able to get a little closer to Kanon‐kun?"
"Whaaaaaaaaat?!
 So, you and Kanon‐kun are like that?!"
"Ah, um, mgh!!
 Th‐that\'s dirty, George nii‐san, twisting the conversation around like that is just mean!"
As they had an animated discussion with ups and downs,
 the four kids headed for the guesthouse.......
The annual family conference was extremely important to the Ushiromiya family,
 and this year in particular seemed like it was going to be especially so.
Apparently, the family head, Kinzo, was personally going to be making a very serious announcement,
 and everyone other than the adults had been strictly ordered to leave the mansion.
Battler hadn\'t attended the family conference in six years, so he hadn\'t really noticed,
 but according to Jessica, there seemed to be a very tense atmosphere tonight,
 completely different from a normal year.
......Common sense made it clear that Kinzo, whose remaining life was short,
 was going to make some big announcement about the succession of the head and the distribution of his fortune......
"I\'m surprised.
 .........To think that Grandfather is actually going to make an appearance......"
"......I see.
 So this is the witch\'s counterattack."
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!
 I wanted to leave the Joker called Kinzo face‐down a little longer, but it is probably about time to turn it over.
 Trump cards exist to be used.
 *cackle*cackle*!"
"Damn.
 So my theory that Grandfather was dead since the beginning, and a mysterious 18th person had snuck in in his place...
...is now suddenly torn apart."
"I had foreseen that you would begin to doubt Kinzo eventually...!
 Come on, come on, your reasoning is back to square one once again, you know?"
"With this, your theory that Kinzo was dead at the very beginning and I was hiding as the 18th person goes poof!
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"
".........Goddammit...
 But no way I\'ll lose heart.
 That\'s only one theory gone.
 I\'ll attack you like a storm, like a tornado......"
"*cackle*cackle*!
 I would have it no other way!
 Even the first twilight has not yet begun.
 It is far too early to give up."
"That\'s right.
 And it\'s not like it was denied with the red truth.
 .........At this point in time, Battler\'s theory hasn\'t been defeated.
 It\'s too early to say that you\'ve won."
"Hmm, you\'re right.
 ......It {i:is} still too early for me to simply swallow her story.
 ...Grandfather is supposed to be finally appearing,
 but there\'s also a chance that there\'ll be a lot of talk about how his health has gotten worse and he won\'t appear after all."
"......Uncle Krauss might simply be trying desperately...
to hide the fact that Grandfather really is dead until the last second."
"Ha...!
 I see, I see, you could also think of it that way.
 Do as you please.
 It will be resolved soon.
 Very soon...
 *cackle*cackle*......!"
All of the relatives and Nanjo could be seen in the dining hall.
Nanjo sat alone, quietly watching the wind and rain outside.
Krauss was sitting in the seat of his own rank, with Natsuhi standing motionlessly at his side.
All the other siblings and their partners were gathered at the opposite end of the long table, whispering to each other......
"......Is that true?"
"Yes.
 ......Maria said...the person who gave her the umbrella...
...was Father."
"Son of a gun...
 Then that means the foundation of our strategy has collapsed...!"
"Not just our strategy.
 Since Father is healthy and has said that he will make an announcement himself, our trivial bargaining with Nii‐san was completely pointless."
"Yup.
 ......That old bastard.
 Why couldn\'t he have just shown himself right away instead of dragging it out?
 Thanks to that, we\'ve just been quarreling with Aniki uselessly."
"............Maybe that\'s what he wanted to test?
 Maybe it\'s not my place to say it, since we aren\'t related by blood, but your father is very intelligent, you realize?"
"Our exchange during the day was probably being listened in on by one of the servants, and reported to Father.
 .........Incredible.
 The fact that we\'re clamoring after Father\'s inheritance is now clear as day to him...
 .........Ah, just incredible..."
Eva held her head, uncharacteristically dejected.
If, as Kyrie had said, this had been Kinzo\'s design from the beginning—
a huge setup spread over more than a year in a bid to find the siblings\' true natures—
then they had fallen for it completely...
"......We still don\'t know for sure that it\'s reached Father\'s ears."
"No, it definitely has!
 ......And everyone but Nii‐san claimed that he was dead, and none of us believed in his good health...!"
"Aaah, we\'re done for.......
 ......He\'ll make an announcement.
 He\'ll say that Nii‐san will become the successor, and that we aren\'t even qualified to wear the One‐winged Eagle......
 ......Ahhh, I............"
"Nee‐san...... Don\'t give up......"
"......Rosa‐san.
 I wonder whether Maria‐chan really did receive that umbrella from Father?"
"Huh?
 What do you mean......?"
"......{i:Maria‐chan} might have met Father.
 But {i:we} haven\'t.
 Maria‐chan only claims to have met him."
"What......?
 ......Are you saying that Maria is telling a lie?!"
"Calm down, Rosa.
 ......We\'re not calling Maria‐chan a liar.
 But she\'s the kind of kid who accepts what people tell her, right?"
"......For example, if, say, Genji‐san came up to her and said something like "I was told by your grandfather to hand this to you, Maria‐sama",
 then even if Maria‐chan hadn\'t met Dad, she still might say that she got an umbrella from him, right?"
"Th‐......that\'s right.
 That could be the trick...!"
"But what Maria‐chan said was this, right?
 "Grandfather came and handed me an umbrella"."
"Yes, it was.
 She was clear that she received the umbrella directly from her grandfather."
"......Directly, huh?
 Well, that\'s that, then."
"...........................
 Whoever said that the thinking of the incompetent can pass for sleeping was absolutely right.
 If you think about it a bit, all this about the umbrella is irrelevant."
"Why?
 Maria‐chan could have been bribed by Nii‐san to lie and say something that made it seem like Father was in good health, couldn\'t she?!
 There is no evidence that Father actually handed the umbrella to her...!"
"No matter who Maria‐chan received the umbrella from,
 or even if she never was given an umbrella in the first place,
 Father will appear very soon.
 With Father in front of us, the question of the umbrella will be completely irrelevant."
".........In other words, the only time that the umbrella question comes into play is the other case."
"What do you mean, the other case?"
"............Ah, ...I got it.
 ......This is probably what Kyrie‐san\'s sayin\'."
".........We\'re bein\' told that Father is comin\' here any moment,
 but there\'s still a chance of some excuse why he won\'t turn up in the end, right......?"
"I, .........I see.
 That\'s true..."
"Maybe Nii‐san just said Father was going to appear off the top of his head, in a desperate bid to buy time against our investigation.
 Father really has passed away already,
 and Nii‐san is still lying and saying he\'s in good health...!"
"In short, if Father appears, then no schemes will be effective.
 There\'s no need to even think about it.
 We\'re fish on the chopping board.
 We\'d have no choice but to leave fate to the heavens and face direct negotiations with Father.
 No choice but to beg for money, in the expectation that we\'ll need to prostrate ourselves and be subjected to his fists."
"......But on the other hand, if Father doesn\'t appear, then our original strategy isn\'t hampered in the least."
".........I see.
 Then, no matter which way it goes, there\'s absolutely no need to get flustered now."
"That\'s it.
 If Father shows up, it simply means that the family conference will be carried out as normal.
 .........If he doesn\'t, we just have to continue to press Krauss nii‐san."
"He might start off sayin\', Father\'s mood has suddenly gotten worse and...
 We gotta make absolutely sure not to let Krauss‐san talk his way out of it."
"......It seems what we should really be trying to figure out...
is what scheme Nii‐san is going to try to use to buy himself some time.
 I know better than anyone just how far he\'ll go to refuse to admit defeat."
"If Father is well, ......then we prostrate ourselves and beg for money.
 ......If it\'s Krauss nii‐san\'s farce, then we continue our ugly sibling fight.
 .........Seems like this year\'s family conference is going to be as wonderful as ever."
"Yep.
 The thinking of the incompetent can pass for sleeping, then.
 It\'s almost ten.
 ......Should we press Aniki?"
Rudolf and the rest looked at Krauss.
Firmly seated, he looked like he was awaiting Kinzo\'s arrival with an air of composure.
......They couldn\'t tell whether that really was composure, or whether he was scheming about how to tie together his lie.
"............Dear......"
"......Calm yourself.
 Making a fuss here won\'t achieve anything.
 .........Let\'s leave it to Genji‐san."
"It\'s almost......ten o\'clock, isn\'t it."
That was the time that had been set for tonight\'s family conference to open.
And in addition, it was also the time that the Ushiromiya family head needed to appear......
Right then, they heard the sound of footsteps approaching from the hall.
{n}There were multiple sets.
Natsuhi jerked her head up with a start......
But there came the sound of a knock, and her expression filled with disappointment.
Because Kinzo probably wouldn\'t have knocked.
"......Please excuse us.
 We have finished closing up the mansion for the night."
It was Gohda and Kumasawa.
Unlike the physically fit Gohda,
 it was rare for Kumasawa with her old body to still be tasked with work this late.
Of course, Krauss also seemed to know that.
"Mmhm.
 Good work.
 .........My apologies for making you work at such a time, Kumasawa‐san."
"Oh, not at all.
 I may not look it, but staying up late is still one of my specialties.
 Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho...!"
"......Could we not at least relieve Kumasawa of the duty of being an observer?
 It really will be difficult on her body, I imagine."
"............The order was to gather all of the servants as well.
 I cannot disobey."
Tonight\'s family conference was clearly different from a normal one.
On a normal year, no one was able to attend the family conference except relatives.
{n}It would have been inconceivable for any servants to be present.
But this year was different.
They had been told to have all of the servants in attendance for the family conference.
{n}Of course, they would not be allowed to speak.
 .........They were there as observers.
Just what in the world was going to happen that needed five servants to observe?
......Even Krauss didn\'t know.
"Hoh‐hoh‐ho.
 Believe it or not, I\'m good at pulling all‐nighters.
 If you stuff yourself with mackerel too, Krauss‐sama, you\'ll be able to keep going all night as well."
"Hahahaha.
 I see, so there\'s energy in you yet.
 No doubt you\'ll still be working with such energy when you\'re past a hundred."
"Madam.
 Forgive my presumption, but I have prepared a light snack.
 It is ready to be served at any time—just give the word."
"Thank you.
 You really are considerate.
 ......Please ask our guests whether they would care for some more coffee."
"Certainly."
After bowing slightly, Gohda took the pot towards the relatives gathered at the other end of the table.
As he did, more footsteps approached from the hallway.
......A single set.
 They were light.
Even before the knock, they could imagine who it was.
"Excuse me......
 I have taken the children to the guesthouse."
"Good work.
 Tonight is a special evening.
 Make sure you stay alert."
"Ye‐yes.
 Certainly, Madam......"
Genji, accompanied by Kanon, had gone to meet Kinzo.
{n}......There was still no sign of their return.
The hands of the clock were creeping past ten.
{n}Once sure of that, Eva spoke to Krauss.
"......Nii‐saaan?
 It\'s time.
 Is the family conference still not going to start?"
"............The arrival of the guest of honor has been delayed.
 Wait a short while."
"How long?
 Sorry, but I\'m setting a time limit on this.
 I won\'t have you saying "Father hasn\'t quite shown up yet" over and over until dawn."
"How can {i:I} make a promise about the time {i:Father} will show up?
 Why are you in such a rush?
 Why not drink some coffee and calm down for now...?"
"Aniki, we\'re gathered here for a family conference.
 Not a farce.
 We\'ll wait thirty more minutes.
 But if that gets us nothing, we\'re barging into the study."
"B‐barging into......
 That would be an action quite lacking in respect for the head!"
"It would, wouldn\'t it? Sorry about that.
 We\'ll sit tight for thirty more minutes.
 Hehheheheh......"
".....................Heh."
"...........................
 I look forward to seeing whether you can keep that same smile thirty minutes from now."
"......You honestly believe that Father is dead?"
"I have no desire to discuss that at this point.
 We just have to wait until Father comes here.
 There\'s absolutely no need for me to argue you down, Nii‐san."
"The Ushiromiya headship will be passed on to the proper person in the proper manner.
 ......No matter what you may scheme, you cannot go against this.
 Of course, the same goes for me."
"What are you on about?
 ......You\'ve been bragging all these years about being the successor to the head yourself...!"
"Allow me to turn your words straight back on you.
 I have no desire to discuss that at this point.
 Father merely has to come here and proclaim it with his own mouth.
 It is completely unnecessary for me to argue you down.
 ......Right?
 Heheheh!"
Krauss casually turned Eva\'s words back on her.
{n}Of course, that poured fuel on Eva\'s anger.
{n}But it didn\'t ignite.
Because in that instant, the sound of a very loud knock rang out.
Both Genji and Kanon were usually very reserved when they knocked.
{n}They wouldn\'t hit the door with such a violent strength.
......It was like a judge\'s gavel slamming down in a call to order.
So everyone fell quiet......
The door opened slightly, ......and Genji showed himself.
Then, he spoke with a solemn tone different from his usual one.
{n}It wasn\'t the tone he used when carrying out his duties.
{n}......It was the tone he used when speaking for Kinzo himself.
So just by hearing Genji speak like that, the siblings were struck with a sudden tension.
"Take your seats, everyone."
At those words, the dining hall fell into complete silence, and everyone rushed back to their designated seats.
They were like students who had been making a lot of noise just before homeroom, hurriedly returning to their seats when the teacher came;
 it might even have felt humorous.
......But there was no way anyone would joke about it.
Everyone sat in order, and Shannon, Gohda, and Kumasawa stood up straight in a row by the wall.
"......The head of the glorious Ushiromiya family, and lord of Rokkenjima, the island that sparkles gold.
 Lord Ushiromiya Kinzo is present."
Of the double doors into the dining hall, Genji opened the right door from the inside, and Kanon opened the left door from the outside.
......And, welcomed by the deepest of bows from the two servants, with his cape fluttering majestically, ............Kinzo appeared......
Kinzo\'s gait had a dignified weight to it, and it was very hard to believe that he had been diagnosed as having not much time left to live.
Genji pulled back Kinzo\'s seat, and motioned for him to sit.
But Kinzo remained standing, signaling with his chin for Genji to move back.
"Hhheheheheheheheh, fuhha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!!
 Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to Rokkenjima.
 Why the frightened face, Evaa?"
"N‐no, why would I be frightened...!
 I, I\'m just relieved to find you in excellent spirits, Father......"
"Wahahahaha...!!
 Evaa, you\'re as interesting as ever, aren\'t yoou?
 You might try honestly saying how frustrated you are at losing your bet with Krauss.
 ......Heheh{0}ha{0}ha{0}hah, you can\'t say it, can youuu?
 Hehuhuha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hah!!"
Eva realized that their conversation during the day had indeed been an open book to Kinzo, and she turned red as she hung her head.
"Well then, my sons, daughters, and their companions!
 Tonight, I shall make an important announcement regarding those things that you all have your hearts set upon: my fortune and the succession of the headship."
"But first!
 I think I will mention how incredibly disappointed I am.
 I refer to the fact that, to this very day, not a single one of you has been able to solve the riddle of the epitaph."
Even though Kinzo said he was disappointed,
 a condescending smile, as though there was no way the likes of them could have solved it, rose to his face as he cast an eye over each and every one of them.
".........I had been planning on handing over everything to the person who could solve it.
 But here we stand today, not a single person having been capable, and not a single person having succeeded to all that is mine."
"Shameful...!!
 The fact that not one among you has come forward with the qualifications to succeed me,
 I find truly disappointing, and shameful, and pathetic!!
 Wah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah!!"
The siblings hung their heads in silence.
Of course, they would have solved it if they could.
 They had blown their chance, and none of them could deny that, but even so, it was just so hard a riddle...
"Therefore.
 I am proclaiming here and now that I will suspend the use of the epitaph\'s riddle as a method of choosing my successor."
"In short, time\'s up!
 This is game over.
 ......What a shame for all of you.
 You all had an equal and fair chance, and that has now collapsed!
 .........Mwwhhuhuhahah!!"
It truly sounded like Kinzo was making a victory proclamation.
"In that case, will the headship be succeeded by my oldest son, Krauss...?
 *cackle*cackle*!
 The answer is <no>!!"
"Wha...?!"
"....................."
"......I am sure you understand why, Krauss?
 I certainly did give you the title of successor.
 But you did nothing with it but get drunk on it...
 Do you know what it means to be the successor......?"
".........It means...to be the one who will succeed you, Father..."
"WROOOOOOONNNNNNGGGGG!!
 The successor isn\'t something that\'s guaranteed by the current head at aaaaaall!"
".........Listen up, Krauss.
 I\'ll only teach you this once, so unplug your ears and listen.
 The "successor", see,
 is what you call someone who finds everyone else who\'s after the headship,
 thoroughly breaks their noses, and makes it so that they can never disobey him again."
"This is not only something that can be said of the headship.
 It can also be said of money!
 A "rich person" doesn\'t mean someone who has money.
 It means someone who crushes everyone who has more money than himself,
 and who scrabbles together more money than anyone else."
"It\'s the same with talent.
 A "genius" is not what you call a person blessed with talent!
 It means a person who crushes everyone with more talent than themselves!
 A person who can coerce all other people to call them that by using their strength and charisma!!"
"You have a mistaken impression when it comes to all of these things.
 ......So you aren\'t of the right caliber to be my successor.
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"
"...............N‐now I have learned..."
Perhaps that was precisely Kinzo\'s philosophy.
Though it could also be taken for a rant, it was as a result of faithfully carrying out that philosophy of his...
that Kinzo had raised the Ushiromiya family to such prosperous heights......
It may be hard to imagine after his immersion in the occult in recent years,
 but it was that brutal aggressiveness that was Ushiromiya Kinzo\'s charisma and aura...
"Such a weak‐minded person has no qualification to inherit everything of the Ushiromiya family.
 In that case, is Eva, Rudolf, or Rosa qualified?"
"That is also <no>!!
 You were not able to solve the riddle, and neither were you able to scheme to drag Krauss down from his throne!
 All the three of you could manage to do was put together a united front to try to extort money from Krauss."
"And even that scheme was thoughtless!
 You can\'t even corner Krauss all by himself!
 .........There could be nothing more shameful!"
"You lack the avarice to steal away the position of successor by any means necessary!!
 In order to get what you want, you should pay all sacrifices, be covetous, avaricious to the last...!!
 Fortune smiles upon the greedy!!"
"You three, who lack that wild spirit, are as unfit for the succession as Krauss!!"
Eva and the rest had no words to respond with.
 And they couldn\'t figure out what it was that Kinzo was about to say...
Was Kinzo actually planning to proclaim that no one would succeed the head?
If so, that would work to Eva, Rosa, and Rudolf\'s advantage.
Because the only thing the siblings would ultimately need to do is coordinate everything between them after Kinzo\'s death, and split the inheritance evenly.
On the contrary, if a specific person\'s name was raised and proclaimed to be the one to succeed the head, that would surely be {i:more} troublesome.
......But would Kinzo really say something that would benefit any of the four siblings after lambasting them so much?
"......You don\'t think...he\'s going to say that because no one will succeed him,
 he\'ll donate all of his fortune to charity or something, right......?"
".........I\'m afraid I wouldn\'t put it past Father."
"The blood\'s just risen to his head......
 For the time being, we\'re just gonna have to hear him out."
"W‐...well then, Father.
 What thoughts do you have regarding the next head?"
"Hmph.........
 Since I am so completely disappointed in all of you, I\'ve lost the desire to hand it over to anyone.
 Therefore, the Ushiromiya family will end here.
 It ends with my generation."
"......S‐surely we must......"
"The Ushiromiya family was ruined long ago in that earthquake.
 The current Ushiromiya family is nothing but my own short‐lived vision of gold.
 ......The likes of which will end when I awaken from my slumber."
"Hehheheh!
 This world is naught but a dream, an illusion.
 ...Life is but a daydream before the awakening called death."
"Aaah, yes, and so it has been since the beginning!!
 That I should lose everything when I die was {f:5:Beatrice}\'s contract, and her curse!
 Fuhhahhahha!!
 You think that will work, {f:5:Beatrice}?!"
"I will be the one to capture you!!
 Tonight, that shall become reality.
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*!
 Wahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!"
For a while, Kinzo was overcome with cackling, and his eyes bulged.
Whenever he talked about {f:5:Beatrice}, he was always eloquent, and filled with obsession......
"Foolish sons and daughters such as yourselves were truly a daydream!!
 It is as though you were never there from the beginning!!"
"Disappear! Wake up!!
 Fade away along with the doze of my true self...!!
 You failures that have not built up anything that makes you worthy to succeed me!!"
"K‐Kinzo‐san.
 If I may......"
"What is it?
 My friend."
Nanjo nervously raised his hand, asking to speak.
{n}Kinzo permitted it.
"I understand how you feel, Kinzo‐san.
 Because you love your children,
 you expect a lot of them, and as a parent and grandparent myself,
 I understand the parental affection that can make you feel as though these expectations were betrayed."
"......However, you are extraordinary, Kinzo‐san.
 A genius.
 Isn\'t it a little too harsh to say that it\'s only natural for them to catch up to you...?"
"And even so, that has not stopped them from trying—
Krauss‐san, Eva‐san, Rudolf‐san, Rosa‐san, and all of their partners, are doing their very best to catch up..."
"Hohoooooooooohhh???
 And just how much money have they built up with this "doing their very best"?
 These half‐wits, who fail in each and every one of their enterprises and become burdened with debt,
 and still try to sponge off me, are "doing their very best" exactly howwww...?!?!"
"Money is the crystallization of everything in this world.
 If you cannot grasp that, then you cannot grasp the world!
 If a soul cannot keep a tight grasp on this world, it doesn\'t deserve to live!!
 Disappear!!
 Begone from my life and reality!!"
"......That argument is unreasonable.
 With that logic, even I would not be allowed to live."
"......And yet I believe the time I spent playing chess with you was worthwhile for both of us...
 ......You should know better than anyone else that there are many things in this world that money cannot buy."
".........mgh.
 ......Hmm."
As the siblings motionlessly hung their heads, they cheered Nanjo on inside their hearts.
Not one of the siblings could offer their opinion to Kinzo in a rage, but Nanjo alone was allowed to, as Kinzo\'s close friend...
Even though Kinzo had raged so fiercely, after being admonished by Nanjo, he nodded several times as though in agreement.
......His surprisingly docile side might have seemed cute, but there was no one who could laugh.
"It may be true that your children weren\'t able to build up as great a fortune as yourself.
 ......Well, even so, from my point of view, they\'re rich enough to make me jealous."
"But besides money, they have also built up a great many things that money can\'t buy.
 When it comes to that, they are in no way inferior to you."
"Hoh.
 And what are you saying they have built up that money cannot buy?"
"Happiness.
 Family.
 ......They have found wonderful partners, had children, and built up their own happy homes.
 Your family is thriving thanks to them, and they have brought back grandchildren for you."
"Grandchildren are good.
 We older people can look at those young grandchildren, who will live on into a new era that we will not be given a chance to see, and we can imagine endless futures for them.
 ......Isn\'t that the sole entertainment for old age?"
"Remember, Kinzo‐san.
 Remember your joy when they first came back to you with grandchildren...!
 Your children, and your grandchildren, will relate your great works to future generations, and they will model themselves after you.
 That is something that a single person cannot accomplish no matter how much money they have."
The siblings all nodded in agreement...
Certainly, there had been a time when Kinzo had looked at his newly born grandchildren with happiness in his eyes.
......Back when he still had some sanity in his heart.
......However, was there any {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} warmth still left inside Kinzo\'s heart......?
"You mean to say.
 That in exchange for the vast riches I created!
 Instead of gaining money, I have gained my grandchildren."
"N‐no, no, that\'s not what I—"
"So, in exchange for the several tens of billions in wealth that I have amassed, I have gained a single grandchild from each of my children!!"
"Hahhahahahahahahahahaha!!
 This is wonderful!
 So, I have created a single life at a cost of ten billion yen!
 That\'s how it is!
 Interesting, thinking of it from the perspective of alchemy truly makes for an interesting analogy, don\'t you agree...?!"
"Hohhh, what valuable grandchildren!
 Wonderful, ......wonderful!!
 Wah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah!!
 Is that right, Krauss?
 ......Is your daughter worth ten billion......?"
"..........................."
Krauss couldn\'t answer instantly.
 ......It wasn\'t that he didn\'t have confidence in his daughter; it was because he didn\'t have a clue what Kinzo was trying to test with this question.
But when Natsuhi was then pressed for an answer, she responded, breaking Krauss\'s silence with an answer of her own interpretation.
"......Y‐yes.
 Jessica is a daughter who I wouldn\'t let go of even for ten billion yen.
 In that sense, I believe she has a value that can\'t be counted with money."
"Hoh.
 So you can state for certain that she is worth ten billion.
 Hohoh!
 What about you, Eva?
 What do you say about your George......?"
Given the way Natsuhi had chosen to answer, there was naturally no doubt as to what Eva\'s answer would be.
......Even though Eva should have known better than to respond to this kind of provocative question, she did so as well.
"Yes, Father.
 George is worth ten billion, ......no, even more than that."
"And that\'s not in the abstract sense of things money can\'t buy.
 George will certainly build up a fortune equal to his worth.
 I am sure he will become a grandson worthy of carrying on your great works...!"
Eva sent a glance at Hideyoshi and Natsuhi that said "Like a fiddle".
......After hearing Eva\'s answer, Natsuhi was about to add more praise for her daughter, but stopped at a glare from Krauss.
"Hmm, I see.
 .........Then what about you, Rudolf?
 What about your Battler?"
"Compared to George‐kun, ......there\'s nothing about Battler I can brag about.
 If he was kidnapped and we were threatened with a ransom of ten billion, I\'d feel like sticking a bow on the guy and letting them have him."
"*giggle*giggle*......"
"On top of that, he\'s an idiot and reckless.
 He dreams way too big and talks about things he hasn\'t got a snowball\'s hope in hell of doing.
 ......I guess in that respect, he\'s a super idiot worth the equivalent of ten billion normal idiots."
"But you look at the average person who hasn\'t even got the balls to be an idiot, and I\'ll bet that guy is gonna try things that ten billion of them couldn\'t do put together.
 Well, I\'m pretty sure he\'ll fall flat on his face.
 The world isn\'t easy."
"......But at the very least,
 there\'s no doubt in my mind that watching over his life will be more entertaining than looking at ten billion average people."
Eva clicked her tongue at the clever style of speech that would probably match Kinzo\'s tastes.
Apparently Rudolf had been after this himself—he grinned back at her.
"......What of Maria?"
"M‐......Maria is my darling only daughter.
 Her value cannot be measured with money.
 ......That is all."
"Hmm.
 ............I see.
 Dreams and the future, miracles and possibilities are the source of my magical power.
 No magic holds power without hope."
"......Hmph, I cannot expect anything more from you people who have proven yourselves to be average, but...
yes, my grandchildren do have future possibilities, and it is possible that they may be worth hoping for a magical miracle from."
"If you say that this makes them worth more than ten billion, hmm, I could understand that.
 ......Hmmm, hmmmm......"
When Kinzo got in a rage, he wouldn\'t let anyone talk back,
 but even so, while yelling by himself, he would sometimes convince himself of something all of his own accord, and change his own opinion.
......That\'s what this felt like to the siblings.
Apparently, even though Kinzo had become absolutely fed up with his shoddy children and had cast them away as being unfit for the inheritance of his title or his fortune,
 he wasn\'t so sure about his grandchildren.
......At this rate, he might soon say that the inheritance would go to his grandchildren instead of the siblings.
As the siblings sat in fear of what their fickle and short‐tempered father would suddenly think of next,
 they carefully watched his every move...
"......Hmm.
 ......Let me change my thinking a little.
 I have absolutely no desire to see you people inherit all that is mine."
"However, it would be quite interesting to question the grandchildren to see whether one of them is qualified......
 I\'ve been thinking of them as kids who never grow up,
 but there is a chance they will show me a glimmer of unpolished brilliance that will surprise me."
"And testing them for that would be...
...yes, that would be hard to pass over as a final diversion for my last remaining days.
 ......Hmmmmm,
 ......well then, what shall I do..."
"I, ...I can recommend George with confidence as a fitting successor for you, Father!"
Eva claimed that right away.
Natsuhi looked like she was about to follow along, but Krauss gave her a look telling her to restrain herself, so she swallowed her words.
"Hehheheheheheh!
 How bold.
 ......Then, let us do this.
 I will individually question the grandchildren to see whether they are qualified to inherit the Ushiromiya family headship and all of its wealth."
"...Father—"
"Howeeever!!
 .........I do not mean by this that one of you will receive the headship indirectly.
 I have already lost hope in every one of you."
"I have nothing to give you now.
 Nothing!
 The ones I will question are the grandchildren.
 And the ones who might succeed me are the grandchildren.
 ......Make absolutely sure that you do not mistake this, are we clear......?"
".........I\'ll follow your decision, Father."
"Same here.
 I\'ll go along with what you determine.
 ......And you, Aneki?"
"O‐of course.
 ......I believe that you will make a wise judgment, Father."
"I, I will also abide by your decision......"
"I shall think of how I will test the grandchildren.
 And that no longer has anything to do with any of you.
 Because you no longer have anything to do with the succession of the head."
"......So why don\'t I use this opportunity to talk about something else that does have something to do with you."
"Something else......?"
"Mm.
 That is the true reason for tonight\'s...{i:final} Ushiromiya family conference."
"......*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!
 What I demand from you is neither a discussion nor your opinions.
 I demand cooperation.
 For my ritual!"
"............Rituuaaal...?"
"Quiet...!
 Father is talking now...!"
Rudolf and the rest automatically knitted their brows at the occult‐like word "ritual".
Was he talking about starting a strange ritual involving {f:5:Beatrice}\'s resurrection again......?
He was demanding that they help...?
{n}What in the world was he planning to start?
In the past, he had carried out many eccentricities that he called by the same name, such as lighting a strange incense and filling the whole mansion with the stench.
To the siblings, a "ritual" was nothing more than one of the aged Kinzo\'s obnoxious hobbies.
"Father...
 Just what do you mean by.........?"
"We\'ll assist you in any way that we can.
 Right, Rosa?"
"Y‐yes......
 But...what in the world...is it...?"
"The ritual as I inscribed it in the epitaph.
 ......It is a ritual to revive {f:5:Beatrice}, and open the door to the Golden Land."
"That witch, who escaped her cage of flesh and sneeringly slipped through my fingers, I will finally be able to capture,
 and subjugate, with my greatest hidden art.
 .........Only, I must sacrifice thirteen people for that purpose."
"......Hehheheheheh!
 It is not easy to gather thirteen sacrifices.
 But tonight is the family conference!
 Look how many have gathered on Rokkenjima.
 There could be no other day on which to carry out this ritual."
Taken literally, it could only sound as though he was telling them to die as sacrifices for his disturbing ritual.
Ridiculous.
 Was this some kind of metaphor...?
But they didn\'t even have a clue what he was trying to tell them through this analogy.
The siblings whispered together, wondering what Kinzo was saying......
"......What\'s Dad going on about?
 Is it his usual bad sickness...?"
"Probably.
 Keep quiet for now and hear him out."
"..........................."
"I\'m sorry, Father...
 I don\'t understand how you mean that."
"What is it you don\'t understand?
 I am speaking extremely simply.
 I have said that I shall choose thirteen people from among the humans on this island and offer them as sacrifices for my ritual to revive {f:5:Beatrice}."
"Even worthless people like you can be very useful as sacrifices for my ritual.
 Wa‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah!!"
"......Hear this!!
 This is not a joke nor anything of the sort.
 This is my final bet, my final ritual, the last I will desire in my life!"
"There are now more than thirteen humans on this island.
 In short, that\'s a head count which can easily satisfy this massive number of sacrifices!
 Become the sacrifices for my ritual!!"
"......Kinzo‐san, ......you weren\'t...possibly......
serious about what you said back then...?!
 It wasn\'t a joke......?!!"
Unusually for Nanjo, his face changed color and he stood up and shouted.
It seemed this wasn\'t the first time Nanjo had heard all this dark talk about thirteen sacrifices.
"Sorry, my friend.
 That was not a joke nor anything of the sort.
 It is what I bet my life on, the final ritual, the final game that I will challenge."
"Yes, this is a game!
 If gaining my fortune and leaving the island is your goal, then there are only two ways to achieve it!"
"Successfully survive being chosen as one of the thirteen sacrifices, and stop the ritual by finally solving the riddle of the epitaph,
 ......or kill me!
 And stop the ritual in that manner.
 Those are the only two ways!!"
By now, it was no longer whispering among those gathered there, but uneasy commotion.
Even the siblings had noticed that Kinzo was beginning to act abnormally...
"......Father, are you a little tired?
 Genji‐san, has Father been drinking at all?"
"...............No.
 The Master is quite lucid."
"Sorry, Dad,
 but I don\'t have a clue what you\'ve started going on about......"
"You\'re free to start up whatever weird ritual you want to revive the witch you love.
 That\'s your hobby, after all.
 But dragging me into all that, and making me into......hahaha, a sacrifice, is just not gonna happen."
"Rudolf, who asked you to chip in?!"
"What are you talking about, Aneki?!
 You think I\'m gonna sit here nodding my head at this, are you nuts?!"
Was the "ritual" Kinzo had mentioned literally the frightening thing it seemed to be,
 or was it some kind of test to choose his successor?
It seemed that Rudolf had taken it at its disturbing face value,
 but Eva apparently still believed that it was something like a trial, or examination,
 to find the proper next head.
But Kinzo\'s response to this was clear.
"Well, that is all I have to say.
 Nooo objections or viewpoints are necessary...!!"
"I will simply awaken from my dream in which I have four failures for children.
 To all of you, what will occur now before your very eyes will no doubt seem like a dream, an illusion, an unearthly world that defies understanding."
"But that itself is my reality!!
 Now, I will finally awaken from the fleeting and useless dream that all of you are!!"
"Come, the game has already begun!
 With this many of you here, I hardly know whose life I should take first...!!"
"Good‐bye, my bungling sons and daughters.
 And for the final and only time in your lives, be of use to me, for my ritual...!!
 Arise, Pendragon Memorial Troops...!!"
As Kinzo raised his arms high like an opera singer, and yelled those words as though towards a packed audience...
...the air shattered like glass, .........and the figures of three people who hadn\'t been invited to this island appeared regardless......
"Chiester{ruby:forty‐five:45}, right here...!"
"Chiester{ruby:four‐one‐zero:410}, right heere!"
"Chiester{ruby:double‐oh:00}, right here, sir."
Three girls with bizarre forms suddenly appeared behind Kinzo.
Where from?
 When?
 Who?
 Who are they??
......The {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s were thrown off balance and their minds went blank.
{n}And because they wasted time with such thoughts, they lost their last chance to survive.
"I grant you permission to shoot six people to death.
 You have free choice of targets.
 Begin attacking."
"Unrestricted firing understood, sir.
 Thank you for the good targets.
 All units, commence unrestricted firing."
"Nihi!
 First one in nyeh!!
 Hyahhah!!"
As 410 scratched the air with her finger, a golden bow appeared in empty space, and its string was pulled back.
The golden arrow that had been readied there was fired off without any hesitation, flew around the room leaving haphazard gold trails everywhere,
 .........and from among those sitting at the table of the family conference, it chose Natsuhi, and pulverized the left half of her face.
Flesh and deep‐red blood splattered all around,
 leaving a massive amount of deep‐red spatter marks on the relatives\' faces and the pure white tablecloth.
......There was silence.
Despite the massive number of deep‐red blotches left on the tablecloth, even still,
 .........no one could understand why Natsuhi\'s head was half smashed, nor why she was hanging her head as though she had dozed off in her chair,
 .........and they watched these events in silence.
......Those sitting on the right‐hand side from Natsuhi were silent for a relatively long time,
 but those sitting on her left were not.
......Because the people sitting on that side...
had been shown how her head had been smashed open like a watermelon or a pomegranate, and could even see inside her......
"Na......tsuhi............"
"......That\'s one.
 Natsuhi, I see. A luckless woman to the end.
 ......Next!"
"00, firing."
In the same way, 00 scratched the empty air to ready her bow, and fired.
Just like the golden arrow 410 had released, it flew around and around at high speeds, drawing a convoluted trail, after which,
 ......as he looked at Natsuhi in shock, it smashed half of Rudolf\'s head in the same way, killing him instantly.
This time, everyone did not stop thinking altogether.
 They realized that a terrible murder had been carried out right in front of them according to Kinzo\'s words.
And they understood that Kinzo would probably kill again......!
""Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!""
""Kyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!!""
Shrill screams burst out.
Even now, they still didn\'t know what to do.
{n}So they could only keep screaming and flapping their wide‐open mouths like goldfish......
"F‐......Father......
what do you think you\'re doing......?"
"...Y‐you dolt!!
 Hurry up and run!!"
As Eva asked Kinzo that in total shock,
 Hideyoshi, who had come to his senses and risen from his chair faster than anyone else, pulled at her arm from behind.
However, merciless fate\'s choice for the third sacrifice...
......was Hideyoshi.
Just like the two before him, half of Hideyoshi\'s head was neatly smashed,
 ......and the right side of his head, which happened to be facing that direction at the time, ......was blown away, chunks of its contents thrown everywhere like a watermelon or a pomegranate.
So, still holding Eva, ......Hideyoshi toppled backwards and fell down.
Still held by her beloved husband, Eva fell over backwards with him.
"Honey......?
 Honey...?!
 HiiiIiiIIiiiIIIIIII!!!"
Eva screamed.
...And who could blame her.
The face she had been looking for......had been half lost,
 and the crushed skull, the squelchy exposed brain, and the crushed jaw were all bare......
"45, impact, on target...!"
"Spectacular.
 Fire again.
 Three remain."
"F‐Father...!!
 W‐w‐w‐w‐w‐what, what...are you doing?!?!"
Krauss stood up forcefully, and was about to rush Kinzo, when 00 blocked him.
......Despite her slender‐looking body, she held back Krauss\'s body with just the palm of her right hand.
He still tried to resist and attack Kinzo,
 so 00 lifted Krauss up by the collar, and twisted into his Adam\'s apple with her thumb.
It seemed to be very painful, and Krauss was overcome with agony.
"Gghh...oooooooohhhh......!!!
 Everyone, ...run...!!
 Get the police......!
 Emergency services...!!
 Quickly......!!"
"Everyone, let\'s escape!!
 Escape!!"
Nanjo\'s sharp words finally broke the spell that had been holding them down in their chairs.
As Gohda and Kumasawa made a mad scramble to escape from the dining hall...
...410 teleported to that spot, blocking the way.
"Nihi! You sure are slow nye~h.
 Did you think I\'d let you escape nye~h{p:0:♪}"
"Hiieeeeeeeeeehhhh!!"
"H‐help meeeeeeeeeeeee!!"
"Gohda‐san, duck!!"
At the sound of Kyrie\'s sharp voice, Gohda, in a state of complete confusion, ducked.
......Then, a burst of air rushed above his head.
Kyrie had taken a big swing with a chair to mow 410 down.
But 410, still wearing a contemptuous expression, easily caught that widely swung chair with one hand.
"......Tch!"
"You\'re a scary woman nyeh.
 You really wanna follow your husband that baaaaad?"
From the sleeve of the arm that she had used to catch the chair, something like a shining golden snake appeared,
 ......coiled itself around the chair, and with a huge CRUNCH!! burst it into splinters.
It was a fearsome power, far stronger than any vice.
When Kyrie realized that the being in front of her, which looked like a girl,
 was actually a being that surpassed human knowledge and which a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} could not even begin to oppose,
 her head was filled with a great alarm bell that welled up from inside her...
Even with a scene like this before their eyes, Genji, Shannon, and Kanon, the servants permitted to wear the One‐winged Eagle, continued to stand calmly at attention by the wall,
 making them look very bizarre and eerie.
For an instant, Kyrie thought that the source of their calmness...
was that they were with the enemy, and had been guaranteed that they wouldn\'t be killed.
......But no sooner had she thought that than the side of Genji\'s face was blown away before her eyes.
"G‐Genji‐san......"
"45, impact, on target...!"
"......Hohoh, Genji, now that is unfortunate.
 ......Rest in peace, my friend.
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*, your death will not be wasted.
 You will become one of the thirteen keys essential to the resurrection of my beloved witch.
 Fuhha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha......"
The half of Genji\'s expression that remained...
...was as indifferent as ever.
He tilted, ......fell in a heap, and sent a blood‐red splatter out across the floor......
".........Genji‐sama..............."
"............We\'re nothing more...than the witch\'s pieces.
 .........Nothing more............nothing more......"
From the meek, ...and frustrated...
no, ......resigned expressions on Shannon and Kanon\'s faces, you couldn\'t feel any naive expectation that they would be saved.
That\'s right.
 Kinzo was, in the truest sense, .........carrying out these murders at random.
In the truest sense, ......he was killing like it was a game to see who would be saved and who would be killed.
"Wellll then, whoo\'ll we go for next nye~h.
 Nihhihi!!"
410 looked at Kyrie for a second.
{n}In that second, ......Kyrie prepared for her own death.
But once she had readied her golden bow in midair, 410 looked at someone else over Kyrie\'s shoulder.
......So, as shameless as it was, Kyrie sensed that she had been saved......
Again, an ugly sound of something cracking and exploding rang throughout the room.
......Who was it this time?
When Kyrie turned in the direction of the sound...
.........she saw Eva collapse onto her husband\'s chest, gushing blood like a fountain.
...Of course, her face was half smashed just like her husband\'s......
410 had mercilessly targeted Eva as she clung to her husband\'s body, sobbing.
"L‐let go of Nii‐san...!!
 Let go of Nii‐san...!!
 Just stop it, Father!!
 Just stop this brutality!!"
"......Run, Rosa......
 Ggh, ghhk, .........!"
Rosa\'s protestations weren\'t reaching Kinzo as he continued to laugh loudly in the blood‐spattered dining hall,
 and nor was she able to lessen Krauss\'s pain as 00 lifted him up by the collar.
So Rosa had no choice but to use force.
 She raised one of the chairs beside her over her head, and gave a warning.
"Father...!!
 Order her to let go of Nii‐san!
 Just make them stop all this!!"
"I think not.
 If that is what you desire, then prevent it using your own power.
 ......Cut a path open for your own fate with your own hands.
 You who have always hid behind the backs of others in fear, show me the final bit of self‐mastery that dwells within you...!!
 Fuhha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!!"
"F‐......Father......
 .........UWAAA{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}Aa{0}A{0}Aa{0}AHHHH!!!"
The chair that Rosa had lifted up...
......swung down at the father who had reigned as a symbol of terror for her entire life.
It was the greatest, and final, act of bravery and self‐mastery in Rosa\'s life.
Kinzo might have been right.
......If she had grasped that courage much, much sooner,
 her life might have been more free, unrestrained by anyone else.
Then, a loud bursting sound.
......The sound of Rosa\'s chair fiercely hitting Kinzo,
 ...it was not.
Still lifting up the chair,
 .........she neatly lost half of her head, and fell with a thud.
While still holding Krauss up with one hand, ......00 had stuck her other hand out towards Rosa.
The golden snake released from that arm...
had constricted Rosa in a helix,
 ......and chewed a hole through her head.
"......Defensive firing.
 I apologize for the discourtesy of a point‐blank shot, sir."
"It matters not.
 Hmm, so this makes six?"
"Yes, Lord {f:5:Goldsmith}, sir.
 This makes six."
After declaring this with indifference, 00 let go of Krauss, who she had been lifting up this whole time.
"Hmmm.
 So, the sacrifices of the first twilight were Eva, Rudolf, Rosa, Natsuhi, Hideyoshi, and Genji.
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"
It was a massacre that happened in an instant.
The interior of the dining hall was dirtied with blood spatter,
 ......and the six unlucky victims lay with their heads brutally exposed.
Fittingly, it was Kinzo\'s abnormal laugh alone that echoed in that abnormal space......
"Hahhahahahahaha, wahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!
 The curtain has finally risen!
 It\'s the beginning of the ritual to revive {f:5:Beatrice}...!!"
"You lucky ones who have managed to escape the first twilight, allow me to introduce you to my friends.
 Arise, my friend!
 Ronove...!!"
When Kinzo called Ronove\'s name, the demon butler appeared out of thin air, bowing deeply and respectfully......
"It is a pleasure to meet you all.
 And to those of you for whom this is a long‐overdue reunion, good day.
 Pu ku ku ku...!
 It seems that we once again have a spectacular mess on our hands."
"I care not.
 This level of stimulus is necessary to wake me from my days of waking dreams.
 Allow me to introduce you. My friend, reliable butler, and one of the 72 Great Demons, Ronove."
"I am pleased to make your acquaintance."
Just who was he aiming that introduction at?
......Krauss and Kyrie, who were still down on their backsides, and Nanjo, and Gohda, and Kumasawa...
could only look up in shock at this middle‐aged gentleman who they had never met before......
Only Shannon and Kanon seemed to recognize him, and they bowed deeply...
"......I see that I was unable to greet Genji.
 I hope that he was at least able to complete his duty painlessly."
"It was an instant death from a direct hit to the head...!
 He didn\'t have the time to feel the pain."
"Is that so?
 Very good."
"Allow me to introduce another of my friends.
 Arise, my friend, {f:5:Virgilia}...!!"
Once again, the figure of someone unknown to the relatives appeared out of thin air.
{n}She appeared in an elegant dress while greeting them gracefully.
".........I thank you for summoning me, my lord.
 Although I would rather not have been summoned into a sanguinary place such as this."
"Allow me to introduce her too.
 This is my friend and reliable counselor both, {f:5:Virgilia}.
 ......I want to borrow your power as a great Finite Witch for my ritual.
 Lend me that power!"
"......As someone under your powerful summoning subordination, I would not be permitted to refuse even if I tried.
 As you wish, my lord."
"............He is a fearsome fellow.
 To think that he summoned three of the Chiester Sisters Corps, and then me, and even {f:5:Virgilia}‐sama..."
"......Even though it is only in the area of summoning, to think that he far surpasses Milady is......frightening.
 The Ushiromiya blood makes my own run cold."
"I will be putting all I have as a summoner into the execution of {f:5:Beatrice}\'s resurrection ritual.
 It\'s still not enough.
 In order to perfectly succeed in the ritual this time, I shall summon more."
"The Pendragon Memorial Troops, Ronove, and {f:5:Virgilia}...
 ......I can still call more... With my magical power, I can still call many more......!!"
"Answer to my summons......
one of the 72 demons, Gaap!!"
"Gaap...?
 You can even summon her......?"
"It probably means that the corrosion has advanced even more on this island.
 ......It\'s enough to enable us to manifest.
 It would surely not be a surprise to see him summon any kind of great demon at this stage."
"Then Rokkenjima has already been completely sucked into a parallel world?
 ............I hope he doesn\'t surrender."
".........You gave him a good deal of hints the last time, did you not?
 After all this time, he won\'t surrender over this much.
 Probably, I should say."
"Pu ku ku!
 .........Well then, I suggest we enjoy the action unfolding on the stage.
 It seems the main character is the Master this time.
 Let us look forward to a script of a different flavor than Milady\'s."
As Kinzo strongly concentrated his magical power, ......a pale blue light gathered in the air, twisted,
 ......and a magic circle began to be drawn with a deep‐red light.
Then it shattered with a sound like glass, .........and a new demon could be seen there.
"......I am glad to see that you answered my call.
 ......Gaap, one of the 72 Great Demons...!"
"............This is a hell of a place I\'ve been summoned into.
 Did you call me to clean up this blood‐stained room?
 {f:5:Goldsmith}...?"
The literally devilish woman, wrapped in a gaudy, ominous costume,
 looked at the horrifying scene which should have made her cover her eyes, ...and her mouth twisted into a grin......
"If that had been the only reason for calling you,
 it would be like using a cashmere scarf to mop the floor."
"It\'s been a long time, Gaap.
 ......To think that a Great Demon such as yourself has finally appeared on this island.
 ......I wonder if this island has nearly sunk into fantasy."
"This all‐star cast is more atonishing than the gruesome state of the room.
 .........A full three Chiester Sisters, the Great Demon Ronove, the Great Witch {f:5:Virgilia}, and even me."
"What\'s going on?
 Is this Pandemonium?
 Are you trying to start a concert from hell or something?
 .........Yes, as a conductor for that, I can\'t imagine anyone other than you, {f:5:Goldsmith}."
"I will have your assistance as facilitator in the completion of my ritual to resurrect {f:5:Beatrice}.
 You have no objections to my summoning contract, I assume...?"
"Objections?
 There\'s no way {i:I} could fight the summoning subordination of the legendary Great Summoner, Lord {f:5:Goldsmith}, who enslaved the famous Great Witch {f:5:Beatrice}."
"......I\'ll assist you.
 Although I will of course charge a fitting price.
 ......So?
 What\'s my first job?"
"Capture the simpletons who made it through the first twilight.
 Fortunately, there are still seven here, aren\'t there?
 Nanjo, Shannon, Kanon, Gohda, Kumasawa, Kyrie, and Krauss...!"
"Hoh, if these seven are all offered as sacrifices, that\'s exactly thirteen people!
 Until it is time for the second and later twilights to be carried out, throw them into the cage of sacrifices, gehehehah!!"
"............A cashmere mop, I see.
 Understood."
As Gaap shrugged her shoulders, she looked at Krauss, who was still down on his butt.
She glared.
Then, she snapped her fingers, ......and Krauss was swallowed up by the floor, as though a round pitfall had opened up there.
"Uu...waarg........."
"One down."
There was no hole in the floor.
 But it had certainly looked as though Krauss had been swallowed up by a hole and disappeared......
"............!!"
Searching for her next prey, Gaap\'s gaze crossed Kyrie\'s.
{n}She snapped her fingers.
Kyrie jumped back as though repelled.
Her instinct was correct.
 Because, in the place where she had been until a second ago, a round, jet‐black hole had appeared, the same kind that had swallowed up Krauss.
However, before she could catch her balance, another pitfall appeared and swallowed her up.
......Even Kyrie had no way of eluding Gaap\'s capture.
"Uwaahhhhh......!!"
Snap went her fingers once again, and a shocked Nanjo disappeared into the floor.
Another snap of the fingers,
 and 410 let out a short yelp and jumped back.
This time, a slightly larger pitfall had opened, taking in both Shannon and Kanon, who had been standing in a line by the door.
But because 410 had jumped away from the door, the way was no longer blocked.
Instinctively aware that they would be next, Gohda dashed out through that door.
Of course, Kumasawa too was hot on his heels, and ran off at lightning speed.
As Gaap snapped her fingers over and over,
 round, jet‐black pitfalls opened one after another behind them, chasing them.
However, they did nothing but drive the desperately fleeing pair forward, and couldn\'t swallow them up.
Gohda and Kumasawa escaped in a matter of seconds......
".........I\'ve dulled.
 I let two get away."
"Worry not, we are currently locking onto the fleeing targets."
"Data link ready.
 Nihi!
 Shall we snipe?"
"No, I cannot authorize that.
 They are precious sacrifices.
 Wait for the Master\'s authorization."
"Great Lord {f:5:Goldsmith}...!
 We await your orders...!"
"It is still too soon for the coming of the second twilight, ......is what the source of my magical power is whispering to me.
 Not now.
 Let them do as they like.
 They cannot escape from this island in any case."
"The source of your magical power is noise and risk and tests of luck.
 ......Hoh‐hoh‐ho, your whims, in other words?"
"Hhhhehhehheh, perhaps you could also put it that way.
 Good work, Gaap.
 Let us proceed steadily with the ritual from here on."
".........Well then, that is that.
 Next is my grandchildren.
 .........I will test them to see whether they are qualified to succeed me.
 Let me see, how best to check their qualifications.
 Kuheheheh...!!"
"If you determine that they are qualified,
 ......do you intend to abandon Beato\'s resurrection?"
"Of course.
 Yet still I will test them.
 ......Hmph, I doubt a woman can understand that contradiction, or my madness.
 Khhhahahahah..."
".........There\'s always something not quite right about men.
 The very concept of playing with risk is beyond me."
"Oh, and here I thought you loved that sort of thing?"
"Of course.
 If a man whispers intimacies in my ear along with dangerous risk, I go head over heels.
 ...But only if he\'s a stud!"
"Pu ku ku ku ku ku...!"
"Quiet, please.
 No talking among yourselves."
"Hmph, truly noisy women.
 But at least they don\'t bore me.
 ......This is why summoning is so gratifying.
 All of you will bear one side of the scales of noise and risk in my ritual.
 I am anticipating great results...!"
Six brutally murdered corpses lay in the dining hall, which was tarnished by a red and gruesome decoration......
By now, it was impossible to imagine that thirteen people had been sitting here in an orderly manner just moments ago.
Kinzo lined up the demons of renown and their subordinates, loudly declared the beginning of an overwhelming night of mass murder,
 and swore to himself that he would certainly revive {f:5:Beatrice}, and open the door to the Golden Land......
"The wait is over!!
 At last the curtain rises on the first twilight!!
 *cackle*!
 That Kinzo, as usual, he loves being flashy.
 Who knew that this man, who can be more persistent than anything when he follows you around, could shine so when placed on the stage."
"Dammit......
 Always killing them in a gory way......
 Destroying half of their heads?!
 The sick shit you witches and demons pull never fails to piss me off...!"
"Destroying half of their heads...... I see.
 So she noticed that the most ideal method of killing, in all the games up until now, was this one."
"Ideal?
 How the crap is this grotesque way of killing ideal?!"
"......It\'s very much ideal.
 Try and remember the very first game."
"You......!
 So you\'re that new demon or whatever that just appeared...
 Goddammit, so the witch\'s corrosion advanced, and now there are even more unsavory characters...?!"
......The more the witch\'s corrosion progresses, the more Rokkenjima tilts towards the other world.
That\'s why strange people keep appearing one by one.
This island is closed off by the typhoon, and not only can no {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s leave it, but new {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s can\'t appear either.
But the more the corrosion progresses, the more witches and demons can appear, without limit.
 Increasing one by one.
By now, perhaps there are more demons than {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s among the characters appearing in this insane tale.
 ......Their numbers might be precisely the figure representing this mad corrosion.
Yeah, I\'m sure that\'s true.
 And not only are their numbers being affected by the corrosion, their fashion sense apparently is as well.
If the corrosion advances any further and even more weird people appear, just what in the world will they be wearing?
 .........It\'s too scary for me to imagine...
......Aaaah, seriously, give me a break...
{n}Please, no more of these weird‐ass people...!!
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*! I can\'t oblige—they\'ll keep on coming, more and more!!
 I\'ll defile the foolish "closed circle" rule {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s speak of, over and over again...!"
"Welcome to my elegant game!
 Gaap!"
".........It\'s been a long time, Riiche.
 Been well?
 ...In fact, you look pretty great.
 Have you gotten younger?
 You look two, maybe three hundred years younger than when I last saw you.
 ............Ah, I see."
The demon Grandfather had summoned and introduced as Gaap...
took a glance at me, and then grinned as though she\'d figured something out on her own.
......Honestly, I felt that smile was repulsive.
"Looks like she\'s Beato\'s friend.
 ......Which means she must be an extremely unsavory character.
 Anyway, they were saying something or other about a closed circle, but what does that mean?"
"Serial murder mystery novels that occur in places isolated from the outside world, like Rokkenjima is now, are sometimes called closed circles.
 Since it\'s isolated from the outside, it\'s like a circle that\'s closed.
 ......Therefore, in general, the characters and suspects are limited."
"Having new possible suspects added on one after another from outside the circle goes against the etiquette of mystery novels.
 ......Basically, the witch is probably trying to desecrate {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s and the mystery genre."
".........So you are Gretel?
 I see, you look like a wise kid, ......*giggle*.
 I like that kind of kid.
 ......Their tongues just melt in the mouth."
"Gross.
 ......Keep the jokes to just your clothing."
"It\'s Devilish Pretty\'s newest, "Jack the Ripper: Christmas Blood".
 ......Sorry for having a style that a country bumpkin from the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} world can\'t understand."
"......Well, I can at least tell it\'s breathable.
 Why don\'t you add a gap down your head while you\'re at it?
 Might help your brain cells breathe a bit as well."
"Gaap is always sensitive to the fashions of the netherworld!
 But this year\'s fads truly are bold.
 I think I\'ll order something sometime...!"
"For you, Riiche, I\'d recommend {nobr:Ali‐Gray}—Alice and the Graveyard.
 Let\'s go to {c:86EF9C:666} sometime soon to look at the clothes.
 You should come over to the netherworld every now and then."
"When this game is over, I\'ll be sure to do that.
 *cackle*cackle*!"
".........Still, your two opponents are pretty cute, Riiche.
 I\'ll bet this kid has figured out the meaning of the corpses with their heads half smashed.
 .........Do you get it, girl......?"
"......Just now, she told me to remember the first game.
 ......What did that mean...?"
"Just what it sounds like.
 ......Remember the first twilight of the very first game.
 ......When the adults\' corpses were found in the gardening shed with the magic circle drawn on it.
 Remember?"
Episode 1.
 The first twilight.
Six people—Krauss, Rudolf, Kyrie, Rosa, Shannon, and Gohda—had died, and each of them had had their head pulverized.........
"At that time, there were two types of corpses.
 The ones with their faces pulverized, and the ones with half of their faces pulverized."
"That\'s right.
 Four with their faces smashed—Rudolf, Kyrie, Rosa, and Gohda.
 Two with the sides of their heads smashed—Krauss and Shannon."
"......At the time, I had fickly created two types of corpses,
 but I realized that the former, more atrocious type was actually disadvantageous for me."
"......Disadvantageous for you......?
 ............Right.
 I get it."
That\'s right.
 The smashed faces might look atrocious.
{n}......But they made it hard to confirm the identity of the person.
For example, at that time, Uncle Krauss and Shannon‐chan had had their heads only half‐smashed.
That itself was of course atrocious, but because half of their faces remained, it was easy to confirm their identity.
But Dad and the other three were different.
Because his face had been completely destroyed, even I, his son, could only guess that it had to have been Dad because of his clothes and the like.
......In short, it remained unclear until the end whether that really was Dad\'s corpse.
"If this reasoning battle had taken place during the first game as well,
 I would probably have claimed that, since it was impossible to confirm that those corpses were indeed Dad and the others, there was a possibility that one was a fake corpse.
 ......After all, Beato didn\'t state anything in red during that game whatsoever."
"Well done. Correct.
 .........A faked death is one of the basics of the mystery genre.
 Even if you make a doctor examine the corpse, you can\'t trust the results if you suspect him of being in league with the culprit.
 So, corpses that can\'t guarantee a death for certain always put the witch side at a disadvantage."
"You can suspect faked deaths for all corpses, and hypothesize that they are the culprit for the incidents that follow.
 ......It\'s a move Battler doesn\'t like, but it\'s the most elementary move to use against a witch."
"Yeah, that\'s right.
 That\'s why Beato started using the red.
 ......With the red truth, she can carry out a perfect autopsy."
"*cackle*cackle*!
 That\'s how it is.
 Normally, for the tragedy of the first twilight,
 I would use the red truth right away, confirming the deaths of these six."
"However, as you know, my battle strategy this time is the complete opposite of previous games, and I have switched to using red truth starvation tactics...!"
"I will not use the red easily given that you use it as a grounding from which to counterattack.
 I can just make you come apart at the seams by using the minimum necessary amount of red in just a single place!"
"What this means is that no matter how I permit you to rant about your theories for each of the locked rooms, ultimately,
 I need only smash one of those with a single red truth."
"Ihihi!
 You\'ve been knocking me about with that thing all this goddamn time, and now I\'ve started using it to counterattack, you\'ve gone and put it away again.
 What a joke."
"Anyways, I don\'t wanna use the red, I wanna be stingy!
 I wanna bully Battleeer!!"
"But how could I guarantee a death for certain without using red?
 I racked and racked my brains over it.
 ......It was Gaap that gave me the idea!
 It truly was a simple method.
 *cackle*cackle*!"
"......I just said something obvious and you hit upon the idea.
 I simply said that you just have to create corpses whose identity and total death can be easily appreciated by anyone who looks at them."
"Kuhhihihihi!
 In short, I combined the two!
 The face, which is necessary to distinguish their identity; and the symbol of total death, the pulverization of the head, which is the vessel for the soul!"
"When I put those two parts neatly together, oh, hey presto!
 Out came the <perfect> answer of corpses with their heads half destroyed!"
"I\'ll bet you love two‐flavor bread and two‐flavor ice cream.
 Your greedy childish tastes are so obvious..."
".........In any event,
 even if their heads are half destroyed, we shouldn\'t assume that they\'re dead at this point in time."
"I know.
 ......Since Beato is holding out on me and refusing to say anything in red, I should suspect everything.
 ......Of course, there\'s no way in hell I\'m gonna swallow the magic mass‐murder by the sexy‐assed Chiester babes."
"*giggle*.
 You certainly have become shrewd.
 ......If this were the first game, you would have swallowed everything."
"*cackle*cackle*!
 An adversary must be like that, or he wouldn\'t be interesting."
"There is no red for now—I suggest you capitalize on that to let your imagination run wild and build up theory upon theory.
 At the very end, at the very sweetest spot, I\'ll cut them all down at once with the red truth...!""..................Ah, ...............uug........."
Silent.
 Black.
 Cold.
 Painful.
Rosa regained consciousness bit by bit......
And the first thing she thought...was that it would have been better if she hadn\'t.
After all, her body was so cold and hurt so much, ......and it became worse the more her consciousness returned.
It felt like she had been sleeping in the darkness for a long time now, face‐down on ice‐cold marble.
......Aaah, this is why I always tell myself.
{n}Even if it\'s just a nap, at least get on the sofa.
I always know that if I naively try and close my eyes for just a second,
 and end up sleeping on the floor or at my desk, it\'ll hurt my body later and I\'ll suffer for it......
Because she slept on such a cold and hard floor, she was chilled to the bone.
Because she slept on such a hard and cold floor, the side of her face that had been pressing down against it was very painful.
......If she were to look in a mirror right now, she was sure she would see an embarrassing mark.
She didn\'t think that just rubbing it would make that mark disappear,
 but she stroked the hurting side of her face for the time being, trying to smooth it over...
......Where.........is this?
She thought it was pitch black, but that appeared not to be the case.
{n}After all, she could faintly see her own body.
......Without a doubt, there was some source of light,
 but even when she looked up at the ceiling, ......or else the sky, there was only an expanse of blackness, and she couldn\'t see any such thing.
Her body alone was slightly lit,
 whereas everything else was sunk in darkness......that\'s what this world was like.
It was almost as though Rosa alone had been abandoned in a forgotten world.
As her mind grew clearer,
 she started getting nervous about why she was all alone in a lonely place like this.
......When she was about to call out, asking if anyone was there,
 ......patter,
 ...patter,
 she heard footsteps coming towards her.
They were light footsteps, so she thought it was probably a kid.
{n}They didn\'t feel creepy to her, so she wasn\'t afraid.
But they also weren\'t Maria\'s footsteps,
 so, wondering who in the world would be in a darkness like this, she stared in the direction she could hear the footsteps from.
.........As she did, ......a faint, approaching silhouette came into view.
It looked......like a child much younger than Maria.
......Who is that?
 I didn\'t know him.
But, the expression on his face was like a lost child separated from his parents.
...As a parent with a daughter myself, I felt as though my chest was being torn apart...
‘........................Uryu.’
"......ah— ............"
The instant the kid muttered that infantile word,
 ......I felt a sharp pain in the half of my face that was aching from the cold floor, as though it had been pierced by long, thin, hard needles.
I reflexively pressed my hand against that side of my face.
‘......Are you okay......?
 Does it still hurt......?’
"...Thank you, little guy.
 .........Where is this...?
 It\'s really......cold."
‘......Come this way......
 You can\'t be here......’
He took my other hand and pulled, with a grim expression on his face.
......I don\'t have a clue what\'s going on.
 However, a single honest expression from a child...
can often tell the truth better than a hundred empty words from an adult.
She didn\'t understand the situation, but even so, Rosa dashed along with him wherever she was pulled...
However, this was a world where nothing could be seen in the darkness except for their own forms.
{n}She couldn\'t even really feel whether she was actually moving forwards as she ran.
......Even though I\'m running, I can\'t even feel any wind.
 It\'s as though I\'m still inside a nightmare...that kind of unreal feeling...
So even though I was running, I couldn\'t maintain my sense of balance, and my legs got tangled and I fell.
......Even in a world that didn\'t feel real, the pain of smashing my face against the cold, hard floor was reality itself.
‘Uryu...... Are you okay......?’
"Ug—.........hh...
 ......I\'m sorry, my head hurts."
......When he said that......infantile word "uryu", pain like being stuck with needles ran though my head again.
Even though it had only happened twice,
 I was somehow able to understand that his word was the cause of my pain.
......So I said so frankly.
"I\'m sorry.
 Could you stop saying that "uryu"...?"
‘Uryu......’
"Hhhk, ......excuse me, I asked you to stop..."
‘U‐...au, ...uu!
 Sorry......’
This time, I got the feeling that his words of apology made me feel a sharp pain in my forehead.
.........What is...this child......?
I know there\'s no malice in him,
 ......but when I\'m around him,
 ......my head hurts......
‘......Are you okay......?
 Let\'s hurry up and go......
 You mustn\'t be here.......’
"Why shouldn\'t I be here...?
 Come on, where is this......?
 Who are you?
 Where is your mama...?"
‘.........But the one who made me...
...is you, Mama...’
"......Huh......?"
He stared at me with round eyes.
......This kid\'s mama.........is me......?
{n}......Who is he?
 Who is this kid?
I don\'t remember at all.
‘Did you......forget about me......?
 You made me, you know......?’
"......Wait a second, stop kidding around.
 ...Maria is my only child.
 .........That\'s right, where is Maria?
 Where\'s Maria?!
 Maria......?!"
I suddenly grew uneasy about Maria not being there.
{n}Why am I all alone in a place like this?
Where\'s Maria?!
{n}Maria being there for me is the only thing that keeps me together...!
‘...Maria is here, ......but she\'s not Maria right now.
 It\'s better if you don\'t see her at the minute.
 That will be better for you, and Maria as well.
 .........For Maria\'s sake as well, run away.’
"Huh......?
 What are you talking about?
 Where\'s Maria?
 Maria?!
 Answer meee!!"
‘Maria will find you...!
 Come this way, quickly, Mama...!’
He pulled my hand again.
 ......He was probably pulling me in the opposite direction from Maria.
 So I stopped in my tracks.
"Let go...!
 Just who are you...?!
 Who said you could call me Mama...?!"
‘......You\'re the one who made me, Mama...
 Did you forget......?
 So that I could be Maria\'s birthday present,
 ......you made me with your own hands, ...did you forget......?’
"........................You......couldn\'t be......
.........Maria\'s......Sakutarou............?!"
‘Yeah.........
 The lion stuffed animal you made...!’
"Gya—!!"
A fierce, sharp pain struck me.
{n}It came from the palm of the hand he was grasping.
I instinctively knocked his hand away, and when I looked at my palm...
.........a hole the size of a thumb had opened there, and thick, deep‐red blood was gushing out.
...It was a hole so big that I could see through to the other side......
‘U‐uryu......!
 Are you okay?!
 Are you okay?!
 What happened...?!’
Sakutarou also noticed my wound, and panicked.
......Judging by his reaction, he couldn\'t understand why my hand had sustained a serious injury.
But, to my eyes, it felt like I had sustained that injury because he had grabbed my hand.
Whether there was malice in him or not,
 ......I understood that this child was something that would do harm to me, and he instantly became strange and frightening......
"Go away......!!
 I don\'t know you...!
 Sakutarou was just a disgusting, crappy stuffed animal, right...?!!"
"I don\'t know you, I\'m not your mama...!!
 Go away...!
 Disappear!!"
‘.........U..................yu.........’
Slowly, ......the base of Sakutarou\'s neck...
...tore in a horizontal line.
It gaped open, and the pitch blackness inside him peeked out.
{n}......There was no gushing of blood.
{n}Only an endlessly empty blackness.
And then, .........from the inside of the gash...
cotton snow poured out, ......and he slumped over, scattering bits of cotton about.
All that remained there......was crumpled yellow cloth,
 and bits of cotton that looked like sticky, crushed cotton candy.
.........A lion...stuffed animal.
Without a doubt.
 They were the remains of the Sakutarou stuffed animal I had torn apart on that day, overcome by my emotions.
The instant I admitted that,
 ............a long, sharp shriek that could rupture an eardrum tore the world apart......
"WAAA{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}AaaA{0}AaA{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}AaAaaA{0}A{0}AAH{0}H{0}HHhH{0}H{0}HHHhHH!!!
 Sakutaroooooooo, Sakutaroooooooooo, waaa{0}a{0}a{0}ahhaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aauuhhhh!!
 Waa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aauu{0}uuhhhh!!"
Like a flood from a broken dam, or like a broken TV...
{n}......Maria wailed in a high‐pitched voice.
.........Maria\'s voice, which made the ears throb, brought up two emotions...
The first was regret: "Aahh, I let my emotions get the better of me and committed a terrible mistake..."
A mother\'s desire to kneel down right away, hold Maria\'s head, cry with her and apologize.
......And in fact, I did that right away.
{n}I held Maria\'s head and apologized in tears for what I had done.
But Maria didn\'t stop crying.
 On the contrary, she rejected me, the one who had torn her closest friend apart, and pushed me away forcefully with both hands.
Since I had been on my knees in an unnatural position, I fell backwards easily.
Maria scraped together the yellow scraps of cloth and cotton bits, ......buried her face in them, and cried even more...
Watching that, the other emotion welled up.
{n}It welled up rapidly.
 ......And then burst.
I mean, she won\'t come around even when I apologize, and there\'s nothing I can do now anyway, and it\'s all Maria\'s fault in the first place...!!
I mean she can\'t make any friends because since she\'s forever taken up with this make‐believe stuffed animal thing, and that\'s why she\'s treated like a weirdo, and, you know...!!
This is a good opportunity...for instructive guidance!
 It\'s not like I was pampered all the time myself...!!
Things eventually break, are stolen, are broken!
Even I had lots of toys and treasures stolen, broken, made fun of,
 and thrown away by my brothers and sister and father and mother...!!
But though I might have cried about that, ......though I might have shed a few tears......
not once did I sob like this and trouble my parents,
 throw a tantrum, get in a terrible mood,
 pound and kick the floor and make a horrible racket...!!
I always wanted to, but I thought I\'d get in more trouble if I did, so I always, always held it in.
{a:c:
It\'s because I held it in{n}ThAT i wAS ablE TO beCoMe THe WOnDerFuL aDULT i aM NOw!!!}
Suddenly, I felt something strangely...missing.
The same feeling as when you use a tool recklessly, and it finally breaks, so that you\'re left holding only the base.
But I hadn\'t been using a tool.
{n}I had only been using my own two hands to hit Maria\'s head repeatedly.
So, ......I looked at my hands.
......From my wrists onwards, my hands had snapped off, cracked off, ......and were gone.
As though only those parts of my arms had become ceramic.
......No, everything beyond my wrists literally had become ceramic at some point, and had broken and fallen.
Cracks had formed in them because I had hit Maria too much, and they had fallen off.
......Look, see, ...aren\'t those my hands there, lying smashed by my feet......?
"h.........?
 hiiiiIiiIiIiiiiii...!!!"
There was no pain.
 But the shocking sight of both my hands breaking off at the wrists made me scream......
"Wh‐what?!
 What?!
 My hands, ......hands, hands...!!
 Eeee{0}e{0}e{0}e{0}e{0}e{0}e{0}e{0}e{0}e{0}e{0}e{0}e{0}e{0}e{0}e{0}e{0}eekkkk!!!"
"..............................
 .........This way, ......you won\'t be able to hit me anymore."
Ignoring my confusion, ......Maria said that with a very cold voice,
 ......as she slowly moved her hands away from her head, where they had been defending against my barrage......
"......What is this?!
 My hands, my hands...!!
 What did you do, Maria, what is this, what is this what is this...?!"
A black silhouette was suddenly standing behind Maria.
{n}......It was the silhouette of an adult.
............Who?!
".........Since an arm can pat a daughter\'s head, flip through a picture book, and make warm meals,
 ......I thought it might be alright to leave them."
"Mama hits my head more than she pats it.
 ......She doesn\'t turn the pages of a picture book.
 She doesn\'t even make food.
 ......I go to buy it myself."
"......But I\'m not allowed to go to the same store over and over,
 not allowed to have my face remembered, not allowed to talk to policemen...
 .........Why?
 Why is that?
 Did I do something wrong?"
"Am I not allowed to have you pat my head, have picture books read to me,
 eat dinner together with you...?
 Why?
 Why?!"
"It\'s NOT my fault!!
 Not my fault, yours!!
 YOUR fault!!"
"You don\'t play with me, but Sakutaro did!"
"He read books with me, watched TV with me, ate meals with me!!
 He was a much, MUCH more important friend than YOU!!!"
"...I, ......I\'m not proud of it...!
 Bu‐but it can\'t be helped, can it?!
 Mama\'s busy with work—work!!
 You know that Mama\'s busy with work, right?!
 What am I supposed to do?!!
 There\'s nothing I can do!!"
"That is true.
 There is nothing to be done.
 Nothing to be done about injuring your daughter, tearing her heart apart, and making her tears run with blood...!
 Then there\'s nothing to be done about the same thing happening again, right here, right now...!!"
"Come, {f:5:Maria}...!
 That is enough for the excuses of the woman who calls herself a mother.
 Can you forgive her, or not...?!
 Is she innocent, or else guilty?!?!"
"Can\'t forgive her!!
 Mama is guilty!!
 I\'ll make the same thing happen to Mama that she did to Sakutaro...!!
 Take Mama, ......and rip her from the seam at the neck,
 ......rip her apart, and throw the cotton inside her everywhere!!"
......Maria\'s eyes ominously flashed blue.
In that instant, invisible, massive arms stuck their fingernails out and grasped Rosa\'s entire body tightly.
The bones all throughout her body made sounds like twigs being stepped on as they readily cracked and broke.
.........Rosa vaguely understood.
 The massive arms are probably......my own arms, from the time I tore Sakutarou apart.
From a stuffed animal\'s perspective, my arms must certainly have been this massive.
So I could imagine what would happen next.
......The sharp nails stuck strongly into the base of my neck, ......and I heard the skin tearing with my own ears.
Then, watched over by the two witches, Rosa\'s flesh was split in two, top and bottom.
When Sakutarou had been torn apart, bits of cotton had flown about like snowflakes.
But in Rosa\'s case, something like thick black tar came out, filthily flying all over the place.
There wasn\'t even a trace of the red of blood.
{n}......It was something black, filthy and thick.
It was probably what a bloodless, tearless human kept inside their body instead.
"This is incredible. Hideous!
 What filthy insides...!
 That was splendid, {f:5:Maria}.
 Well then, is this enough for your revenge?
 Can you forgive your mother, or not?
 Innocent, or guilty...?!!"
"Can\'t forgive!!
 Still can\'t forgive, guilty...!!!"
{f:5:Beatrice} brandished her pipe wand,
 and a surge of gold butterflies regenerated Rosa\'s broken body in an instant...
".........kh, ......gh!
 *cough*cough*......!"
"Feel your great sin, which cannot be paid for by a single human life.
 And remember your own grievous sin...!
 Come, try to remember...!!
 Remember how great a sin you committed...!!"
.........Hello.
 ......Is that you, Mama?
 ......What time will you be back?
"I\'m sorry.
 I\'m busy with work again today, so I\'m staying over."
......Staying over at work again.........?
 ......Your job\'s being hard on you again today, huh...
"Yeah, I\'m sorry.
 I really am busy.
 I\'ve been holed up at the company this whole time.
 I can\'t even get a breath of outside air."
"Mama\'s job isn\'t one I can just finish up quick.
 Unless I give them the best design I can, I won\'t be given another job...that\'s how tough this job is.
 So it always needs a lot of time."
...Yeah.
 Understand.
 .........I\'ll be a good girl and watch over the house, so work really hard, finish it quickly, and come back home, okay......?
"Thank you for understanding about Mama\'s work......
 I promise that I\'ll buy a delicious cake and bring it home with me tomorrow."
Don\'t need cake.
 ......Instead of taking time to go to the cake store, I\'d be happier if you just came home that little bit sooner.
"Don\'t worry.
 I\'ll come back quickly, I promise.
 So let\'s eat delicious cake together.
 Let\'s drink delicious tea together.
 Let\'s read a new picture book together.
 Let\'s play with that "Wolves and Sheep Puzzle" I bought recently.
 Both of us together.
 ......It\'s a promise."
.........Yeah, promise.
 I\'ll be waiting.
 ............Do your best at work, Mama......
"Hohoh.
 It\'s a lonely story, but this is good mother‐daughter love, with each showing consideration for the other, is it not?
 Do you see any problem with it, Maria? Rosa?"
"..............................
 ......Th‐that promise, ......I believe I kept it.
 The next evening, didn\'t I do as I promised and return earlier than usual with the cake I bought?"
"That\'s not it, I knew......
 .........That evening.
 A pay‐on‐delivery package came for you, but there wasn\'t enough money in my wallet,
 so I called your company to ask you what to do."
"......I\'d been told only to call at special times,
 ......but thought it\'d be bad if the package was something important for your work...
 So I called."
"...................................."
".........And when I did, they told me you had the day off.
 ...They told me that it had been decided long ago that you would have the day off, .........and that you had gone far away to play.
 ............I knew.
 The whole, whole time, .........I knew that you were lying...!"
But you know what? ......Sakutaro scolded me, saying that wasn\'t true.
That Mama was very busy with her job every day.
That there was no way she would abandon me and play.
That the person who told me Mama had the day off must have made some kind of mistake...!
That\'s what Sakutaro said.
So I believed him.
 ......I believed him!
I love Mama, I love Mama...!
And of course Mama loves me too, loves me too!!
"...............Yes.
 Me too.
 I love you, Maria......"
Rosa let out a deep sigh.
{n}......Maybe she felt the weight of her words.
Then, she set the receiver back on the bedside phone.
The dark room made the windowside view of the starry sky on the ground stand out even more beautifully.
On the table in front of that terrace was a very cold wine cooler,
 and the one she was enjoying a glass with was gazing at the scene below...
".........You didn\'t tell your daughter that you were going on vacation?"
"I told her once, but she made such a fuss about it that I decided not to tell her anymore.
 It\'s less of a pain that way."
"......If you\'re worried about your daughter, surely you didn\'t have to force this into your schedule?"
"But that way, we\'d never get our schedules to match...
 Didn\'t I say not to worry about that?"
The slender, middle‐aged man clad in a white robe gave a small sigh.
Rosa reacted sensitively to that slight action......
"Come on!
 Let\'s not talk about my daughter.
 It\'d be a waste of this excellent wine."
"............I find you fascinating as both a woman and a human being.
 But for that very reason,
 I feel bad about taking so much of your time that it strains your relationship with your daughter."
"Aren\'t I always asking you not to worry about my relationship with my daughter...?!
 I make sure not to talk about her when I\'m alone with you, don\'t I?
 I wouldn\'t even have phoned from up here if it weren\'t for the noisy drunks laughing stupidly in the lobby downstairs...!"
"Rosa‐san.
 Couldn\'t you reconsider sudden vacations like this in the future, for your daughter\'s sake...?
 Isn\'t it alright if we only do it when our schedules match?"
"But then our schedules won\'t match at all......!
 Don\'t you understand, I......want to be with you all the time......!"
"That\'s how a child behaves when they\'re in love.
 Love between adults should be a little more stoic.
 ......Rosa‐san, I feel sad too that I can never stay with you for very long.
 But I think we\'re enjoying a very full adult romance with the limited time and opportunities we have."
"So you\'re telling me to be with my daughter more.
 ......Don\'t be a woman, be a mother?"
"......That\'s what you wish for too, isn\'t it?
 You must want to spend some relaxed time with your daughter.
 I\'m not going anywhere.
 I\'m trying to say that I think it\'s sad for you to sacrifice your daughter so you can prioritize your time with me."
"........................................
 ......Did you patch things up with your wife?
 .........You\'ve started thinking you don\'t want to split up, haven\'t you."
"I don\'t want to talk about my wife.
 Just like you don\'t want to talk about your daughter."
"......You\'ve started thinking that women with children are a pain."
"I have never said anything of the sort."
".........Whenever someone finds out I have a child, they desert me.
 ......Even when I tell them they don\'t need to worry about the cost of raising her, they all desert me...
 ......I...thought you understood about my daughter,
 .........but it looks like you really don\'t like women with children......"
"That\'s not what I\'m saying.
 Of course I like you, Rosa‐san.
 I\'m just trying to say to take better care of your daughter—
you must want that yourself—so I don\'t want you to hurt yourself by lying to your daughter.
 That\'s all I\'m saying."
"Liar!!!
 You just can\'t be bothered to deal with me any more, can you?!"
"I never said that...!"
"No, I know, I can tell.
 After being abandoned so many times because of that child, I know,
 I can tell by your mood, yes, you\'re the same, you\'re just like the other men!!
 You don\'t want a woman with a child, you don\'t want a divorcee, you don\'t want to deal with it!!"
"You don\'t want to become the parent of a child made with another man, right?
 No, of course you don\'t, I know exactly how that feels!!"
"I once went out with a man with children, and I absolutely understood that feeling...!!
 That\'s why......I believed that I could be together with you, a person who understood about my daughter!!"
"Ghagh!!
 *cough*, ......*cough*......
 ......That\'s right......
 You were......always in the way......"
".............................."
"......If not for you, ......I would have been able to grasp my happiness as a woman long ago......
 Your existence......constantly gets in the way of my happiness......"
"............Ma...ma........."
".........Even I didn\'t want to give birth to you...
 No, that\'s wrong.
 ......I did think it\'d be nice to build a happy family together with you...
 ......But he disappeared right before you were born.
 He said he\'d build a warm family with me...he tricked me...and disappeared from my sight for all eternity...!!"
"Only you were left.
 No love or memories or anything remained!!
 Where is that man now?
 He probably just turned my days with him into a warm memory, and found a new love.
 And maybe that time he managed to build up a happy family...!!
 And me?!
 I have you!!
 I can\'t even look for love!!"
"Men can go between women as they like and brag about it!
 But the woman, me!!
 {i:I} have {i:you}!!
 I have you as a stone weight,
 and because of you I can\'t search for romance, I can\'t have love, I have no choice but to live alone!!"
"No, I\'m not even allowed that, I\'m not even allowed a night to myself to drown my sorrows!!
 Who are you?!
 Who?!
 You ruined my life, and won\'t even let me have a new one... Just what are you to my life?!"
"Die, disappear, I\'ve hated you since the time you were born!!
 I\'ve hated you since the time you were in my womb!!!
 But I tried to stay positive and accept you, I\'ve been doing my best to play the part of a good mother."
"Yes, I did my best!!
 As other women of my generation enjoyed being single, sometimes playing with passion, or even being joined with someone in love, I watched from the sidelines,
 stuck wearing the two hats of a mother and a woman...!!
 Who ever showed appreciation for my efforts?!
 No one admired me, no one praised me!!"
"I got what I deserved?
 You don\'t want a woman with a kid?
 Sour grapes?
 You\'re looking for a girl who\'s sweet and pure?!
 Well who the hell wants YOU, you goddamn inexperienced punks!!!"
"I was so desperate, I probably looked like I\'d fall for you easy... Yes, damn right I was desperate!!
 I\'m still at the age where I want to know love,
 and I was being swamped with work and caring for my child, and when I realized that I would probably grow old and live out my life like this,
 you can\'t even imagine how desperate I was!!"
"Of course I hate your real father too!
 But he and I both share the blame for bringing about that breakup.
 I myself might have been enough of a pain in the ass to make him run away!"
"But the breakups after that, all of them were your fault!
 When did I ever scold you for that?!
 Never, did I?!?!?!"
"The day after one man left me, when I wanted to drink myself dead drunk, was Parent\'s Day at your school!!
 I was there, my tear‐stained eyes disguised with heavy makeup,
 and the way I felt when you said something off the mark and the whole class laughed at you...
is something I expect you and everyone else on this planet couldn\'t possibly understand!!"
"I hate you, loathe you...!!!
 And up to this very moment, I\'ve never really loved you even once!!!
 Whhaaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaahhhhh!!!"
Maria\'s face was frozen......
If words really were blades,
 ......Maria\'s whole body would probably have been stained red with fresh blood by now.
Even after gaining the power of a witch and resolving herself to take revenge for Sakutaro,
 ......she couldn\'t stand these curses coming out of her mother\'s mouth...
"............Ma.........ma..................
.....uuuwau......
uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!!!"
"Ugly.
 Aaaaaaaahh, how ugly is a woman drowning in lust...!!
 This is this woman\'s true nature!!
 Even I, as a thousand‐year‐old witch who has explored the depths of evil, find this most difficult to watch!!"
"Aaah, {f:5:Maria}, now is the time for you and her to part ways!!
 Smash the ugly lump of meat that calls herself your mother...!!
 There is no meaning in your pure soul being bound any longer by the chains of parent and child!
 With your own hand,
 release your own soul now!!
 You have now gained the teeth and claws to protect yourself!!"
"Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!!
 Now I\'ll make you learn all the days of pain I went through...!
 I\'ll get revenge for my days of suffering...!!!"
"Ahhahahahahahahahaha!!
 Aren\'t you the one who\'s been making me suffer?!
 I\'m the one who wants revenge...!!"
"I should have done that before you were born!!
 I should never have given birth to you!!
 Get out of my liiiiiife, uaaaoo{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaahhhh!!"
"......ggyah—"
As Rosa howled, her upper body was crushed in a way that can only be described by the word "splat",
 and in an instant, was turned into something similar to a wrung, blood‐stained towel.
"Get crushed.
 Can\'t forgive, ......can\'t forgive...!!"
"Kuhhahhahha......!!
 You filth.
 That form suits you...!"
......Even though everything from Rosa\'s waist downwards was upright as normal,
 the upper half of her body alone was crushed; the extreme difference was altogether bizarre.
Then she fell over—but her body was regenerated the instant she fell.
"*cough*cough*!
 *cough*!!
 .........{i:You} die.
 ......Kuhhi{0}hi{0}hhi{0}hhi{0}hhi......!"
"Come, Maria.
 Is this all there is to your anger and sadness?
 Now is the time for revenge!
 Time for the settlement of anger and sadness...!!"
"Take it out on her, spit it out at her!!
 Push out all of the wedges that have been driven into your chest, and fling them back!!!"
"Uugaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhoooooooooooooohhhh!!!"
Maria\'s howl was colored by the ugly sound of flesh and bone being simultaneously crushed...
As Rosa, who had foully insulted Maria, lay spread‐eagled,
 a neat, perfectly circular area of her chest was squashed into a pulp, as though it had been trampled by an invisible elephant.
Her heart and her lungs and her ribs were trampled so mercilessly that they were completely indistinguishable.
......That might have symbolized the pain in Maria\'s heart up until today.
"So, Maria.
 Are you now satisfied?
 Can you forgive your mother\'s sin?
 Or not?
 Innocent?
 Or guilty?!"
"Can\'t forgive!!
 Still can\'t forgive, can\'t forgive at all!!
 Mama is guilty, guilty guilty guilty, can\'t forgive!!!"
"Naturally, how could your days of anguish be equalled by this level of punishment?!!
 You will learn, Rosa!
 Come, try to remember, what form did you have?!
 Revive in order to be killed!!
 Be killed in order to purify your sins, over and over!!!"
Beato waved her wand, her body was regenerated again,
 and Rosa sat up, coughing violently in pain...
And once again, she spat out curses rejecting Maria.
".........You aren\'t Mama.
 You\'re a witch, a witch tormenting me and Mama!!
 I won\'t forgive you just because you look like Mama!
 Won\'t forgive you!!"
"......You\'re the witch......
 Always reading creepy books and playing witches...!!
 You\'re the one who should disappear!!!!!!!
 Because of you, even I get treated like a weirdo!
 Because of you, because of yoo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}ou{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}uuu!!!"
"I should never have given birth to you!!
 I wish you had never been born...!!
 I hated you since before you were boo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}ooorn!!!"
"UWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH...!!!"
.........Maria screamed.
Was she unable to bear her anger and sadness?
{n}Or else, was she taken over by an indescribable emotion......?
It was surely...a cry of hopelessness.
And yet, this was the reality that had to be accepted.
Even Maria knew.
{n}She had known that she was thought of as a nuisance.
But even though she knew it, she did not believe it.
She believed that she was loved by her mother, and all the various events that should have made her doubt this,
 she did her utmost to interpret in a positive light, trusting and clinging to her mother\'s love.
But.........she had no one except her mama.
Despite all this, she really did love her mama,
 ......and wanted to return to the days when she could still believe that her mama loved her too......
So she howled...
She brought everything to nothing.
 She would not accept it.
 She denied it.
She denied the black witch making her mother say such things,
 and.........the part of herself that couldn\'t forgive that mother......!!!
But she couldn\'t deny it!
This was reality, fact, truth, the answer.
Unmistakable, absolute......reality!!
Maria turned Rosa into a lump of meat over and over.
In the dark world that reflected her heart, over and over it echoed:
 that ugly sound which would make one want to cover their ears, of flesh and bone being torn apart......
Each time, {f:5:Beatrice} revived Rosa.
She dragged her back into the world of endless torture, from which even death was no escape.
This was the true deepest hell that the Endless Witch {f:5:Beatrice} could create.
However, this world was not made endless by {f:5:Beatrice}\'s will.
......Because every time Rosa turned into a lump of meat, {f:5:Beatrice} asked the same question of Maria.
"*cackle*cackle*!
 Are you satisfied, {f:5:Maria}?!
 Can your anger forgive your mother?!"
"No way, no way!!
 Won\'t forgive, won\'t forgive!!"
"I\'ll teach you all of my pain...!!
 Teach you much, much more...!!
 Still not enough, not close to enough...!!
 Since I was born, since before I was born...!!
 I can\'t erase the anger and sadness of being despised for all that time......!!"
".........Fuhi...hahaha......
 ......I hate you, haaate you...
 Fuhihiha...haha......"
"UGaAAAAAAAAAaaAAAAAAAaaaAAHHHH!!!"
Again and again she revived her.
 Again and again she returned her to a lump of meat.
In all kinds of ways, she crushed her, smashed her, beat her, and tore her to bits.
{n}Flying blood spatter and flesh had by now turned the once pitch‐black world into a mix of red and black.
Maria\'s anger was still not settling down.
It was as though she was disgorging all of the rage she had suppressed from the time of her birth until today.
If all that was poison to her heart...
Then would the repeated murder of her mother purify her soul...?
Could these pointless atrocities save her soul even just a little bit......?
This endless torture...might have started serving as a slight diversion from her sad, unrewarded life.
After all, ......it seemed that she had finally been able to regain her smile.
"Learn it!!
 You, the source of my unhappiness!!
 Learn it!!
 Learn that my pain is greater than this!!
 Kihhihiha{0}hha{0}ha{0}haha!!"
"What\'s wrong?
 Aren\'t you going to laugh anymore?!
 Try and laaaaa{-}a{-}aauuugh!!"
"......Fuhi...fuhihihi......
 Gyablkk...!!!"
Half of her skull collapsed.
{n}Eyeballs flew out, and black cranial fluid gushed.
{n}Fragments of teeth scattered.
"Come on, revive...!!
 Try and laugh...!!
 Come on, come oooooon!!!"
"............Hih......hih.
 ......Ghaggh—!!"
Her whole chest along with her ribs turned inside out, spewing her filthy innards everywhere around her.
All of them writhed, looking like some kind of foul creature.
"Come on come on come on!!
 Revive!!
 Can you still laugh?
 Can you still laugh?!
 Kihhihihihihi?!"
".............................."
Rosa couldn\'t let out a laugh anymore.
{n}......But her face was laughing.
It was covered with a twisted laugh, which was filled with a malice that rejected her unwanted daughter.
I erased that laughing voice.
{n}Next, I\'ll erase that laughing face.
I\'ll erase it, I\'ll crush it, I\'ll tear it to bits...!!
"Laugh, try and laugh, Mama...!!
 Kihhihihihihha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha?!
 What\'s wrong, Mama, wake up, read me a picture book, let\'s go take a walk...!!
 Tell me you love me, make a promise for next Sunday, let\'s go shopping, let\'s go to the movies...!!
 And then of course break that promise anyway!!"
"Kihhihihihihihihihihihihihihi, isn\'t it fun, Mama, isn\'t it fun? I\'m playing with you now!!
 Kihhihha{0}hha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!!"
"That\'s right, you are now playing with your mother, having fun with her...!!
 Tell me your emotions now!
 I believe they should not be of anger or sadness or pain...!"
"Yeah, you\'re right, I can feel it, {f:5:Beatrice}...!!
 I\'m having so much fun now... I\'m playing with Mama, so it\'s tons of fun!!"
"And even though I\'m killing Mama over and over again, I can bring her back to life with just a single bit of magic!!
 I took care of my toys because I couldn\'t fix them if they broke...!!
 But if the toys could be fixed, I\'d want to break them over and over again!!
 Kihhihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi!!
 Hihihihihihi, hihi........."
"......But, ............Sakutaro won\'t be fixed.
 ...He can\'t be fixed.........
 .........Because Mama, who made him,
 ......Mama, who gave birth to him,
 ......won\'t accept him."
".............................."
"I\'m not accepted by Mama either, am I...
 .........So the broken Maria can\'t be fixed anymore either.
 .............................."
".........Kihihihi.
 Kihhi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi!!
 Kyah{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hyah{0}hyah{0}hyah{0}hyah!!
 Aaaaaaaaaaahhh, it\'s fun, it\'s so much fun, Mama...!!
 I\'m having so much fun that somehow, I\'m starting to feel like I could forgive you...!"
"Hey, Beato, this is a reeeeally strange emotion...!
 Why?
 Why have I started to feel like I could forgive Mama?!"
"That is the enlightened state that is only reached by witches who have gained the power to control life and death at will.
 ......You can kill her at any time.
 You can bring her back to life if needed.
 If she becomes a pain, then you can simply kill her once more...!"
"Once you\'ve learned that you can do this at any time simply by snapping your fingers, the nonsense of the human realm, all of it becomes unworthy of lending an ear to, of less importance than the chirping of insects...!"
"You began to feel like forgiving your mother not because your eyes were opened to your mother\'s love.
 It was because now, as of that moment!
 You stand at the entrance to the world of true witches...!!
 Welcome, Maria, to the profound and sweet world of witches!!"
"I\'ve done it...!!
 I\'m not Maria any more...!!
 Still an apprentice, maybe, but I\'ve surpassed the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} world...!"
"Now, I\'m the Apprentice Witch of Origins, {f:5:Maria}......!!!
 There\'s nothing to make me feel bitter, nothing to make me sad!"
"Mama, I\'ll forgive you.
 I\'m sure I can forgive you!
 I think I\'ll be able to forgive you after doing just a little bit more!!"
"After all, I am a witch!!
 Ki......hihhi{0}hi{0}hhi{0}hhi{0}hhi{0}hhi{0}hhihhi!"
"Kihhihihih!!!"
Maria probably would forgive her mother eventually.
{n}......After brutally murdering her countless times.
 Generously.
".........Whoa, that last thunderbolt was huge.
 Must be pretty close, don\'t you think?"
"It sounds like it.
 No matter how old you get, thunder still makes you jump."
Battler was looking at the dark night through a crack in the curtains.
{n}Every once in a while, a pale white lightning bolt would light up the sky, and he seemed to be enjoying it.
"......................................."
"......Oh?
 Please, Battler, you\'re making so much noise that Maria\'s woken up now.
 Sorry, Maria.
 Sorry Battler\'s so noisy...!"
"What the heck, it\'s my fault?
 Sorry, Maria.
 You can go back to sleep.
 Night‐night."
Maria was looking a bit hazy, with drowsy eyes.
{n}......She was probably still half‐asleep, and couldn\'t think straight.
".....................Uu.
 ......Had enough.
 Won\'t sleep."
"It\'s OK, sleep.
 You\'re still half‐asleep right now.
 Ihihi."
"......Not half‐asleep!
 ............Uu!!"
"Oh come on, you\'re blatantly half‐asleep.
 Lie back down, lie back down."
"Not half‐asleep! Not half‐asleep!!
 Uu‐uu!!
 Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!"
"Quit it, Battler, you dumbass...!
 Ugh, god, what are you thinking, getting a kid who\'s just woken up into a bad mood...!"
"Not half‐asleep!
 Not half‐asleep!
 Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu‐uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!!"
"I understand, Maria‐chan...
 You aren\'t half‐asleep.
 So calm down......"
"Not half‐asleep not half‐asleep!!
 Uu!!
 Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!"
Maybe it was because of her dubious mental state after waking up, but Maria suddenly threw a tantrum.
In Battler\'s mind, he had only been teasing her a little bit,
 so he was taken aback by this extreme overreaction.
George hugged her and held her head, trying to calm her down, but Maria\'s tantrum wasn\'t quelled easily.
Battler and Jessica were trying to push the blame on each other, saying "It\'s your fault", "It\'s your fault too".
"Hey, be quiet, you two...!
 Jessica‐chan, there was still some hot water in the pot, right?
 Could you make some tea for her?
 .........Did you calm down?
 Maria‐chan."
"...............Uuuu."
It looked like her tantrum was dying down bit by bit,
 but she was still glaring at Battler, who had made fun of her, with sharp eyes.
"Battler‐kun was just messing around.
 He doesn\'t really think you\'re half‐asleep.
 So calm down.
 Alright?
 ........................?"
"...................................."
George noticed.
 ......Maria was staring at Battler with incredible eyes.
And, ......despite having just displayed all that emotion, ......she laughed in a small voice.
{a:c:
Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihi.}
Instead of a laugh, it seemed more like she was muttering while savoring,
 or else counting, each "hi".
As though each time she said "hi", she was making something brutal happen over and over.
George felt something creepy for a split second,
 ......but he wasn\'t able to notice the madness that, for a brief moment, peeked out of the depths of the girl\'s eyes.
After remaining spaced out for a short period of time,
 Maria stopped her bizarre quiet laugh, and pushed George\'s arm aside, as though telling him to let go.
".........Uu.
 Forgive him."
"R‐really?
 You\'re such a good girl, Maria‐chan.
 ......Battler‐kun, Maria‐chan forgave you.
 Make up with her."
"Uhh, sorry for teasing you.
 Forgive me..."
"Here you go, Maria...
 We made you café au lait to show we\'ve made up with you.
 It\'s got lots of sugar in, so it\'s sweet."
"Don\'t want it.
 But forgive you.
 ............Because I\'m a witch.
 ...Kihihihi."
One more time, Maria laughed in a creepy, quiet voice.
But it was only for a very short time, so Battler and Jessica didn\'t think much of it.
......They decided to think that, probably,
 it had only looked that way for an instant, when a flash of lightning had lit up her cheek with a pale, white light.
Then, they heard the sound of loud and hasty footsteps rushing towards them from the hall.
It was already about half past ten at night.
{n}A time that could safely be called "late at night".
Hearing footsteps like that at this time was not very peaceful...
Then, along with a clearly disquieting and wild series of knocks, they heard Gohda\'s and Kumasawa\'s voices.
......That clearly told them that this was an abnormal situation.
"Children...!!
 Are you there? Are you there?!
 It\'s Gohda!"
"It\'s Kumasawa, is everyone alright?!
 Aaaaaaah, what shall I do, what shall I do...!"
When George opened the door, the two of them tumbled in, sopping wet.
It looked like they had dashed here from the mansion without an umbrella.
"Wh‐what\'s gotten into you two......
 What\'s happened......?!"
"I‐it was, it was...!!
 Th‐th‐the Master—{nobr:Krauss‐sama}—{nobr:everyone, he}—
awawa{0}wa{0}wa{0}wa{0}wa{0}wawawa..."......It was......a pitch‐black room.
There were no windows, and by the light from the weak bulb, one could only just barely make out the state of things around them.
It appeared to be an old, forgotten, dusty underground storehouse, with some kind of furniture haphazardly thrown into it......
However, even with just a little light, one could at least tell that it probably wasn\'t a storehouse.
......Because that room was sealed off with iron bars.
"......Where...is this.........?"
"Not a clue...
 ......Is this place underneath the mansion......?
 Was there this kind of room......directly underneath the dining hall......?"
They had been dropped into what had appeared to be a pit, and {i:fallen} into this room.
Therefore, it would be appropriate to think that this room was directly below the dining hall.
......However, not even Krauss could bring himself to believe that there were pitfalls rigged in the beloved dining hall, where he had enjoyed his meals for years,
 ...and that directly below it was this dungeon‐like room.
But the ceiling, when they looked up, was made of rugged stone, ......and they could not understand from where in that ceiling they could have fallen.
No, all five people who had been dropped here thought the same thing.
Although they had felt a sensation of being dropped into a pit,
 ......there was no way there could be pitfalls in the dining hall, nor could this dungeon‐like place be directly underneath it.
......But, in point of fact, they {i:had} fallen into this place, and were locked in.
{n}......And so, ...they were confused.
"......It is lucky that no one was hurt after falling from such a height..."
".........Shannon, Kanon.
 Did either of you two know about this room...?"
"......No.
 We also have no knowledge of any room like this."
"..................Really...?"
"R‐really......
 We really......don\'t know any room like this......"
It seemed that Kyrie thought that there was a good chance that, despite their age,
 they might know of the mansion\'s secret tricks as servants permitted the One‐winged Eagle.
There was a long silence, as if evaluating their answer...
"......No, it\'s probably true that they don\'t know.
 Shannon is a very tidy person, after all."
"If she had known about this room, it would probably have been scrubbed until it was sparkling.
 The filth of this room is proof that you two don\'t know of it.
 ......More importantly than that, I think we should worry about what to do now, don\'t you?"
"E‐exactly......
 We need to call the police...o‐or rather, call for medical assistance as soon as possible......"
Nanjo\'s words rang hollow.
...Obviously.
Six people had been killed in the dining hall.
{n}They had all witnessed the exact moments when the six had been killed.
And what\'s more, it had been done by half‐destroying their heads—
anyone could tell with just a single glance that they had been dealt a fatal injury.
Everyone understood that calling for an ambulance now would be completely meaningless......
"Thank you, Doctor Nanjo.
 ......We already understand that our partners are no longer alive.
 .........Thanks for trying to console us by mentioning medical assistance."
".........Natsuhi......
 .............................."
Once again, an oppressive silence took control of them.
But Krauss shook his head harshly over and over, and decided just for now to forget the pain of losing his wife,
 and dedicate himself to figuring out where they were.
"Everyone, listen to me.
 ...............Dad is...
.........beyond hope now.
 ...The time for words, and seeking comprehension or an explanation...
is long past."
Nobody answered.
......Without any kind of discussion or mercy, six people had been killed in an instant.
And Kinzo had so boldly proclaimed for them to become sacrifices in a thirteen‐person murder ritual.
......Since they had been locked up in this place,
 they too would probably become the ritual\'s next sacrifices before long.
Around this time, their eyes were becoming used to the darkness,
 and, bit by bit, they were starting to be able to make out the dungeon\'s interior.
......What they thought was furniture haphazardly left in the dungeon turned out not to be furniture at all.
They were......small cages that could be used to imprison a single person, restraining tables, ......or were those torture racks?
.....At any rate, it was obviously more ghastly than a mere jail cell.
Since those objects were rusted and covered in thick layers of dust, there was no doubt that they had been long‐forgotten.
......Maybe you could even have called those things Kinzo\'s sealed and forgotten madness.
However, it was this room in which they had now been locked away.
.........Those objects weren\'t exactly comforting to people who were locked up,
 hoping to be released without harm...
"......Anyway, let\'s get out of here.
 We\'ve lost loved ones and friends and would like to spend some time shedding tears,
 but more than that, ......I\'m worried about the children."
".........I, ...I wonder if the children are safe......"
"All we can do is pray...
 ......Come to think of it, Kumasawa‐san and Gohda‐san aren\'t here."
"Perhaps they were able to...get away safely..."
"You never know.
 It\'d be a relief if they were able to meet up with the children..."
"Gohda‐san can be relied upon in times of crisis, and Kumasawa‐san is knowledgeable and calm...
 I\'m sure they would be helpful to the children..."
"......Hahaha.
 I hope so."
Shannon and Krauss smiled bitterly a little.
 But they quickly realized how improper that was, and stopped, clearing their throats.
".........We can\'t be too optimistic, Nee‐san.
 There\'s a chance that they have already been attacked, after we were."
"I agree.
 What Father carried out in the dining hall was...
...the six murders of the first twilight from the witch\'s epitaph, right?
 Then, the second twilight is to "tear apart the two who are close"."
"......We can\'t deny the possibility that Gohda‐san and Kumasawa‐san may have already been killed, having run away to hide together in close company.
 .........We can\'t cling to the optimistic idea that they definitely got to the guesthouse and are protecting the children."
Kyrie coldly analyzed the worst‐case scenario.
Even for her, it was heartbreaking to have lost her beloved husband.
{n}......But right now, the most important thing was protecting that husband\'s son,
 along with the other children, from becoming sacrifices to the insane family head.
She overcame her sadness with the parental urge to protect the children.
......It seemed that both Kyrie and Krauss were strong enough to forget their grief, if only for the time being...
They could let their tears flow later.
......For now, in order to protect the children, they had to act.
"Anyway, let\'s get out of here...
 It seems to be a rather old cell.
 Couldn\'t we break the bars somehow?
 Let\'s try searching the entire room for some way to escape."
"There\'s all kinds of junk around here. I wonder if there are any tools lying around that we could use.
 There might be something that we could use as a weapon, or something that we could use to break the bars."
Kyrie pulled a lighter from her pocket.
She herself didn\'t smoke, but she kept one tucked away in her pocket to light Rudolf\'s cigarettes.
......It was an extremely valuable source of light for searching through this dim dungeon.
"Shannon, help Kyrie‐san search the room.
 Kanon, you\'ll help me check out the bars.
 This is a very old cell.
 The bars could be loose."
"Wh‐what should I help with......?"
"Please just keep up your strength.
 ......Father will probably come here before long.
 You\'re the only one whose words will reach him.
 In a way, you might be holding our lives in your hands."
"......My words...will no longer reach him, I think.
 I\'m sorry, but I don\'t believe I will be of any use......"
"Then lend us your expertise as a doctor.
 .........I wonder if there is a drug that makes people instantly faint?"
"......A drug that makes people instantly faint......?
 What are you talking about......?"
"We believe we fell through a pit, and landed in this dungeon.
 ......In that panic‐stricken place, that\'s what we believed happened."
"......But looking at how large this room is, I came to a realization.
 This dungeon cannot be underneath the dining hall."
"How can you tell that it can\'t...?"
"............You\'re an idiot, Nee‐san.
 This dungeon is too narrow compared to the dining hall."
"Exactly.
 The first person to fall was Krauss nii‐san.
 The second was myself.
 When you fell into this room, did you move from that spot, Krauss nii‐san?"
"......It\'s embarrassing to say, but I lay there groaning in pain from the landing.
 Immediately after that, you came crashing down next to me."
"The distance between us as we stood in the dining hall, compared to where we landed, is clearly strange."
"C‐...certainly, when you put it that way.
 ......I was the next to fall, so I remember fairly well where you two were standing.
 ......The distance between you two in the dining hall might have been greater than this entire room."
"We fell into a pit, and directly dropped down here.
 ......It\'s not like we fell into multiple intersecting pipes, and were all collected together before falling down here."
"The fall was instant, wasn\'t it?
 I don\'t remember rolling around in some sort of elaborate water pipe system."
"............Indeed, we can\'t explain that with a pitfall.
 ...How strange."
"What does that have to do with......the drug that makes people instantly faint that Kyrie‐sama was talking about...?"
"...........................
 ......Kyrie‐sama is probably thinking that there were no pitfalls in the dining hall, I would guess."
"But we did actually fall."
"To put it accurately, we had the feeling that we fell into a pit.
 ......It\'s only natural.
 That\'s the only way we could describe such an experience."
"I, I see......
 In other words, this is what you\'re getting at..."
"......We were not dropped into a pit,
 ......but shot, for example, with something like a blowdart, lost consciousness instantly, and the instant we fell to the floor,
 it could be that we just remember that as though we fell into a pit......"
"............I see.
 That\'s a much more persuasive explanation than there being numerous pitfall traps in the dining hall that we\'ve never noticed, even after decades eating there."
"......Nee‐san.
 Do you have a watch?"
"Huh?
 .........Y‐...yes.
 I have a pocket watch.
 .........Umm, it\'s about twenty to eleven."
".........Yes.
 My watch says the same.
 ...In short, it hasn\'t been more than ten minutes since that chaos in the dining hall."
"My watch likewise.
 ............That\'s much too short a time to knock us out and carry us somewhere.
 .........Judging only from the time, it\'s reasonable to think that we did fall through a hole leading directly underneath the dining hall."
"Watch hands are easily tampered with.
 ......While we were passed out, they may have wound everyone\'s watch back.
 We are incapable of proving that this possibility doesn\'t exist."
"...........................
 Whether a pitfall, or else a drug that induces fainting,
 ......it does not change the fact that we need to be on our guard..."
"......So, Doctor Nanjo?
 Is there a drug that can do that?"
"Well, ............
 ......It\'s the same as your logic, Kyrie‐san.
 ...I cannot prove that there is not a drug with that effect of which I do not know."
"......As they say, you can never be too careful.
 ...Sorry, it was a pointless question.
 Except, I think that with my hypothesis, I was able to suggest that this dungeon is not necessarily directly underneath the dining hall."
"I see...
 .......There\'s always the possibility that we were carried off to a dungeon in Father\'s hidden mansion,
 which is rumored to be hidden somewhere in the middle of the vast forest.
 ......If we can escape from here and get outside, then we\'ll know.
 We can save worrying about that until after we get out."
"Exactly.
 I\'m truly sorry.
 I\'ve only been asking and inquiring into useless things."
"No, it\'s quite reassuring.
 Please continue to tell us if you notice anything else.
 It might become a hint to escaping from here."
".........I always heard from Rudolf.
 He was always surprised by your ideas, and they would sometimes serve as valuable hints.
 ......The fact that you\'re here is a blessing within a tragedy."
"......Thank you.
 Rudolf‐san told me something about you, as well.
 He said that you usually act big, but when things get serious, you overflow with a sense of responsibility, and are a very dependable older brother."
"Hahaha... That\'s too kind.
 .........Dammit, these iron bars won\'t even budge.
 How are things on your end, Kanon?"
".........No luck here either, I\'m afraid."
Krauss and Kanon tried wiggling each of the bars in various ways.
......There were a few bars that could be twisted,
 and a few felt like they had enough room to rattle around a little bit,
 but even so, they could not be broken with human strength alone.
......However, there was still hope if they could use some kind of lever‐like tool.
It was still far too early to give up yet.
The children\'s lives were hanging in the balance.
 ......Even if there was no hope, they couldn\'t stop their struggle.
And it was better even for them to act this way.
......If they were to stop...there was no doubt that they would once again be overcome by the grief of losing their loved ones, and crouch down, clutching their knees......
"How are you doing, Kyrie‐san?
 Found anything?"
"......I\'ve found some stones small enough to hide in a clenched fist.
 Even this might work as a weapon.
 Though, I\'m sure it\'d be impossible to whittle down those iron bars.
 How about you, Shannon‐chan...?"
"No, nothing."
".........Ah, this is...
............a phone."
"There\'s no way it\'s connected.
 ......But, we might be able to use the cord for tying something up or as some form of weapon.
 If we break it and take it apart, we could take out the metal parts.
 Krauss nii‐san, there is a keyhole for opening the cell, right?"
"Yeah.
 It\'s a pretty large hole, quite old fashioned.
 ......If we twist some wire into it, we just might be able to pick it."
"We might be able to use the metal parts of the phone as a substitute for something.
 ......This phone will become our weapon."
"It\'s the same as investing.
 Information is our weapon."
Krauss and Kyrie laughed together at this way of putting the phone to use, which didn\'t remotely look at it as a means of communication.
"............What are you doing, Nee‐san."
"Ah, ......um, ...I just wondered if maybe...the phone was w‐working......"
"............({i:whisper}) You dummy, Nee‐san."
"Huh...?
 .........What?"
Suddenly, Shannon let out a small surprised cry.
"K‐Kyrie‐sama...!
 .....This phone, it\'s connected."
"What did you say...?"
It was like when people move out of an office, taking everything with them, leaving only the telephone behind—
that\'s the feeling the phone gave off, having been left in the corner of the cell.
The cord was wound into a coil, one end of it being swallowed by the wall,
 and at a glance, it looked as if it could plausibly be connected.
......But, to think that it actually was...
Kyrie took the receiver from Shannon and pressed it to her ear.
{n}The electric hum was certainly the one with which she was familiar.
{n}......This phone was indeed live.
"Wh‐...what good luck...!
 Let\'s contact the police...!"
"Hold on...!
 This is too good to be true.
 Should we not suspect that it\'s bugged...?!"
"If they were planning a trick like that, normally they would cut the telephone line.
 ......There\'s a good possibility that they actually overlooked this."
"If they notice, the line might actually be cut for real.
 There\'s nothing that we could tell the police that would be problematic for us if they overheard."
......That did make sense.
 The point of a wiretap was to overhear some important piece of information,
 but the way things were now, they could not think of a single thing that would come up in a conversation to the outside world that could be troublesome to have heard.
Kyrie instantly concluded that it was more likely to be a mistake on Kinzo\'s part than a trap......
"Y‐...you do have a point......
 I believe that you start with 0 to make calls to the outside......"
"Kanon‐kun, I\'m going to make a phone call, so will you watch how things are out there for me?
 If you sense somebody coming, let me know."
"Y‐yes......!"
Kanon raced off towards the iron bars, silenced his breathing, and strained his ears......
{n}As everyone present watched her, Kyrie dialed {ruby:the police:110}...
However, she pushed the hook down repeatedly and redialed.
......It didn\'t seem to be working very well.
".........The outside line begins with 0?
 110 would be 0110 then, right?
 It doesn\'t seem to want to go through..."
"Hand it over here, I\'ll try to call......
 ..........................."
Krauss took the receiver in Kyrie\'s place, and tested various things......
But in the end, they were unable to notify the police......
The phone itself was definitely live, but the circuit was apparently cut somewhere.
......Did this mean that "they" were not so naive?
"......So it\'s useless after all......"
"So our enemy is no pushover...
 ........................"
Kyrie let out a deep sigh, leaned against the wall, and hung her head for a while.
As tough a girl as she was, for a brief moment, she might actually have had the naive hope that the phone could actually work.
......She sneered at herself mockingly for holding onto that naive hope for even one moment.
And then, ......she thought back upon just what was happening here.
......Honestly...despite having been shown such a thing right before her eyes, ......or rather, exactly because of that...
......she still could not think of that gruesome mass murder as something real...
{n}It was less that she couldn\'t believe it, and more that she didn\'t want to.
Ushiromiya Kinzo had killed six members of his family.
He had summoned strange, witch‐like, demon‐like people,
 ......right out of thin air, ......
.........and with something like magic,
 ......he had begun to kill people one after another..........
...........................
Too much to handle.
 ......Even though she definitely saw it, there was no way she could accept that spectacle......
".........There\'s no way that\'s what happened.
 .........Those were obviously Grandfather\'s friends, or something.
 ......They were just hiding somewhere in the dining hall beforehand, and used some trick to appear suddenly and surprise us.
 .........There\'s no other way to explain something as screwed up as that."
But when those six had had their heads blown apart, a golden arrow had flown around and around the room.
......That had truly looked like...
...magic.
Was that another thing we just saw wrong?
{n}There\'s no way it was magic.
 There must be some kind of trick to it.
......Since it was capable of smashing heads, there\'s no doubt it was some explosive.
For example, a styrene toy plane like they sell at candy stores, painted gold,
 and with a powerful explosive loaded onto the end of it.
.......That said, at a glance, it had seemed to be flying at random;
 Kyrie couldn\'t imagine that such a thing could be fired six times, and each time perfectly hit the victim square in the head, one after the other.
Surely its flight wasn\'t computer‐controlled to seek out and deliver precise hits on its targets,
 which would make it a high‐tech styrene plane on the same level as a guided missile...?
".........Would he invest such a large amount of money into developing some stupid trick like that?
 ......For that insane entertainment......?
 Does this come back to the old "I wouldn\'t put it past Father"......?"
A number of mysterious people had appeared suddenly out of thin air,
 ......six people had had their heads demolished by a mysterious golden flying object,
 ......and the five of us were locked away in a mysterious dungeon by a mysterious set of pitfalls, or else put to sleep by some fainting poison dart......
The family conference started a bit after 10 p.m.
{n}......It\'s only been about thirty minutes since then.
Probably,
 those events, which took place in such a short amount of time,
 ......none of us are able to understand, nor come to grips with, even though we witnessed them ourselves.
Even if we did get ahold of the police,
 it would probably be impossible for any of us to accurately explain what we saw......
I may only just have witnessed it,
 ......but my brain\'s fried, and I have no confidence even in what I myself saw...
Kyrie had to try her hardest to rouse herself from her overwhelming confusion, just to hold onto her sanity......
"Dammit......what\'s going on here,
 ......damn, ...dammit...!"
Krauss started to become desperate, hitting the hook multiple times, and redialing over and over.
......He too was feigning composure, but was unable to hide his panic.
The more he redialed, the more the pretense of serenity peeled away...
None of this makes any sense......
Kyrie couldn\'t help but pray that the events that had just occurred were no more than a dream...
.........Suddenly, the look on Krauss\'s face changed.
"Uh, o......oh...!
 I got through, I got through...!
 It\'s ringing...!"
"R‐really, Krauss‐san...?!"
"Yes, I see it now, the old man was shortsighted...!
 It seems that he cut the external line in an effort to prevent us from contacting the police, but he missed out on severing the internal line...!"
"Internal line?
 Krauss‐san, where did you call...?!"
"The guesthouse.
 I\'m calling the room where Jessica and the rest are staying...!"
"......Ah?!
 Hello!
 Hello?!
 It\'s me...!
 Who is this...?!
 Gohda?!
 Is Jessica there, is she safe...?!!"
"K‐Krauss‐sama......!!
 I\'m so glad you\'re safe...!!
 Yes!
 Milady Jessica and the other children are here as well, safe and unharmed...!"
"Dad!!
 Is that you, Dad?!
 I\'m so glad you\'re okay......!!
 Is Mom okay?!
 Is she there?!"
".........M‐......"
Krauss choked on his words.
......Krauss had clearly seen Natsuhi\'s head crushed, had seen her killed right before his eyes......
Eventually, he was going to have to tell that to Jessica.
......However, Krauss began to fret over whether he should tell her this very moment, and lost his words.
......But even that was an answer under these circumstances......
"......I don\'t know about her......
 ......Let\'s pray she\'s safe.
 ...For now, I\'m just glad you\'re safe."
"...........................Yeah.
 ......I understand.
 .........I\'m sorry for......asking."
Jessica\'s voice was filled with tears...
 ......There was no doubt for Krauss anymore.
{n}Jessica and the others had been told everything, start to finish, by Gohda and Kumasawa when they had met up at the guesthouse...
After they learned that six whole people had been killed,
 Jessica and the others must have been in a frenzy about wanting to go to the dining hall.
.........Luckily he had been able to call before they stormed off towards the mansion.
{n}Krauss was relieved at his good timing during such tragedy...
"We have Kyrie‐san and Doctor Nanjo, as well as Shannon and Kanon here.
 We\'re locked in a place that\'s like a dungeon, but don\'t worry.
 We\'ll figure something out."
"Dungeon?
 Where?!
 We\'ll come save you...!!"
"Unfortunately, we haven\'t the slightest idea where this is either.
 We think it might be under the dining hall, but that might not be true.
 .........But anyway, Jessica.
 You must not leave there.
 You\'ve heard from Gohda what happened?"
"Yeah......
 ......Grandfather,
 .........he...
......{nobr:{m:-5:——}—ed} everyone......"
"Grandfather isn\'t in a sane state of mind right now.
 If you run into him, you\'ll be in danger.
 You might be killed...!
 You mustn\'t even think about trying to come and save us...!
 We\'ll take care of ourselves."
"Th‐then what should we do?!
 Grandfather, you piece of shit, how dare you do that to Mom and the rest......!
 I\'m gonna kill that worthless old bastard...!!"
"Jessica, if you talk like that, you\'ll sadden your mother.
 A lady doesn\'t use those kinds of words."
"Uuuuughhu......uuuuuhughhu......!!"
"Anyway, you all put your own safety first.
 Lock up the guesthouse.
 ......But you mustn\'t get complacent.
 The large window in the downstairs lounge might get broken."
"Stay in the room you\'re in, and use a bed to make a barricade.
 There\'s a toilet and fridge in there too, right?
 You should be able to stay holed up until tomorrow morning."
"......Alright, I\'ll say it again... Don\'t think of anything dangerous.
 And definitely don\'t think about trying to take revenge for Mom!
 Think only of hiding and making it through this, and don\'t provoke the enemy."
"Yeah......mm....!!
 Okay, ......Dad......!
 Uuuuhhughuuuu!!"
After that, Gohda took the phone,
 and was told again to watch over the children as a responsible adult.
......Gohda repeatedly replied "Yes, sir!" in an overstrained voice, his face covered in cold sweat.
From there, Kyrie received the phone and spoke with Battler, and when Shannon and Kanon got their turn, George and Jessica answered.
 And following that, Nanjo and Kumasawa picked up as well, so that all members of both sides had their turn on the phone,
 each encouraging the other and confirming that they were at least safe for now, even if their location was unknown,
 and coming to a complete understanding of the current situation for both sides.
They wanted to talk forever, but now was not the time to chat.
Krauss told them that they would be hanging up for now, and those in the guesthouse agreed.
"If anything else happens, we\'ll call.
 Wait by the phone so you can pick it up quickly.
 Again, be careful.
 You mustn\'t do anything rash...!"
"Y‐......yeah, I understand......
 Just knowing that you and......Kanon‐kun and the rest are safe, ......that\'s a win in my book......
 ...We\'ll do our best.
 Please stay safe...!"
"Yeah, of course.
 Well then, I\'m hanging up for now.
 Be on your guard."
With that, the phone call ended.
Gohda and the rest of the men quickly descended the stairs, closed the shutters, and secured the strong locks on the doors.
However, just as Krauss had worried, there was nothing that could be done about the beautiful wide window in the downstairs lounge.
If this were to be broken, it would be easy for them to get inside.
It wouldn\'t be hard for someone like Kinzo, who hadn\'t hesitated at committing murder, to invade the first floor.
"......It\'s likely that Grandfather and his followers will be armed.
 Locking ourselves in this room is our best bet, and moreover our only method of staying locked down.
 ......It\'s painful that we have no choice but to stuff ourselves in a locked room, but if our enemies are carrying guns, then that\'s the only method we have left to us."
"Th‐the Master is said to have a collection of working guns.
 .........That\'s right, guns, that was a gun...
 If so, ......it\'s a horribly powerful gun...!
 W‐we can\'t contend with that at all...!"
"............Smashing someone\'s head, that takes a hell of a lot of force, right?
 It might be a magnum bullet, or something along those lines.
 That might go through a flimsy door like it\'s nothing."
"If so, then that\'s even more of a reason to barricade ourselves in the room...
 Let\'s put up a bed and block the window too.
 ......If we do that much, then it doesn\'t matter how many guns they\'ve got, they shouldn\'t be able to break in."
"Shit, ......is this passive, one‐sided defense all we can do?
 ...Goddamn him, knocking off my dad, and even capturing Kyrie‐san...
 ......You\'re gonna pay for this, you old goat...!"
"I‐i‐i‐impossible, there\'s no way we can go against them...!!
 Besides, it\'s not just the Master, he has several underlings too!
 Th‐there might even be more of them...!
 .........Just what......are they......?"
Battler was filled to the brim with the urge to get revenge for Rudolf,
 and to rush out of here to save Kyrie.
......But just by looking at how terrified Gohda was, there was no doubt in him that this would be reckless...
"......It\'s gotta be hard on you too, ......right, Aniki?
 And yet we\'ve gotta stay holed up here, ......goddammit......"
"Of course, I\'m torn up about it too.
 ......There\'s no way I could remain calm with both of my parents murdered."
"But specifically because of that, I {i:have} to remain calm!
 Do you think that our murdered parents would want us to die in vain?
 There\'s no way they would!
 They\'d want for at least the children to escape."
"That\'s why I\'m going to survive.
 And I will report this to the police, and uncover everything.
 The courts will avenge my parents.
 {i:That} will be my revenge.
 ......There\'s no way our parents would want us to die taking revenge for them.
 Right...?"
"...........................
 ......You\'re right...
 You\'re damn right...
 ......That old bastard, fuck your stupid ritual...!
 If you\'re saying we\'re gonna be sacrifices for that, then we\'ll run away just to spite you, and fuck up the whole goddamn thing......"
"That\'s the way.
 ......Besides, you still have Kyrie‐san, Battler‐kun.
 And I still have Shannon.
 Let\'s just act cautiously and wait for our chance.
 Carelessness on our part might even work against the others who are captured."
"......Hostages, ......huh.
 .........But Grandfather captured them so he could use them as sacrifices, right?!
 If we don\'t go and save them, then they\'re just waiting to be killed, aren\'t they?!"
"We don\'t even know where the dungeon they\'re being held in is...!
 Neither did Shannon or Kanon‐kun, or of course Gohda‐san or Kumasawa‐san."
"The probability that they\'re in a secret location that only Grandfather knows of is incredibly high.
 ...Under these circumstances, aimlessly wandering about is suicide!"
"......I, ......I know that...
 .........But still......goddammit......are you saying the only thing we can do is stay confined here until something happens......?"
"Ba‐......Battler‐sama, I understand your feelings, but...
......let\'s put safety first...
 ......From what Krauss‐sama said, they seem to be in a fairly old cell,
 and they may be able to break the bars somehow.
 ......The wise choice of action now is to believe in them and wait."
"Grandfather has a number of subordinates, and they\'re all armed, correct...?"
"Y‐......yes, that is correct.
 .........And they\'re probably...
yes, all armed......"
Gohda had been able to say that Kinzo had others on his side,
 ......but he had not been able to mention that they were mostly all young women, like witches, ......and committed their murders using strange magic.
If he had said that, it would only have caused the others to doubt his sanity.
...No, in fact, he himself still couldn\'t understand what he had seen, and was doubting his own sanity.
......But, regardless of sex or appearance, ......regardless of whether it was done with magic or a gun.
The fact that those girls had followed Kinzo\'s orders,
 and killed six people in an instant...was an unshakable truth......
If those people came to attack the guesthouse as well, ......what would happen?
Just closing the doors and windows like this was surely meaningless......
Gohda, ......as well as Kumasawa.
The only thing left for those two, who had witnessed that massacre in the dining hall,
 was to cradle their heads, not even knowing how to interpret what they had seen...
".........Kumasawa‐san, are you okay......?
 Want some tea......?"
"H‐hohohohoho...
 Thank you very much, yes, thank you...
 ...I\'m sorry, but may I be left with my thoughts for a little while.........?"
Maria tried to be nice, but it seemed that Kumasawa still wasn\'t able to clear away her confusion.
"......Maria, thanks for being considerate.
 Let\'s let Kumasawa‐san rest for now."
"......Uu."
Jessica too showed consideration for Kumasawa, certain of the shock she must have received after witnessing such a tragedy,
 ......but her imagination couldn\'t even come close to the impossible scene Kumasawa had witnessed...
Nevertheless, with her mother having been killed, and her father having been captured,
 there was no way that Jessica could stay calm either.
She sealed her anxiety and sadness using her anger towards Kinzo, and walked irritatedly around the room.
"............Kumasawa‐san.
 Is Mom really.........dead?"
"......Y‐yes......
 ......I\'ve never seen such a...horrible way to die before......"
"It\'s...not possible that she\'s still alive,
 .........and with treatment, we could save her,
 ......is it......?"
"...........................
 ......A‐.........after such a thing happened to her head, it\'s unimaginable that she could still be.........alive......"
".................................
 ......Well, yeah...
 ......If the head gets smashed,
 ......there\'s normally no need for treatment, is there......"
When Gohda had come flying into the guesthouse, overcome with agitation,
 he had told about the massacre in the dining hall without concealing anything.
......Except for the part about the witches and magic, which they themselves still could not believe.
In other words, they hadn\'t even sugarcoated the cold‐blooded way in which Natsuhi and the others had died.
......It was too late now, but Kumasawa regretted having obviously said too much......
However, while lightly shaking her head and with a slightly painful laugh, Jessica spoke.
"......No, if anything, I was able to stay level‐headed thanks to what you told us."
".........If you\'d avoided mentioning the part about her head being smashed,
 ...maybe I\'d have said that she could still be alive,
 then ran off towards the mansion, straight into Grandfather, ......and I might have been killed."
"......There\'s a chance that sliver of hope would\'ve been fatal.
 .........With that in mind, I\'m grateful."
"......I am deeply sorry.....
 I apologize for not choosing my words carefully..."
"Don\'t worry about it now.
 There\'s nothing we can do about Mom now......but Dad\'s still alive.
 Kanon‐kun and Shannon, and Auntie Kyrie and Doctor Nanjo too."
"......I want to save them somehow, so we shouldn\'t do anything unnecessary that might be a burden to them.
 ......The most helpful thing we can do right now might be to wait by the phone."
There could be a phone call asking them to create a diversion to facilitate their escape.
Or perhaps the others might learn their location, and call for rescue.
......Jessica understood that in order to act promptly when that time came, the only thing they could do for the time being was to wait in this room...
George, Battler, and Gohda returned, having finished checking all of the locks downstairs.
Each of the three was holding a bunch of different objects.
George had things like drinks, canned food, crackers, and other types of snacks that he had found in the lounge and pantry, as well as a first‐aid kit.
All consumables that would be indispensable while they were locked down.
Gohda had a large folding ladder and carpentry tools.
Those were so that, in the case of an emergency, they could nail over the door from the inside to seal it.
{n}If it came to that, the ladder was for escaping out the window.
Battler had brought up objects which could be used as weapons, such as blades and poles.
The kitchen knives went without saying; the disassembled table legs could be used as clubs;
 and the pole roughly the size of a person, which had been made by taking apart a hat stand,
 could surely be used as a spear, even though it had no point.
......There was a good possibility that the enemies were carrying guns, so it was dubious whether these would be of any use.
But it was still better than not having them, and if those things could provide at least a little peace of mind, then they could also expect some kind of calming effect from them.
Then, they placed beds and sofas from around the room up against the door, barricading it.
They didn\'t go so far as to seal it up with nails.
 ......There was still the chance that Krauss and the others would escape, and come to meet up.
They had apparently set up a barricade at the top of the stairs as well.
{n}It had been designed to create a racket, so it would work in place of a warning alarm as well.
It was apparently Battler\'s idea.
For that reason, they turned the TV off.
{n}.........So that if the first‐floor window were to be broken, they would know by the sound.
Once the switch had been turned off, all that was left was an eerie silence.
......The sound of the violent wind and rain.
 Were they going to have to spend the whole night in such crushing suspense?
The boat was meant to be coming tomorrow morning.
However, judging by the weather report, the typhoon was expected to continue all day tomorrow, and the boat probably wouldn\'t come.
......The typhoon would pass in the morning of the day after tomorrow.
In other words, the boat would be coming the morning of the day after tomorrow, ......as in, the morning of October 6th.
And right now, it was late at night, October 4th.
.........They would have to spend more than thirty hours on this island,
 with Kinzo turned cold‐blooded murderer and his weird companions prowling about......
Even with the shutters closed, there would definitely be a little bit of light seeping out.
It might let the enemy know that they were hiding here.
......Battler suggested that it might be best to turn off the lights.
But they had already been taken over by such a ghastly feeling just from turning the TV off.
.......There wasn\'t anyone who directly challenged his proposal, but then again, there wasn\'t a single other person who agreed to it.........
"......Uu.
 Can\'t watch TV?"
"Yeah, sorry, but you\'ll have to bear with it.
 ......We can\'t afford to miss the sound of the enemy breaking in."
"........................
 ......Boring."
Even though she had been told that her mother had died, Maria alone somehow didn\'t seem to feel an approaching sense of danger.
It seemed she was quite displeased with having the TV turned off.
.........Even with this bizarre situation in front of her, she can\'t share our sense of danger?
......Because she\'s so young?
To Battler right now, seeing that young girl act in a way that was even slightly out of place...
made him feel that there was something very eerie about Maria......
"All that said.
 .........There\'s nothing more to try.
 Do you think you\'ll be able to do anything about the bars?"
"......Unfortunately, they\'re tougher than I imagined.
 I don\'t know when these were made, but their durability is certainly up to snuff.
 These are truly made rather well."
Kyrie chuckled softly.
{n}......They had no moves they could make, but the mood had calmed just a little.
"......This place is just like where you place chess pieces once you\'ve captured them.
 ......There is nothing left we can do, then......?"
"Not so fast.
 It\'s still too early to give in.
 If we stop thinking, we might as well stop breathing, right?"
"Exactly.
 ......Chess pieces taken aside may have no purpose, but there\'s a great purpose for them in shogi.
 Just one captured pawn should be able to put pressure on the opponent."
"I see...
 But still, there\'s nothing that can be done about these bars......"
"For us, maybe.
 .........But, if we can pinpoint where this is and contact Gohda‐san, we might be able to get him to come and save us."
"I see...
 But that would mean forcing danger on Gohda‐san......
 And I would also be worried for the children in the guesthouse, without a full‐grown adult male..."
"If you\'re risk‐averse, biding your time until the situation improves again is not a bad idea.
 ......However, if you don\'t know when to cut your losses, what you have might become worthless scraps of paper.
 ......And what we have is our lives."
"Our dignity as parents, too, right?
 After talking big like that during the telephone call, and telling them that we\'d handle it and they should stay put, we can\'t just start asking for help right away.
 That would be very uncool.
 *giggle*."
"At this point, pride is already worth less than nothing.
 .........Why don\'t we put our heads together?
 Where is this?
 Is it really underneath the dining hall?
 Or else, is it a different place, separate from the mansion...?"
Krauss, Kyrie, and Nanjo began to discuss their plans.
Kanon was squatting by the bars, silently trying to sense anyone\'s presence.
 ......Just as he had been ordered.
Shannon came close to him, and they both squatted down together.
"............Do you sense someone?"
".........Yes.
 ......They aren\'t paying any attention in this direction, but there\'s somebody relatively close by."
"Is it {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}...?"
"............I think it\'s the goats.
 Their breathing is really noisy."
Kanon\'s ability to sense the presence of others was several levels above that of a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.
He described their breathing as noisy, but Krauss and the rest couldn\'t even pick up the slightest hint of it.
......Therefore, even if he had simply reported it, they would merely have doubted his ears.
"...............They got us, didn\'t they."
".....................
 ......It\'s unusual.
 For us to be captured without being killed."
"This time, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama didn\'t make her appearance.
 And the Master left his study.
 ......I don\'t have a clue what\'s going on..."
"I do.
 .........Whatever happens or changes, it\'s all for that witch\'s fickle entertainment.
 The result will be no different."
"I wonder if this time we\'ll be able to.........go to the Golden Land."
"Who knows.
 We have a high rate of losing."
"............Come to think of it, it\'s a rare thing that both of us survived the first twilight, isn\'t it?
 ......I get the feeling that it\'s incredibly unusual for us to be able to talk together like this even though the ritual has already begun."
"Maybe.
 ......But that\'s still just for the witch\'s entertainment.
 I\'m not thinking of it as anything other than her letting us live just a little longer to ridicule us, since we usually drop out right in the beginning."
"I wonder if........we\'ll be unable to reach the Golden Land again."
"I\'m sure we won\'t.
 ......If we hold onto any foolish hope, we\'ll get taken advantage of again."
"*giggle*.
 That\'s right.
 Last time you got taken advantage of."
"......I\'m an idiot."
Kanon made a sour look, and turned his head.
Shannon laughed softly, and apologetically leaned towards his shoulder.
"But......it\'s nice to hear that Milady is safe, isn\'t it?"
"......She\'s escaped the first twilight, that\'s all.
 ......She might just be being made to wait for an even crueler death in a later twilight."
"What about you, Nee‐san?
 ......Aren\'t you glad George‐sama\'s safe?
 It\'d be nice if you two could reach the Golden Land together."
".........Thanks.
 I wish the same for you and Milady as well."
"I, I don\'t have my hopes up.
 .........It\'s just as you say.
 All that witch is doing is having fun dangling prizes in front of people, and watching them flounder."
".........I\'m sure no one will be able to go to the Golden Land.
 ......If I was foolish enough to wish to reach the Golden Land with Milady,
 .........that witch would find that very fun to toy with, and would certainly never let us reach there."
"......You\'re right.
 .........{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama is thinking about which order of sacrifices will be the most interesting."
"The whole thing about them being chosen at random is just a blatant lie.
 That swindling witch...
 ......All that about having any wish you want granted in the Golden Land is probably just a lie."
"..................That\'s not true.
 The Golden Land is......a wonderful place."
"Have you been there?"
".........Only for a little bit.
 Though, even that was probably just {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama\'s joke."
"...............What\'s it like there?"
"Well.
 .........It\'s a wonderful place.
 ...I can\'t really explain it well.
 It\'s a world like a pleasant dream."
"A paradise‐like place, with roses blooming all over and beautiful butterflies dancing, or something like that?"
"......It\'s not a place with a tangible image like that.
 It really is like being in a dream.
 When you\'re there, it\'s very gentle, very peaceful,
 ......and you\'re allowed to sleep as long as you want, like when you wake up early on your day off, lying under the covers."
"......Sunlight comes in through the cracks in the curtains, and you think "I have to get up",
 but then you realize it\'s your day off, and you can go back under the covers again...it\'s a place where you can feel like that."
"I\'d feel annoyed that I got up at all.
 Getting up by accident even though it\'s your day off is something only you would do, Nee‐san.
 .........Go on?"
"Well.
 While I was there, I felt very contented, and very calm.
 But once you return to this world, you can\'t remember it well, even though you\'ve only just been there."
"It\'s a lot like when you can\'t remember a dream you were just having.
 ......But I still remember that it was a very calm and quiet world."
".........That\'s it?
 Wow, that Golden Land she\'s always bragging about isn\'t much special at all.
 ......I thought it was a place where all your wishes come true."
"It is.
 It\'s a place where all your wishes will be granted.
 .........Well, maybe that\'s not quite it.
 It might be better to say it\'s a place where you don\'t have to wish for anything."
"......For example, if you were cold, Kanon‐kun, and wished you had a jacket, you\'d be happy to be given one,
 but if you were in a warm room to begin with, there wouldn\'t even be a reason to want a jacket, right?"
"......That\'s what the Golden Land is like.
 There\'s no need to even wish for most wishes.
 It\'s a world released from everything, where everything is calm."
"You could even say it\'s a place that transcends the concept that having your wishes granted will bring happiness...a world released from everything."
"........................
 ......It sounds kind of religious."
"And there, everything is equal.
 All things with minds are equal.
 ......There are no {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s, nor furniture, nor witches.
 ......There, I was equal to everyone.
 There was no longer any need to feel ashamed of myself because I was furniture."
".........It was honestly a happy world where I was equal to all {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s, and even witches.
 I can\'t really remember it well,
 but I have the feeling that when I was there, I was equal even to {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, and we were good friends."
"............If that witch is there, then it\'s not a much of a paradise."
".........So, you want to go to that blissful Golden Land with George‐sama.
 That\'s strange.
 The Golden Land is a utopia where you want for nothing, right?
 Wouldn\'t you be content even if George‐sama wasn\'t there?"
".....................
 ...The Golden Land is very calm, peaceful, and everything is fair and equal.
 ......But actually, happiness alone is left out."
"It isn\'t a happy world?"
"Of course, just by being peaceful, calm, and fair, it\'s an incredibly happy world.
 ......But I guess you could say that it\'s a world of zero, where you\'re released from all negative worries."
"The human world is filled with negatives, so of course a zero world is incredibly happy, ......but it\'s still zero.
 *giggle*, that\'s asking for a lot, isn\'t it?"
"......It\'s something like this.
 When you\'re nodding off on your quiet holiday morning,
 ......if the person you love the most is next to you, and they\'re holding your hand, then it can become an even greater, more wonderful happiness, .........something like that.
 ...Sorry, Nee‐san is horrible with analogies, I\'m too stupid."
"......So,
 to you, the greatest happiness would be reaching that world together with George‐sama."
"Yes.
 And I\'m sure that for you, it would be reaching that world together with Milady."
"The two will be released from their worries in a fair world...?
 .........It feels like I\'m being indoctrinated into some kind of strange religion.
 I imagined something more...worldly.
 A world where we would be given magic medicine, and that would make us be born again as {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s, or something more like that."
".........If you go, you\'ll understand.
 If {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama really is a fickle person, then surely some day, she\'ll let you get a glimpse of it too.
 ......Then you\'ll be able to understand my example."
"....................................
 Well, I\'m not holding my breath.
 ......At any rate, it seems like game over for us this time already.
 Maybe we can do better some other time."
"......You\'re right.
 If we have some strange hope, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama will take advantage of us again.
 .........It might be best for us just to stop thinking, and entrust ourselves to fate."
".........We just need to be simple chess pieces.
 ......No matter what we think or don\'t think, we can\'t escape from the witch\'s chessboard.
 Our role is now just to wait and see how we\'ll be tortured to death.
 ......For us, the dream of the Golden Land is too unavailing."
"..................You\'re...right.
 ......Sorry......"
Kanon shrugged his shoulders, then told Shannon to leave him alone because she was interfering with his duty, distancing himself from her.
Realizing her thoughtlessness in bringing up such an inappropriate topic and instead hurting Kanon,
 Shannon bit her lower lip and stared at the ground...
She wouldn\'t bother him any more.
{n}She went off and squatted in a corner by herself.
".....................nn—"
At that moment, Kanon twitched.
{n}It was like the ears of a cat when it reacts to a faint sound.
"What\'s wrong?"
"......Shh.
 .........Krauss‐sama, somebody is coming."
"What?!"
They ended their conversation and strained their ears.
......For a while, they couldn\'t hear anything,
 but before long, they were able to hear the sounds of a large group of people walking...
"......So they\'ve come."
"The time of reckoning is upon us—or else, our first and final chance."
".........I shall talk to Kinzo‐san.
 ...I will try to find out where this place is somehow."
"We\'re counting on you.
 ..........................."
During the last phone call, Kyrie had asked what the time over at the guesthouse was.
......It had been the same as her watch, and by this she had learned that their watches hadn\'t been set back.
It wasn\'t just the clocks on the walls in the guesthouse.
{n}Several people\'s watches, including George\'s and Gohda\'s, had matched.
......If that was the case,
 then after the massacre in the dining hall, they had been transported to the dungeon in only a few minutes.
Not enough time had passed for them to be knocked out and carried away.
Then were those really pitfalls, meaning that this was the area directly under the dining hall......?
All they could do was pray that Nanjo could find out where this was...
"......They\'re coming.
 There\'s probably...four people.
 ......The Master, and three of those who appeared in the dining hall."
"OK, good.
 You come back here as well now.
 We\'ll deal with the rest."
"Shannon‐chan, sorry, but can I have you sit by the phone?
 Hide it with your skirt."
"Ah......yes...!"
The presence came closer, ......and there was the sound of a heavy door being opened at the other end of the corridor.
The light they were apparently carrying illuminated the dimly lit corridor, stroking the walls with razor‐sharp shadows.
And then, the light from the lantern they held lit up the prisoners through the bars.
......The bars\' sharp shadows divided them up lengthwise.
There were four figures there.
 .........It was Kinzo, ............Ronove, {f:5:Virgilia}, and Gaap.
"The head of the Ushiromiya family, Lord {f:5:Goldsmith}.
 Everyone, your silence, please."
"...............{f:5:Goldsmith}?"
"It\'s Father\'s pen name.
 It seems he always signs with it when writing those bizarre grimoires."
"‘Kinzo’ made English‐style?
 Shouldn\'t that be {f:5:Goldwarehouse}?"
".........Hahhahahahahahahahahaha.
 A warehouse is a place to keep things in and nothing more.
 Whereas I create gold, and use my craftsmanship to further increase its worth.
 Don\'t you think "smith" is much more fitting?"
"...............Certainly.
 I apologize for blathering."
"Kinzo‐san......
 ......Just what is going on?
 Where in the world is this...?"
"Oh, my friend.
 Can\'t you remember?
 Certainly, you may never have entered the prison, but you should remember walking through this corridor."
".........Huh,
 ............huh?
 ...............Y‐you don\'t mean........."
"......Do you have an idea?"
"But, no, .........that is inconceivable.
 ......Firstly, we fell through a pitfall, and furthermore, we were locked up in here after only a few minutes...
 ......Not only is the distance too great, that\'s physically impossible......"
"For a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}, right?
 *giggle*."
"Father... Is this the mansion?
 To think that the mansion had an underground area like this......"
"Kraussss.
 Wasn\'t there a place whose existence you all whispered of, and which you followed after me on numerous occasions trying to find?
 .........This is that place.
 No, to be correct, this is under that place.
 *cackle*cackle*...!"
"This place couldn\'t be............Kuwadorian\'s...
...basement...?!"
"......It is as you surmise.
 This is the basement of Kuwadorian."
"Kuwadorian......
 ......You don\'t mean...Father\'s rumored hidden mansion......?
 It really exists......?"
"This mansion was constructed for the sole use of my beloved witch, {f:5:Beatrice}.
 It is truly a shame that I cannot show you around the above‐ground section, as it is such a beautiful and elegant mansion."
".........How lovely, just the two of you alone in a mansion with this kind of room.
 It seems that you and I are differently inclined."
"......Kyrie‐san.
 ......It would be wise to refrain from such rude comments."
"*giggle*.
 But I agree.
 ......If a mansion I was given had this kind of dungeon in it,
 even a hundred‐year love would turn cold, and I\'d take anything of value and run for the hills."
"Pu ku ku.
 Oh? You have no interest in this sort of thing?
 And here I was thinking that you would go head over heels."
"Heheh.
 .........Of course I go head over heels.
 If I get a collar or something for a birthday present.
 ......But only if he\'s a stud."
"Puu ku ku ku ku!"
"Quiet!
 ......Don\'t you need a gag more than a collar?"
"Oh, even that\'s not off‐limits for you?
 You sure aren\'t picky, Lia.
 *giggle*......"
"Wh‐who gave you permission to shorten my name...?!"
"Enough, you noisy women!
 Are you telling me you\'d like to be locked up in the same cell?"
"I, I apologize, my lord...
 This old body of mine would not be able to stand such a cold prison..."
{f:5:Virgilia} quickly apologized, but Gaap merely laughed together with Ronove.
It was like she was saying that she wouldn\'t be captured,
 or else, that even if she were to be captured, it would be meaningless......
"A prison is a place where the captured cannot escape from.
 That implies the strong will and love to not let go for a lifetime.
 A woman who you could give up on if she ran away is not worth the word "love"."
"A woman who makes you fall so madly in love that you don\'t want to let her escape, to the point of binding her in chains...
 It is only upon reaching that level that it becomes a love worth sacrificing my life for.
 .........I will not ask you to understand."
".........I cannot be bound by anyone, and will not be bound.
 I don\'t want to be loved, I want to love.
 I feel the same as you, {f:5:Goldsmith}.
 That\'s why I understand the madness of your love."
"Love and madness are two sides of the same coin, or so they say.
 How bothersome."
".........But learning where we are so easily was a big step.
 We\'ll ask the details later, but it seems that you know about this place, right, Doctor Nanjo?"
"Y‐yes......
 ......If that corridor is the underground passage beneath Kuwadorian,
 .........then if we go straight there, it will become a long tunnel,
 ......and if we stay on that, we should be able to return to the mansion."
"......Then if we could just do something about these bars, we could go home."
"Father...
 What are you planning to do with us?"
"As I have already declared, you are the sacrifices for the later twilights.
 There are conveniently five of you here.
 You will be perfect as hostages for the five gougings."
"......I see.
 ...Then it\'s the time of reckoning for us, then?"
"Eventually.
 That\'s not why I\'m here this time, so relax.
 Besides, I believe I said it already.
 ......If one of my grandchildren is deemed suitable to inherit everything from me, then the ritual will be called off.
 In other words, your lives will be spared."
"......Wh‐what are you planning to do to the children?"
"To see if they are suitable to be my successor or not,
 I shall give them a test.
 If even one of them can impress me, I\'ll call the ritual off."
".........And if there isn\'t anyone suitable,
 ......what are you planning on doing with the children?"
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!
 There\'s no need to worry about that.
 After all, you are the ones who will be made into sacrifices first.
 Anything after that should be of no concern to you."
"You simply need to place your fates in the hands of your own children.
 ......Your children, the fruit of what you\'ve birthed, taught and raised.
 They should truly be the most suitable to entrust with your fate...!"
"*cackle*cackle*!
 Don\'t make such a worried face, Kraaauss...
 Believe in the daughter that you brag is worth ten billion yen.
 Hehheheh, heh{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!!"
".........Exactly.
 Children are the fruit of their parents.
 Worthy of entrusting with the parent\'s fate.
 And Father, that applies even to you."
"......Heheh, hahhahahaha!
 This woman has guts, what a waste on Rudolf!
 Wahhaha{0}hahaha...!!"
"...Kyrie‐san, ......it would be best not to aggravate him too much."
"I agree.
 Let\'s bear with it for now......"
"That\'s right...
 ......After all, we\'re simply fish on a chopping board.
 There\'s nothing we can do now."
"Except insult me with such vigor.
 I don\'t dislike that kind of woman, you know?
 {f:5:Beatrice} was that kind of woman too, in the beginning.
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"
"............My lord.
 Let us get to the main topic.
 We\'ve been getting derailed for a while now."
"Ah yes, there was that. Sorry, sorry, my friend.
 Well then, let\'s get to the main topic.
 For that, I\'ve prepared a phone.
 .......Shannon, very shrewd of you.
 You don\'t have to hide it any longer.
 I had that put there.
 *cackle*cackle*...!"
"M‐my apologies......"
"........................"
Shannon quickly withdrew, and the telephone was revealed...
"Krauss.
 Call the grandchildren in the guesthouse.
 And tell them of the test—of the start of my trial."
With a gesture that seemed to be saying "go ahead", Ronove urged Krauss to pick up the receiver.
"...............And if I say no?"
"Hohoh, and why do you think you\'re in a position where you can make a deal?
 If you don\'t call, then the grandchildren won\'t even be given a chance.
 The Ushiromiya family will end here.
 And I\'ll turn you all into sacrifices right away!!"
"You\'d be lucky to become sacrifices right away.
 ......Don\'t you think it\'d be more painful to watch the children be made into sacrifices first, before your very eyes...?"
"......Ga...ap.
 The Master is the one who decides the order of the sacrifices.
 Keep your opinions to yourself."
"Lia, you just tried to shorten my name and failed, didn\'t you?"
"I, I did not!
 And I told you not to shorten my name...!"
"......Women truly are..."
"Noisy. Pu ku ku!"The clinic that Nanjo had opened and later passed on to his son still existed on Niijima.
The aged doctor was Nanjo\'s son, but the atmosphere about him was very different.
"I am truly sorry to say this after you have come all this way, but I have nothing in particular to tell you."
Nanjo\'s son spoke very indifferently.
"......After the accident on that island was taken up by the talk shows in a most indiscreet manner,
 there was a great deal of deeply offensive probing into my father, who was {nobr:Mr. Ushiromiya\'s} doctor and friend."
"All of it was without proof, and also, defiled all of my father\'s previous achievements.
 I still feel a great deal of resentment towards all of that."
"............I think that\'s understandable.
 It\'s been pretty much the same for me.
 Constantly since I was six."
"True.
 My apologies."
The doctor finally remembered that Ange was also a victim, exposed to the same curious eyes as he had been.
"In that case, you can probably understand why I want nothing more to do with that incident.
 ......That was an unfortunate accident.
 The only ones who want to make a fuss about it being a crime are the irresponsible TV shows and magazines.
 I am more than fed up with their attitude."
.........Nanjo had been placed in the spotlight for being one of Ushiromiya Kinzo\'s few friends.
Because of that, there had probably been a persistent offensive from the Witch Hunters and the press to use the late Nanjo\'s son as well as a source of information.
......The doctor went on and on, criticizing the press indignantly.
"I really understand how you feel.
 My personal life was put under surveillance,
 and I had no privacy, no portrait rights, heck, I don\'t know if I was even afforded human rights.
 So I {i:deeply} empathize with your pent‐up anger."
".........And for that very reason, I want to know, more than anything else, what in the world was that incident that so thoroughly ruined my life.
 That\'s why I came here."
".........I\'m a related party just like you.
 Not a magazine columnist or an interviewer.
 Please, don\'t get the wrong idea."
"I didn\'t come to do this for fun.
 ......And I\'d very much appreciate it if you stopped looking down on me.
 If we\'re going to do a comparison of whose life was most screwed up by that incident, you won\'t even come close."
"............mgh......"
Ange spoke sharply.
Never having imagined that he would be talked back to in such a forceful manner, the doctor couldn\'t help but fall silent.
......From Ange\'s perspective, the doctor was whining about absolutely nothing.
She really wanted him to pack in his patronizing attitude.
 It was about time to make him understand how many days had passed for her before arriving on this island.
The doctor realized that he had misspoken, and remained silent for a while, looking uncomfortable.
"I know it\'s probably painful to remember what happened at the time, but if there\'s anything you do know, please tell me, no matter what it is.
 Of course, I\'ll tell no one."
"I visited here today to bring some closure to my life.
 ......I\'m eighteen.
 That incident took away twelve years of my life.
 And it\'ll probably keep on taking."
"......I was thrown into darkness when I was six years old and I\'ve never gotten out.
 Are you still going to tell me I have no right to know...?"
".........No, ...I\'m sorry.
 It seems that since all the others who came were ill‐natured folk, I instinctively put up my guard.
 I apologize for my rudeness."
"......Alright.
 If you\'ll swear not to breathe a word of this to anyone, I\'ll tell you everything."
"Thank you, Doctor.
 ......Then, if you would.
 Please tell me anything you can."
"......As you know, my father was not only {nobr:Mr. Ushiromiya\'s} personal physician, but his friend through the game of chess.
 That relationship was very long, stretching back to the time {nobr:Mr. Ushiromiya} moved to Rokkenjima."
"Just how close were they?"
"Considerably, it seems.
 It seems that their connection through chess led my father to stay at {nobr:Mr. Ushiromiya\'s} mansion quite often."
"......I am not sure it is right of me to say this, but {nobr:Mr. Ushiromiya} was extremely moody.
 And my father was an exceedingly magnanimous man, who excelled at interacting with people like him.
 It\'s not hard to imagine that he was a rare friend for the isolated {nobr:Mr. Ushiromiya}."
"That day was the day of the family conference.
 ......The Ushiromiya family conferences are said to have involved harsh questioning from Ushiromiya Kinzo over how his fortune would be put to use,
 almost like a financial conference.
 So Doctor Nanjo had gained a trust so great that he was asked to attend even that...?"
"My father was a simple doctor,
 so I cannot imagine that he was in a position to advise on asset management for a millionaire family like the Ushiromiyas."
"He was most likely called there to assist, because {nobr:Mr. Ushiromiya\'s} health was not at its best at the time.
 ......As {nobr:Mr. Ushiromiya\'s} close friend, I\'m sure that my father would have kept his mouth shut, and been trusted not to leak the secrets of the family conference."
"......Was Ushiromiya Kinzo in very bad health at the time?
 Are there any medical charts left?"
"My father probably took the medical charts with him on the day of the accident.
 I\'m afraid to say that the entire folder of {nobr:Mr. Ushiromiya\'s} medical charts has been lost.
 He was my father\'s patient, so I don\'t know the details either."
"Around the time of the incident.
 Was there anything you thought was strange?"
".....................
 ......Well, there was...
 ......However, it seems exceedingly likely to result in a misunderstanding, so I don\'t particularly want to talk about it."
"......What is it?
 Please tell me."
For a while, the doctor beat around the bush,
 but after he\'d said that much, Ange would not allow the subject to be dodged.
Eventually, he was worn down, and after making Ange swear herself to secrecy again, he opened up......
"The truth is, several days after that accident, I received something by mail at my home."
".........Mail?"
"It was very curious.
 The sender was made out to be me, but I had no memory of it.
 Someone had sent it in my name."
"The destination was Rebun Island in Hokkaido.
 ......It\'s at the northernmost tip of Japan, excluding the Northern Territories.
 The recipient\'s address was on Rebun Island, but.........
the name was my father\'s."
"......However, it seems there was a problem with the destination address, so it had received an "Address Unknown" label,
 and been returned to the sender, "me"."
It was...truly a strange tale.
Nanjo\'s son\'s name was written as the sender.
{n}......However, he said that he hadn\'t mailed the letter.
In short, that meant someone had sent it using his name.
The destination was "Nanjo Terumasa", on Hokkaido\'s Rebun Island.
But the lot number written on it didn\'t exist,
 so the local post office had been unable to deliver it, and instead sent it back to "the sender, Nanjo\'s son"......
"......What was inside?"
"...........................
 ......I truly ask that you keep silent about this.
 I am by no means pleased to have received this.
 Even so, I can hardly throw it away......"
The doctor stood up and headed for the bookshelf.
There, dozens of dictionaries that could only have been ornamental were lined up one after another,
 asserting in the strongest way imaginable that the owner was an intellectual.
When he pulled several volumes out from there, a large, brown envelope was hidden behind them.
He took it out and tossed it onto the desk.
It had been been carefully sealed with adhesive tape,
 and its faded color and dryness told that it had remained sealed for twelve whole years......
"Most sincerely, .........I ask for your silence."
While emphasizing it so much it was annoying, the doctor removed the seal with a quality paper knife.
......Then, when he tilted the envelope, an already opened mail envelope spilled out.
The envelope had weight to it, hinting that there was something other than a letter inside.
.........The recipient...was certainly Nanjo Terumasa.
{n}Even seeing that......was a huge shock.
After that incident, Nanjo\'s corpse had not been found, and he was being treated as dead in absentia under extraordinary circumstances.
......And despite that, this letter addressed to a Nanjo in Hokkaido existed.
{n}One could almost take this as a sign that he had faked his own death and escaped to Hokkaido.
"......Was Doctor Nanjo really in Hokkaido?
 Or was there another person there with the same first and last names?"
"If my father had somehow escaped from the accident and was living on in Hokkaido,
 that would have made our family very happy, regardless of the situation."
"I also thought of that possibility at first.
 ......However, the destination address of this envelope does not exist.
 In short, this envelope was mail that had no way of reaching him."
"............Is there a possibility that the sender miswrote the correct address?"
"Of course, I cannot disprove that.
 However, judging from the residence\'s house number, I find that hard to believe."
".........
Hokkaido,
 Rebun Island,
 Rebun County,
 Rebun City,
 1‐2‐34‐567.
 ....................."
Up until Rebun City, it\'s alright.
...But I just couldn\'t wipe away the feeling that following sequential number, 1234567, was a little insincere.
It felt like a fake address that some kid had made up.
"They probably just randomly wrote some clearly nonexistent address.
 I think it\'s natural to assume that, from the very beginning, this envelope was sent to a nonexistent address to which {i:it had no chance of being delivered}."
If the destination address doesn\'t exist, mail is generally returned to the sender.
But even in the case of a faulty address, the local post office will often courteously,
 and to the best of its ability, research to find whether the sender\'s intended destination exists.
When they still can\'t find it, the mail is sometimes returned after an investigation of several days.
It seemed that this was what had happened with this envelope, and the stamp was postmarked October 3rd.
It was postmarked on Niijima.
{n}Niijima is a long way away from Rebun Island.
On top of that, the destination was also nonsensical.
{n}......It had taken more than a week for the mail to be returned.
......In other words, there was an extremely high chance that having this envelope returned to the sender after an indeterminate amount of time...
had been the goal from the very beginning.
Why do something like that.........?
Even before asking what it was that had been sent, this envelope was already veiled in mystery......
"..................And inside it?"
"Go ahead."
After getting the doctor\'s permission, I tilted the already opened envelope.
From the inside came a small, folded letter, and a small key with a number tag attached.
 A swipe card slid out in addition.
A112 was engraved on the key\'s number tag.
{n}......I didn\'t know what it meant.
The swipe card was pitch black and had gold letters engraved on it.
"MEMBERS" was written there in English.
 The jet‐black, gold‐lettered card design made it feel like something very high‐class.
......But of course, I didn\'t have a clue what kind of card it was just from that.
......I unfolded the letter.
{n}Its contents were extremely brief, and only the following was written:
07151129.
And the name of a certain massive bank known throughout Japan, as well as the words "Central Branch".
......That was all.
"What\'s this.........?"
"...............
 .........It\'s a card, a key, and a PIN for a safe‐deposit box.
 And it wasn\'t a normal safe‐deposit box either.
 It was an unsettling one, which was apparently reserved only for special clients."
After he had finished putting his affairs in order following his father\'s funeral, he visited the bank.
......PIN and key and card.
 There was no doubt that something of great importance was stored there,
 and it was natural that he was curious about what that could be.
At first, he didn\'t know what to do.
{n}......The card wasn\'t properly his possession.
When he mustered up his courage and showed the card to a bank clerk, he was then switched to a clerk of clearly high status, and was guided to a large vault on the fourth basement floor.
The security on the way there was strict.
The doctor had himself stored valuable items such as real estate transcripts in safe‐deposit boxes before,
 but this was something on a whole different level......
"......Unlike the procedure at the deposit box I use,
 their system didn\'t carry out any identity checks so long as you had a card, a PIN, and a key."
"......But, in any case, it was a very secure vault, and I was frightened by how imposing it was.
 ......I wondered what kind of shady objects might await me that had to be stored in a place like this."
"............And so?"
"When I passed the card through the reader, I was asked to input the PIN.
 And after that eight digit number was input and authenticated, I was permitted access to the vault."
"......It was an incredible scene.
 A world like something from a sci‐fi movie.
 That massive, dimly lit silver room was covered with doors to safes."
He entered that room along with the clerk.
As soon as the card was read, the vaults he had a right to were apparently determined,
 so that safes he could open were lit with a green light, while those he couldn\'t open were lit with a red one.
"A112 indicated one of those safes.
 ......By the way, there was a long line of other safes marked with a green lamp besides that one.
 I think there were at least twenty."
"There might even have been more in other corners of the room.
 ......In any event, I only had the key to A112.
 I had no way of checking the contents of the other safes."
As the clerk watched, the doctor unlocked and opened the safe.
When he did, a safe drawer like a large cabinet opened,
 ......and an expensive‐looking duralumin case showed itself...
That was carried into a separate room, where for the first time, the clerk left, and he was introduced to the contents......
"And the contents were.........?"
"........................
 ............Cash."
"Cash?
 How much?"
"I have heard that a pack of one million yen in fresh banknotes is precisely one centimeter thick.
 Since those were.........packed tightly into a duralumin case of such a size..."
"......There was probably a hundred million total.
 I don\'t know, because I didn\'t count.
 I didn\'t even touch it with my hands.
 I realized at once.
 This was dangerous money."
It isn\'t normal to store a whole hundred million yen in cash in a safe like that, case and all.
......It\'s much easier to deal with if you deposit it into a bank account and turn it into a number.
The very fact that they were unable to do that made it clear that there was something wrong with that cash......
"......My mind went blank, and I instantly realized that I must not get involved."
"And you didn\'t use it at all?"
"Yes.
 I locked it straight back up, returned it to the original safe, and left.
 ......I have thought about throwing away that key and card, but I have no idea what might happen.
 For that reason, I\'ve been hiding it in the back of the bookcase, a secret from everyone, for a full twelve years.
 .........I still don\'t know what kind of money that was."
"......Could I borrow this envelope?"
"No.
 Please just view it here."
".....................
 ......Alright.
 Then if I may.
 There\'s something I want to investigate."
I took Onee‐chan\'s grimoire from the knapsack I had set down.
......Then I opened to the page with the paragraph {f:5:Beatrice} had written to Onee‐chan, and compared the handwriting on both......
"..................................................."
............The characteristic handwriting was unmistakable.
 The one who had sent this hundred million yen in cash............was {f:5:Beatrice} herself......
But, .........what is it...
 Something\'s bugging me......
{n}What is it.........
 What is it.........
".........Y‐......yeah.
 I\'m pretty sure I got something like that in the mail.
 Hey Ma, where\'d I put that again?!"
The same envelope and contents had been sent to Kumasawa\'s son, who had once lived with her.
But he had been very busy in the days since, and seemed to have forgotten about it among the hustle and bustle of everyday life.
But apparently, its strange contents had stayed in his memory, and he remembered as soon as Ange told him......
After a bit of a wait,
 his thin‐lipped wife came with the envelope, complaining that he always forgets where he puts things......
The modus operandi for the sender and recipient was exactly the same as for Nanjo\'s son.
{n}The sender was made out to be Kumasawa\'s son, and the recipient was Kumasawa Chiyo.
And the destination address was in the Okinawa Prefecture.
{n}Okinawa Prefecture, Yaeyama County, Yonaguni City, {nobr:1‐2‐341‐5167}.
Yonaguni Island is at the westernmost tip of Japan.
{n}And the lot number was exactly like before: a sequential number that had apparently been chosen at random.
......Now it was certain.
 This envelope was definitely sent with the goal of having it be returned to the sender.
Its contents were exactly the same.
A letter with the PIN and the bank\'s central branch written on it.
{n}A swipe card.
 A key with attached number tag.
The inscription on the number tag was A113.
{n}......The number right after the one on the key that had been sent to Nanjo\'s son.
Most likely, inside the vault was the same kind of duralumin case, packed with a hundred million yen in cash......
"......Got the feeling my mom had sent it to me from beyond the grave.
 Don\'t really get what\'s inside, and it\'s creepy, so I just left it alone all this time, and totally forgot about it until today."
"......So, you know what this is, girl?
 Could it be that the same thing came to your place...?"
".......................................ah."
"......What is it, Ange‐sama?"
‘Uryu...headache? Headache...?!’
"............Sorry, my head hurts......
 ......Stabbing pain... .........I {i:know} this......"
‘What do you mean, you know this......?’
"You don\'t mean,
 ......this envelope......came to your place too, Ange‐sama...?"
.........I remember......
 ......I remember......!!
A strange envelope was also sent to me...twelve years ago...!!
I had fallen into depression after losing my entire family.
 ...But it was a really strange thing to come in the mail, so a faint memory of it remained.
It was a strange letter, which I had no memory of sending, but which had me as the sender.
I forget the destination address, but the person it had been sent to was Ushiromiya Rudolf.
{n}My father.
I remember that I got this letter I thought was from my father who had died, I opened it up,
 and I found a key and a card that I didn\'t really understand... I remember being really confused.
I felt let down, and threw it away somewhere, I think...
Where did I put that envelope?
{n}I probably lost it somewhere in the chaos that followed.
By now, I have no way of checking its contents.
But somehow I think I can guess.
......I\'m sure the contents were the same.
 Without a doubt, there must have been a key, a card, and a note with a PIN inside the envelope......
"......{f:5:Beatrice}......
 ......What was she trying to do here...?
 So did she hand out this stupid money to all surviving relatives?
 .........I won\'t forgive her......for mocking them even after their deaths........."
‘Uryu...uryu......Ange.........’
Sakutarou acted nervously.
 ......As I looked at his worrying face, my agitation began to cool off bit by bit...
"I\'m sorry...
 My hatred of {f:5:Beatrice} isn\'t anything new.
 ......I\'m just surprised and angry to find out that I had a connection with the witch already on that day, at the age of six..."
".........For the past twelve years,
 you have been enslaved by {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama\'s curse.
 ...This might be proof that this really was a curse.
 But please, don\'t fall apart.
 Part of this journey should be to break through that."
"That\'s right......
 Just letting the blood rise to my head won\'t get me anywhere.
 Got to think calmly.
 .........What\'s going on?
 What\'s the meaning of handing out a hundred million yen to each of the relatives?
 Was she trying to provoke us......?
 Damn that {f:5:Beatrice}........."
‘Ange......calm down......
 ......Uryu......’
As Sakutaro buried his head in my stomach, he urged me to stay calm.
......I took another deep breath, and started thinking.
".........I wonder if the sending of these envelopes was to demonstrate that this was a premeditated crime by {f:5:Beatrice}."
"They were postmarked right before the family conference.
 And they were intentionally set up so that they would be sent back after some time."
‘......They wanted them to arrive after the incident, is that it......?’
"Yeah.
 That\'s what it implies.
 .........But it still leaves me wondering a little.
 Why such an uncertain method?"
"Uncertain?"
"Yes.
 After all, you can\'t even guess in advance at how many days it would take for the mail to return.
 ......Normally, you can\'t even guess at the amount of time it will take for the receiving post office to do the research, make a determination of unknown recipient, and send it back."
‘Yeah, now that you mention it......
 It\'d be more certain if they just set an arrival date and mailed it that way......
 Uryu...’
"......Maybe, but still,
 if they mailed it the day before, then no matter how quickly it returned, it would probably have arrived no earlier than Monday.
 I wonder if they wanted to make it seem like a letter from the dead."
"......A letter from the dead, you say."
"......You\'re right.
 That surprises you, and makes you feel horrible.
 ......Some mail with your dead family\'s names written on the outside in large letters...
gets thrown into your mailbox with an ominous label attached."
"......However, it doesn\'t really make sense to me.
 I would have mailed it to arrive on a specified day.
 I just can\'t understand why someone would allow the insecurity of it possibly arriving on a day they weren\'t anticipating."
‘.....................Uryu.
 ......But that really does sound like Beato to me.’
"Huh?
 You...know about Beato?"
‘......Well, I only talked with her a little.
 ......But somehow I can tell that Beato would do something like this.’
‘.........Can\'t you imagine that too, Mammon?
 Beato likes pranks like this, right?’
"..................
 .........Yeah, that might be true.
 ......I wouldn\'t put it past {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama to try a vicious prank like a letter from the dead."
‘No, not just that part.
 .........{f:5:Beatrice} would find it more fun to do it in a way that was a little bit uncertain, instead of one that was absolutely certain.’
".........She would find an uncertain method...more fun...?"
I remembered Maria onee‐chan\'s diary...
{n}......It had quite a lot of descriptions of playing with {f:5:Beatrice}.
Occasionally, some of these involved Beato playing pranks on the adult relatives with Maria.
But those pranks always followed a certain little aesthetic principle of witches.
Which was.........that things are more fun if they are uncertain.
One day, Maria onee‐chan had brought a wind‐up minicar, and she and Beato decided to use it for a prank.
It was a popular toy at the time—if you made the minicar back up, it would wind up the spring in the tires, and when you let go, it would race forwards.
They had wound up that minicar and set it in the shadow of a milk jug.
......In other words, the prank was that, if you lifted the milk jug, the minicar would jump forwards and surprise whoever did it.
Hoping that someone would get caught in this prank, Onee‐chan and Beato had watched the adults from the shadows for their whole teatime.
They were looking forward to seeing who would get caught by it, but ultimately, no one moved the trap milk jug, and the trap never went off......
When Onee‐chan had then muttered "We should have put it somewhere where they\'d definitely get caught by it",
 Beato apparently said this.
She said,
 "Traps where you don\'t know who will get caught, or even whether anyone will get caught at all, are more thrilling and fun".
......It\'s probably true that you wouldn\'t get that kind of excitement from a trap that would definitely catch someone.
......This kind of description occurred in multiple places,
 making it possible to guess that the witch called {f:5:Beatrice} had quite a fickle character and loved a random thrill......
A fickle person is very hard to deal with.
 I can\'t flip over the chessboard......to find out what that witch from twelve years ago was planning.
As Ange thought these things over, her gaze wandered from place to place.
Then, she suddenly showed interest in the wall.
{n}There, a number of framed photographs were hung.
Many were commemorative photos from when the Kumasawas got together as a family or went somewhere to play, and Kumasawa herself was in many of them.
...Still with a smile that made it so you could almost hear her lighthearted hoh‐hoh‐ho laugh.
......It\'s a distant memory, but I do remember that she was definitely this sort of cheerful old lady...
"Did you notice anything different about Kumasawa‐san in the days leading up to the incident...?"
"Nope.
 She looked the same as ever.
 .....Grumbling about how tough the family conference was and how it put her on edge, same as always."
"............?
 ......What\'s this?"
Among the numerous frames, there was one that had something other than a picture of people in it.
It was a photograph of an enlarged relief of a door from a Western‐style house or something.
......I couldn\'t see any interesting subject in particular, which actually bugged me a bit as I wondered why anyone had gone to all the trouble of taking it.
As I got closer, I realized that some text had been written in pen.
"......Oh yeah, that\'s a photo I got when Mom\'s belongings were distributed.
 I think it probably has something to do with that "Legend of the Gold" thing."
"The witch\'s epitaph, you mean?
 Rumored to point to the location of the hidden ten tons of gold...
 ......So Kumasawa‐san tried to solve it too, I see.
 But this isn\'t the epitaph.
 ......It\'s the first time I\'ve seen it."
There was an arch above the Western‐style door, and that arch had a relief.
 It was an inscription in English, and that seemed to be the focus of the photograph.
The pen writing appeared to be a translation into Japanese.
".....................
 "This door will only open with a probability of 1/1,000,000,000,000,000.
 You will only be blessed with a probability of 1/1,000,000,000,000,000."
 .........I don\'t know it.
 Nothing like this ever showed up in the epitaph or Onee‐chan\'s diary."
"In Mom\'s belongings, there were quite a few photos and notebooks that looked like they were from her trying to solve the epitaph\'s riddle."
"Turns out she was actually surprisingly fond of that kind of thing.
 And there was that rumor that ten tons of gold bars were hidden somewhere.
 No wonder she was so besotted by it."
In both Maria onee‐chan\'s diary and in her grimoire, there was a description of the witch\'s epitaph.
It mentioned about how it was a ritual to open the door to the Golden Land, and {f:5:Beatrice}\'s resurrection ritual, and {f:5:Beatrice}\'s succession ceremony.
 And so on.
Maybe the most interesting one was the last line, the succession ceremony.
According to {f:5:Beatrice},
 if you were able to solve the witch\'s epitaph,
 you would receive not only the ten tons of gold and the Ushiromiya family inheritance,
 but her own magical power and name, as well as the title of Golden Witch.
Among the Ushiromiya family at the time, the witch\'s epitaph was thought of as a difficult quiz, which the head, Kinzo, had prepared to select his successor.
But in the Mariage Sorcière interpretation, the questioner was {f:5:Beatrice} herself,
 and she had posed the question in part to choose her successor.
......There were slight discrepancies in the details of the two interpretations.
Either way, its disturbing contents brought to mind a bloody serial murder,
 and both of the message bottles depicted a crime that followed that pattern.
If I could solve the witch\'s epitaph now, twelve years later, I wonder if I could expose some plot made back then......
I tried to solve it many times myself, but I never did have a clue what it meant.
{n}It seems that many Witch Hunters have been trying as well.
I also found theories like the La Plata theory and the Enoura theory in certain books.
However, none of these theories were conclusive......
"Are there any other materials?"
"I think so, but they were all split up between my siblings.
 I don\'t have a clue who has what.
 Sorry."
".........Just reading this English text that Kumasawa‐san took a picture of, it gives the impression that this was a forbidden door that was rarely opened."
"......But where in the mansion is it, I wonder.
 Judging by the lighting, it looks like it\'s outside.
 ......I wonder if Kumasawa‐san suspected that the gold was hidden in there."
"Who knows.
 In any case, it\'s probably {i:somewhere} in the Rokkenjima mansion.
 ......It\'s a pity, but there wasn\'t the kind of money in Mom\'s bank account to make me think she found the gold.
 Uhahahaha, she probably didn\'t find it after all."
......The Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}, gave ten tons of gold to Kinzo.
Which meant that the witch was the true owner of the gold.
{f:5:Beatrice} was the owner of all the vast fortune of the Ushiromiya family.
The witch holding this vast wealth had massacred the humans on Rokkenjima on that day,
 ...and sent large amounts of money to the surviving relatives like it was a game.
......Like hell it\'s a letter from the dead.
 This is desecration of the dead.
I was once again convinced.
 ......My family, who died on the island that day, didn\'t die and go to heaven.
They\'re being trapped by the witch even now, and are being desecrated and tormented for all eternity......
The last place Ange visited...
was a store in a region where residential and commercial areas intermingled, with a signboard saying "Marufuku Sleep Shop"......
There lived the man who had been the captain of the ferryboat to Rokkenjima at the time.
......Even he, who had once lived as a man of the sea, had retired after contracting a serious illness,
 and was now being taken care of at the house of his son and his son\'s wife...
"I remember you well...!
 You were only about yea high.
 Look at you now...!
 You must have been absolutely devastated.
 I understand how you feel, believe me...!"
The former boat captain was so full of energy that you couldn\'t really tell why he had retired in the first place.
His memory seemed clear too; he had a good memory of things that had happened more than a decade prior, and it seemed that he could even remember how Ange had been at the time.
The lively conversation was very helpful for Ange,
 ......but at the same time, the captain also remembered the final family conference very well,
 and the fact that he had detailed memories of even Battler\'s "gonna fall gonna fall uproar" on the boat was instead painful for Ange.
It had been so back then as well, but even now, there was no public way to cross to Rokkenjima.
It was necessary to make an individual request to an owner of a boat to make the voyage.
I still hadn\'t managed to arrange for a boat to Rokkenjima,
 so if he refused me, the voyage to Rokkenjima would probably become hopeless......
"No need to explain.
 It\'d be no easy job finding a boat willing to go to that island at this point.
 ......Nowadays, some of \'em don\'t even call it Rokkenjima any more, they call it by its old name, Akujikijima.
 Can\'t see you getting any sailor round here to help you out."
Originally, Rokkenjima had been feared as an island of disaster by the fishermen.
And when that incident happened twelve years ago, that fear reached its peak......
They respected the sea, feared it, and revered it.
 There were almost no sailors who would try to take a boat to the cursed island.
Because of that, most of the Witch Hunters were unable to cross over to Rokkenjima,
 and were limited to taking a trip around the island.
......Ironically, this caused the mystique surrounding Rokkenjima to increase even more,
 and resulted in the proliferation of the bizarre witch stories they loved so much...
".........Would you take me in your boat?"
"Mm.
 They\'re sposed to give her back to me just for tomorrow.
 I hear the engine\'s been acting up lately, though.
 We\'ll crank it up to full throttle!"
The former boat captain promised that tomorrow, he would go back to his previous job and take his boat out to Rokkenjima.
With this, I\'d managed to secure a method of transport to Rokkenjima.
{n}This is probably all I can do on Niijima.
All that\'s left is...tomorrow.
 On Rokkenjima, ......I\'ll reach the final destination of a journey that stretches back twelve years.
‘That\'s great news...
 You\'ll be able to go to the island now...’
"Yes.
 ......I\'d heard that it would be hard to find a boat, so the boat captain\'s cooperation really helped me out."
".........Although he may not have been as badly affected as you, Ange‐sama,
 I\'m sure that the incident twelve years ago has been a thorn for the boat captain as well, one that he still hasn\'t been able to pull out."
‘......Uryu.
 ......Even the captain wasn\'t able to find closure.
 This whole time.’
"Well, yeah.
 ......If that guy had taken his boat out on October 5th as promised, there\'s a chance that he could\'ve saved a great many people.
 If he hadn\'t been hesitant with his boat just because of a little wind..."
‘Uryu... You shouldn\'t say things like that...
 I\'m sure that\'s pained the captain constantly until today......’
I heard that it had truly been right in the middle of a typhoon on October 5th.
According to the boat captain, he had known for certain that they would be trapped by the typhoon if they headed to Rokkenjima on October 4th.
But the family had been very insistent upon that date, which had been determined beforehand as the date of the conference.
......It was only natural.
 All of the adults had their own packed schedules, and had come to the family conference having arranged those schedules in advance.
They probably had their own circumstances preventing them from easily pushing it back to next week just because the typhoon was approaching.
......It wasn\'t the boat captain\'s fault.
But perhaps you could say that he didn\'t feel so guiltless that he could place the blame wholly on the typhoon.
Certainly, just as these two said, there\'s no doubt that the boat captain has been dragging the events of twelve years ago along with him this whole time.
......And, by taking me, the last member of the Ushiromiya line, to the island,
 and bringing me back safely, he might be trying to find some resolution for the past...
"The boat\'s meant to be coming back just after noon.
 I\'ll take you to Rokkenjima after that, so we should get there before evening.
 It\'s an island without electricity or lights.
 You won\'t be able to stay long.
 ......Is a short trip like that gonna satisfy you?"
".....................
 It\'s not the kind of thing where staying longer will satisfy me more.
 I\'m grateful just to have you take me there."
"Mm, don\'t mention it.
 If I hadn\'t parted with my boat, I wouldn\'t have to be so stingy, and I\'d be able to take you to the island as much as you like..."
It\'s not like I have a goal of doing something in particular on Rokkenjima.
{n}So, the time of day I\'ll be staying there is evening...
......The evening, which straddles the two different worlds of day and night, seemed almost like a borderline between this world and the next—
or possibly, between 1998 and 1986—and felt like the most fitting time to visit Rokkenjima.
......It\'s not like I\'ll be doing anything on the island.
 Staying there for just a few hours will be just fine if I can feel some closure.
At that time, there was a small knock on the paper sliding door, and Amakusa stuck his head in, tapping his watch.
I nodded back and told him I\'d gotten hold of a boat for tomorrow.
"That\'s great.
 ......It\'s about time for us to go.
 We\'ll be counting on you tomorrow, Captain."
"You betcha!
 I know all about the troubles you\'ve had.
 I was watching the talk shows at the time, and I was disgusted by all the people stirring up that incident just for fun.
 I\'ll help you out any way I can."
"Thank you very much.
 ......Then we\'ll see you noon tomorrow.
 Umm, here.
 The fare for the boat."
Ange took a wrapped wad of ten‐thousand yen bills from her pocket.
The boat captain must have seen its thickness as well.
 But he paid it absolutely no interest, and shook his head.
"......I\'m grateful to you.
 This is guidance from heaven.
 I\'m being given a final chance to take you to Rokkenjima and bring you back safely."
"Now, I\'ll finally be able to finish the final job Kinzo‐san entrusted me with.
 So I\'m grateful to you.
 I got more than enough money from Kinzo‐san back then.
 Can\'t take it from you."
".....................Thank you very much."
"Watch your step on the stairs.
 They\'re a doozy."
......I went down the steep staircase that was the exact opposite of "accessible".
It was getting hard to believe that there had actually been a chest of drawers and a TV in the room upstairs.
Most of the first floor was a bedding store, with many futons piled up on each other.
The captain followed behind us as we weaved our way through the cramped futon shop.
After cautiously checking around outside, Amakusa dashed out first and started up the car.
"My grandkid\'s room is empty.
 I really wouldn\'t mind if you stayed there.
 As you can tell, I\'m up to my eyes in futons."
"Thanks a lot for the offer.
 ......But I can\'t cause you trouble if worst comes to worst."
".........Dunno your circumstances, but seems to me like you\'re caught up in a lot of trouble.
 There\'s rumors some shady people are on the lookout for someone.
 Wouldn\'t happen to be you, would it?"
".....................
 ......How should I know?"
Ange played dumb, but it looked as though the boat captain had guessed.
"My job was to take visitors to Rokkenjima over to the island, ......and bring them back again."
"......That job was interrupted twelve years ago, and it still hasn\'t been finished.
 So, thanks to you, I\'m finally gonna be able to finish that job."
"....................."
"So what I\'m saying is.
 .........Please let me finish the job.
 Do you understand?"
"..................
 ......Yes.
 It\'s not like I\'m going there to die."
But part of me does feel that, if I could die on that island, I would surely be able to go to where my family is......
I had finally become aware of it.
 ......I might have been planning......to die on that island.
I might have come all this way, heading for Rokkenjima, in search of a place to die.
The boat captain had guessed that as well.
{n}And so, for emphasis, he told me again: Don\'t.
".........I won\'t.
 I promise.
 .........In the first place,
 I\'m still unclear about why I even have to go to Rokkenjima, what the purpose is at all."
"No, I\'m sure there\'s gotta be one.
 If there isn\'t one for you, ...then there is one for {i:them}.
 The island called you.
 That\'s why you came here."
".........You might...be right.
 ...I might......have been called."
I was called.
 For what reason?
 For them.
{n}Mom.
 Dad.
 Battler onii‐chan.
{n}......And...Maria onee‐chan.
.........Or maybe, the Golden Witch.
 {f:5:Beatrice}.
What does Rokkenjima have for me?
{n}And what will I achieve?
Even though tomorrow was almost upon me at last, I still wasn\'t able to understand my own mission......
There was the sound of a car stopping in front of the store, and a short honk could be heard.
"Then I\'ll see you tomorrow.
 Have a nice evening."
"Mm."
I got past the stacks of futons in the narrow store, and was about to go outside.
{n}............Just then, my feet stopped.
"......What is it?"
"...........................Uh,
 ...............umm,
 what is that......?"
"Hmm?
 That?
 What?
 What are you talking about?"
Trembling all over, .........I pointed at it.
But no matter how much the boat captain squinted, he noticed absolutely nothing in that direction that should have surprised me.
......That means,
 ............th‐......that means............
"............Im‐impossible......
 ...Wh‐why............?"
‘U‐.........uryu.........
 ......Ange,
 ......why?
 What\'s going on......?!’
"......I, .........I don\'t have a clue either......
 There\'s no way something that ridiculous......
 Is this magic?
 A miracle......?"
".........Yes, this is probably fate.
 ......I just......understood.
 ............This......was my mission."
‘............Uryu...............’
"I.........don\'t have a clue what\'s........."
I was frozen in position, shaking, pointing into the semi‐darkness inside the store......
"Wh‐what is it?
 What\'s over there?!
 I don\'t, ...I don\'t understand...
 Wh‐what is it that you see...?!"
"Thank you, Captain.
 ......All of this, all of it,
 ......it was all fate.
 Even me visiting this place...
...was fate.
 ............This...
......is the mission...and the purpose...that I\'m going to Rokkenjima for........."
"............Ange‐san?
 What is it, is something wrong?"
"I, I\'m as clueless as you...!
 She\'s just gone still as a statue, pointing into the darkness...!"
"Ange‐san......?
 Are you alright?
 What can you see......?"
"Can\'t you two see it?
 That, right there.
 ......Can\'t you see it?!"
"All I can see is a normal display case.
 There\'s no one there, missy...?"
‘Uryu............Ange......
 ......I don\'t know what\'s going on......
 ......Is this......a dream?
 Magic......?
 What\'s happening......?
 ...............?
 ............Ange...............?’
Sakutarou lifted his face towards Ange......
From her eyes...
{Comment:Intentionally left out, doesn\'t work in English (......ぼろりと、):}
...slid a single tear.
".........Ange‐sama.................."
"......I understand.
 Onee‐chan.
 ......And...
............{f:5:Beatrice}."
‘.........Uryu.........’
So {i:this}............is magic.........".........A test......?"
"......M‐mm.
 Listen well..."
Once again, there was a call from Krauss to the guesthouse.
......And the message was......that Kinzo wanted to hold a test to see if the grandchildren had the qualifications to be the next head.
".........The head has said that his successor will not be one of us siblings,
 that he wants to......pick from you grandchildren..."
From Krauss\'s restrained style of speech, Jessica realized as his daughter that he was being forced to speak.
And she was forced into the realization that the hostages were being exposed to danger even now,
 and that if they refused this test, there was a possibility that the hostages would be harmed.
"S‐......so......
what should we do?"
"......M‐...mm.
 Hold on..."
Krauss held the receiver away from his ear, then looked at the grinning Kinzo on the other side of the bars.
Kinzo gave his next order.
"Before the test, those unrelated must be removed.
 .........Gohda and Kumasawa are there, I believe?
 It will be a problem if they interfere with the test.
 Banish them from the guesthouse."
".........Banish, ...you say......?"
"There should be a gardening storehouse in the rose garden.
 Lock Gohda and Kumasawa in there.
 Hmm, we\'ll begin from there.
 Tell them to do it immediately."
".........My weapons will be watching.
 Should they do anything questionable, I\'ll instantly stop the test and execute all of you as sacrifices!"
"......I, ......I understand......
 ......Hello, Jessica...
 Listen closely to what I\'m going to tell you......"
Krauss relayed to Jessica the orders to lock up Gohda and Kumasawa......
"......What kind of test are you planning?"
"Hmm?
 Aah, it truly is a simple test.
 I will simply have my grandchildren show me their resolve.
 Well now, I wonder what kind of results they\'ll show me.
 ......Hehehahahah."
With displeasure, Kyrie watched Krauss, who was talking with the children...
......It\'s regrettable, but for now we can\'t refuse orders.
In this dungeon, a feeble resistance won\'t amount to anything.
If we provoke him too much and drive him into a position where he might kill us,
 there will no longer be any way to stop this murderer.
......For now, the only choice left is to obey his rules without agitating him,
 all the while waiting for a chance......
However, if we continue to obediently follow his commands,
 the children might be attacked in this so‐called test, and they might even lose their lives.
.........Whether we feign obedience or try to resist, ......nothing will cause the situation to improve.
Anyway, keeping our eyes peeled so that we don\'t let a single chance escape until the very end...is the only resistance possible now.
......While telling herself this, Kyrie watched over Krauss as he delivered Kinzo\'s orders......
".........Kyrie‐san.
 Let us be patient......"
"I know.
 ......It\'s unfortunate, but all we can do right now is wait.
 If we can just do something about these bars, we\'ll be able to get back to the mansion......"
"......If only we could somehow get out of here...
 ......I‐I\'ll try something.
 ...............Kinzo‐san, I have a request."
"Hm, what is it, my friend?"
"We understand well that you want to test the children...
 ......It is fine for you to do things as you desire."
"Without your power, the Ushiromiya family might have collapsed long ago.
 We truly understand why you want to carefully select the person who will take charge.
 Besides, that is what the family conference is about.
 We won\'t get in your way..."
"Hmm.
 I am glad to have your understanding.
 That\'s right, this is the family conference.
 The final family conference, where I will select and finalize the next head.
 Fuhaha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!"
"So, the thing is, Kinzo‐san...
 ......It is far too cold here.
 We won\'t interfere with your test, so couldn\'t you take us to a slightly warmer place......?"
".................."
At Nanjo\'s words, the slight signs that Kinzo\'s mood had been improving were blown away.
A moment of silence struck Nanjo as Kinzo glared at him with dangerous eyes, as though evaluating him......
"......Certainly, this place is cold.
 It\'s tough on an old body.
 ......My lord.
 Wouldn\'t it be alright if we moved them upstairs......?"
"That is not happening!!
 I don\'t think so, Nanjoooooo...
 I know how truly elegantly you lay the foundations for future moves as you appear to give me a turn\'s breathing room.
 I\'m not falling for that, ohhhhhh noooo...
 If you insist you\'re freezing, then I will line the floor with red‐hot coals!!"
"M‐my apologies......"
{f:5:Virgilia} had tried to help out too, but in the end, Kinzo was having none of it...
"...............You two sure are obedient.
 ...If you felt like it, you could easily break these bars."
"..........................."
"......Even if we break these, nothing will come of it."
"True.
 ......If you were to break these, it would mean the end of {f:5:Goldsmith}\'s game.
 ......All of you, as well as those humans in the guesthouse, would immediately become sacrifices for Kinzo\'s ritual."
"......But, you know, you two might be the only ones.
 Who hold the power to break through this situation......right?"
".........You want to reach the Golden Land, don\'t you?
 You must have many dreams you want granted, right...?
 *chuckle*......"
".............................."
"Gaap.
 You mustn\'t provoke them.
 ......This is not your game.
 It is the Master\'s game, and Milady\'s."
".........What is it, Ronove?"
"Oh, no, nothing.
 ......We were chatting with the prisoners.
 Forgive us."
Gaap sent one final sneering smile at Kanon, then turned away.
Kanon could only bite his lower lip and shake his fists......
".....................
 ......Dammit........."
"......Well done......
 Good job holding it in......"
"We\'re powerless......
 Because we\'re furniture......"
"That\'s right, ......we\'re powerless.
 ......But there are times when furniture is needed, and even loved."
"......We\'re stored away in the basement right now, that\'s all.
 ......I\'m sure that one day, somebody will love us.
 Need us.
 ......So, for now, let\'s ignore their provocations and bear with it...
 ......Okay?"
"......Father.
 I\'ve ordered them to lock up Gohda and Kumasawa in the storehouse."
"Good.
 You may hang up now.
 ......Chiester Sisters.
 Observe the grandchildren as they lock Gohda and Kumasawa away.
 If they do anything suspicious, ......then in that moment, the selection test for my successor will be over."
When Kinzo made his order, the Chiester Sisters appeared behind him in a line.
"Understood, sir.
 ......I will scout.
 {ruby:Five‐five‐six:556} and 410, cover both flanks.
 45, wide‐area surveillance."
"00...
 556 is......"
"Ah, ............that\'s right.
 Sorry."
"She was a good kid......"
"......That\'s why I don\'t like them nyeh.
 ...Good people."
"What are you doing, Chiester Sisters?!
 Carry out my orders!"
"...............My apologies, sir.
 Then, let us go observe.
 ......Move out!"
The Chiester Sisters erased their forms simultaneously.
Nanjo and Kyrie witnessed the instants they appeared and disappeared as if by teleportation,
 but they interpreted this as if they had probably moved in and out of the darkness in a way that only looked like teleportation,
 and the two could do nothing but rub their eyes...
"......Well then.
 I shall begin preparing for the test.
 Ronove, Gaap.
 I\'m asking you to be the examiners.
 {f:5:Virgilia}, you watch these rats.
 .........After all, two of my furniture are here.
 Just in case, be on your guard."
He glanced sharply at Shannon and Kanon.
 Tightly closing her eyes, Shannon gave a silent bow, answering wordlessly that she would not cause any trouble......
"......Certainly.
 I\'ll be careful."
"Isn\'t this cold hard on your old body, Lia?
 Should I bring you a hot water bottle...?"
"Shut up.
 Hurry up and go.
 Gap."
"Pu ku ku ku...!
 Well, well, tests and examiners, what a strange experience we have this game.
 .........I do hope this development entertains Milady."
"......Come, arise, goat attendants."
{f:5:Virgilia} called out into the dark, and from that spot, three massive goat‐headed attendants slowly melted into vision.
"Ah, Riiche\'s minions.
 How useful.
 And they look so warm.
 I see, so this is instead of a hot water bottle.
 In that case, wouldn\'t sheep have been better than goats?"
"Shut up about it, you cashmere mop.
 ......They aren\'t very bright, but they faithfully follow orders and are quite dependable."
"Mm, I leave it to you.
 My friend, {f:5:Virgilia}.
 ......The rest of you, follow me."
Kinzo turned with a grand swish of his cloak.
Following him were Ronove and Gaap,
 ......as well as the three recently summoned goat attendants.
"......You three are supposed to wait here with me.
 Don\'t follow them."
The goats jumped in surprise and then came plodding back.
Kyrie, who had been watching in disbelief as all of this played out, couldn\'t help but snort.
"Heheh......
 What entertaining underlings."
"L‐Lord {f:5:Goldsmith} did not give you permission to speak freely."
...She was probably a little embarrassed.
{f:5:Virgilia} had spoken coldly, but Kyrie could see right through that, and for a little while, she couldn\'t restrain her muffled laughter.
However, on the inside, Kyrie was surprised at the number of people Kinzo had with him.
Because, including Kinzo himself, at least ten enemies had already been spotted...
......The dungeon they were currently locked in was supposedly underneath the hidden mansion called Kuwadorian.
Although this mansion\'s existence had been whispered of, not even Krauss had known it for a fact until today.
Were there actually several facilities like this on Rokkenjima, unknown to all but Kinzo,
 hiding untold numbers of henchmen that only Kinzo knew of...?
Just how many humans are on Rokkenjima, locked away by the typhoon...?
No, actually...
Are we the only ones under the impression that there are only 18 people on this island......?
As we bickered over whether {f:5:Beatrice} existed or not, and racked our brains over something as minor as a 19th person,
 were we on this island the perfect example of frogs in a well...?
No, wait, in fact...
 At this point, are there actually more people on the enemy\'s side than on ours...?
"............Just what the hell is going on......
 Witches? Demons? Magic?
 ......Am I supposed to believe in those?
 Are my eyes screwed up? Or is my head?
 ...I think I\'m losing it........."
A mass murder by magic.
{n}Demons forming and disappearing in thin air.
More importantly than the enemy\'s numbers,
 how should we interpret the various things thrust before our eyes that cannot be explained with the common sense of this world?
......Kyrie started to feel like she didn\'t know what was going on anymore,
 and while desperately battling the urge to abandon everything and give up, she clenched her teeth in an attempt to hold onto her sanity...
Obviously, Gohda and Kumasawa were quite unwilling to be locked in the rose garden shed.
......But they had been threatened that, if they resisted, the hostages\' safety could not be guaranteed...
It was fairly hard to get them to agree,
 but once the idea was raised that their safety might actually be guaranteed if the key to the gardening storehouse was to be handed to them through a cracked‐open window after they were shut inside,
 ......and it was suggested that blankets and food could be carried in for them, they were finally convinced.
".........This place is pretty chilly...
 I wonder how long we\'ll have to stay locked in here......"
"......In the worst case, it\'ll be until Monday morning, so a full day and night.
 ......I really feel bad about doing this to you two..."
George and Battler cleared a space on the floor, then spread the blankets there.
{n}They also left the canned food, crackers, and other light snacks they had brought.
"It\'ll be hard for you guys to go until Monday morning with just this...
 If only we could have stopped by the kitchen..."
"We were told not to go to any unnecessary places.
 ......They do apparently have us under surveillance, after all.
 .........Dammit."
"......I am honestly sorry that we cannot be of any use......
 And these are the times that we are truly supposed to be at your sides........."
"It can\'t be helped.
 ......More importantly, we\'re trusting you to take care of Kumasawa‐san.
 ...We don\'t know what\'s going to happen.
 When it comes down to it, I want you to do what you can to help her.
 And more than anything, I want you to be safe..."
"...Yes, I understand.
 ......Please, be careful, everyone.
 Right now, the Master is......taking human lives like they\'re pieces on a chessboard.
 ...Please be careful."
Gohda stared at the floor, remembering that atrocity in the dining hall, even now unable to believe what had happened,
 and he hung his head in shame at his inability to fully describe that terror.
"Thank you.
 .........Please make sure you stay on your guard.
 You too, Kumasawa‐san."
"......And you all please take care as well......
 I don\'t have any idea what\'s going on anymore......"
"Well then, ......we\'ll be off.
 Let\'s go, Battler‐kun. Jessica‐chan.
 ......Come on, Maria‐chan, you too."
"............Uu."
Looking at the painful expression on the faces of the pair to be imprisoned, it became hard to close the shutter.
But we can\'t disobey.
{n}......We\'re being watched.
We brought the shutter down and locked it.
{n}Then George headed to the small window on the side of the storehouse.
It was a small latticed window which could only be used for light and ventilation.
It looked like something from a jail, making the two of them seem even more pitiable,
 ......but on the other hand, it would protect them from Kinzo and his subordinates, or so one would hope...
He opened the window and called out.
"......Are you alright? You\'re not cold, are you?"
"We\'re alright.
 We\'ve been given all these blankets, after all.
 ......If we wrap ourselves up, we\'ll be just fine."
"I wish we could have brought them a kerosene stove or something......"
"......But it wouldn\'t have ventilation here.
 It\'s tough, but there\'s nothing we can do now.
 ......Hostages are being held against us.
 We can\'t disobey..."
".........Dammit...
 ......If we could just save Kyrie‐san and the rest somehow......"
"Shh.
 ......They might be able to hear you.
 .........Gohda‐san, here.
 The key to the shutter."
George threw the key in through the tiny window.
"......Thank you.
 I\'ll hold on to it."
Gohda took the key, and after showing it to Kumasawa, placed it in his own pocket.
There was only one key to the gardening shed\'s shutter.
{n}That was being held by those who were locked up inside it.
If the children had held onto it, then if it was stolen from them by some chance, that would risk exposing the lives of those in the shed to danger.
And even with the key, the shutter could not be opened from the inside.
 It satisfied Kinzo\'s demand.
However, there was now no longer any way to open the shed from the outside either.
 This would protect them.
Kinzo had ordered that they be confined, ......and we could do nothing but trust that this cold locked room would protect them.
Holding Maria\'s hand, Jessica watched George hand over the key, then looked over the thickets in the pitch‐black rose garden.
......Somewhere in this darkness, somebody was hiding, watching to see whether they obeyed orders or not.
Of course, merely pointing their flashlights out there did nothing to make any suspicious silhouettes appear.
But somebody was surely out there...hiding and watching.
They were hit many times with an urge to scream at them.
{n}......But they held that back through reason.
The four children left the area behind, repeatedly looking back over their shoulders.
The feeble light from the lightbulb in the gardening storehouse was seeping out slightly.
......Was it at all possible that this insane incident would somehow come to an end, ......so that they could see those two again?
......To George, who had closed the shutter himself,
 ...the resistance of the lock made it feel as though he had killed them with his own hands.
".........But even so......we can\'t disobey......"
"A {i:test}...?
 ......What the hell, old man......!
 Killing Mom, capturing Dad for that......
 I don\'t get it, I\'ll kill him...!"
"......It\'s alright, Jessica onee‐chan.
 There\'s nothing to be sad about......"
".........Maria......"
"The witch will be revived very soon.
 .........It won\'t be long before you can see her in the Golden Land.
 ...Kihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi............
 Ouch."
"Don\'t laugh at inappropriate times.
 ......Seriously, a resurrection ritual for a witch?
 He should just keep his fantasies to the inside of his head.
 Getting all these people involved...
 ........That\'s gonna cost you, ...bastard..."
".........Let\'s return to the guesthouse.
 ...It\'ll be bad if we aren\'t there when Grandfather calls."
Urged on by George, everyone began walking towards the guesthouse......
At that moment, Jessica spun around, and roared towards the darkness of the rose garden.
"..................HEY!!
 Someone\'s watching, right?!
 Tell the old man...!!
 Tell him I\'m gonna friggin\' kill him!!
 Let\'s go...!!"
Of course, there was no reply, only the howl of the wind and rain......
The children returned to the guesthouse...
{n}...In fear of what would be waiting for them when they got back.
After they departed,
 .........from the exact point in the darkness that Jessica had yelled at,
 two rabbit ears sprung up...
"......S‐sorsorsorryyyy...!
 They found me ouuuut...!!"
"It\'s \'cause you\'re too slow, 45, nye~h.
 Ni~hihihi~, Pendragon‐sama\'s going to scold youu~{p:0:♪}"
"I\'m sorry I\'m sorry, please don\'t tell Pendragon‐sama on meeeee!"
"Shut up be quiet.
 It was obviously just a bluff.
 ...Gohda and Kumasawa\'s imprisonment confirmed.
 Mission accomplished.
 Time to report back."
"Neener‐neener.
 Nihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi!
 Ouch."
"Do you want us all stuck on nothing but carrots and water because of collective responsibility?
 ......Let\'s go."
It certainly seemed to be a fact that they were being watched.
Because once they returned to the cousins\' room, turned the lights on, and lay down on their beds, the phone rang again.
Up until now, Jessica had been answering the phone, seeing as it was her house,
 but now it was George, as the eldest, who picked it up.
This time, Kyrie‐san was on the other end of the phone.
{n}George handed it to Battler out of consideration...
".........Hello.
 Kyrie‐san?
 Is everything alright over there...?!"
"Thanks for worrying.
 ...It\'s agreeable for now.
 .....................Sorry, I\'ve been ordered to refrain from speaking freely.
 Listen closely to what I\'m about to tell you."
The fact that they were hostages still hadn\'t changed.
{n}And Kinzo or one of his subordinates was probably listening to this conversation.
Battler restrained the urge to talk about other things, and focused on what Kyrie had to say.
"The tests will be given to Jessica‐chan, George‐kun, Battler‐kun,
 and Maria‐chan, in that order.
 .........You\'ll be called out in turn, so until then, do not leave the room.
 The person who is called out will head to their designated location, alone."
Battler repeated it out loud so that his cousins would also understand.
"......Jessica, Aniki, me, and Maria in that order, stay in the room until we\'re called, right.
 ......Got it...
 ......Maria too?
 Even a nine year old girl... What\'s that old fart going to force her to do, goddammit..."
"...............The future of the Ushiromiya family rests in all of your hands.
 ......Do your best."
"......Hm.
 ...............Sure."
Battler noticed the strange nuance in Kyrie\'s words.
{n}Even without any blood connection, he could still understand thanks to the long‐lasting bond they shared.
Now was not the time to worry about the future of the Ushiromiya family.
{n}......That wasn\'t the message that Kyrie wanted to send.
She probably meant "there is no way for us to escape from this dungeon, and we can only wait to be rescued.
 Our lives are in your hands".
......Something like that.
"Yeah, leave it to us.
 No idea what kind of test it is, but bring it on.
 I\'m not backing down from that challenge.
 .........It\'s a serious test, right?
 ...It\'s OK for us to...
...go all out?"
"......Yes.
 It\'s a serious test.
 He plans to {i:seriously} test you all."
"That\'s no good, no goddamn good at all.
 ......Some old fart on death\'s door thinks he can take me when I\'m serious?"
"Let\'s see him spew that shit from beyond the grave.
 He\'s there, so tell him this for me:
 The next head is me.
 And my first action will be to implant my fist into your face...!"
Even without Kyrie having to repeat it, Battler\'s powerful declaration of war reached Kinzo\'s ears...
"Fuhahahahahahahaha!!
 Battleeeeer, I will truly be looking forward to it!"
"I can\'t wait to see just what a man who once discarded the Ushiromiya name has attained,
 to just what state of mind he has ascended as he stands before me!!
 Tell him that...!"
Unfortunately, Kinzo\'s voice was not picked up by the receiver.
 So Kyrie spoke for him.
"He says he\'s more than up for the challenge.
 .....Alright, Battler‐kun.
 There\'s no need to hold back.
 .........You are Rudolf‐san\'s son."
"......No, you are my son.
 Show me something I won\'t be embarrassed to brag about.
 .........I entrust everything to you......"
"Roger that, Mom.
 .........Leave the rest to us...!"
".........All of us here have lost the right to inherit the position of head.
 ......Now we\'re just the same as pieces taken off the chessboard, looking on from the outside.
 So you\'ll have to fight by yourselves."
"...............Kyrie‐san........."
The nuance of those words was.........
"We\'ve already given up.
 ...You can forget about us."
......But.........for that very reason, I won\'t give up......
{n}I\'m going to wreck this test or whatever, and save everyone...!
"Well then, ......here are the instructions for the first test, Jessica‐chan\'s.
 ......Head to your own room, he says."
"Own room?"
"It seems he means Jessica\'s personal room in the mansion."
".........I\'ll hand it over to Jessica.
 Tell her directly.
 ......Jessica."
"He‐hello......
 ............Okay, ...I understand..."
"............Me first, huh...
 ......I\'m ready.
 Be right back!"
In actuality, Jessica was probably feeling the fear of a girl her age.
......But she buried those feelings and strengthened her resolve.
"Be careful, ......okay?"
"......We\'re being watched, right?
 We can\'t do anything.
 All we can do is exactly as we\'re told."
".........They say that old geezer killed those six in the dining hall in an instant, with no hesitation.
 ......It might be the same for us."
"I get it.
 ............I\'ll pay him back."
"Don\'t do anything reckless.
 .........If you think you\'re in any danger, you put yourself first.
 ......If Uncle Krauss finds out that his daughter sacrificed herself for him,
 there\'s no doubt it would tear his heart apart."
"It goes the other way too.
 .........If Mom and Dad were both killed, and I was the only one left,
 my heart would rip itself to pieces."
"..............................
 ......Battler‐kun.
 Is what you said earlier true......?"
"Yeah.
 ......Kyrie‐san and the others are already......prepared for what will happen."
"Then I\'m even more sure I\'m ready.
 ......Their lives rest on our shoulders.
 The hostages can\'t do anything while locked up.
 So it\'s up to us to do something about it."
".........If anything happens, run back to the guesthouse.
 At that time, we\'ll be done playing along with Grandfather\'s game."
"Aniki........."
"At that time, we will declare war.
 .........Wherever they\'re locked up, we\'ll save them, and we\'ll see that Grandfather gets what he deserves."
"......Are you sure, Aniki?
 ......Shannon‐chan\'s there too."
"........................
 ......That doesn\'t mean I\'ll sit around and wait for my fiancée to be killed.
 .........What scares me is not that Shannon might be killed by Grandfather."
"{i:I\'m just worried you guys will be first to find that doddering old bastard who gave my fiancée a taste of terror, and literally beat me to the punch}."
"Now I get it...
 ......Yeah, this really is a test to settle who the next head\'s gonna be."
"Yep.
 ......The first one to bury a fist into that old geezer\'s face is the successor."
George, Battler, and Jessica each forcefully nodded their heads and put their fists together.
Then Jessica headed off to her own room, as designated......
Her form disappeared into the darkness of the rose garden, which was shaking in the violent winds.
......As they saw her off, George and Battler hardened their trembling fists.....
Jessica\'s back was watched through the window by Maria, who had remained upstairs.
Her expression was blank......
"......I wonder why everyone is getting so upset.
 .........When {f:5:Beatrice} is revived, we can get her to bring everyone back to life."
Jessica\'s form had already been completely swallowed up by the darkness.
......At that time, the phone began to ring again.
Battler and George heard it and came clamoring back, but Maria picked up the receiver right away.
"...............Hello."
"M‐......Maria‐sama...?
 It\'s Shannon.
 ......Would you please hand the phone to George‐sama?"
This time, it was Shannon on the phone.
And the purpose of the message was to tell the next person, George, where he was to go......It goes without saying, but since the time she was born, ......Jessica was raised in this mansion.
The Western‐style house that the cousins simply called "the mansion" was her home.
And yet, she had never understood her cousins\' feelings as much as she did today.
......And at the same time, her own home, which she knew well, had never felt so different a place as it did now......
Her own.........room.
This had once been her personal hideaway, the only place in this vast mansion where she could feel at peace.
However, ......that door had never felt as intimidating as it did now.
".........A test, he says...?
 Tch, what the hell has he got waiting in there......
 He better not have ransacked my desk and stuff......"
She acted tough, trying to deceive herself.
{n}......Trying to make herself believe that she wasn\'t scared of anything.
She readied herself, and opened the door to her room.
"...................................."
......When she saw that, fortunately, the room didn\'t appear to have been messed with, she relaxed.
No one......was there.
 ......Of course.
{n}There was nowhere for anyone to hide here.
Right away, Jessica locked the door behind her.
{n}......Now the room was safe.
She peeked under the bed and in the closet, but of course, no one was hiding.
"......Wh‐......what the hell.
 ...Haha, ...haha...!"
She looked at the clock.
 ......Ten past eleven, or just a little past that.
As her tension lessened and fatigue came back to her entire body, she realized how messed up this whole day had been.
It was still only eleven.
......The plan had been for all the cousins to get together, have fun playing around, and talk animatedly about all kinds of things together into the night.
Normally, we would have been doing that kind of thing at this very moment.
{n}Why has that......turned into this......?
".........It\'s all that old bastard\'s fault......
 ......How could he do that...to Mom......
to everyone........."
Her head was swimming with anger and sadness......
 But there was no one here to direct those emotions at.
......Because of the lock, this room\'s security was guaranteed.
{n}Remembering that one more time, Jessica somehow regained her calm......
If it keeps up like this and nothing happens...
{n}Jessica thought that she would like to go to the dining hall and see her mother\'s last face.
......Even though Gohda had emphasized so strongly that it was gruesome and that she definitely shouldn\'t look at it,
 even so, she wanted to see her mother\'s face one final time...
But they had been warned repeatedly that doing anything stupid would put the hostages in danger.
......Could it be that locking the door was also against the rules......?
If I close myself up in here, I alone might be saved.
......But if I don\'t open it, it will surely be against the rules, and Dad, Kanon‐kun, Shannon, Auntie Kyrie, and Doctor Nanjo...
will be killed.
............There\'s no way the scales balance between five lives and my own one life.
Jessica tightly shut her eyes, resisting the other part of herself which said "Isn\'t it alright as long as {i:I} survive?",
 ......headed to the door, and made to unlock it.
......Just then.
Clap, clap, clap......
A crisp applause rang out, making Jessica\'s heart leap...
"If the door had remained locked, it might have been in violation of the rules, and harm could have come to the hostages.
 ......But even so, your own life might be saved."
"However, you resisted that temptation and were about to unlock the door yourself.
 That bravery of yours is worthy of admiration."
"Wh‐who..............."
I, the owner of this room,
 ......had searched to make sure there was nowhere any human could have been hiding...
 .........Where had this...man...
.........There was nowhere for a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} to hide,
 ......but could something that wasn\'t {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} have managed it.........?
I was pretty sure this was my first meeting with this largely built, middle‐aged man.
 ......I did not recognize this guy, who looked like a butler and bore the seal of the One‐winged Eagle.
"A pleasure to meet you, Jessica‐sama.
 .........I serve as head furniture for the Master, the 27th of the 72.
 I am called Ronove."
"......Rono...ue......?
 ............Genji...san............?"
"......Ah, yes, ...Genji is like my little brother.
 Or perhaps he was my true form in this world.
 ......Perhaps you could even say he was a vessel."
".........What\'s...this guy...saying.........?"
"Oh, my apologies.
 This is not something that can be explained to a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.
 .........Well then, let us move on to the main event."
"So this is that old crackpot\'s...
...test or whatever........."
"Correct.
 This is the test that the Master has granted you."
At Ronove\'s elegant gesture, like that of a butler ordering for the meal to be set out,
 many gold butterflies flew up out of nowhere......
"Gwah?!
 What the...hell......?!"
The swarm of gold butterflies spun around, forming a small swirl as they gathered in one place.
......Then, that golden mound disappeared like a pile of leaves blown away by a cold wintry wind,
 ......and there lay a Western envelope with the One‐winged Eagle crest done on it in gold leaf......
Ronove gestured to her to pick it up.
{n}Jessica timidly picked it up, and opened the letter inside......
".....................What is...this......?"
"It is an exceedingly simple test that looks for the qualifications for becoming the next head.
 ......Please attend to the question written there with the readiness of the next head who will bear responsibility for the Ushiromiya family,
 and tell me your answer, as well as the thoughts that led you to it."
"......Wh‐............what the...utter hell..............."
Shaking, Jessica looked back and forth between the paper and Ronove\'s face several times......
......At that time, George, who had been called out after Jessica, could be seen in the arbor of the rose garden.
He had been planning to give Shannon the ring that would be proof of their engagement...here, tonight, at this time...if things had gone normally.
...But the woman in front of George now was not Shannon.
"......Read it.
 That is {f:5:Goldsmith}\'s test for you."
".............................."
George picked up the Western envelope on the table where he had once drunk tea with Shannon,
 and read its contents......
Perhaps its message was short.
 After a single glance at it, George\'s eyes grew sharp.
"............What is this...
supposed to be?"
"Ehheheheheh.
 ......It\'s what it looks like.
 This is the test given to you, to find if you have the qualifications to be the successor to the head.
 ......Ask yourself what makes you qualified to be the successor, as you answer the question."
".........What a...stupid question."
"I agree.
 It really is a stupid question.
 .........In that case, isn\'t the Ushiromiya family headship something just as trivial in {f:5:Goldsmith}\'s eyes?
 ......Heheheh."
George lowered his eyes to the surface of the letter once again, and examined its contents......
George and Jessica.
 ......While the tests given to them were slightly different, they were almost exactly the same.
"......‘Among the three mentioned below.
 In order to gain two, sacrifice one.’"
"It\'s a simple three‐choice test.
 .........Decide for yourself which one you will choose not to save."
"If you refuse to choose, the test is suspended.
 I have been given permission to kill you right here by my own hands.
 .........If you would include even that as a choice, then there are four choices."
"It\'s been an awful long time since I\'ve gotten to play with a kid like you, so I can\'t say I\'d be disappointed."
".........Are these three choices only a test?
 Or will the choice be accompanied by its result?"
"Don\'t be naive.
 ......The one you choose will definitely lose their life."
"......................................."
{a:c:{e:070:Among the three mentioned below.
{n}In order to gain two, sacrifice one.
{n}{n}1. Your life
{n}2. Shannon\'s life
{n}3. Everyone else\'s lives
{n}{n}If you do not choose one, all of the above will be lost.}}
"...............Why is Shannon\'s name here?"
"The second choice has the name of the one most needed by that person, and most loved.
 ......I believe Kanon\'s name is written second on Jessica\'s test."
".........You gave this stupid question to Jessica too...?"
"*giggle*giggle*.
 ......What does Jessica matter?
 Right now, you are the one being tested."
"It really is a simple three‐choice test.
 Which can you throw away for the sake of the other two?
 ......Isn\'t that simple?
 If you still can\'t decide, would you like me to lend you a coin......?"
"......A coin?
 How would you choose between three options with something that only has two sides?"
"There\'s no one who would throw away their own life.
 ......So naturally only two options remain.
 Will you give up on everyone for the sake of the one you love?
 Or will you give up on the one person you love so that you can save as many people as possible?"
"Either way, you can fit it with an appropriate just cause.
 After all, this Rokkenjima is now a demon island.
 ......The sickly sweet buddy‐buddy pretense of the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} world is not necessary.
 No one will blame you.
 Do as your heart desires."
"......While asking yourself whether you possess the fitting qualifications to succeed the headship of the Ushiromiya family...
 No, make your decision as though you yourself {i:are} the Ushiromiya family head.
 Ehheheheheh......"
".........................................."
".........What.........the hell do you take me for............"
Jessica crumpled the letter up and threw it on the floor.
"I believe your anger is quite appropriate.
 ......I also find it an exceedingly pitiful, and truly ludicrous question.
 ......Pu ku ku ku."
"Like hell there\'s anyone who could wish for their own death.
 And...like hell there\'s anyone who could want to remain alive after abandoning the life of the person they l‐...love.
 ......And......like hell there\'s anyone who could massacre everyone else......as long as it\'s good for the two of them......!"
"No, Jessica‐sama.
 Such a person could exist."
"This is Rokkenjima, the demon island!
 It is now completely cut off from the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} world and dunked fully into the netherworld like cheese fondue.
 The values of the human world will be taken out with the trash."
"Pu ku ku!
 So please.
 Choose the things you desire from the bottom of your heart, in the order you desire them.
 Whatever remains will be your answer, and one most fitting for this insane night."
"Screw you!!
 How could I......choose any of these?!!"
"‘If you do not choose one, all of the above will be lost’...
also makes for a fine fourth choice.
 It may also be interesting if that one is chosen."
"But since choosing that will result in the loss of your own life in the end, I believe it would be more wise to do the honorable thing and select number one, "your life",
 so that the other two will be saved.
 ......All is entrusted to your decision, Jessica‐sama."
"Please, let me hear an answer and conviction fitting for the successor to the Ushiromiya family......!!
 I am sincerely hoping for a wonderful answer, fitting for the Master\'s descendant who shares his blood!!"
"Da‐......damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiittt......"
That scene was being observed through a magic crystal ball being held by Kinzo.
Kinzo finally couldn\'t hold it back; spreading his arms and facing the heavens, he began laughing in an explosive voice......
"Fuhahahahahahaha, waahha{0}hha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!
 Why do you hesitate, foolish grandchildren and descendants of mine!!"
"This is a simple problem that can be answered immediately!
 It should cause less vacillation than whether to put butter or jam on your morning toast!!
 ......Do you people know the correct answer?"
He turned and stared wide‐eyed at the Chiester Sisters, who had been faithfully standing in wait behind him.
"N‐no, no, my apologies, I don\'t know, Lord {f:5:Goldsmith}!"
"Fool, not choosing at all means GAME OVEE{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}EEER!!!
 You foolish rabbit, who cannot even choose a reason or a goal for her own life...!!"
"You have not the value of a single ant that anyone might step upon without even noticing!!
 Die! Be crushed!! Disappear faster than I can blink!!
 ......And what of you?"
"......I would sacrifice the first one, "my life", sir.
 Weapons exist to fight and die in battle.
 And weapons exist to destroy enemies and protect allies.
 If we can die protecting those we love, we can die satisfied, sir."
"Hoh.
 A truly splendid model answer for a weapon.
 The immediate reply is very nice.
 ......Have you been taught that you\'ll be given an extra carrot for answering that way?
 Heheheheh, that\'s not it, is it noowwwwww?
 Even that isn\'t it, is it noww{-}w{-}w{-}w{-}w{-}w{-}wwww...?"
"You are merely answering the way you have been told to answer, repeating the answer you have been indoctrinated with!!
 You are the same as that other rabbit a second ago.
 You still live without having chosen a purpose or a goal to live for...!!
 Filth whose life has no value...!
 It would fit you well to crush you down and use you as fodder for the other livestock!!"
"...............
 ...Yes sir!
 A‐animal fodder...would be an honor......!"
"I don\'t think sooooo!
 You don\'t want to see anyone else die anymore, doooo youuuu?
 Why can\'t you accept that?
 Accept that your old wounds are still festering and rotting deep, deep inside...!"
"Yes, the rotting stench almost makes the nose wrinkle, you foolish rotten rabbit!!
 These are words of praise for you!!"
".........Th‐thank you very much...sir......"
"Well then, what about you, the last one.
 Which of the three choices would you choose...?"
"Nihi.
 Number two without hesitation."
"Hoh...
 Number two.
 There are not many who could proudly choose to offer "the one you love" as a sacrifice.
 Tell me your reason."
"Because the one you love will be lost eventually.
 If you don\'t have anyone to love, you won\'t be hurt, and even then, you still might be able to love someone again someday.
 So,
 the person you love right now isn\'t worth that much at all nyeh.
 ......Nihi!"
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*.
 I see, so that is why you reach such an answer, you rabbit who has become cowardly because you have been hurt by love......
 I have heard that rabbits die of loneliness, but just when was it that your heart was killed...?"
"Then, rabbit, I shall alter the question.
 Why don\'t I change the second option to, not "the one you love", but "the memories of the one you loved"."
"......How is that?
 Can you still select that one?
 What\'s this about the one you love not being worth much at all, foolish rabbit...!"
"Filth who cannot even face up to the depths of her own love!!
 Try and choose it, try and choose to have the one you loved forgotten!!!!!!"
"You can, right?
 I\'ll bet you can, riiiiiiiight?
 Cooooome onnnnn, try saying that you caa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aaan!!!!"
"I, ...I, I can...
 I can...!!
 Nihi, .........nihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hiiihii......"
"L‐Lord {f:5:Goldsmith}...!
 Please, have mercy on her......!!"
"Hihiiihiii...
 ......Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinn...!!"
"That is enough, rabbit filth!!
 Go to {f:5:Virgilia} and help keep watch on the dungeon.
 Begone!!"
The Chiester Sisters, their old emotional wounds gouged,
 disappeared as though running away.
After that, even though there was no one left to hear him, Kinzo continued talking as though continuing a play...
"......And there you have it, my pleasant test.
 To be truthful, there is no choice that can be said to be correct."
"Whichever answer they choose, it is about whether they can choose...
without hesitation,
 quickly,
 and with a resolute conviction and their own strong, unshakable will!!"
"The reason and their willpower are more important.
 .........That is what I want to know about.
 Ahhh, descendants of mine, I am truly looking forward to what kind of answers you will show me!!"
"............Hmmmm?
 Me?
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*!
 Yes, of course I once had the same question thrust upon me.
 Because I splendidly answered that devil\'s question, I was able to claim gold, honor, and that witch herself as my own."
"Which answer did I chooooose?
 .........Do I really need to say it out loud?
 Wahha{0}hha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!!!"
"So.
 Have you decided on your answer......?"
"................................."
As Jessica stared at the crushed letter which lay on the floor,
 ......she hung her head in constant silence.
All that filled the room was the sound of the wind and the rain, and the rustling of treetops.
{n}Regardless of how noisy that was, it simply made the silence more apparent.
Ronove waited for Jessica\'s answer.
{n}......However, Jessica didn\'t speak.
Whether she was deep in thought, or had stopped thinking, Ronove couldn\'t tell.
......No, ...he might actually have known.
But, cruelly like a demon, ......Ronove urged Jessica to voice it.
".........If you cannot choose any,
 ......I can at least take your life painlessly, ...if you would like......?"
".................................
 .........ll m."
"......What?
 I\'m afraid I had trouble hearing.
 May I ask you to repeat......?"
Jessica lifted her face, ......and looked straight into Ronove\'s eyes.
......It seemed that she had decided on her answer.
"............Kill me."
Jessica said it one more time, ......clearly.
Perhaps Ronove had imagined from the very beginning that this would be the answer.
......Without any surprise, he smiled lightly and nodded.
"......I thought that you would choose that answer, Jessica‐sama.
 ......Now then, there is no right or wrong answer to this test.
 The important part is what thoughts led you to that answer."
"Come now.
 Please answer that with your readiness as the next head."
"............It\'s not like I chose the first one \'cause I wanted to die.
 ......The second one was letting Kanon‐kun die.
 That\'s obviously out of the question.
 So forget that one.
 ......The third one was everyone else\'s lives.
 That\'s also obviously out of the question.
 So forget that one.
 ......After that, only the first choice remained."
"Process of elimination, ......is it.
 So it was not something you chose proactively, you say......"
After chuckling slightly, Ronove dropped his gaze.
......A {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} couldn\'t even imagine what kind of answer a demon would have been hoping for.
......All she could understand was that this was apparently slightly below Ronove\'s expectations.
"......It\'s not a bad answer, but I must say, it\'s not a good one either.
 ......I suppose I would call it a 60.
 ......I\'m a little disappointed."
"You\'re a pretty selfish bastard, telling me to answer with self‐confidence and then being disappointed when I do."
".........Apparently it was not only process of elimination.
 ...Either way, it is a failing grade, ......but it seems that there is a little more to your thoughts.
 Allow me to ask."
"I don\'t want to die.
 ......So I didn\'t {i:want} to choose the first one—no one would.
 ......People struggle as much as life will let them, \'cause they want to live in happiness.
 So normally, the first choice should be impossible from the beginning."
".........However, you took that first choice.
 You chose to throw away your own life.
 Only that choice remained."
"I tried......thinking of the future that would come after choosing each one."
"......Hoh.
 And what did you find...?"
"First, .........I tried letting Kanon‐kun die.
 .........I tried to imagine the rest of my life after having abandoned the one I love."
"What kind of life was it...?"
"She was a horrible woman, who didn\'t deserve to live.
 A shabby woman who forever lamented her own decision, and lived only to regret.
 ......A horrible woman who would choose to live and abandon the person she loved... I could never forgive a woman like that.
 ......I\'d put an end to her myself."
"Heheh, how spirited.
 .........In that case, could you not also have considered the third choice?"
"......Yeah.
 I tried letting everyone but me and Kanon‐kun die.
 ......There\'s no way Kanon‐kun would like me if I did that."
"And it was no good for me either... Although I had Kanon‐kun, all the lives I abandoned for that became a cross that I had to bear for my entire life.
 ......And even Kanon‐kun was forced to bear that cross."
".........I\'m not going to make a foolish choice just to force a cross on Kanon‐kun.
 If there\'s a future me out there who would do something like that, .........she\'s unforgivable to me.
 ...I\'d put an end to that woman myself too."
Jessica had pictured it in her mind.
{n}The future her, beyond each of the three choices.
There were three Jessicas.
{n}......Of the three, two had regrets.
{n}Only one could hold her head high and smile at Kanon.
"......You know,
 I once had the nerve to preach something to Kanon‐kun.
 ......Something about trying to live life to the fullest."
"Live your life to the fullest.
 ......Meaningful words.
 That is a surprisingly difficult thing to do."
"So yeah.
 I\'ve got to hold my head high and show Kanon‐kun.
 .........Show him a way of living where you can hold your head high, and look anyone in the eye with a full and guiltless smile."
"......Will Kanon be able to receive your self‐sacrifice?
 Haven\'t you considered that your self‐centered decision might hurt him even more...?"
"That\'s why...I want to leave a message..."
"Hoh.
 ......I will listen, but I am after all a demon.
 ...I may not keep my promises..."
".........Keep it.
 Your promise."
Jessica spoke that looking quite unconcerned.
She had asked the demon who was about to take her life to pass on a message, and she wasn\'t thinking for a moment that she would be betrayed.
......At that extremely innocent smile, Ronove closed his eyes lightly, and shrugged his shoulders.
"Hmph......
 ......Very well.
 So?
 What shall I tell him...?"
‘......Tell Kanon‐kun...to live his life to the fullest.
 ......No, that\'s not quite it.
 Not his life...not {i:Kanon‐kun\'s} life.
 ......Even now I can\'t get him to tell me his real name,
 but tell him to live the real Kanon‐kun\'s life to the fullest.
 .........Tell him that.’
"...............Mi...lady......"
"......Jessica......
 ......You are unbelievable............"
"Ronove is fickle, so he might not have passed the message on.
 ......Aren\'t you lucky?
 To have me here showing you this scene."
A musty three‐sided mirror was set beyond the bars, ......and the scene with Jessica was reflected on it.
On the next mirror...the scene with George was reflected in the same way.
None of them questioned how a three‐sided mirror had appeared from a group of butterflies,
 or why Jessica and George were reflected on it.
......Because the reflected sights themselves were more important.
"............You are that prepared...
......to throw your life away,
 ......for his sake........."
".................................
 ......My......deepest apologies..."
Krauss looked at Kanon with a complicated expression that had an awkward smile mixed in.
{n}......Kanon couldn\'t meet his eyes.
"......{f:5:Virgilia}‐sama.
 ......There is no reason for Milady to lose her life.
 ......Please kill me.
 Please change it to the second choice.
 ......That way, everything should resolve itself."
"Hohhohohohohoho...
 I am not capable of granting that wish.
 ......After all, this is Jessica\'s own decision, which she chose."
Suddenly, the air split, and the Chiester Sisters appeared, flying into {f:5:Virgilia}\'s chest.
"{f:5:Virgilia}‐samaaaaaaaaaaaa!
 Hiieeehheiiiiih!!"
"So mean, so mean, Lord {f:5:Goldsmith} is so meeeeeaan, wahhhn{0}haaaan{0}haahaahhhn!"
"I\'m......doing the best I can......
 Crushing me for animal fodder...that\'s just too much.
 ......Uuuuuuuughhuhhuu!!"
Still without a clue what was going on, {f:5:Virgilia} was smothered by the sobbing Chiester Sisters.
"Th‐there, there. Everything\'s alright, it\'s alright. Don\'t cry, don\'t cry......
 I\'ll make you some delicious tea......"
"......I\'m leaving it up to all of you to guard this place.
 If they do anything suspicious, inform me immediately...!"
The goat attendants all looked at each other, and nodded their heads.
{f:5:Virgilia} took the Chiester Sisters and left.
The sound of people going up a set of stairs could be heard, so they had probably gone to an upper floor.
".........This is our chance.
 ......These goat‐heads seem to be stupid.
 ......I wonder if we can trick them..."
Kyrie realized that an opportunity had arrived, but she still hadn\'t thought of a way to break the metal bars......
The Jessica reflected on the three‐sided mirror closed her eyes, as though she had given up.
......The way she had both hands stuck into her pockets, wanting to be defiant until the very end, might have been her own kind of aesthetics.
"............That\'s all I want to say.
 .........Kill me."
"......Very well.
 ............Here we go, then.
 ......Do not worry, for I shall make your death more gentle and merciful than any sleep."
Ronove raised his palm......as he slowly approached Jessica......
"Dammiiiiiiiiiiittt!!
 Wrooggh!!
 Graaah!!"
Realizing that his daughter would be killed, Krauss repeatedly body‐slammed the metal bars, going half‐mad.
The goats looked like they were sneering at how a mere {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} didn\'t stand a chance at breaking those bars.
And, true, Krauss\'s pointless effort might have been comical.
......But Krauss was giving it everything he had.
 As Jessica\'s father, he was living in that moment with everything he had, so that he could save her.
.........Kanon made tight fists with both hands.
If he used his cursed power, he might be able to cut through even metal bars.
......But there were a full three goats.
 ...There was no way he could defeat three of them in an instant.
 It would instantly be reported, and then {f:5:Virgilia} and even the Chiester Sisters would dash in.
Though he may be able to break the bars, ......he could do nothing more.
{n}......It was useless.
......Kanon knew already that the witch was sneering at that kind of useless effort,
 ......so he could do nothing but stare at Krauss\'s repeated body‐slams...
"......Ah, ............George‐sama......"
Shannon, who had been looking at the three‐sided mirror, let out a voice.
...They looked to see that George, who had been silent this whole time, had raised his head.
{n}......It seemed that George had also decided on an answer...
"............Have you decided?
 Your answer?"
"Yeah.
 .........I\'ve decided."
"Is that an unwavering answer...?"
"Yeah. It\'s unwavering."
"Then let\'s hear it.
 .........Oh, by the way,
 it seems Jessica decided to take the "your life" option.
 I hope that an indecisive person like you won\'t simply say you chose the same answer......?"
"......Jessica gave her own answer.
 ......No matter which choice that was, it was Jessica\'s answer.
 It does not influence my answer in any way."
"I see.
 Then let me ask again.
 ............Among the three mentioned below.
 In order to gain two, sacrifice one."
"1. Your life.
 {nobr:2. Shannon\'s} life.
 {nobr:3. Everyone} else\'s lives.
 .........Which have you chosen?
 Could it be the first one, like Jessica?"
".........No."
"Oh......?"
Gaap looked a little surprised.
 ......Because she had thought that a timid‐looking man like this would never choose any other option.
".....................
 ......That\'s nice to hear.
 I\'m glad the most boring option for me has been removed.
 ......Then, it seems unlikely, but......is it the second?
 Can you abandon Shannon\'s life......?"
".........You must be joking.
 Why would I do that to the person I\'m going to give an engagement ring to tonight?"
"........................
 .........Now this is bold.
 Is that your answer......?"
".........Yes.
 ......My answer...
...is the third choice."
George had chosen.........the third choice.
{n}......“Everyone else\'s lives”.
Even Gaap hadn\'t been able to imagine that answer.
......She had been sure that he\'d choose number one, just like Jessica......
{n}So, she became interested in how he had reached that answer.
......How he had reached an answer that had defied the imagination of the 33rd ranked demon of the 72.
"I want you to tell me.
 .........Tell me the perspective that makes you able to sacrifice the lives of everyone else so that you and the fiancée you love will be safe.
 ......Process of elimination, like Jessica?"
"No.
 This is the clear and only choice for me."
"...............So it\'s "I\'m alright, Jack"?
 You can sacrifice the world for the woman you love...?"
"Just what are you talking about?"
"............What.........?"
George faced the demon as he spoke, looking at her almost in disbelief.
"......Tonight,
 I planned on calling Shannon to this very spot, and giving her this ring as proof of our engagement."
".........There probably are quite a few people who wouldn\'t celebrate an engagement between me and Shannon.
 I was prepared to make enemies of the entire family by announcing my engagement to her."
"I have been prepared.
 Since the time I came to this island, .........no, that\'s not it.
 .........Since the time I confessed to her that I wanted us to get engaged."
"............So, you can sacrifice everything else as long as you can get married......?"
"Marriage...
...means remaining an ally to your wife for your entire life.
 .........As of that moment,
 ......I was prepared to make the entire world my enemy for her sake."
Those words, through the three‐sided mirror, ......also reached Shannon\'s ears.
{n}And his determination reached her eyes.
......Shannon certainly had arranged with George that tonight, she would be given an engagement ring.
Then this incident had occurred, and she hadn\'t been able to receive the ring.
But now,
 .........even though it wasn\'t in the form of a ring,
 ......Shannon had received something even greater.
......And as proof of that,
 ......a single tear with the same sparkle as a diamond...
dripped down.
"Heh, ......heheheheheheh......!
 What a gutsy answer.
 .........Yes, if I really think about it, this was an easy decision for you."
"After all, your parents were already killed on the first twilight, right?
 By now, there\'s no one whose death would bother you.
 Hahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha, I see, this was an easy choice.
 Ahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha......"
"You can say whatever you want.
 This is my determination and my choice, ......personally, and as the next family head."
The sparkle in George\'s eyes was brilliant and sharp.
...For just an instant, Gaap felt the same sense of intimidation that Kinzo exuded, and was slightly overpowered.
".........I see.
 ......So, the same answer as {f:5:Goldsmith}......
 ......Despite your innocent face, ......you\'re going to become a terrible demon in the future.
 ......What do you know, we might get along pretty well."
"You will succeed {f:5:Goldsmith}.
 And maybe one day, I may even be summoned eventually and serve you.
 ......That might be surprisingly interesting.
 .........Heheh."
Gaap needed to change her opinion of George.
......This man bore a determination and resolve unimaginable from his outward appearance, and had not adopted that just now,
 ......but had possessed it since the very beginning.
"I am prepared to inherit the headship right away.
 .........No, that\'s not it.
 You told me to think as the head in this test.
 So I answered based on the premise that I am the head."
".........No, even that\'s not it.
 I thought as the head himself.
 ......Right now...I {i:am} the head of the Ushiromiya family."
".......................................
 Ehheheheheh......
 I\'m impressed... I didn\'t expect you to be able to say so much."
"It seems you really are one to be reckoned with.
 ......Battler\'s and Maria\'s tests haven\'t been done yet, but if you ask me, I think you should be the one to pass.
 ............But only if that is your true, unexaggerated answer, of course?"
"............Do you doubt my resolve?"
"Can you carry out the choice you chose?
 Can you, right now, with your own hands, offer all the lives that exist on this island as sacrifices......?
 With your own hands, I remind you...?"
"I can.
 I\'ve said several times that I have that resolve."
"Ha, ............hahahahahaha!
 Then return to the guesthouse right away, and kill Battler and Maria!
 When that is done, I will bring you the other hostages.
 Execute each of them except Shannon before her eyes!
 You can do it, right?!"
"{i:I can}.
 My resolve is on a whole different level from yours."
"...........................mngh.
 Then carry it out!
 Death for them all!
 Carry out this blood‐stained ritual as the new head of the Ushiromiya family...!!"
"......Understood.
 I\'ll carry it out.
 I am already the head of the Ushiromiya family."
"Yes, that\'s right!
 Stain that throne red by your own hands...!
 You will become king of the netherworld, ruler of all demons...!!"
Gaap was now sure.
{n}This man was truly fitting to succeed Kinzo\'s madness...!
"Rage on, storm! Cry out, thunder!!
 Celebrate the birth of the new demon king!!
 The island of demons has now welcomed a new ruler...!!"
In response to the demon\'s call, the tempest raged more and more.
Then a massive lightning bolt fell, its tearing thunder and brilliant light creating the feeling of just a moment of silence......
"So,
 ............about the order of the murders.
 I get to choose, right?"
"Please, as you wish, Your Majesty, the new demon king of Rokkenjima.
 As your heart desires...!"
".........Well, for lack of a better option...
the first one will be you, then—I hope that won\'t be a problem?"
"..............................Huh?"
A gust of wind blew, ......stirring up George\'s jacket as though it was a cloak.
It was very much like the cloak worn by the head.
{n}It definitely gave the same impression of grandeur......
......At that time, ......Gaap certainly saw the storm wiped away, and the sky covered with a pure‐white and vast full moon.
Bearing the full moon on his back,
 the man who called himself the new head...
sneered at the demon.
"Even the lives of the Ushiromiya family, all of them......are now my fortune.
 There will be reparations to be made for the damage that has been done to that fortune.
 It won\'t be cheap."
"......You didn\'t seriously think you could take the lives of my parents, Aunt Natsuhi, Uncle Rudolf, Auntie Rosa,
 and Genji‐san, and hope I\'d overlook it, right?"
"Ho...
......hohoh...
............you little wise guy......"
Ronove had been intending to press his palm against Jessica\'s chest and stop her heart.
But a short distance away, his hand had stopped......
......On the carpet at their feet,
 ......plop, plop...small red flowers bloomed one after another.
The seeds of those flowers...
...had fallen down from high, high above,
 .........all the way from Jessica\'s fist,
 ...held up as though to strike the heavens.
Ronove\'s nose was stained red with spurting blood,
 ......and those drops were dripping onto the carpet.
".........By the way, that just now was my answer as a maiden.
 ......My answer as the next head is different."
"Allow me to ask......"
"......The person I love, my family and my relatives, everyone, everyone!!
 I\'ll protect them.
 If I\'m the head, then that\'s my duty!"
"Dad wasn\'t just acting self‐important.
 He was protecting me and Mom!!
 ......Fighting the pressure of succeeding the Ushiromiya family......for several decades!!"
"So I know.
 ......Being the successor is nothing trivial.
 ......So you know what?
 This is easy as hell.
 ......It\'s easy as hell for me to risk my own life!!"
Jessica knew.
She knew that her father, in order to protect his family, was even now bluffing and fighting a solitary fight.
Jessica understood something that his back had been telling her!
Another left straight was buried into Ronove\'s face.
{n}......That mighty strike wasn\'t due just to the brass knuckles she was using.
It was a strike...
of a person, a family head, who could throw away everything in order to protect.
"If Dad\'s lost his qualifications to be the successor,
 then I, the next in line, will succeed the headship.
 ......Head of the Ushiromiya family, Ushiromiya Jessica!!
 I\'m not enough of a wimp to let you keep on doing whatever the fuck you want!!"
"............A wonderful answer.
 I shall change your score from earlier.
 Plus 10 for that answer.
 ......Plus 10 for that splendid left straight."
"Which means I only need plus 20 more for a perfect 100?"
Ronove backflipped away from her, and violently wiped away the blood pouring from his nose.
......It had become, not blood, but petals of a red rose.
The blood on his face was wiped off, ......and in its place...
was a grin from a great delight, which he had last felt so many centuries ago that he could no longer remember just how long it had been.
"Your resolve.
 I, Ronove, will test to see whether it is deserving of full marks......"
"Cram it, jackass!!
 Come at meeeeeeeeeeeee!!!"
"Come, to the Abyss...!"
"Wwagh?!"
Beneath George\'s feet, a pitch‐black pit suddenly opened its mouth wide.
{n}Of course, George had no way of resisting.
After being swallowed up by it, George fell out of a pitch‐black hole that had opened up in the ceiling of the arbor.
As George fell down,
 he was hit sharply in the gut, like a precision bee‐strike, by a reverse roundhouse kick from a stiletto heel...!
Launched out of the arbor, the instant George thought that he was about to be swallowed up by a rose bush...
...another pitch‐black hole opened there and swallowed George up.
And this time, a pitch‐black hole opened in front of Gaap at her feet, spitting a defenseless George out of it.
......By that time, Gaap had already finished the preparatory motions for the next reverse roundhouse kick.
"Ghh, ......what is......this..."
"Welcome back. *giggle*!"
Right side of the head.
 Below the right armpit.
 Side of the right knee.
As Gaap danced and spun like a small cyclone,
 she kept hitting him, {nobr:right foot} {nobr:left foot} {nobr:right foot} {nobr:left foot}, with successive roundhouse kicks.
The fourth one became a sweep, cutting George\'s feet out from under him and making him fall down,
 but of course, there was no floor there, but a pitch‐black hole, and George was swallowed up once again.
Gaap once again spun around like a small cyclone.
{n}George, likewise, was once again spat out from the ceiling of the arbor.
".........Take this and keep it as a memento, the single strike at the end of the Abyss.
 ......Die......!!"
The sharp strike of the queen bee pierced the heavens like a rising cyclone.
{n}It kicked through George\'s abdomen as he fell from the ceiling......
And then, ......time froze.
 George was pinned in midair by Gaap\'s raised leg......
"Gah, .........mmph........."
Still pinned in midair, George moaned......
Then Gaap, with George still hung up on her foot,
 ......grinned.
".........I\'ll admit it.
 Your attitude at least is mature.
 But that\'s no good if it doesn\'t come along with power."
"......Did you know?
 They say you need three kinds of power to rule this world.
 The first is influence.
 The second is wealth.
 Do you know what the last one is?"
"I read it in a book.
 ......Force, right......?"
"Correct.
 That is what you are lacking."
Gaap finally released George.
By kicking him upwards one more time, adding in another roundhouse kick and smashing him into a pillar.
"Ghh? ......Ung...uhhhgh......!"
"No one will fear a monarch without influence, without wealth, or without force."
"Kinzo possessed all three.
 That is why he reigned as a tyrant!
 ......If you\'re going to call yourself Kinzo\'s successor, try showing me some of his majesty!"
"......Come on, how long are you going to lie there?
 Stand up.
 If you don\'t, you\'ll {i:fall} again, see?"
"Pu ku ku ku.
 Not bad movements.
 But I feel they are somewhat unsuitable for a lady."
"Asshooooooooole!!
 Ducking and weaving and hopping around!!
 Aren\'t you gonna fight back......?! Quit jerking me around, you douche!!"
Ronove was dodging skillfully, jumping back, and avoiding Jessica\'s fists,
 but he still wasn\'t striking back himself.
Because of his agile movements, as swift as a flag whipping around in strong winds, Jessica\'s fist wasn\'t even able to touch him.
Amidst a feeling of her blood running hot, Jessica regained her offensive composure.
Even though this room was large for a bedroom, it was too small an area to keep up such exaggerated dodges for long.
......She calmly realized that, and started using not just her fists, but her legs as well.
"......Hoh.
 ......Doing boxing with just your arms makes you but half a man.
 Your arms must be the roaring lion, burning with power.
 And your legs the snake, cold as ice as it closes in on its prey."
"Snakes don\'t have legs!"
"Pu ku ku, very true."
Jessica began cornering Ronove towards the wall with perfect footwork.
 She wouldn\'t let him get around her.
......Ronove\'s magnificent dodges looked flashy, but they needed sufficient room.
Once cornered, he wouldn\'t be able to dodge anymore...!
Jessica had a good understanding of the special characteristics of her equipped weapon, the brass knuckles.
This powerful weapon\'s most notable characteristic was how it didn\'t let the opponent defend.
Even if they blocked with their arm, that arm would receive direct damage.
{n}......If it hit the wrong way, it might even break the bone.
So she pressed him forward.
 She would block off his escape routes, ......and then, with this fist, she would chip this demon down!!
"Whoops...!
 Oh my, when did...?"
"Looks like I\'ve finally cornered you, huh......?
 Where is everyone being held?
 Where\'s that old bastard hiding?
 You tell me everything, and I\'ll let you go with nothing more than ripping that mustache off, alright?"
"That would be a problem.
 Believe it or not, it does take me an hour every morning to set this, you see."
"If I put you in a plaster cast, I guess you won\'t even be able to do that!"
"............Oops‐a‐daisy.
 .....................gggh."
Ronove had blocked Jessica\'s lunged fist with his arm.
{n}He tried to act as though it was no big deal, but it must have hurt a lot.
......Jessica grinned.
{n}Ronove smiled the same way, but twitched slightly.
"......I see.
 This certainly does hurt."
"Final warning.
 Break down and apologize."
"That, I cannot do.
 It would ruin my image."
"Then just break.
 Flurry of puncheeeeeeeees!!!"
Jessica\'s iron fists were pounded into Ronove.
But Jessica was startled—the impact felt wrong, and there was the sound of breaking glass.
"Wh‐......?!"
At a glance, it looked like Ronove had caught Jessica\'s fist with his palm.
 ......That wasn\'t quite true.
When Ronove opened his hand, a faint purple glowing barrier like a glass shield appeared there,
 stopping the attack by a hair\'s breadth.
Pulling herself together, Jessica struck out with her fists again, but with truly magnificent movements, Ronove caught all of them......
"I am, after all, a demon.
 I am at least capable of this level of magic.
 .........I must say, though, you are quite good.
 If I were a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}, I am sure that this is where I would have admitted defeat.
 It is because I am a demon that I can still continue to fight."
"Y‐......you frigging cheater.........!"
"Is that all?
 ......Are you sure that by attacking all the time, you are not neglecting your own defense?"
"Huh?!"
"......Waaah!!"
Ronove pounded his palm into Jessica\'s stomach, stopping abruptly just a fraction away.
Jessica was repelled by the purple shield, tumbled backwards, and smashed her head on the bed.
"My shield cannot be broken by a mere {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.
 I suggest that you never again dream of being able to touch my body."
"......In that case, ......I\'ll just punch straight through that shield......!!"
"You are a dauntless person.
 That tenacity...yes, it is truly fitting for the next family head.
 ......Why don\'t I be your opponent for just a while longer.
 This is one of the privileges of an examiner.
 .........Pukku{0}ku{0}ku{0}ku{0}kuku!"
"SHATTER TO PIECEEEEEEEES, IIIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!"
Gaap looked down on George, sneering.
{n}He was lying face‐down in a puddle on the rose garden path.
The merciless rain beat down on him, so that it looked as though even the heavens were mocking him...
".........Ahhahahahahahaha.
 Stand up.
 You\'ll fall again."
"..........................."
George stood up shakily.
......It seemed his spirit hadn\'t given in, but the damage to his body was fairly significant.
"Beg for your life.
 What you\'re doing now is the same as the fourth choice of choosing nothing.
 ......You chose the third choice, right?
 If you get down on your hands and knees and apologize, I\'ll forgive your rudeness towards me."
"Then, I\'ll guide you down to the dungeon.
 There, for your beloved Shannon and your own powerless self, you will kill the other hostages one by one."
"......You can do it, right?
 You did boast about having that resolve.
 ......Heheheheheh."
George didn\'t answer.
{n}......But his gaze was still obstinately resisting surrender.
"......If you are too obstinate, then this time you really will fall to the deepest depths of the Abyss...
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*."
Gaap\'s strength was undeniable.
......There was no doubt that Shannon\'s group, watching through the three‐sided mirror, understood that—
probably even more clearly than George himself...
".........George‐sama......
 ......Please,
 ......that\'s enough.........
 ...You don\'t have to do this for someone like me......"
"Nee‐san......"
"......If you didn\'t fall in love with me,
 ......you wouldn\'t have to fight with anyone, right, George‐sama...?
 Then please, just abandon me......
 Please, forget me......"
There was no way for that voice to reach George.
......But, even so,
 ......George answered.
"No way.
 ............I won\'t...surrender."
"......Oh?
 Why......?"
"............Because that...is my...resolve.
 ......I\'ll fight everything for Shannon\'s sake.
 And I\'ll make everything accept us,
 ......and everything bless us."
"Hey, tell me something.
 How can you go so far for that furniture called Shannon?
 .........She\'s just a good‐for‐nothing, isn\'t she?
 Furniture for the garbage that doesn\'t even make for a satisfactory waitress."
"............I won\'t permit any more insults against the woman I love."
"So what are you going to do about it?
 How is a weak kiddo like you going to fight against me...?"
"Loving someone is strength.
 ......I was able to become strong because I learned that feeling.
 .........‘Shannon,
 I love you.’
 With just those words, I can stand back up, over and over again."
"Shannon\'s in the dungeon, you know?
 No good professing your love to me."
"No.
 She heard.
 ......Because that is love.
 Shannon can hear my words right now.
 The reason I can believe that...is because of love."
"..................This guy... ......"
‘Shannon.
 You are not furniture.
 ......Even if you were, you would be mine alone, the only furniture for me in the world.
 I want you to be close to me all my life.
 ......I need you...always and forever.’
".........G‐......George‐sama..............."
"......I\'m jealous.
 He\'s surpassed my husband in smooth talking."
"Th‐......this is youth."
"Ahhahahahahahahahahaha...!!
 Love is strength?
 Then why are you so weak, boy?
 It must mean your love is also that weak, then, I guess?"
"*snicker*snicker*!
 Your love for your fiancée is weak.
 Your parents\' disappointingly quick deaths were weak.
 Everything about your life is weak."
"...............Shannon taught me about love and strength.
 If you insist upon measuring my love for Shannon by my strength alone,
 ......then let me teach you about my love."
"*chuckle*, nice words.
 ......Nowww I get it.
 So you say that the way you can still stand up after being kicked down so many times is the strength you received from Shannon.
 In that case, what did you receive from your mother and father, who were killed without a fight?
 .........?"
Suddenly, there was a blackout.
 ......Outside?
".........N‐......no.
 .........Th‐...this is............"
The thing blocking Gaap\'s vision...
............was the bottom...
of George\'s...
...
shoe...
"............Side kick.
 Nasal bone fractured."
It had stopped right in front of the tip of Gaap\'s nose.
"The thing I got from Mother was this kick."
After several moments\' delay, Gaap jumped back.
 Of course, it was too late.
If George hadn\'t stopped, he probably would have caused exactly the damage he had announced.
"And what I got from Father...
...is patience."
Anger with a low boiling point isn\'t something to be truly feared.
{n}......True anger is cultivated through patience.
".........I understand your declaration of violent intent.
 ......I also understand your defamation of my fiancée and my parents.
 And you have no intention of retracting any of these......?"
"......Y‐you......"
"I have a sufficient understanding of your attacks now.
 ............If you\'re ready...may I fight back?"
"E‐enough of your slick talk, bucko......!!"
A pitch‐black hole opened its mouth at George\'s feet.
But George rapidly opened his legs, straddling the hole.
 The same move wouldn\'t work again...!
It was an extremely light dodge, and the upper part of his body didn\'t even quiver.
"Patience means not losing your cool, and instead composedly researching your opponent\'s moves.
 .........For what purpose?
 Isn\'t it obvious?
 Do you know?"
"N‐n‐no I don\'t......"
"It\'s to counter, to give back exactly what you got, to make them never want to mess with you again,
 to make them cover their face in tears and snot and forget to wipe it off,
 to make them want to rub their forehead on the ground and apologize over and over—to completely, perfectly, thoroughly...!!!
 ......Pulverize them until they can\'t get up."
George dashed.
Pits opened one after another, but George would not step in them again.
And because she persisted in that move, Gaap was captured for a second time...
".........Reverse roundhouse.
 Jaw fractured."
"...............!"
It was stretched out more forcefully and beautifully than Gaap\'s had been.
Of course, while it centered directly on Gaap\'s face, it stopped a hair\'s breadth away.
Perhaps she couldn\'t rely on pitfalls at this close range.
Gaap kicked at George\'s shins as a diversion,
 and in the instant of weakness when he tried to deal with that, she aimed a kick at his stomach.
It was a bee‐like stab by her stiletto heel.
......But it sliced through the air where George was no longer.
".........High axe kick.
 Collarbone fractured."
"............wh‐uh—"
From beside Gaap,
 George coldly announced that, his foot still raised.
If that monarch\'s heel had been swung down, a collarbone fracture would have been an understatement.
"This guy\'s...
......stronger than me...at close range......?!
 Need distance......"
She jumped backwards to gain a large distance.
She jumped and jumped and leapt and even backflipped, increasing the distance between them.
It should have been magnificent, but for some reason, it looked very similar to the movements of a small, scared animal.
If she opened the distance, she could fight at the range that was her specialty, using a mixture of pitfalls and kicking techniques...!
"You fool... Regret the arrogance of passing on three chances to defeat me, in the depths of the Abyss!!
 ..................Huh?"
Gaap landed beautifully and tried to aim a pitfall,
 when a razor‐sharp wind cut her bangs.
 ...Yes, cut them.
And twice.
 ......This time it didn\'t just stop a hair\'s breadth away, but scattered her bangs with its air pressure......
".........Armada com martelo.
 ......Orbital blowout fracture with the first strike.
 Cerebral contusion with the second strike."
"..................{m:-5:——}—...!!!"
Gaap was too shocked to speak.
George had closed all that distance in an instant, and let off a fearsomely nimble midair double kick.
......Furthermore, with the accuracy and edge of a razor, it had cut nothing more than a few of her bangs.
"I learned the power of kicks from karate,
 speed from tae kwon do,
 and freedom of range from capoeira."
"......Mother was always trying something new.
 But it was very educational being able to study their various merits."
"Wh‐......why don\'t you hit......?
 ......Because I\'m a woman?!!"
"......You spoke of force as a monarch\'s third power."
"It looks like you\'re still mistaking the meaning of that force.
 ......In this situation, force doesn\'t mean hastily wielded violence.
 .........It refers to a deterrent—the knowledge that if someone opposes the monarch, that person won\'t get away unharmed."
"A deterrent......?"
That was the point.
 That was why all of George\'s attacks up until then had stopped just before the blow.
These bare misses, which were more difficult than hitting directly, had all been performed so splendidly.
...And any one of them would probably have crushed Gaap in a single hit, if George had wished it.
He was—deliberately—not doing that.
"You said it yourself, right?
 Force is the power to rule.
 .........If you destroy your opponent with force, you won\'t be able to rule them, right?"
"A monarch\'s force is something that is only shown.
 He does not destroy.
 ......He makes others submit, and adds them to his own fortune.
 If you black out on me, I won\'t be able to make you guide me to where everyone is being held."
Gaap had to admit it.
She had to admit that George understood force in the truest sense...!
"You\'ll take me to where everyone is.
 I would advise against resisting.
 .........I won\'t hold back anymore."
"...khh...!!
 .........Sorry, Lia... Lemme borrow your troops.
 This guy\'s too much for me alone to handle!!"
As a large, pitch‐black hole opened in the sky,
 thunk, thunk, thunk—three muscular goat attendants fell out.
 They surrounded George.
".........Reinforcements?
 I wonder if I should take this to mean that you retract your statement about me being weak."
"I, ......I admit it.
 ......I made light of your power...the power of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s......"
"No.
 This is the strength of a man who has come to know love."
"Wh‐what tripe... How can you say stuff like that with a straight face?!!
 Come, goats!
 Crush this man into meatballs!"
"Heheheh, these goats are stupid, but it looks like they at least have power.
 I\'ll make it so that even your fiancée won\'t be able to recognize your corpse!"
"You refuse to surrender and intend to continue fighting. Understood.
 ......I proclaim that henceforth, you will receive real harm proportional to your own attacks."
"If you still plan on attacking me, I suggest you prepare to receive a great deal of damage."
When George proclaimed that,
 ......a faint red magic circle rose up around him.
But it seemed that George couldn\'t see it.
{n}However, Gaap, being a demon, could.
"M‐......magic?!
 Why does this guy have a defensive barrier...?!
 And what\'s more, it\'s......specialized for counterattacks...?!
 Is this......wh‐what you meant by a deterrent......?!"
From a demon\'s perspective, that might have been magic.
But in George\'s eyes, it was...determination.
It was absolute determination that would show no mercy to anyone who wished for further fighting,
 and force them to prepare for a significant counterattack.
 Absolute determination...becomes magic.
Ronove had been accurately blocking Jessica\'s fists with the shield.
 ......But something felt odd.
Even though he was certainly stopping the blows with the shield,
 he felt his arm beginning to strain and ache.
All physical damage should have been shut off.
......However, the damage from her fists was gradually being transmitted to his arm, and was accumulating.
Ronove acted like he was composed, so that this wouldn\'t be noticed...
"Heh, heheh...!!
 I\'m not gonna get worn out.
 What\'s wrong, old man?
 Starting to get a little tough...?!"
"......No matter how much you attack, it is useless.
 Why can\'t you understand that you cannot break my shield?"
"Saying that is not gonna stop me hitting you.
 ......No matter how hard someone\'s heart is, words are gonna get through to them a little bit each time, and eventually, you can make a crack...!
 I believe it!!
 I believe that there\'s no such thing as useless effort in this world!!"
"Isn\'t that why we live?! To the fullest!!
 If words get through eventually, then the same goes for fists...!!
 I don\'t even know the meaning of the words "give up"!!"
Those words were probably aimed at Kanon...
 Kanon had, technically, rejected Jessica\'s words.
 ......But Jessica knew that, no matter how obstinate his heart was, those words would eventually soak through.
And she believed that surely, the day would come when he would understand her heart, and stop calling himself furniture and disparaging himself,
 ......and step out into his new life.
So Jessica wouldn\'t give up.
 She wouldn\'t lose heart...!
"Sounds dumb as hell, huh?
 I\'ll bet it makes no sense to a guy like you, does it?
 See, a girl in love...doesn\'t even think about "giving up because it\'s useless"!!"
At that time, Ronove certainly saw.
{n}He saw the red‐hot burning glow of light surround Jessica\'s fists.
".........This is......problematic.
 ......Enchanted, are they?
 ...Permeation upgrade......that will be troublesome."
Within her relentless fists and determination...dwelled the power to succeed no matter what.
{n}From a demon\'s perspective, that was magic.
 Absolute determination...becomes magic.
"See?
 Nothing useless about it.
 ...My fists are making it through, aren\'t they?
 You\'re guarding your arm, old man."
"...............It seems I will have to get a little more serious.
 ...It appears it is as you said.
 ......In this world, nothing is useless."
"That\'s right...!
 If you give up saying something\'s useless, that\'s when your life is frigging over...!
 I\'ll get through to him.
 ......Definitely...!!"
I\'m an idiot, so this is the only way I can live,
 but even so, ......I believe that one day,
 I\'ll definitely be able to teach Kanon‐kun about a new world!!
So I\'m not gonna buckle in a place like this...!!
{n}I\'ll definitely defeat you,
 and save everyone!!
"Dammit!!
 If I could just...open a hole......aaaaaaaargghhh!!!"
Krauss was repeating his useless effort in trying to somehow open a hole between the metal bars.
......Useless.
 .........There\'s nothing useless.
{n}There\'s nothing...
The lookout goats had been swallowed up by those black pits and disappeared.
......Now was their do‐or‐die chance.
This was their only chance to break the bars......
"S‐stop it, it\'s impossible, Krauss‐san!
 We can\'t do anything about them with our bare hands!
 Let\'s look for a tool, don\'t waste time on the impossible...!"
"If you give up saying it\'s useless, then it\'s all over...that\'s what my daughter said.
 ......Even if it\'s impossible for my body, as long as a small person like Shannon or Kanon could make it through......!!"
"......At this stage, action is more important than racking our brains.
 Let\'s put our strength together, I\'ll join in too...!
 ......Kanon‐kun, you\'re a boy, lend a hand...!
 ......Kanon‐kun?!"
"............Krauss‐sama.
 Please stand back."
"What?
 What are you thinking of......?"
"......It\'s alright, isn\'t it, Nee‐san?
 .........If we try struggling...just one more time."
"............Yeah.
 ......I\'ll...struggle once more as well.
 ......No, not once.
 ...Over and over again."
Jessica\'s voice had reached Kanon.
{n}It had certainly permeated into his stone‐cold heart.
And George\'s voice had reached Shannon.
 If the love he had shown was embodied by strength, she would have to respond in the same way.
An incredible metallic sound rang out.
.........The first flash cut horizontally through several of the metal bars, and with the next flash, they were cut through horizontally again,
 causing them to clatter to the ground like bamboo shoots cut by a sword.
Krauss, Kyrie, and Nanjo didn\'t even have a clue about what had just happened......
"......Doctor Nanjo.
 Which way down the corridor goes to the mansion......?"
"Y‐.........yes!
 It\'s to the left at the back...to the left at the back......!"
"Let\'s go, everyone.
 ......We\'ll be noticed by {f:5:Virgilia}‐sama any time now."
"You two...
......what in the world {i:are} you......?"
"............We\'re......"
When Kanon hung his head a little and faltered, Shannon slapped his shoulder, smiled, and spoke.
"We are {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}."
"V‐{f:5:Virgilia}‐sama!!
 Response from warning network, jailbreak!
 The goat guards aren\'t there for some reason...!!"
"......Whaaat?! Why?!
 ...............It\'s Gaap, isn\'t it.
 Taking my summons without asking!!
 ......Gap!
 Gapgap!!"
"......Confirming Rules of Engagement.
 Request permission to fire at the escapees, ma\'am."
"Do it...!
 Kill them! {ruby:Grrrr:Kiiiiii}!!
 Gapgapgap,
 gab,
 gya!!!"
"Understood, ma\'am.
 45, 410, preparing for sniping pursuit combat.
 Ammo type: Guided cluster rounds.
 ......{f:5:Virgilia}‐sama, the escape prevention barrier."
"Owowowow......
 Y‐yes, right.
 Hohhoho, I won\'t let you escape from here.
 ......Owow, bit my tongue saying Gapgap..."
As they ran down the underground passage, the path in front of them was once again blocked by metal bars.
 The door was, of course, locked.
......However, that was no problem for them now.
"Kanon, more metal bars!
 We need you...!"
"Yes, Krauss‐sama...!"
"......That is incredible, though.
 ...I wonder if you could tell me what kind of principle it works on."
"I\'m not interested in principles.
 The only thing that\'s important is that he can sever the metal bars, and we can escape from here...!
 Don\'t get distracted, Kanon, just do it!"
"Leave it to me......!"
Kanon sliced the metal bars again with a red trail.
 But there was a harsh, strange noise, and only a slight scratch was left on the metal bars.
"G‐goodness,
 ......these are sturdy......"
"No.
 ......It\'s enchanted!
 It\'s {f:5:Virgilia}‐sama\'s magic lock."
"Can you cut through it?"
"Of course.
 But it will take time."
"I\'ll give you three minutes...!"
After taking a deep breath and focusing his concentration, Kanon once again extended his sword that trailed red.
When he pressed it hard against the metal bars, sparks sprayed, almost as though he was burning through them with a blowtorch.
"It looks like cutting it is possible, ......but it\'s going to make us work for it."
".........Krauss‐sama.
 We\'ve been locked on to by the enemy.
 Please move back."
"Huh?
 Pursuers?
 There\'s no one coming!"
"Please get behind me.
 They\'re aiming for us...!!"
"45, data received.
 Targets acquired. Correcting for terrain.
 Forming firing curve, control points adjusted.
 Data link to 410."
"410, data received.
 Checking danger zone, no problems."
"00, loading 48 sub‐rounds, individual homing F&F.
 Guided cluster rounds: ready."
"45, firing preparations complete.
 Guided cluster rounds: loaded."
"410, nihhihihihi!
 Firiiing!!"
A golden arrow that sparkled gold was fired, leaving a gold tail streaming behind.
{n}It drew a curve, went through the door, through the keyhole, down the stairs, towards the underground path at full speed......!
"S‐something shone!!"
"......You can\'t block the golden arrow with a shield.
 Kanon‐kun, prepare to intercept.
 Let\'s link."
"Gatekeeper, understood.
 .........It\'s been a long time since I\'ve fought alongside you, Nee‐san.
 Don\'t screw up."
"Yeah.
 I\'ll give it everything I\'ve got."
"Then we\'ll be fine!"
Kanon stopped cutting the bars, and stood in front of Shannon.
Behind him, Shannon closed her eyes, concentrating her mind, focusing deep, deep into the darkness of the underground path......
A guided cluster round is a special kind of arrow made up of 48 sub‐rounds bound together.
{n}It explodes mid‐flight and divides into 48 mini‐arrows.
The strength of each individual one is low, but they pierce through all shields and possess total lethality against ground troops.
And on top of that, each one of the 48 possesses autonomous guidance towards their individual targets.
".........It shone.
 ...It\'s divided..."
"Checking guided cluster round division.
 46...7...8, ...48 sub‐rounds, all locks acquired.
 Interception control. Data link to Kanon."
"Kanon, data received.
 ......Your ability is incredible, Nee‐san.
 I can {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} all 48."
"Observe the interception priority ordering.
 Trust your nee‐san."
"Of course.
 I don\'t even need to open my eyes."
"Commence interception."
"T‐targets unharmed!!
 I‐it was intercepted...!!"
"Nihyah?!
 All 48?!"
"Hoh‐hoh‐ho......
 Shannon and Kanon were originally a furniture pair, you see.
 They\'re strong when they\'re together.
 ...Owowow.
 ...I wonder if this is going to become a mouth ulcer..."
"Calm down, reload.
 ......Updating ammo type.
 Precision light‐speed sniper rounds.
 Prepare for precision sniping."
"Sounds good nyeh! Impossible to intercept super high‐speed rounds!
 Impossible to defend against for a mere Gatekeeper nyeh!"
"Precision sniping understood.
 Commencing collection of precision firing data........."
"Wh‐what in the world was that just now......?"
"Don\'t worry, I\'m as clueless as you...
 All I know is that we\'d be dead if we hadn\'t relied on those two..."
"Kanon‐kun, thanks.
 Go back to the metal bars.
 Next will probably come a shot that you can\'t intercept."
"How do we block against such an attack...?!"
"We don\'t let them shoot.
 ......Kanon‐kun, spirit particle combat, guard yourself."
At those words, Kanon closed his eyes tightly and clenched his teeth.
{n}......With Shannon at the center, a pressure and impact blasted out that could only be perceived by those not human.
"......Huh?!
 Firing system error!!
 No good, rebooting...
 Huh, huh?!"
"Spirit wave jamming! Spirit particle protection, move it!
 What are you doing, cover your ears, 45!!!"
An unseen, unheard impact blasted towards the Chiester Sisters.
00 and 410 crouched down, covering their ears...but 45 didn\'t make it in time.
......Still standing bolt upright, her eyes rolled inside her head.
"Ukyu...?!?!"
"...Kyuu? Kyuu!
 Kyuu
kyuu
kyu~!!!"
"45, damaged...!
 Her compiler engine\'s gone kaput...!!
 ......U...gya, ......the noise...is horrible for me too nyeh......"
"45,
 410,
 ......and 00,
 damaged...
 Abandoning sniping.
 ......Ack, it came straight through the link......
 H‐have to reboot..."
Raising their spirit particle sensitivity for precision sniping had backfired.
They had taken the full brunt of the spirit particle shock wave Shannon had released,
 and not only 45, who had been hit directly, but also 00 and 410, who had been linked with her, were taken down.
"Are you alright?!
 ......I\'ll make you some more delicious black tea later, okay? Hold together!"
"M‐......my apologies, ma\'am......
 We\'ll reboot.
 Please wait a few hundred seconds......"
All of the Chiester Sisters collapsed.
 They would probably get back up eventually, but it looked like it would be hard for them to return to the battle lines for a while.
"So, furniture was able to repel weapons, if for but a moment.
 .........I see, the plots which entertain that child truly are filled with unexpected turns!"
{f:5:Virgilia} tore the air with a large motion as though opening a door.
"Come, arise, goat attendants...!
 It\'s time for work.
 Kill and capture the escapees.
 Corpses are fine, we can just revive them anyway!"
A gold‐colored door opened in the air, and countless giant goats with muscular bodies peeked their faces out...
"Come now, hurry.
 There are five escapees, so the fastest five of you win!
 There will be a wonderful prize! Come on now, go for it, go for it!"
{f:5:Virgilia} clapped her hands, urging them on.
A prize?!
 After glancing at each other at those words, the goats rushed to the door at once, trying to get out,
 making the exit as tight a squeeze as the trains during the commuter rush.
Each wanted to get out first, so none of them could get out.
{n}......{f:5:Virgilia} held her head in frustration.
By that time, Kanon had managed to cut just enough bars to make a gap that could be slipped through.
It proved a bit of work for Krauss, large as he was, and Nanjo, whose waist was nearly his downfall, but even so, they all managed to make it through.
But their relief at getting through was short‐lived.
Immediately, another set of metal bars blocked the way in front of them.
"The security sure is tough.
 ......I bet they really didn\'t want the people in here to escape."
"Kanon, sorry, but I\'ll have to ask you again.
 ......I\'m sure it\'s tough on you, but please...!"
There was sweat on Kanon\'s forehead.
You could tell at a glance that cutting the metal bars, which had been made even more solid by magic, was exhausting him considerably.
"......Yes, leave it to me, Krauss‐sama."
"Only you can do it!
 Please, we\'re counting on you...!"
Only he...could do it.
 ......Holding tightly onto those words,
 Kanon concentrated his mind again and once more set himself to the task of cutting the bars.
".........Enemies are coming from behind. Multiple."
"Yes, this time, even we can tell.
 ......The ground\'s really shaking.
 I can tell that some terrible monsters are rushing at us."
"Don\'t worry.
 I\'ll seal the bars we just came through with a magic lock.
 Goats won\'t be able to break it."
Shannon held her hand out towards the bars they had come through.
......But she stopped right away.
"Wh‐what is it...?"
"{f:5:Virgilia}‐sama has started neutralizing the spirit wave jamming...
 It\'ll be bad if it\'s broken—we\'ll lose the initiative once the Chiester Sisters are rebooted...!"
"I\'ll make you pay in full for bullying these cute rabbits."
"If you\'re trying to gain the advantage with those crafty little spirit particles, I\'ll tear all that off and rob you of them."
"Nee‐san, concentrate on the spirit wave jamming!
 The gap in those bars is too narrow for those goats.
 It should hold them back for a while...!"
"I don\'t have a clue what you\'re saying, but—"
"We at least got the point that it\'s something pretty bad."
Kyrie picked up a metal bar that Kanon had just cut.
{n}Krauss had no weapon, but he rubbed his fist, and the two of them glared into the depths of the underground passage where the shaking was coming from.
"......I believe this set of bars is the final thing blocking the way."
"How far is it to the mansion from here?"
"Quite a walk...
 The path is even, but I seem to remember walking for thirty minutes......"
"So if we run flat out, it\'ll be half that time."
They couldn\'t tell for sure since they didn\'t have the three‐sided mirror,
 but there was no guarantee that George and Jessica could hold out against demon opponents for all that time.
"......If we run at twice walking speed, it\'ll be fifteen minutes.
 And running at twice that speed again would make it eight minutes."
"And if we sprint flat out at double that speed again, it won\'t even take five.
 No sweat."
"Wh‐what an unreasonable calculation...
 But calculations in dire emergencies do tend to be that way...!"
"......My sincere apologies, everyone.
 The rest will be up to you...!"
"Leave it to us.
 Kanon, you cut the bars as fast as you can.
 Shannon, you concentrate on jamming this witch called {f:5:Virgilia} or whatever.
 Kyrie‐san and I will defend against the pursuers...!"
Then, the roars of beasts rang out from the darkness, and numerous fiery, glowing, bright‐red eyes appeared.
The goats rushing towards them, with thunderous force, were several levels more massive than the guards had been.
The tremors they created were almost like an earthquake.
{n}The power and terror was tremendous, but Kyrie instead laughed with relief.
{n}......Those massive bodies wouldn\'t be able to go through the gap in the bars!
The group of goats crashed into the metal bars with a terrific sound like that of a train colliding with a dead end.
Clumps of dirt fell here and there from the ceiling, and you could tell that the metal bars had buckled inwards.
.....The force of their charge must have been no different from a train.
{n}If the metal bars hadn\'t been there, they would undoubtedly have swallowed the five of them up and crushed them in an instant.
When the group of goats, pressed up against the metal bars, realized that the five were right in front of them,
 they let out a terrible howl, trying to intimidate the five.
......Although it was hard to tell whether that was really intimidation, or because of the pain from being pushed and shoved.
One calm goat among them figured out that it just needed to do something about the metal bars,
 and grabbed two of them with its massive arms, and began bending them as though opening double doors.
Kyrie sharply jabbed her metal pole at that goat\'s vitals...!
 The goat let out a roar of anguish.
It probably hurt a lot, but that was all.
{n}It wasn\'t enough to bring it down...
"Krauss‐san...!!"
"Rrroooaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!"
Still holding the stuck‐in metal pole, Kyrie relinquished the opposite tip to Krauss.
Krauss ran there with all his might, leapt into the air and kicked it in with all his weight and kicking power combined...!
All of that destructive power was focused on that single pole, drilling it in!!
"......A‐are you alright?
 Please don\'t rub the affected area.
 I shall prescribe some medicine later. Take care..."
As the goat who had taken a pile bunker to its vitals writhed with teary eyes,
 it nodded its head.
"Looks like our link isn\'t that bad either.
 We can\'t let Shannon‐chan and Kanon‐kun beat us."
"Naturally. We are a loving family, after all."
"We can take them if it\'s two‐on‐one!
 Next, that one on the right!"
"Roger...!
 You seem like a great wife. That Rudolf, I\'m starting to think he grumbled a little too much."
"Oh? You\'ll have to tell me about that later.
 Rudolf‐san, it\'s no use you turning white in heaven, it\'s too late for excuses."
The goat\'s massive body sank into the rose bush.
 Even taking into account that a leg\'s power is three times that of an arm\'s, this strength surpassed common sense.
That massive body, flying up and through the air from being kicked in the chin...it was too epic!
Even George seemed a little surprised.
"......To think that my kick works on monsters too.
 I\'m astonished."
"...............It\'s because of your counterattacking‐type barrier.
 ......The attack power that grazes you is added on to your own.
 ......The superhuman power of those monsters has been added to your kicks..."
"Hmm......
 ...I don\'t really get it, but isn\'t that just perfect for me?
 ......If you\'re going to attack me, then no matter who you are, you should be prepared for a counterattack of equal measure.
 Nonaggressive defense.
 That\'s exactly my policy."
That\'s why Gaap couldn\'t easily touch him.
The counterattacking‐type barrier had no defensive power.
 However, because of its counterattacking characteristic, it could be useful in defense by making the opponent hesitate to attack.
The goats were foolish, so they attacked without worrying,
 but the effect was being realized to the full against Gaap.
"These guys really are dull.
 When your power is even, it\'s better to be of a smaller build."
He lightly dodged the log‐like arm.
When that arm touched the barrier that protected George, it let off a strong, red light.
......And the tip of the foot that was counterattacking gained the same shine, and the superhuman power of the goat was added to George\'s own.
The second goat fell forwards and floated in the air for a second.
{n}Then, George\'s next roundhouse kick missed right over the falling goat\'s head.
......For an instant, the goat hoped to get away with its life.
But no!!
 A heel was dropped onto the back of its head, and it was forced to kiss the ground.
"......Going from a high roundhouse kick into a neri chagi is pretty basic, right?
 It connects pretty often if you don\'t overuse it."
"This guy\'s......a problem,
 ...seriously a problem......!!"
"Demons? Witches? Get real.
 .........The rulers of Rokkenjima are this Ushiromiya family.
 I will teach that to you with every ounce of strength in my body."
".........Yoooouuuu.........!!"
The only way to finish off George now that his body was wrapped up in the counterattacking‐type barrier...was to not allow him a counterattack.
......Next time she sucked him into the Abyss, she would have to kick and drop him, kick and drop him, kick and drop him,
 until she kicked him to death!!!
But George had already perfected reading the faint warning signs that told of the appearance of Gaap\'s pitfalls.
......If he managed to jump over that next pit,
 ......then this time, he would probably pulverize Gaap\'s head with his whirlwind‐like kick, without holding back in the slightest,
 ......just as had been done to his parents.
She was able to envision that scene vividly.
It was far too late now, but Gaap cursed Kinzo all the same for calling her out to this ridiculous island...!
Ronove finally started using both of his hands to form his shield.
Without a more powerful shield, he wouldn\'t be able to completely block Jessica\'s fists anymore.
The enchantment on Jessica\'s fists grew the more she fought.
The permeation upgrade had already stacked several times,
 and those fists had also been given an impact upgrade, a piercing upgrade, and a speed upgrade, making them fists worthy to fight on par with a demon...
".........What\'s wrong?!
 Starting to get tired?!
 You\'re getting all slow!!"
"No.
 Your movements, thoughts, and kinetic vision have been exponentially enchanted.
 .........My movements have not changed from the beginning.
 ......Your movements are beginning to capture me."
"And you still won\'t fight back...?!!"
"This is the style which I insist upon.
 ......However, I cannot allow things to continue as they are.
 It\'s about time for me to get serious and end this......!!"
Ronove\'s face turned into an expression he had never shown before.
{n}It was truly demonic, and to Jessica\'s eyes, full of respect.
Because it was an expression only shown to enemies strong enough to make him get serious.
"Whooaa?!?!
 What the heck?!"
With a whole‐body gesture that you couldn\'t call elegant, Ronove set up a shield with all his strength, the size and thickness of a wall.
Its sturdiness was nothing like a shield.
 It was literally a wall.
And on top of that, with all of Ronove\'s magical power, it pushed Jessica back bit by bit.
......Did he plan on pushing her back against the wall and crushing her to death?
Jessica tried to break through the wall with both fists, but it was solid.
 ......Without any exaggeration, it was solid!
"You call this serious...?!!
 No problem... I\'ll break right through iiiii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}iiitt!!"
"I will not let you this time.
 This wall is somewhat different.
 ......Here, allow me to enchant it as well."
Ronove made magic signs with his fingers almost like a ninja;
 the wall glowed red for just an instant, and became imbued with some kind of ominous power.
Almost immediately, Jessica also gained a firsthand understanding of this.
Every time she pounded her fists against the wall, pain rebounded upon her as though glass fragments had scattered and hit all over her body.
"I upgraded it with attack‐reactive armor.
 An exceptional item which will decrease the force of your attacks by counterbalancing them,
 and can even counterattack with reactive fragments."
"......You are perfectly welcome to keep punching it, but doing so will affect you as well."
"Heh, ...heheh!!
 So it\'s an endurance test between me and your wall?!!
 Fine by me!!"
"Will you fall to your knees first, or be pushed into the wall first?
 ......Allow me to observe."
"Or, I might break through it and smash that whole wall along with your face, ever think about that?!
 Just watch meeeeeeeeeee!!"
Without hesitation, Jessica slammed both fists into the wall.
{n}Each time she did, a large amount of shards scattered, tormenting her body all over.
Countless red cuts soon appeared all over her body...
She grimaced at the intense pain, but her eyes were burning with fighting spirit, and her lips curved in a grin exactly the opposite of the pain...!
"Kanon, are you done yet?!
 We are alright,
 ......but I can\'t say the same for the bars holding those guys in check...!"
"Just......a little more......!"
"There\'s no end to these guys...
 The bars might break just from them shoving each other!"
The metal bars creaked under the strain of the group of goats.
{n}Several arms grabbed the bars, twisting them with superhuman strength.
......However, some bars were being pulled in opposite directions by different hands.
 Apparently they really were stupid.
The way those countless hands were grabbing the metal bars......happened to match up by chance.
Several hands grasping two metal bars neatly put their power together and pulled the bars to the left and right, creating an opening.
The incredible sound of metal bending could be heard, and that gap was getting larger bit by bit...!
They attacked the arms of those goats one by one, but they weren\'t getting anywhere.
{n}They couldn\'t stop the gap from expanding left and right...!
A loud metallic sound came from behind them.
{n}Kanon had finally finished cutting.
"Quickly!!"
"Kyrie‐san, ladies first.
 You next, Doctor Nanjo!"
"Krauss‐sama, please leave this place to me...!
 Ngh, ......what?!"
Kanon\'s red sword, with which he had cut the metal bars, disappeared.
"......Sorry!
 We\'ve entered {f:5:Virgilia}‐sama\'s spirit particle combat area of influence!!
 Our magic power is being neutralized!"
"Hoh‐hoh‐ho.
 I am impressed that you put up such a fight against a Great Witch like me...
 You can no longer use your magic in that underground passage."
A magic circle column drew complex magical formulae around {f:5:Virgilia}.
......With such full‐fledged magic being used, Shannon\'s power couldn\'t even compete.
On the contrary, it was surprising that she had withstood as much as she had.
"Spirit particle superiority ensured.
 Come, Chiester Sisters. Now it\'s your turn."
"Wait, are you still rebooting?!
 Why are kids so bad at waking up these days...?!"
"M‐my apologies, ma\'am...!!
 We\'re all different versions..."
"Why is it that the shortcuts and pulldown menus get all screwed up every time you change versions nyeh...!
 Did not shut down successfully last time?
 Administrator privileges??
 What is all this nonsense!!"
"Ukyu~~!!
 Ukyu~~!!
 (Fix me quickly~!! Waaaah!)"
"Calling Imperial Guards troubleshooting!
 What?
 You won\'t tell us without a user code?!"
"45 is in control of the user code nyeh."
"Ukyuu!!
 U,
 kyu,
 kyu,
 kyo,
 ukyu,
 kyuu!!!"
"A‐all I can hear is {ruby:kyuu‐kyuu‐kyuu‐kyuu:9999}......
 Have her write it on some paper."
"Her language support system hasn\'t come back up, so she can\'t even write nyeh."
"...........................
 Y‐you take your time fixing yourselves...
 I\'ll go myself..."
""Sorryyyyyyyyy~!!""
The narrow underground passage was packed with goats, truly like a commuter train in the morning.
{f:5:Virgilia} was again in disbelief at this congestion.
"What are you doing...?!!"
"Huh?
 You want to be first because you want the prize?
 You\'re getting in each other\'s way because you don\'t want the others to steal the prize from you?"
"You stupid goooooooooooooaaaaaaats!!!
 I\'m going myself, so open the way!!"
"What?!
 You don\'t want to?!
 {f:5:Virgilia}‐sama is trying to steal the prize?!"
"Why are you forming a scrum?!!"
"Aaah, it\'s so crammed and tight!!
 When did this become a goats‐only car?!
 Ugyu~~!!
 Whoever just touched my butt, get off at the next statioo~~n!!!"
".........Hm? What do you want?
 Come this way, you say??"
The five people in Krauss\'s group dashed through the passageway with all their strength!
{n}They couldn\'t afford to dawdle around underground.
They had to quickly join up with the children on the surface!
{n}Once everyone was together, there would no longer be anything to fear!
Just then, a terrible rumble started closing in from behind.
{n}Had the pursuers finally made it through the metal bars?!
But they couldn\'t see anyone when they turned around.
But that rumble and the dirt falling here and there from the ceiling grew closer and closer,
 finally catching up with them and even going past them.
It felt almost like they had been passed by ghosts.
The instant after they thought that nothing had happened, the ceiling in front of them fell in, and a single goat stood in their path.
......{f:5:Virgilia} was sitting on its shoulder.
"This wise child knew a shortcut.
 What a good kid, you get first prize.
 Later, I\'ll treat you to some homemade mackerel curry."
Maybe it really was happy even to receive such a dubious prize.
 The massive goat showed its joy by putting its hands together and wiggling.
{f:5:Virgilia} leapt down, laughing that now it was finally checkmate.
"......Damn...... It\'s no good...
 ......Our magic has been completely killed..."
"...It\'s too early to give up...
 ......Even without magic, we still have our bodies..."
"D‐don\'t be ridiculous...!
 There\'s no way you could fight a monster like that without that strange power...!"
"......S‐stay back, children..."
"I\'ll handle them somehow, so you escape past that monster while I\'m keeping him busy...!"
"I won\'t let you.
 Hohhohohohohoho!"
{f:5:Virgilia} clapped her hands, and a purple magic barrier appeared behind her,
 stealing even the faint hope that Krauss had been betting on.
"Is there...nothing more to be done......?
 ...N‐no, there\'s still a chance.
 ......Even Jessica fought.
 I must do the same..."
"A‐are you serious?!
 It\'s not possible, not against that massive monster...!"
"Don\'t be absurd...!
 Krauss‐san, let us think of another way......"
"If you think of something, I\'m open to suggestions.
 Until then, it looks like I\'ll have to manage something...
 ......Come on, get back."
"......Be careful."
"Hohohoho...hohhohohohohohohoho!
 My, my, Krauss.
 You intend to fight this child alone?"
"........................khh...
 Y‐you never know.
 In a fight, it\'s always possible to get in a lucky shot..."
"Hohhohohoho.
 You think you can win even with a fluke...?
 Allow me to explain the situation for you, since you clearly don\'t know your place."
"Whaat......?"
"Hohohoho...
 Assuming you were to wield 100% of your strength, your power level is at most 6.
 In comparison, this child has a power level of 1000.
 In short, even if there were 100 of you, you could never win."
"Well, it\'s true that there are uncertain elements in a fight.
 I will admit that your power level has a slight scaling factor to it."
"But even so, your chances of defeating him are around perhaps 0.00001%.
 Do you understand?
 You don\'t even have a one in ten thousand chance of victory.
 Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho...!"
{f:5:Virgilia} and the goat guffawed together.
"D‐...damn it......
 If it\'s a one in ten thousand chance, then the payoff will be ten thousand times more, will it not?
 ......A good dark horse.
 I like betting tickets like that, makes me want to buy them..."
"Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho!
 But the coin to buy that is your life, and there\'s only one of those, you know.
 Nevertheless, I can understand the feeling of wanting to entrust your fate to that miracle."
"......Which is why, in praise of your courage for standing against us without fear, I shall give you a bit of a handicap.
 This child will fight with only his left arm.
 Well, even so, I can\'t imagine for a moment that he\'ll lose to you."
"............Seriously, what is that thing that keeps going bing‐bong‐bing‐bong?"
"V‐......very well.
 I\'ll accept that challenge......
 Left arm or whatever else, I\'m sure I\'d be killed with a single strike in any case.
 ......I also only have a single chance at a strike.
 I can only bet everything on that."
"That\'s absurd, Krauss‐san...!
 I, I know that you used to do boxing, but I believe that was from your college days...
 No, no, even if there were a pro boxer here, there\'s no way he could defeat a monster like that with just one strike...!"
"......That would be true if it were a match in the ring.
 But Krauss nii‐san does have an admittedly small chance that he can set his hopes on.
 ......He\'s setting all his hopes on that one chance..."
"Y‐you aren\'t saying......
 But...there\'s no way that\'s going to work..."
"......Krauss‐sama........."
"W‐watch me...
 I\'ll settle this with a single strike......"
Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho...
 How unwise.
{n}I know what you\'re gunning for.
{n}The distance between the two of them is more than 10 meters.
If the goat and Krauss both step in with all their strength to settle the fight with a single blow, their power will be double the norm.
{n}Both will crash together, so it will be a relative 4 times normal.
Even if, on top of that, the strike miraculously lands on a weak point for a critical hit, that will only double the power.
.........In short, Krauss\'s maximum power level of 6, times 8, will cap out at 48 at the most.
He might just barely be able to win if he repeated that lucky shot a full 20 times.
Hohhohohohoho, if you\'re killed every time you take a hit, and your damage still accumulates,
 .......let\'s see, perhaps you could finally win when we get to Episode 24?
Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho, if only this series could stretch on so long...!!
 Either way, you don\'t even have the slightest chance of victory!
......Good gracious, what is that bing‐bong I keep hearing?
"I will be betting everything on a single strike...
 You have no reason to hold back either.
 Give it everything you\'ve got..."
"Hohohoho, he\'s requesting that you go all out.
 Pulverize him with a single all‐out strike, and turn him into chunks of meat."
As the goat got excited and beat its chest over and over, it took a position as though preparing for a sprint.
Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho, is this what you were hoping for?
Stake your hopes on your greatest power level, and despair when even that doesn\'t reach at all!
It pinged again!
 That thing is really getting on my nerves, what {i:is} it?!
"Here I come......
 Ready?"
The goat roared in response.
Then, with a matched timing that only the men confronting each other could comprehend,
 ......the two leapt forward like bullets shot out of a gun.
The men howled, collecting the strength from all over their bodies into one arm each.
The goat\'s fiery glowing eyes clearly locked onto Krauss\'s face.
......He could perfectly see a vision of when he would step forwards,
 when he would punch through Krauss and blow him away,
 and when he would achieve his total victory.
The long, painful days before today drifted through the goat\'s mind......
The hard days of training where his senpais had picked on him...
The faint glimpses of his senpais\' warm concern during those days.
And the joy of that day his power had been acknowledged, and he had been accepted as one of the team...!
I never properly respected my parents.
......That\'s right, I\'d actually planned on washing my hands of this business when this job was over, and returning to my hometown.
Sorry, my little goat sister...your onii‐chan caused you nothing but trouble.
And I, ...a‐actually have a childhood friend, and I\'m going to marry her when I get hoooooome!!!
"Gyaaaaaaaaahh!!!
 Nooooooooooo!!
 Don\'t trip so many {c:86EF9C:loser flaaaaaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aags}!!"
"You can\'t handle that punch, dodge iiiiiiiiiit!!"
It happened the instant before the two crashed and their punches crossed.
"Foolish, {f:5:Virgilia}.
 It looks like you couldn\'t make a composed decision."
"You must not take that punch!!
 Deflect it!!"
"?!?!"
The very instant the goat\'s left straight and Krauss\'s right straight crossed!
 The goat obeyed {f:5:Virgilia}\'s order with super‐fast reflexes and pulled back his straight, deflecting Krauss\'s punch!
".........mmgh—"
Yes, {f:5:Virgilia}\'s decision was probably wise.
{n}After all, the number of loser flags act as a multiplier on the opponent\'s power level!
"That was close.
 If you had taken that punch after tripping so many loser flags, imagine just how great a force it would have been multiplied to...!!"
"Come on, from there, smash the completely open right side of his face with a right straight!!"
"What?
 The promise about fighting with only your left arm?"
"Hoh‐hoh‐ho!!
 Promises are made to be brokennnnn!!"
"Gyaah, tripped another ooooooone!!"
"I\'m disappointed, {f:5:Virgilia}.
 You really were lacking composure."
"What\'s that......?!
 How was I not composed by noticing it beforehand and making him avoid it...?!"
"Wh‐...why is that, Kyrie‐sama...?
 If they had crashed like that, wouldn\'t Krauss‐sama have won......?"
".........Ah, I, I see...!
 Even with 20 loser flags,
 ......that\'s still not enough!"
Krauss\'s and the goat\'s double rush make it x4.
{n}With a miracle on their side, the firm promise of a critical hit would double it again for x8.
On top of that, a multiplier of x20 equal to the number of tripped loser flags applies, making it x160.
At a glance, that looks like an incredible amplification, but even so, Krauss\'s power level is 6.
{n}Even multiplied by 160, it only makes for a power level of 960.
{n}Just a fraction below the goat\'s 1000...!
"That\'s why I said you weren\'t composed.
 You made a blunder.
 If they had crashed like that, you would have won."
"H‐hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho!!
 Even if that were so, it all comes to the same thing if this right straight smashes Krauss\'s head!!
 Die, Ushiromiya Krauss!!!"
"......Take this...the most powerful blow in the world of boxing."
Having deflected Krauss\'s right straight,
 the goat\'s own right straight closed in on the right side of Krauss\'s face, which had been left open...
But there, it crossed with a left straight from Krauss...
The two punches crossed, and time stopped as each aimed for the face of the other......
"Ho.........hohohoho.
 To think that it would be brought to a simultaneous strike at a moment like this!
 But his power level caps out at x160, making it 960!!
 You never made it to my child\'s 1000...!"
".........No.
 {f:5:Virgilia}‐san.
 ......You\'ve lost."
"Why?!"
"You made your goat deflect the first cross‐counter.
 ......Certainly, if the right straight he issued after that were to hit, Krauss‐san would probably be in pieces."
"...However, that was crossed...
 ......That\'s just no good.
 I\'m afraid this is a complete loss for your goat."
A cross‐counter has four times the destructive power.
{n}This is common knowledge in boxing.
And if that is deflected, and the right straight hits, then the double cross‐counter has 8 times the destructive power.
{n}This is also common knowledge in boxing.
If that is crossed......
{n}By the principle of leverage, the triple cross then multiplies the destructive power by 12!
This is also painfully common knowledge in the world of boxing!!
".........Krauss‐san\'s power level is 6."
"A double multiplier from both sides for rushing in, making it times 4."
"Th‐the critical hit makes it times 8."
"Up to times 160 for tripping too many loser flags."
"......And times 12 on top of that for the triple cross‐counter."
"T‐......times 1920......"
A power level of...11520...!!
 Krauss\'s punch now had the power to easily win that Budokai tournament...!!!
"......This result was brought about by Krauss‐san\'s persistence in not giving up on victory until the end, ......and your conceit.
 Without either, it would never have become so powerful..."
"......You fought well.
 .........It\'s okay, you can fall now..."
Nanjo patted the goat on the shoulder...
......O‐......onii‐chan...gave it his all......
As the sparkling drops from the goat\'s eyes scattered, he softly toppled backwards,
 and flattened {f:5:Virgilia} like a pancake.
"Ugyaa!!
 Heavyyyyyyy, get oooffffff!"
The goat\'s massive body was too heavy for the slender {f:5:Virgilia}.
{n}She floundered around with it on top of her, but it didn\'t look like she would be able to escape.
In that instant, the barrier {f:5:Virgilia} had sealed broke.
"No hard feelings, please.
 Underestimating the principle of leverage was the cause of your defeat."
"......I wonder why the principle of leverage worked on that counter.
 It\'s an eternal mystery."
"Let\'s escape while we can...!!
 You take care, {nobr:Mr. Goat}...!"
"W‐well then, excuse us, {f:5:Virgilia}‐sama!"
".........*bow*."
"Waaaaaaaaiiit!!
 Get back heeeere!!
 Get this thing off meeeeee!!
 Kiiii!! Gapgapgapgap!!!"
There was nothing more to block their way.
{n}......They ran through the underground passage with single‐minded purpose...!
Jessica had finally been cornered with the wall at her back.
{n}......Ronove\'s magic barrier was advancing bit by bit, and would probably crush her against the wall before long.
Considering the distance...this would be the final strike, the final throw of her iron fist.
Jessica had dealt out many punches so far.
......The wall wasn\'t invincible.
 It had already started to crack, and it wouldn\'t be strange for it to smash at any moment.
However, due to the rebounding damage,
 Jessica herself was in very bad shape, with cuts all over her body.
"......Just stop this now.
 I don\'t intend to crush you.
 It is up to the Master to decide how to deal with you.
 ......However, I do intend to put in a good word for your impressive fight."
"N‐
.........no...frigging...
...way...
 ......Not yet......
 It\'s not......over yet........."
"......You have wounds all over your body.
 It\'s all you can manage just to stand, is it not?
 ......It seems that you plan on putting all of your strength into this final strike.
 However, that final strike will instead prove fatal for you."
The damage reflected by Ronove\'s magic barrier was proportional to the strength of the attack.
{n}Jessica\'s all‐out punch would be bounced back onto her.
......The more all‐out she went, the more suicidal it would be for her.
"I, I get it......
 I know that........."
"I am warning you.
 Stop this now.
 It is for your own good."
"Stop bluffing.
 Your wall is about to break, right...?
 I\'ve been the one punching it, you think I can\'t feel that.........?"
"........................"
That was...a fact.
 Ronove\'s wall was already on the verge of breaking.
And on top of that,
 Jessica\'s fists had been imbued with an unimaginable magical attack power by now, and their destructive power defied the imagination.
......If she wasn\'t careful, that destructive power might pierce the defensive wall, smash Ronove as well,
 and then go on to expand the size of her bedroom by connecting it to the room next door.
......However, that damage would rebound on Jessica as well.
{n}She wouldn\'t escape unharmed!
"I will say it just one more time.
 Stop.
 I say this out of consideration for you!"
"Shut the hell up......
 .........Say your prayers."
Jessica howled.
 ......Putting all her strength and her last and greatest destructive power into her fist, she roared......
The three goats had been beaten down long ago.
 Without a single ragged breath, George cautiously closed the distance between him and Gaap.
......He was after her.
 He was planning on bringing her down with a single strike...
Gaap was also aiming for a single strike.
{n}.........If she let that chance slide, this time, she would be killed......
"......Aren\'t you going to use your pitfalls?"
"............Ack......"
Even the tiny moment of weakness during the time it took to open the hole would prove fatal against George now.
......Gaap cautiously calculated the distance and timing, but even as she did, George closed the gap between them...
".........If you won\'t move forward, then I will."
"......C‐......come on then...
 No more tricks.
 ......This kick of mine...
...will end this!"
The instant she noticed George\'s body blur, ......only his jacket was floating in the air.
A short sound of realization entered her mind, and in that instant, darkness covered her.
George, with his heel swung up high, looked even like a massive dragon attacking from the sky.
"Y‐you fell for it......
 ......I win, Ushiromiya George!!"
"What—"
Gaap opened a vast pit with her in the center, and swallowed up George along with herself...!!
The two were swallowed up by the pit, and spat out from the ceiling of the arbor.
But that was what Gaap had been after, so she alone landed lightly.
 ......But there was another pit in George\'s landing spot.
"Ehheheheheheheh, aaaahhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!!
 Got you, Ushiromiya Geooooooo{-}o{-}o{-}orge!!"
"It\'s been fun die now,
 it would be a waste for someone as good as you to end up as the Ushiromiya family head,
 so I\'ll eat you up right here, right now!!!
 Oooooorrrrrooo{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}oa{0}a{0}a{0}aahhh!!"
George once again fell from the ceiling of the arbor.
 He had probably been dropped the same distance as falling off the roof of a two‐story building.
In midair, he couldn\'t control his posture in any way.
{n}It was impossible to resist or defend or avoid!!
As Gaap spun like a whirlwind, she concentrated all of her energy on the sharp tip of her stiletto heel.
......This was the final strike...to perform his requiem.
{n}The queen bee\'s final strike, that would bore into heaven, knocking him down into the true Abyss!!
"Welcome to the Abyss!!
 This is the end of the line for you!!!"
Her prey captured in her sight, she launched her foot up into the sky.
......It was then that she saw George\'s face.
 .........Even though he was in midair, he was calmly adjusting his glasses with the middle finger of his left hand.
And his posture was still preserved as that of an axe kick.
{n}Aiming for Gaap\'s forehead, without the faintest deviation......
".........I already anticipated that you would opt for that move."
"............Wh...at.........?"
"If I\'d jumped to make the person that was {i:on the ground} taste my heel, my posture would have collapsed long ago.
 .........However, my posture hasn\'t collapsed in the slightest.
 Do you know why?"
"......You...
...don\'t...
mean......"
"From the very beginning,
 ......I jumped to make the person that was two stories below taste my heel!!!"
"Uungh, ......ooooooo{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}h{0}h{0}h{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhhhh!!!"
"You lose, missy!!!"
"Bing‐bong."
"Unnggggrrrroooooaaaaaaahhh, take thiiii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}iiiss!!!"
Jessica\'s last and strongest upwards punch...
reached the wall,
 ......and was sucked in.
It was sucked into the black, large hole that had suddenly opened on the wall.
"Well, .........I did advise you to stop."
"What.........the............"
"......Ghhg............ah......"
"Truth is,
 .........I was never in even the slightest little bit of trouble.
 Soorry..."
......Jessica\'s fist had gone for George\'s stomach,
 ......and George\'s axe kick had lined up on Jessica\'s head.
The shocking destructive power imbued in Jessica\'s fist crushed George\'s organs and scattered his abdomen.
The equally‐as‐shocking destructive power in George\'s axe kick smashed half of Jessica\'s head, and scattered its contents in the same manner......
"Pfft, ...ahhahahahahahahahahahaha...!!
 I mean, come onnnn.
 Witches are all about the acting, riiiiight?
 Hey, Riiche, how was it, were you watching...?"
"Wahahaha, waaaahhyahhyahhya, aaakkyakkyakkya!!
 Not baaad, followed the script to a T!
 You really do get it, Gaap!!
 Woohoo!!"
Beato and Gaap gave each other a light high five.
"......hhh...
...aaahh...
............hhhhhhuuAAAA{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}AAHHH!!!"
"Thanks, Ronove.
 That was a treat.
 I\'ll return Jessica\'s corpse back there.
 ......Separate the corpses of the two who are close.
 ......Is the second twilight done now?"
Gaap dropped Jessica\'s corpse into a pit,
 and chucked all the chunks of meat, too, into Jessica\'s room,
 as carelessly as throwing them into the trash...
Jessica\'s corpse and lumps of flesh fell from the ceiling and poured out all over her room.
Ronove shook his head slightly at this all‐too‐gruesome change.
"............My apologies, Jessica‐sama.
 I did warn you."
"Of course,
 ...I suppose it\'s only natural that a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} like yourself can\'t understand the demonic pleasure I derive from foreseeing this conclusion and giving you repeated warnings that I know you won\'t listen to.
 ......Pukkuku{0}ku{0}ku{0}ku{0}ku{0}ku{0}kukuku!"
"It really was fun, kiddo.
 ......But you play with words a little too much.
 ......I think ‘If you\'re ready, may I fight back’ was the absolute classic?
 Eheheh, you\'ve been reading a few too many light novels or something, you know?
 *giggle*giggle*giggle*!"
In the arbor brutally decorated by George and Jessica\'s scattered blood and guts,
 Gaap enjoyed a loud laugh for a while...
...But she quickly realized that, in all seriousness, this was a little too filthy and undignified, and she snapped her fingers.
As she did, gold butterflies rose up from the ground all around the garden,
 stuck to each of the bits and stained patches of blood, and got them out.
......Then, bit by bit, they slowly turned back into George\'s corpse,
 and the awful corpse with its guts splattered out was repaired into a clean corpse that looked like it was sleeping.
Was this some kind of post‐mortem sportsmanship towards a good opponent............?
The heavens were slowly split.
......Because Gaap had lifted a leg high into the air, pointing at the sky.
"So long, lady killer.
 This is the real Game Over."
Squish.
 ......Without a trace of mercy, that foot was brought down,
 ......and buried into George\'s forehead.
Her stiletto heel, sharp as a weapon, was impaled through George\'s forehead.
She......pulled it out with a blorp......
It was like a mark of proof that Gaap had indeed finished him by her own hand......
Ronove returned Jessica\'s corpse to its original form as well.
{n}......And unlike how it had been with George, he also restored Jessica\'s life......
"...U‐...nff, .........*cough*, *cough*......
......what in the.........world......
 ......A dream......?"
"No, that is wrong.
 ......You certainly did pass away, Jessica‐sama.
 You should be well aware of the memory of your final moments."
It was burnt into the back of Jessica\'s mind.
......For some reason, she remembered being thrown somewhere, ......and that her head had been smashed by George\'s heel......
"Am I......alive......?"
"No, you are dead.
 That is merely being postponed for a scant three minutes with my magic.
 After three minutes, the magic will end, and you will return to being a tragic corpse with half of its head destroyed."
"Wha......t.........?
 ......Heh, .........heheheheh......"
"Death is brutal.
 In most cases, you aren\'t even given the time to ready your heart.
 ......However, I have decided to give you that time, in recognition of your valiant battle.
 Use those three minutes to ensure that your lingering attachments to this world are all taken care of."
"Or, ......I could use those three minutes to take you down with me......"
But the power that had been burning inside Jessica\'s body was now completely lost.
......Jessica was aware of that herself.
 She was already dead.
"Well then, I will leave you now.
 If you would excuse me.
 ......It was fun, Jessica‐sama."
Ronove turned his form into a cloud of gold butterflies, and disappeared.
All that remained was the sound of the wind and rain, and the figure of Jessica, crouching down against the wall......
Jessica realized.
 After three minutes, she probably really would revert to the corpse she had been.
......In those three minutes, was there anything she could do.........?
She stood up, and with a shaky gait,
 ......took the phone that was on the desk...
"He‐......hello.
 ......Is that you, Jessica?
 Jessica?!
 What is it, are you alright?!?!"
".........Heh, ......heheheheh...
 ......They...got me......"
"Are you alright?!
 Are you hurt?!
 I\'ll come help you right now!!"
"Nah, ......it\'s too late.
 ...I\'m...already dead, apparently...
 Ahahaha, by the time you get here, I\'ll be a corpse with half my head spilled out."
"God{i:damn} that old man!!
 Wait right there, I\'m coming right now!!"
"Listen, Battler!!!
 Listen closely, alright...?
 .........I know exactly why Gohda‐san and Kumasawa‐san were so awkward talking about the guys who killed the six in the dining hall."
".........Those guys, uh...
......they aren\'t...
{y:0:Human}{n:0:human}."
"Wh‐...whaat?!
 What are you talking about........."
"What do you want me to say, man, I frigging saw it, okay?!!
 Those guys, they warp, set up barriers, ahhaha, {i:all} of that crap, y\'know...?
 It\'s like some manga, some anime, ......seriously, we can\'t deal with that."
"......Ahhahhahhah......
 ...It was never gonna happen, fighting them... It\'s impossible......
 That hat‐stand spear you were so proud of, you\'d need something way better than that to deal with these guys..."
A line of blood dripped down from Jessica\'s forehead......
"George nii‐san didn\'t make it either.
 Instant death, that was...
 .........Heheh, the next test is yours, Battler.
 .........I wonder if your test will be the same as ours......
 .........Be careful, ......and don\'t get it wrong."
"Y‐you mean the test...?"
"No.
 .........Don\'t get it wrong and...
...think the enemy\'s obviously gotta be {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}."
".........The enemy...is not {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.
 ...They\'re demons......who can wield terrifying magic at will."
"No matter what, ......don\'t get that wrong......"
"*cough*, *cough*cough*!! Watch......yourself......"
A line of blood dripped down from Jessica\'s mouth as well.
......The left half of her head started hurting.
Jessica realized that she was about to return to the corpse she had been.
"...............When thirteen people die, the Golden Witch...revives.
 Mom and the others killed earlier were the first six.
 That\'s the first twilight.
 ......And with George nii‐san and me dead, that\'s the second.
 ......So if just five more people are killed, the ritual is gonna be complete, ......and the witch will revive."
".........I hope Dad and the rest are safe...
 ......If they aren\'t,
 .........the one to test you...
might be the newly resurrected {f:5:Beatrice} herself..."
By now, Battler had no idea what Jessica was saying.
{n}But from her tone, he realized that she knew she was about to die.
So even though he didn\'t understand the situation, he urged her to hang on in there.
"......Haha, I told you, I\'m already dead.
 .........See ya.
 It looks like time\'s up.
 ......Good luck on your test.
 I hope you can...become the head.
 ..........................."
"Jessica?
 Jessica?!
 Hey, answer me!!
 Jessicaaaaaaaaaaa!!"
Battler\'s sorrowful voice could be heard from the dangling receiver.
......Crouching with her back against the adjacent wall...
{n}......Jessica\'s head was half smashed.........
"Where are we......?"
"...Is this...a well......?
 Where is this...?"
Kyrie stuck her face out of the well, and then Krauss showed himself too.
{n}When he noticed that they could see the back of the mansion beyond a grove of trees, Krauss realized more or less where they were.
......To think that there had been a hidden underground passage in a well all the way out here,
 and that it led to a hidden mansion......
"Th‐this really is tough on this old body......
 ......Ordinarily, you can come up through a different place, with real stairs.
 Provided you can unlock it..."
"......I have many questions I\'d like to ask you about the layout of this place later, Doctor Nanjo.
 ......Shannon, are you alright? Grab my hand."
"I, ......I\'m okay.
 Kanon‐kun, quickly."
Kanon was the last, climbing up the ladder towards them in the shaft disguised as a well.
{n}......It was probably quite deep.
When he looked down, for the first time, he realized how far he\'d come up.
"Nihi. Firing."
Bang.
............As Kanon was about to finally crawl out of the well, a hole the size of a basketball opened up in his chest.
......Everyone there looked through the hole in Kanon\'s chest to the scenery beyond......
"K‐..........Kanon‐kun!!!"
"......Ne...
...e‐sa...
............"
Kanon toppled backwards,
 ......and was swallowed up into the depths of the well......
"E‐everyone, run for it!!
 The Chiester Sisters!!
 They\'ve locked on, we can\'t avoid them!!
 Run!!
 At least one of us survive...!!!"
At that time, Krauss, Kyrie, and Nanjo...
clearly saw a golden curve appear from the well,
 ......and sew itself through the side of Shannon\'s head.........
"Shannon!!!"
Head pierced.
 The three were perfect witnesses to everything, up to and including the opposite side of her head being blasted away into pulp.
Shannon fell to her knees,
 .........blood gushing from both sides of her head,
 and flopped to the ground.
"W‐waaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhyaaaaaaaaaahhh!!"
"They\'re after us!!
 Run!!
 We\'ll be killed!!"
"...R‐run...run run run!!!"
Nanjo had become paralyzed in fright by the manner of Shannon\'s death, and the Chiester Sisters would not miss their chance.
A curve again appeared from the well, and pierced through Nanjo\'s forehead and out the back of his head in an instant, sewing through him.
......Thump.
 And so Nanjo expired.
"What on Earth... Why...?!!
 Where\'s the enemy attacking from?!"
"We\'re being sniped!!
 I don\'t know where from, but they have us completely in their sights!!
 Escape into the mansion, block their line of sight!!"
The two dashed into the back entrance of the mansion.
Then, the instant Krauss tried to shut the door behind him...
......a golden curve appeared for the fourth time, piercing Krauss from the back of his head out through his forehead, and smashing even his forehead to pieces...
"............nngg...
.........oohh............"
"Eeek!!
 Hiyiiiiiiii!!!"
Krauss\'s body lurched over, fell down hard, and drew a neat radial pattern with the insides of his head...
Kyrie ran wildly through the hallway, flew into some room, and locked the door.
.........But she couldn\'t imagine for a moment that this would save her life.
She would probably die soon!
This was apparently one of the guest rooms.
{n}......At that moment, a phone on a side table caught Kyrie\'s eye...
After hanging up the call from Jessica, Battler was literally just about to dash out.
In that instant, the phone rang again.
"H‐hello!!!
 ...............Huh?
 Kyrie‐san?!"
"......Yes, Battler‐kun.
 ......I got lucky.
 I managed to escape the dungeon somehow.
 I really was fortunate."
"Where are you?!
 Is everyone alright?!
 On our side, it looks like Jessica and George‐aniki are—"
"Listen!!!
 I probably won\'t be alive for long."
Then, right after she got the sudden feeling that the keyhole of the locked door might have glowed gold,
 a gold, curved line drawing a helix...
...no, a golden sewing thread...infiltrated the room through there at an incredible speed, and bored a hole into the floor by Kyrie\'s feet.
......Oh, that\'s rare.
The enemy, who had sniped the other four one after another with extraordinary skill,
 apparently really does have trouble shooting me between the eyes with a single shot while I\'m holed up in this room.
But the next strike will probably hit......
At this point, Kyrie finally remembered the initial massacre in the dining hall......
......That\'s right......
 ......This is what killed Rudolf and the rest, all six of them......
"......Listen, Battler‐kun.
 I\'m going to tell you everything exactly as I saw it.
 ...I\'m sure you\'ll think that something\'s gone wrong with my head."
"......In fact, it\'s alright for you to think that.
 Even I still haven\'t come to terms with what it was I saw."
".........Today,
 after you all returned to the guesthouse, the family conference began in the dining hall,
 ......and I\'ll tell you everything that happened next."
"Listen until the end without butting in.
 ............The call might suddenly be cut off partway through.
 If it is, that\'s the moment I was killed."
".........Kyrie......san......"
Then, Kyrie spoke...
......about how Kinzo had come, the family conference had started,
 ......the six had been killed, and the five of them had been confined.
......About how she had escaped somehow, and made it to where she was now,
 and how everyone had finally been killed—all spoken dispassionately, as she had seen it, with no dramatization.
......She even spoke about how everyone except her had been killed, and how she had observed the moments of all their deaths,
 ......and how, even this very moment, someone was trying to kill her.
"............Actually,
 even while we\'ve been talking, ...I\'ve been attacked three times.
 Something like a strange gold thread keeps flying in through the keyhole, spinning around and aiming for me."
"First it was by my feet.
 ......Next, it was close to my shoulders.
 ......Just now, it grazed my ear.
 ......Its aim is getting more and more accurate.
 Looks like it\'ll go right between my eyes pretty soon......"
"R‐run, Kyrie‐san...!!
 Run awaaaaaaaaaaay!!!"
"Where to?
 ......You realize,
 ...I\'ve managed to run all the way here,
 ......shut myself into a room, and even locked the door......?
 .........And I\'m still being targeted.
 .........Just where am I meant to hide...?
 ......Seriously......"
"Ky......
ri...
e...
...san........."
"Battler‐kun...
 Are Jessica‐chan and George‐kun......still alive?"
".....................
 ......Just now, ...there was a phone call from Jessica...
 .........It kinda......sounded like they were...done for......"
".........Thought so.
 ......Yeah, when we five were being killed one after another, I had a kind of premonition.
 ......I thought that perhaps the second twilight had been finished in the thirteen‐person murder ritual, and that our twilights had been reached."
".........In other words, when I die, that\'s thirteen.
 Then the ritual will be complete.
 ......The Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}, will be resurrected."
".........I wonder what will happen.
 ......On this island filled with demons and witches, and swarming with goat monsters,
 ......when even the boss of them all, the Golden Witch, appears,
 .........I wonder just what in the world will happen...
 ......At this point,
 I can\'t...
......make any sense of anything anymore."
Kyrie‐san\'s voice......had given up, completely, on her own life.
And because Battler could tell that,
 ......he couldn\'t stop the tears......
"......I did have just one thing...I can advise you on."
"What...?"
".........Even if...
a demon or a witch does appear in front of you..."
"Yeah..."
"There\'s no need whatsoever to doubt what they are.
 ......Understand that they are what they seem."
"........................"
"You might think that there should be some trick, or that there\'s some true identity behind it.
 ......If you have the time to think of something like that,
 ......it would be much more constructive to think of how not to damage the mood of whatever you\'re facing."
"......Even mistakenly, ...you must not say "Prove it then, show me some magic"...
 ......They will probably use a method of utmost cruelty...
...to show you the proof."
"......I can\'t...
...believe it......
 ......I never thought...
...I\'d hear something like that coming from your mouth...
 ......I can\'t believe it........."
"I understand.
 That it\'s unbelievable.
 ......That\'s why...that\'s the only advice I can give to you.
 ......{i:Believe}."
".........You\'re telling me to believe in {f:5:Beatrice}...and demons and witches and monsters......?"
"Probably,
 ......even after being so clearly shown all those things not of this world,
 ......we still weren\'t able to believe any of it, I think."
"......I\'m like that even now.
 ......The true form of this thing that keeps attacking me, trying to shoot through my forehead,
 ......is something I can\'t understand,
 .........and I can\'t believe."
"So,
 ......I want you at least to believe, to understand,
 .........and to accept that being which...
...we couldn\'t fully accept.
 If you do that for me, our deaths won\'t have been in vain.
 .........It\'ll also have been worth it for me to make this phone call...
 ......Ah...!"
"K‐Kyrie‐san?!?!"
"......I\'m still okay.
 It grazed me, but it missed again.
 ......I very much doubt...
.........that I\'ll survive the next one.
 .........Thank you.
 And goodbye, Battler‐kun.
 ......I was once cold towards you because you were Asumu‐san\'s son.
 ......Forgive me...for those days."
"What do you mean, {i:forgive} you? Kyrie‐san, you are a {i:mother} to me now!!"
I felt as though I heard an incredible sound at the other end of the receiver.
{n}And then, a noisy clattering sound.
......As though the receiver had fallen to the floor.
"Kyrie‐san?!?!
 Kyrie‐san!!!
 Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!!"
.........Kyrie‐san never...
......responded through the phone...
.........again........."......I don\'t know why you\'re angry, Battler."
"You {i:should?!}
 Everyone was killed, goddammit!!
 By that goddamned old fart!
 Saying something incomprehensible about {f:5:Beatrice}\'s resurrection ritual or something!!"
"Then, that means, thirteen people have been offered as sacrifices,
 ......and {f:5:Beatrice} will have revived already, you know?"
"Yeah, that\'s perfect!!
 I\'ll take {f:5:Beatrice} too and kill them both!!"
"............We survived the ritual.
 So we\'ll receive an invitation to the Golden Land from {f:5:Beatrice}, you see......?"
"All wishes are granted there.
 If you\'re suffering because your family was killed, then you just have to bring them back to life.
 ......That\'s what I plan to do.
 I\'m going to revive my really nice real mama, the one that isn\'t possessed by the black witch."
"......So Mama will always be with me from now on.
 .........There won\'t be any more overtime or working on days off.
 ...She\'ll always be with me, and think only of me, kihhihihi, and she\'ll fight all the time against fearsome enemies for me.
 Kihhihi{0}hi{0}hihihi...!"
"......There\'s something wrong with you.
 ......How can you sit there saying such incomprehensible crap in a situation like this...?!"
"............Didn\'t Auntie Kyrie just tell you, Battler...?
 ......Didn\'t she tell you...
to believe...
...in the witch?"
".....................Sh‐shit.
 This isn\'t the time to get in an argument with you...!!
 Forget "hostages", at this point, there\'s no one left alive at all!
 This dumb‐as‐hell, screwed‐up ritual game is done now...!!"
"From here on, I\'m doing what {i:I} want.
 Someone might still be alive.
 Or someone might be hiding!
 I\'ll search every nook and cranny of this place, find them, and beat the shit out of them!!"
In a rage, Battler grabbed his hat‐stand spear and flew out of the room.
Maria watched him go, looking bored...
".........But {f:5:Beatrice} would grant your wishes soon anyway.
 ......Stupid Battler.
 ......Kihhihihihi."
Then, the phone rang out again......
Maria stood up, and grabbed the receiver.
"Uu.
 Hello.
 ......Uu?
 Uu!!!"
Of course, the sound of the phone also reached Battler\'s ears as he was about to dash out of the guesthouse.
With a violent forcefulness, he turned around and dashed into the cousins\' room...
"M‐Maria......!
 The phone call, ......who\'s it from...?!"
With a terrifying look on his face, Battler yelled at Maria, who was on the phone.
You couldn\'t blame him......
 Right now, the only humans left alive on the island were himself, Maria, Gohda, and Kumasawa.
But there was no way those two could call when they were locked up in the gardening storehouse.
......Which meant.........there was only one person.
{n}It had to be Kinzo.
As she happily chatted with the person on the other end of the phone, Maria slowly turned to face Battler.
.........And, with an unsettling expression on her face, she laughed with a "kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi".
{n}......It felt almost as though the person on the other end of the line was chatting about Battler.
"Maria...who\'s on the phone?
 ......Grandfather......?!"
Battler couldn\'t imagine that this was the case.
...After all, it was inconceivable that Maria would be having such a friendly talk with Kinzo,
 ......chatting to him about Battler with that eerie smile on her face.
Just what kind of person could be on the phone.........who could make Maria chat with a smile like that?
.........At that time, in the back of his mind, the words Kyrie had spoken to him drifted up.
Even if a witch does appear, there is no need to doubt it.
{n}......Just.........believe in its existence......
"Yep.
 Battler just came back.
 He sure is hasty.
 Kihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi......"
"Maria!!
 Who\'s on the phone?!
 Who?!?!"
"......Hand it over?
 Sure.
 ............Here, Battler."
After getting the consent of the person on the other end, she held the receiver out to Battler...
"..................uh."
"Here."
Maria held the receiver out for him to take, ......as though it was perfectly normal.
Battler felt just a little bit of hesitation towards taking the receiver.
......Because, .........by acknowledging the existence of the person at the other end,
 .........he would have no choice but to admit it.
.........Kyrie had said it.
......There is no longer...
...any need...
...to doubt their existence...
Battler took the receiver.
After he did so, Maria briskly headed for the door.
Battler, who was slightly fearful about finding out for sure who was at the other end of the receiver,
 questioned Maria before taking the call.
"H‐hey!
 Where are you going...?!"
"To where my test is.
 ......I wonder who the Ushiromiya family head will be, you or me.
 Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi."
".........D‐don\'t go!!
 You\'ll be killed!!"
"No I won\'t.
 The ritual\'s already over.
 ...And even if I am, I\'ll be revived.
 ......Whether one of us becomes the head or not, we\'re already invited to the Golden Land.
 See you."
"Wait!!
 Maria...!!!"
Battler stretched his hand out to Maria\'s back as she left,
 ......but the cord of the receiver that he was gripping held him back like a chain.
......He readied himself.
 ...Battler put the receiver to his ear......
"...............He‐......hello......?"
"<Congratulaatioooooooons>!!
 <And I\'m fi~ne>!!
 <And yoo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}oouuuuu>?!
 Aaa{0}a{0}ah{0}h{0}h{0}hyah{0}hyah{0}hyah{0}hyaaaaa!!!"
Screwed up, mocking English filled his ears.
{n}......It was the voice of a woman he didn\'t know.
......Who—
the inside of his head was starting to freeze up—
............who............
"What do you mean "who", Ushiromiya Battleeeeer...?
 The answer, normally, is <ye~s, I\'m fine>!
 Is it not??
 That takes me back...you must have done that one in middle school, right?
 That thing you do in pairs!
 Uhhya{0}hya{0}hya{0}hya{0}hya{0}hyaaaaahh!!!"
"Y‐...you\'re insane......
 Who are you?!!
 Answer me!!!"
"Say it in Engliiish.
 Isn\'t that your specialtyyyyy?"
"......Qui‐quit messing with me......
 Who are you?!!
 That crazy old bastard\'s underling?!"
"‘Underling’ is a cruel description.
 Go the other way and try "captive".
 ......I have Kinzo captive!
 Ri~~ght?
 Wahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha..."
That last laugh didn\'t sound like it was aimed at Battler.
......It was almost as though Kinzo was right next to the phone, cackling as well...
"......S‐......say your goddamned name!!
 Who are you?!
 Who?!!!"
"Try and guess, you could win a invite to Hawaii!
 Ahhyah{0}hyah{0}hhyaaaah!!
 Fffinally.
 FINALLY!!
 Mmmmmmm, it was soooo looo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}ong, the days leading up to today were reee{-}e{-}eeally long...!!"
"I seriously waited a thousand years, you know?? For this day to arrive!!
 And here it is, all thanks to you,
 my BIG resurrection!!
 <Thank you>, Kinzo!
 Just this once,
 I\'ll let you have that last takeback of yo~urs!!!"
"......Hell\'s bells, do you have to be in this much of a good mood?
 Can\'t you act a little more ladylike?"
Kinzo and {f:5:Beatrice} sat facing each other over the chessboard on the reception table.
Also on the table were expensive cheeses and the like to go with drinks.
{n}And there was a line of several empty wine bottles.
As {f:5:Beatrice} rolled around in her sofa in an unseemly way,
 she held a wine glass in one hand, in a good mood,
 ......and probably, completely drunk.
"I\'m in the {i:best} mood today, so I\'m feeling crazy generous!!
 Hey, hey, Kinzo, don\'t use a well‐aged noble rot wine like this as a decoration!
 Hooooly shit, it\'s a 1947?!"
"If you don\'t open it today, just when are you gonna open it?!
 Let\'s slosh it all over each other for fun!
 Then let\'s whack each other with the empty bottle!
 Uhhyah{0}hyah{0}hyahhya!!"
"Hahhaha, that would be entertaining.
 You are a little too excited.
 You\'re cutting loose too much."
"And what about youuuuuu?!
 Aren\'t you happy to be reunited with meee?
 Aaah, it\'s the living world! The earthly world!!
 Long live my flesh!!"
"......What......are you going on about.........?
 ...Are you saying that you\'re......B‐{f:5:Beatrice} or something...?"
"<Ye~eeeeeeeeeeeeeeess, I aaaaaaaaaamm>!!
 Thanks to Kinzo\'s thirteen‐person murder ritual, I\'ve finally been resurrected...!!
 It\'s nice having a mouth, it\'s nice having a tongue!
 How fun it is to be able to talk to you like this!"
"Come to think of it, even though we\'ve hurled insults at each other over and over again,
 this is the first time we\'ve had a conversation like this on the board during the game, isn\'t it?
 How very fresh!!"
"Oh, did you hear that pop sound?!
 He {i:opened} it, the maniac actually went and opened that vintage wine that\'s expensive as shit!!
 Do you know how much a single bottle of that stuff {i:costs}?!
 As much as a whole ten‐kilogram ingot, isn\'t that craaaaaazy?!?!
 Hiiiii‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah!!"
"C‐cut the crap...!!
 {f:5:Beatrice} my ass...!!
 You say you\'re the Golden Witch?!
 That\'s enough!!"
"Where the hell are you?!
 Is that damn old fart with you as well?!
 I\'ll beat the shit out of both of you!!
 Where are you right now?!
 Answer me!!"
"Ohhh, so you want to meeeet me?
 Uhhihihihi, sure is tough being a popular woman!
 But please, don\'t try to chat me up when Kinzo\'s around, okaay?
 The guy\'s a bad egg, he gets seriously jealous, see?"
".........But when Kinzo isn\'t around and we\'re all alone, I\'ll love you all you want in secret, alright...?
 Uhyaaahya{0}hhya{0}hhya{0}hhya{0}hhya{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}kkya{0}kkya{0}kkyakkya!!!"
"Y‐you\'re insane........."
"Kinzoo, I\'ve changed my mind.
 I won\'t do Maria\'s test.
 You go."
"How fickle.
 Then you are saying that you will do Battler\'s test?"
"Nothing wrong with that, ri~ght?!
 That guy\'s so much like a younger you, y\'know? It makes my heart race."
"Don\'t worry, I\'m not gonna cheat on yooooou.
 I\'ll only be alone with him this one time.
 ......I\'m always alone with you, riiight...?
 But no more tying me up twenty‐four hours a day, alright?
 Kuhhyahha{0}hha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!!!"
"So there you have it, Battlerr!
 I, the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}, will be running your test myself!
 As for the place...let me see.
 At the front entrance to this mansion!"
"Battlerr, this headship test, you\'ve seriously gotta full‐ass this one, okaay?
 ......I mean, Kinzo\'s practically dead on his feet.
 If you become the next head, you\'ll be the new owner of everything on this island."
"......I wouldn\'t mind letting you have me all to yourself, you know......?
 Just like Kinzo did, ......control me, okay......?
 Kuhhihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi, uhhya{0}hha{0}hha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!"
"Th‐the front entrance of the mansion......
 Perfect...!!
 Listen to me, you stinking drunk!!
 I\'ll sober you up.
 And I\'ve got some {i:hot punch} waiting to help you through your hangover!!
 Just you wait!!"
Battler impulsively slammed the receiver down.
{n}There was no need to talk through a receiver anymore.
......I\'ll meet her face to face and settle this!!
I took the spear I\'d made by taking apart the hat stand,
 and went outside without even an umbrella.
......It\'s hard to imagine that the young woman calling herself {f:5:Beatrice} will be waiting for me alone.
...I should probably assume that she\'ll be waiting with those supporting troops that Gohda‐san and Kumasawa‐san told us about.
Going alone would be too reckless...
"Gohda‐san, Kumasawa‐san...!
 It\'s me, it\'s Battler...!"
I headed for the gardening storehouse first.
{n}I need all the help I can get.
Gohda‐san\'s a burly man, so I can probably count on him to add some extra brawn.
{n}Kumasawa‐san\'s knowledge and familiarity with the area as a senior servant might prove to be a huge weapon.
Both of them have master keys, and they know more about the mansion than I do.
 ......They\'re pretty reliable allies.
As I banged on the shutter and called out for them to open it, I remembered that there was nothing they could do from the inside.
I would have to get the key back from them and open the shutter myself.
I went around to the side, knocked on the small latticed window there, and opened it up.
"Gohda‐san, Kumasawa baa‐chan...!
 It\'s Battler...!!
 Hey, come on, get up...............h...ey........."
The scene in the shed, lit by a dim lightbulb, .........was all too......bizarre......
"......Gohda...
sa...n......
 ......Kumasawa......sa...
......n........."
From a low ceiling beam...
......hung two thick ropes,
 ......and at the ends,
 ......Gohda‐san and Kumasawa‐san...
.........were hanging...by their necks.....
It was dim, and I was looking through a narrow gap between all the various pieces of equipment strewn about, so I couldn\'t make out any more detail than that.
......But when they showed not even a tremor after I called out to them,
 and because of the way the loops around their necks seemed to carry the full weight of their bodies, I could sense no trace of life from them......
"You\'ve got to be............kidding me......right............?
 ......Why........."
The shutter is still closed.
......And there\'s only a single key, which I\'m sure Gohda‐san took possession of.
So how did the culprit......open the shutter and kill the two of them inside......?
No wait, they weren\'t necessarily killed...
{n}If this is a suicide......
......That way, this locked room makes sense, but I don\'t know why the two of them would hang themselves...!!
Feebly, ...I slumped down on the spot.
Now, the only humans alive on this island...
...are me, Maria,
 ......and my old bastard\'s old bastard.
.........No, there\'s also that nutso woman calling herself {f:5:Beatrice}...
Maria\'s been acting like she\'s on the witch\'s side from the beginning.
{n}And Gramps is the very person who revived the witch.
{n}Plus there\'s the witch herself.
......What the hell... .........Then, it\'s just as though...
.........I\'m the only one on this island............
Using my pole as a cane, I feebly rose to my feet.
......Damn, I can\'t do it like this...
{n}I\'ve got to avenge...everyone......
"Damn iiiiiiiit...... This is no good...
 Yeah, it\'s no good, it\'s no goddamn good at all...
 Damn iiiiiiiiiiiiitt........."
I got the crying out of the way while I could...
 So that all my weak emotions would be squeezed out with my tears...
Then, ......I straightened up, and gazed into the darkness in the direction of the mansion.
.........At the entrance to the mansion, the witch is waiting.
I\'ll go, ......and settle this.
I\'ll find the source of this weird, blood‐soaked night, ......and crush her with my own hands...!
Amidst the pouring rain, ......I walked through the rose garden without an umbrella, letting myself get soaked.
......I could see the arbor in the distance.
According to Jessica, it seemed that George‐aniki had also been killed...
Well, by this point, there\'s no need to worry about the lives of any hostages.
{n}......I left the path, aiming for the arbor.
Then,
 ............I saw George‐aniki\'s weather‐beaten corpse...
"...............Aniki......
 ............Shit............"
The corpse was in front of the arbor.
If he could have died under the arbor, he would at least have been spared being beaten down upon by the rain...
There was a gaping hole in Aniki\'s forehead, as though he had been shot with a gun.
Perhaps because the rain had washed everything away, his face wasn\'t covered with blood, ......and so he looked almost like he was sleeping.
...However, the deep red his clothes were stained still provided the evidence that a large amount of blood had flowed out...
How happy I\'d be if he were sleeping, or else pretending to be dead...
......But Aniki\'s eyes remained open, even though the rain sprayed against them.
......And......the hole in his forehead was, without a hint of a joke,
 ......the real thing...
There had been a faint chance...
that Gohda‐san and Kumasawa‐san hanging by their necks in the gardening shed could have been a bad joke.
But that naive possibility had now been completely denied.
And, as I looked at this corpse, I became completely sure.
Just as Gohda‐san had once said.
 ......The enemy came to take lives as though these lives were pieces on a chess board.
".........Yeah, ......there\'s no mistake.
 ......It seems that old geezer and the witch...
......really don\'t view our lives as anything more than that......"
...That damn witch, when she was on the phone...
{n}She talked about us like we were "on the game board"......
"...Perfect......
 ......Right, she thinks this is a game, huh......
 Then, ...in the same way you killed everyone like it was a game,
 .........it\'s alright if I kill all of you like it\'s a game as well, right......?"
"............Just you wait......
 ......{f:5:Beatrice}........."
The lightning caused the mansion\'s vast shadow to emerge.
......Finally, ......the mansion.
As the massive shape came into view, there was no silhouette of any person.
{n}It seemed that there weren\'t any underlings waiting for me in a pack, or anything like that.
.........According to Kyrie‐san, there were a large number of attendants with goat heads.
At least for now, I couldn\'t sense...
any large group like that hiding and staring at me...
What\'s this......?
{n}Beneath the roof of the entrance,
 .........there\'s something set down.
"......What is this?
 .........A...box?"
It looked like the kind of small box that girls often keep trinkets in.
......Or maybe it was the same kind of extravagant cigar case you\'d find in a reception room.
Either way, it didn\'t look like something that belonged here...
{n}It clearly looked......as though I was being told to open it.
But the thought of doing what they wanted me to do was somehow irritating.
{n}......However, it didn\'t look like we\'d get anywhere if I didn\'t open it.
Could it be that it\'s set up with some trap to make it explode when opened......?
While thinking things like that, and forgetting even to go under the overhang,
 I continued to glare at the box as the rain beat down upon me.
Then, .........mixed in with the thunder, was some kind of......music?
 ...It sounded like something like that.
......It was the tone of the big clock in the hall announcing midnight.
It was also the sound that announced that the crazy day of October 4th had finally ended,
 ......and that the much more incredibly crazy day of October 5th had begun.
That sound quietened, ............and I could hear an eerie laugh coming out of nowhere......
I got the feeling that the voice was coming from the heavens, ......and I looked up at the sky.
......And there.........was a woman I had never seen before.
{n}No, it\'s not true that I\'ve never seen her before.
{n}......I saw her once today.
Yes, in the portrait inside the mansion......
The clothes were different, ......but that face was just like the witch of the portrait......
Aaah, who am I kidding... I already know who this person is...!!
"......S‐......so you are {f:5:Beatrice}!!!"
"Yooohooooooooo, Battleeeeeeeeeeeeer...!!"
Leaning over the second floor balcony, ......and waving cheerily from under her umbrella,
 ......was, without a doubt, ......the witch of the portrait, ...{f:5:Beatrice}.........!!
Was the plan for the boss to watch on from above as her goat underlings torture me to death...?!
I adjusted my grip on the spear,
 and, imagining goats creeping out of the surrounding shadows and the entrance and surrounding me, I raised my guard in all directions...
"Ahhaha, be at ease, there\'s no one here but you and me, see?
 There is no goat furniture, there are no demon butlers; Master is not here, nor my close demon friend."
"And there are none of the gold butterflies that help compose my physical form, there are no magic circles, and no summoners in attendance!!
 ......Do you know what this means?"
"Not a clue.
 Quit babbling..."
"I have in fact met you several times even in this world.
 Almost as though brushing past one another, meeting only for a moment.
 ......As you know, this world of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s is filled with a toxin just by your existence and your doubting of me."
"Almost like solid ramparts strengthening the defense around you, the king!
 And through multiple games,
 I advanced my pieces one by one, splitting you apart, and cornering you, undermining your ramparts bit by bit."
"Then, finally, once I opened a tiny crack, I sent a bishop in, so that it could approach right up next to you.
 .........But as you know, bishops are pieces with blind spots."
"As long as you stay on the black squares, a black bishop can exert massive influence upon you,
 but if you escape just one step to a white square, then even if I close in right next to you, I will not be able to touch you."
"That is why I have progressed through these games by sending in various pieces so that you cannot stay on a white square,
 forcing you out in front of me, the one who controls the black squares next to you."
"Howeeever!!"
"There are now holes opened all over your ramparts,
 and I was at last able to send in, not a bishop, but a full queen!!
 Do you know what kind of piece a queen is?"
"A rook plus a bishop.
 ......Is this what you\'re trying to say?
 ...Now, you not only control the black squares that are the witch illusions, but have also become able to encroach upon the white squares of the human world at will...?!"
"That is correct!!
 Where there exist the gold butterflies that are my minions, you have been labeling those squares as witch illusions,
 denying them under the hypothesis that they are observerless nonreality, am I right...?
 *cackle*cackle*, I am well aware......!!"
"For that very reason, I have at last descended thus upon the squares of white!!
 Worry not, I\'ll call plenty of gold butterflies, goats, demons, and witches later on!
 If you wish, I will invite you to my Golden Land!!"
"There, I will grant you any wish that you desire...!!
 Wahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!!"
"......It\'s starting to look like someone knocked an ink bottle over the chessboard of this island."
"I see, that too is a pleasant description...!
 *cackle*cackle*, soon, you will be covered in that ink as well.
 Before long, you will become dyed pitch‐black, and surely become a black king...!
 At this point, you are a pitiful existence drowning in a sea of ink, are you not?"
"No, I\'m not.
 I\'ll admit that the island has been stained completely black from your ink bottle,
 ......but there\'s still a white square left."
"Hoh, and where...?!!"
"Right under my feet.
 .........Your magic ink may try to cover the entire island, but it can\'t cover the ground my feet are standing on.
 ...Even if this island seems to be stained pitch‐black at a glance, I am me.
 I am here, with my feet firmly planted on a white square!!"
It\'s strange...
 Until a second ago, I was trembling all over.
......But now that she\'s appeared openly right before my eyes like this, my terror has actually lessened.
It\'s funny.
 Ghosts are most terrifying when you can only sense them.
When you can see them, and they have a face you can plant your fist into, there\'s nothing scary about it...!!
......However, she is definitely not a funny or a friendly person.
......She can kill me instantly while rolling around giggling, just by snapping a finger.
Whether we interpret the result of her snapping her fingers as magic flying at me or underlings showing up to shoot me, it doesn\'t matter.
......In any case, whether this is fantasy or mystery,
 that queen is in a position where she can kill me just by snapping her fingers......!
...I see, ......so this is the meaning...
......of the queen of this island,
 ...who reigns over both the white and black squares......?!
"Now then.
 It might be interesting to wait until you catch a cold in all that rain, but it\'s about time to move to the matter at hand.
 .........I am sure that you can tell there is a box there?
 Your test is inside of it."
"Hold it.
 ......After all that\'s happened, I\'m not interested in some stupid game about who\'ll be the next head."
"My game is to take you and the old man, ......and all the rest of you guys who killed everyone, and give every one of you a full‐on punch to the face."
"Hoh.
 So you will fly through the sky up to my balcony?
 Very good, very good, *cackle*!
 Come on then, up you come already, come on come on, up up!"
"......Damn you, acting like you\'re hot shit just \'cause you\'re in a completely safe place...
 I\'m coming up there right now, so you better be prepared!!"
"Aah, no, no, no.
 It\'s all locked up.
 Of course, the shutters are down for all the windows as well.
 My castle isn\'t so fragile that a single knight like you could break in!"
I tried the front door anyway just in case, ......but, yup, it really was locked.
{n}When I looked around, I noticed that indeed the shutters were closed on the windows.
......Normally, they wouldn\'t be.
"......Tch.
 Looks like you prepare for everything.
 ......Where\'s the key?!"
Gohda‐san and Kumsawa‐san probably have master keys, but they\'re in the locked room of the gardening storehouse.
......I can only give up for now...!
"Damn......
 ......Guess she\'s no fool herself."
"Are you really so dying to be right by my siiiide?
 Alright, if you pass your test with flying colors, why don\'t I grant you an audience?
 If you pass, then you will be the successor, and my new master after Kinzo."
"......My body and soul will be yours to do with as you will.
 Because I am ultimately the Ushiromiya family\'s furniture!
 Ah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah!!"
"............Well,
 it looks like you want to make me take this test no matter what.
 ......Alright.
 I\'m game.
 ...If I pass, my first prize will be a punch to your face."
"Scary, scaary...
 But it\'s not like I mind being controlled by violence, you see?
 {i:Grab}...onto my head!
 Make my face twist in pain, violate me in the same way a hawk tears apart and scratches at its prey with its talons...!!"
"Aaah, remind me of Kinzo in his younger days once more...!!
 That single time in my thousand‐year life!
 Remind me of that day I was taught the joy of being controlled, of submitting and being reduced to furnituuuuuuuure!!
 Uhyaaa{0}hhya{0}hhya{0}hhya{0}hhya!!"
"......You damn drunk, we aren\'t getting anywhere."
Ignoring the stupidly smiling witch, I picked up the box.
"Yes.
 Open it.
 Inside is a letter.
 Read it."
"........................"
I opened it.
 ......There was a faint smell of cigarettes.
{n}Apparently, it really had originally been a cigar case.
{n}But there were no cigarettes or cigars inside.
Instead, there was a Western envelope with the One‐winged Eagle crest.
{n}And when I opened that too, ......there was a letter inside.
I looked up at the witch.
 She was grinning down at me.
......It seemed she was waiting in anticipation to see what kind of reaction I\'d have to the contents.
......Dammit, I\'ll show her.
 Its contents were like this...
{a:c:{e:070:Among the three mentioned below.
{n}In order to gain two, sacrifice one.
{n}{n}1. Your life
{n}2. __\'s life
{n}3. Everyone else\'s lives
{n}{n}If you do not choose one, all of the above will be lost.}}
".........The heck is this?
 Some pretty creepy stuff\'s written here.
 And most importantly, the second one is blank, so I don\'t even know whose life."
"Mm.
 That second one is where you put the name of the one that person loves the most.
 For Jessica\'s test, it was Kanon\'s name, and for George\'s test it was Shannon\'s name."
"......Since they had obvious feelings for certain people, I was able to write those names in beforehand,
 but I don\'t know who you have feelings for.
 So I didn\'t know whose name to write, and left it blank."
"That\'s perfect.
 I love you, {f:5:Beatrice}.
 I\'ll stick your name in here.
 So my choice is going to be number two.
 Is that alright?"
"Hey, hey, quit joking, quit joking.
 Come onnn, please, Battler.
 Tell me the name of the person you have feelings for.
 If you don\'t, then this won\'t be a test, right?"
"Too bad.
 I don\'t have any woman in particular.
 Even if I did, why the hell would I tell you?"
"In that case, this test will not work for you.
 Hmmm, what a shame, what a shame.
 And I was really wondering what kind of woman was your cup of tea!
 *cackle*cackle*!"
".........What if I said I like young, flat‐chested girls with long, black hair.
 You don\'t match in a single area, do you?"
"Lies, you breast sommelier!
 You prefer a blonde bombshell with a <dynamite body>, don\'t you?!
 I am precisely the embodiment of your ideal, *cackle*cackle*!"
"If guessing your three sizes is the test to become the successor, I\'ll take it gladly."
"Ah, yes.
 This was the test to choose the successor.
 Chatting with you is so much fun that I\'ve been getting a bit off topic."
"......Then let us begin the headship test.
 I will question you to see whether you are qualified to be the next Ushiromiya family head.
 Answer with care."
The witch, who had been joking around like she was drunk until a second ago, suddenly regained her gravitas.
......She looked as though she truly had stepped out of that imposing portrait...
".........I am the Ushiromiya family alchemist, the Golden Witch and the Endless Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}."
"......Do you have the qualifications to inherit the Ushiromiya family headship and all of my gold—
that is what I will test.
 .........State your name."
"............Ushiromiya...Battler."
Under that majestic gaze, unimaginable from her manner a short while ago,
 I answered without any hesitation.
......She truly was......yes, indeed,
 ......in the truest sense, she was that worthy of calling herself the queen of this island.
"Very good, Ushiromiya Battler.
 .........However, you have thrown away that Ushiromiya name for the past six years, have you not...?
 Why is that...?"
".........mgh............
 ......Because I\'d had enough of my dad, the old bastard."
"I know.
 It was because you felt your father\'s remarriage disgraced the death of your mother, whom you loved and respected, yes...?"
"I see, you have no blood relation to your new mother whatsoever.
 It is not as though I cannot understand why you would feel unable to accept that mother.
 ......However, no matter who your father remarries with, that does not change the fact that his blood runs in your veins, correct?"
".........What\'s your point?"
"I can, to an extent, understand the childishness which led you to oppose your father\'s remarriage out of a desire to have him all to yourself."
"However, was throwing away the Ushiromiya name as a means of resistance not a disgrace to your family and blood?"
".........You were born and raised Ushiromiya, were you not?
 Do you think you were qualified to forget that debt and throw away the Ushiromiya name?"
"......It has nothing to do with you.
 This is between me and Dad...!"
"The Ushiromiya name does not belong to you and your father alone.
 You are a child who simply rebelled, unable to forgive the fact that your father was to be stolen away by an unknown woman.
 ......Those six years during which you forsook the Ushiromiya register were a significantly long period where you dragged the Ushiromiya name through the mud.
 Know the depths of your sinfulness."
"..................Well, sorry I\'m so childish..."
"However.
 Even though it was prompted by the deaths of your grandparents, I do commend you for returning to the Ushiromiya register.
 Accordingly, I shall give you a chance to purify yourself of that sin.
 Now is the time to atone for your sin of six years ago."
"Come, try to remember, remember your own sin.
 Remember it, confess, and repent.
 ............That shall be my test for you."
......At that moment, a massive thunderclap rang out, making my mind go blank.
"..............................
 ......Repent? ...What?
 .........Are you trying to tell me to apologize?"
".........The test has already begun.
 You may think as you wish."
There were no signs from the witch\'s expression that she was sneering at a person unable to answer the tough question thrust upon them.
{n}......She was earnestly asking something of him, and he could even feel a quiet determination.
Even as the rain beat upon him, Battler could not shift his eyes from her gaze.
......The witch threw her umbrella away.
{n}She abandoned herself to the falling rain.
So that the rain would fall on her until Battler answered that question.
......She had chosen to join him, allowing the rain to beat down on her as well, until he reached an answer.
For some reason, Battler could tell that.
{n}......But, even so, ......he didn\'t understand.
"W‐......well, ...uh.
 ......I mean, you\'re right, I do think I was being childish...
 All things considered, just \'cause Dad got remarried, that doesn\'t wipe out what I owe him for raising me."
"......I hear Dad always kept on sending money over for my living expenses,
 ......and he even said he wanted to be involved in my school events.
 .........The only reason he couldn\'t come is......I told Grandma and Grandpa not to let him come no matter what......"
"......................................."
"......A‐and yeah, ......if you want to just be blunt and say I was being childish and rebellious, I can\'t argue with that.
 .........But you know, ...in that case,
 ......Mom, ......Ushiromiya Asumu, who\'s gonna set things right for her...?!
 Mom was so devoted to our family, and did the very best she could...!"
"But Dad was cheating with Kyrie‐san.
 He even got her pregnant with Ange...!
 And then the moment she was born, he rushed them both into his register."
"......What is that if not a betrayal of Mom?!
 Who\'s gonna set things...
right...
for her?!!"
"......But what you\'re saying is also right.
 Even though the cheating was a fact, I still owed him for raising me."
"So I thought I\'d cancel those two things out and leave the family, what\'s the problem with that?!!
 That\'s right, I had the right, ......no, the duty to wallop Dad in Mom\'s place, didn\'t I?!"
"I let him get away without that!
 I left without saying anything, as though I hadn\'t been there in the first place!!
 And Dad forgot about me and started a new family with Kyrie‐san and Ange!
 That settles everything, doesn\'t it?!!"
But six years passed after that.
 ......Time healed the anger.
Kyrie‐san understood my anger as well,
 and she tried hard to interact with me despite that, and soften my heart.
Ange didn\'t know anything about the situation,
 and she adored me, believing that I was her real big brother who just lived in a separate house.
......As for Dad, he was acting like nothing had happened, and told me I could come home any time I wanted.
"It started to feel more and more stupid keeping it all going!!
 I thought it was about time for me to cool my head as well.
 So I said to Dad that if he apologized, I\'d call it water under the bridge.
 On the day of Grandpa\'s funeral."
"And that guy, he actually put both his hands on the floor and apologized...!!
 I couldn\'t believe how pathetic he looked...!"
"My dad, who was all about looking cool, actually bowed his goddamn head to me...!
 ......When I saw that, it felt like it\'d be stupid to keep it up any longer."
"I\'m sure Mom would\'ve thought the same thing!
 Every time Dad and I fought, Mom would always laugh and mediate for us.
 "Oh, that silly thing is what you were fighting over?"
 she\'d say.
 ......I could feel Mom saying that and laughing...!!"
"That\'s why,
 ......while I couldn\'t bring myself to say "I forgive you",
 .........I thought it might be alright to start over again from zero.
 So I decided to wind everything back to how it was six years ago.
 .........And I returned to the Ushiromiya family register...!!
 I\'d cried, raged, and stressed over it for a whole six years!"
"It might have been the same for Dad, and maybe even for my dead mom.
 Maybe Kyrie‐san and Ange too.
 ......So we went back to zero, and I returned to being Ushiromiya Battler!!!
 That\'s my immediate family\'s problem,
 ......and has nothing the hell to do with the Ushiromiya family!!"
"You aren\'t qualified to judge that to be a sin, and I have no duty to show repentance to you!
 If there was anyone I should have done that for, you\'ve already killed them!!"
"So I won\'t apologize for anything!
 I won\'t repent!!!
 That is my answer for this test!!!"
"..........................................
 ......Is that all...?"
"What.........?
 .................."
I had pretty much fully responded to her provocation,
 and I was sure that I\'d vented out all the stuff that I\'d been keeping inside my chest, stuff I hadn\'t wanted to show anyone.
That was what the witch had supposedly been hoping for, too.
 ......And yet, the witch\'s blank expression didn\'t change in the slightest.
I had been sure she would start cackling and guffawing,
 sneering at my childish, foolish, and shameful past.
But to the contrary, I could feel a sense of shock about her,
 ......something you could almost call disappointment.
".........What do you mean "is that all", ......I\'ve confessed everything inside me!
 What aren\'t you happy about?"
"The atonement for your sins is still insufficient."
"Atonement?
 ......What the hell, are you asking me to prostrate myself right here and apologize like Dad did...?!"
"............No.
 I have no interest in the home affairs of your immediate family.
 Where are we?
 Rokkenjima.
 The main residence of the Ushiromiya head family.
 ......Isn\'t there a sin you should remember, fitting for this place......?"
"............Are you......saying that I have...another sin......?"
"......Remember, Ushiromiya Battler.
 .........And it is your inability to remember which is your sin.
 For that reason, I shall forgive you.
 If you can remember, I shall forgive you.
 .........Remembering that is my test of atonement for you."
".........That\'s......a lot easier said than done......"
"............Remember.
 ......That is why it is a sin."
"...Sorry, Beato.
 ......I have absolutely no memory of it."
"......You make it seem like I caused you trouble six years ago or something,
 but unless I\'m mistaken, this family conference is the first time we met.
 It\'s true that your legend did exist six years ago,
 but I\'m pretty confident that we didn\'t know each other back then."
"......Naturally.
 On the Rokkenjima of six years ago, I was not yet manifested."
"Then what kind of sin are you saying I have?
 ......Are you saying......I\'ve sinned against you somehow...?"
"Do not make me repeat myself.
 I was not manifested six years ago.
 For us to have been acquainted would be an impossibility.
 In the world you represent, it was as though I did not even exist."
......Beato\'s cold eyes......felt as though they were accusing me of some kind of sin.
It felt, on the face of it, as though she was still holding a grudge for some way I\'d treated her, and was criticizing me for it.
However, ......I obviously couldn\'t remember doing anything like that to her, and Beato had said so herself.
There was no link between us six years ago.
{p:1:Six years ago, no person called {f:5:Beatrice} existed for me}.
".........At least give me a hint.
 ......Does this sin or whatever...have something to do with...
...you and me......?"
"I had no connection to you six years ago.
 Remove me from your thoughts already.
 ......Why...do you think it is a sin against {i:me}?"
".........Your......eyes."
"Eyes...?
 ............Hoh."
"Your eyes, they\'re......whispering at me to apologize.
 ......But I had no connection with you six years ago, and even you admitted that."
"............Is it true?
 ......Is it really not a problem between me and you......?"
".........I already said it wasn\'t.
 No problem between me and you has anything to do with this."
"But still, ......your eyes are telling me differently.
 ............So I don\'t even have a clue.
 .........Can you say it in red?
 Can you declare that the sin you\'re telling me to remember isn\'t something between you and me?"
"...........................
 ......Very well."
{p:1:The sin I am now demanding that you remember is not between Ushiromiya Battler and {f:5:Beatrice}}.
".........Then why are you looking at me with those eyes......?"
"I do not know.
 .........I am simply gazing at you blankly.
 If it feels that way to you,
 ......perhaps that is because there is something that makes you feel that way."
"........................
 .........What the hell kind of sin have I got?"
"{p:1:Ushiromiya Battler has a sin}."
"......I said what kind, dammit.
 It\'s probably just some stupid sin, like hitting someone or tricking someone."
"{p:1:Because of your sin, people die}."
"L‐liar...!
 I\'ve never killed anyone...!!
 Say it, then!
 Who did I kill?!
 When? Who? How?!"
"{p:1:Due to your sin, a great many humans on this island die}.
 {p:1:None will escape, all will die}."
"Wh‐.........whaaaaat?!?!
 Wh‐what the hell are you going on about?!
 Are you saying {i:I} killed everyone?!
 I\'m a killer?!"
"You do not carry it out directly.
 .........However, because you committed a sin, the cogs of fate were sent astray, spun a full six years, and due to the deviation that resulted,
 ......tonight, this many lives are lost."
"{i:You are one of the causes of this tragedy}."
"......Oh, ......come the fuck on!!
 {i:I\'m} the cause?!
 Then what?!
 Are you saying thirteen people died because {i:I} abandoned the Ushiromiya register six years ago?!
 Are you saying thirteen people died because {i:I} came back to the Ushiromiya family after six years?!"
"Give me a fucking break!!!
 For these six years, I\'ve been the man furthest from the Ushiromiya family!
 What influence could {i:I} have had on {i:anything} and how?!"
"It\'s not like I came to the family conference because I wanted to!
 I\'d patched things up with the family after six years, so to like, draw a line under that whole period,
 I came to Rokkenjima reluctantly...!!
 It\'s not like I had some duty to come here today!"
"I came back, and because of that a tragedy occurred?
 Then what?!
 You\'re saying that if I hadn\'t come back, no one would\'ve had to die?!"
"Say it in red!!
 Can you say in red that if I hadn\'t come back, this screwed‐up murder case wouldn\'t have occurred?!
 ......There\'s no way you can, because you\'re the culprit behind everything!!"
"Repetition requested!!
 "If Ushiromiya Battler hadn\'t returned to Rokkenjima, the crime wouldn\'t have occurred".
 Go on, say it if you think you can...!!"
"......Can\'t do it, can you?
 There\'s no way in hell you can, the culprit is you, not me!!
 Don\'t you dare try to push the blame for this onto meeeeeeee!!!"
"......................................."
"......Answer, in red!!
 I said repeat it...!!
 You can\'t!
 My existence has nothing to do with the crime.
 Stop messing with my heeeaaaad!!!"
I began to remember that the raindrops pounding down were cold.
......The rain earlier had just hurt,
 ......but now I felt a tormenting cold from those raindrops......
".................................
 ......Is there nothing that you remember?"
".........Sorry,
 but I don\'t have a goddamn clue."
".............................."
"......Look.
 ......I\'m starting to get a little pissed off.
 ......If there\'s something you wanna say, then say it.
 If you have a grudge against me, you just have to come out and say it.
 ......Don\'t be nasty about it and demand for me to remember."
"............I\'ll ask one more time.
 ......Can you not remember any sin?"
"No!!
 I can\'t remember a goddamn thing...!!"
".........So...
...he says that he can remember...nothing."
With this, are your regrets at an end......?
"...........................
 ...............m...m..."
Even a hopelessly long shot will be a source of regret if not attempted.
......That will do.
The attempt itself has meaning.
".........That may be true.
 ...In that case, this is...
the end of my regrets, and my game."
What will you do...?
"...Who knows.
 .........I\'m not interested at all anymore.
 ......Sorry, but I wish to leave the game board now."
..............................
 ......I see.
 ......I understand.
"I will take over for the rest of the game.
 .........You may rest."
"......Mm.
 ..............."
"All that remains, I will finish.
 .........You may forget everything and bury your head in your pillow.
 A feather futon should gently protect you from everything."
".........Finish up the rest for me, ......please."
"Leave it to me.
 ......Leave everything else to me, and sleep."
The witch who had questioned Battler hid herself,
 and the other witch, who had appeared from behind, remained.
She was certainly identical, the same witch,
 .........but her expression was somehow indifferent and ice‐cold,
 ......a far cry from the one before, who, though apparently drunk, had at least been in high spirits.
"...............Hey!!
 Are you listening?!
 That\'s enough for that test thing, right?!
 I don\'t give a crap whether I passed or failed!
 The only thing that\'s gonna help the way I\'m feeling is bashing you in the face!!
 Get the hell down here!!
 Or else open up this door...!!"
The witch said nothing back.
Her eyes were as ice‐cold as Battler\'s shoulders.
......She was clearly a different person from the one who had first appeared on that balcony.
The witch looked hard into my eyes, ......and gave two small shakes of the head.
Even without words, I was able to gather that she was expressing some kind of disappointment...
Without saying anything, the witch turned on her heels.
After that, only Battler remained, the cold rain still beating down on him.........
The study was in the middle of a lively party.
It seemed that Gaap was making fun of {f:5:Virgilia}, teasing her over some stupid triviality.
...They were spitting "Lialialia", "Gapgapgap" at each other.
Kinzo and Ronove had opened a new bottle and were enjoying the show.
"Oh, you\'re back.
 How were the results of Battler\'s test?!"
"Maria\'s test got passing marks with no complaints, I\'ll have you know?
 I\'ve long held her in contempt as a worthless little urchin,
 but lo and behold, surprise surprise, {nobr:my oh} {nobr:my oh} {nobr:my oh} my, not bad, not bad, not bad indeed!
 Wa‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah!!"
It seemed like Kinzo was dead drunk.
{n}He laughed towards Beato with the same level of excitation as the time they\'d left for the tests.
...However, Ronove and {f:5:Virgilia} instantly noticed the change in her enthusiasm.
Gaap also froze her expression and went silent.
"Wahhahahahahahhahha, what is it, {f:5:Beatrice}, my beloved witch?
 Not enough to drink? Not enough on the side?
 Let\'s go out in the pouring rain and roast a cow whole, oohhh, not a bad idea!"
"Ronove, make the preparations right away!
 {f:5:Beatrice}, let\'s leave the results of Battler\'s test for later.
 Why don\'t we have a toast with spare ribs first, uwa‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah!!"
"..................Roast yourself whole."
"‐ha‐hah‐hah‐hah,
 ......what?"
As Kinzo doubled over laughing in a great mood, the witch who had spoken bluntly passed him coldly by.
......Then, behind the witch\'s back,
 .........the old summoner\'s body suddenly went up in flames...
"Gyuoaaaaooaahhh!!!!
 Gwohh, gah, ......gyah.........w...h...y............?!"
While spitting crimson flames from his eyes, mouth, nose...every hole on his body, Kinzo rolled around.
......Even though it was a terrible hellfire, it didn\'t burn anything except Kinzo.
Kinzo didn\'t have a clue what was going on.
......He rolled around, unable to understand why {f:5:Beatrice}, who had been in such a good mood,
 had suddenly turned so cold......
The dancing silhouettes of witches and demons created by that massive rolling torch...
looked like a group of excited spectators around a burning at the stake.
However, the eyes of the demons watching over it were indifferent......
When Kinzo finally stopped moving, the fire disappeared, leaving a pitch‐black corpse.
The inside of the room was commanded by the stillness of the sound of the rain......
"......What has happened, Milady?"
"It has lost its thrill.
 .........Clean up those bothersome cinders."
{f:5:Beatrice}\'s expression......was unbelievably apathetic.
...There was an iciness there that told the others that they risked the same fate as Kinzo if they annoyed her.
"............Y‐yes.
 I will do it..."
Gaap made a jet‐black pitfall swallow up Kinzo\'s cinders.
...If she hadn\'t carried that out quickly, Gaap might also have been burned.
 You could feel that thirst for blood.
No, a thirst for blood probably isn\'t the best way to describe it.
......Just like humans don\'t have any particular emotion when they step on an ant while walking.
......That was how much, unconsciously and mercilessly, Beato was now filled with a brutal emptiness that wouldn\'t hesitate to bury a passerby...
"......Wh‐what is it, Beato?"
"I don\'t want to answer.
 ...............No, I can\'t even be bothered to answer any more."
".........What is it? This isn\'t like you.
 ......Did something happen?
 Did Battler say someth—"
".........k...g...gyhh—"
{f:5:Beatrice} hadn\'t even responded.
 It seemed that she had even ignored it.
But there was a change in Gaap.
From her feet, a crackling, cracking sound rose, like thin ice breaking,
 ......and in an instant, turned Gaap into a glass sculpture.
"G‐......Gaap..."
"............Disappear for a while.
 I\'m in a very bad mood."
{f:5:Beatrice} spoke in a truly cold voice,
 ......which froze the heart just to hear it.
"......Certainly.
 In that case, please allow us to retire.
 .........If you need anything, call at any time."
After a single bow, Ronove turned into a cloud of gold butterflies, and hid himself.
{f:5:Virgilia} turned Gaap from a sculpture into a group of gold butterflies,
 and then turned into a cloud of them herself, which mixed in with the others and disappeared.
............In the study made untidy by drinking,
 ......{f:5:Beatrice} stood still, alone.
Since the time she had returned, her expression hadn\'t changed in the slightest...
......However, when she saw the fallen empty wine bottles and scattered cheese plates,
 her brow furrowed, and she looked a bit displeased.
And when she whispered "disappear", in that instant, the room flashed, and was tidy again, as though nothing had ever happened.
The reception chairs were neatly arranged, and there was no wine or cheese.
{n}There were no stains where things had been spilled, nor was there any scattered trash.
......To the contrary, even the air had frozen over,
 and, enough to make one doubt whether so many noisy people really had been in this room until just moments ago,
 .........the study had returned to total silence.
.........In that silent, ......frigid study where even the air had frozen,
 {f:5:Beatrice} stood still...
Then, she called him in a mutter.
"..................Battler.
 Are you there?"
"......I\'ve been here for a while.
 .........What the hell\'s going on with you?
 You\'ve been acting strange."
"Do I seem strange?
 My apologies."
"............Even though you were having such a good time drinking with that damn old fart, you suddenly burned him up,
 and your demoness friend is a glass sculpture.
 ......Even your demon butler and your master got a "disappear and get the hell out".
 ......Just how fickle and selfish are you?"
"Battler. I\'m done."
"With what?"
"............I\'ve had enough, now."
"Wha?
 .........Well, uh, you were the one who cooked up this game.
 Heh, if you\'ve had enough, that\'s great for me.
 So basically, you\'re resigning?"
"I am not resigning.
 I am just ending it.
 No, I won\'t even end it.
 The game will simply be abandoned for all eternity."
"Pretty sure they call that resigning.
 ......Man, the words "got tired of it and threw it away" fit you perfectly."
"Precisely.
 I am tired of it and am throwing it away.
 I don\'t care about the rest.
 It can remain abandoned and gather dust as much as it likes."
"........................
 ......What\'s up with you?
 You\'ve been kinda hard to deal with since a short while ago."
"......Are you still sour over that baffling test?
 If you\'ve got something against me, all you have to do is say it clearly."
"You said in red that it has nothing to do with you, but that\'s got to be a play on words, right?
 It\'s written all over your face.
 You have a grudge against me."
"How many times will I have to say I have no grudge against you before you\'ll understand?
 At the time you left your sin behind, I did not exist."
As Beato spoke with an irritated expression, her face twisted to look even more displeased.
Fickle.
 Inconsistent.
 Moody.
 Temperamental.
 ......Selfish and simple‐minded and cruel.
But even so, she had never shown an expression as strange as this even once before now...
"............Well, you were the one who instigated this game.
 I\'m a bit let down that it won\'t get resolved, but feel free to invite me again sometime if you feel like it.
 But when that time comes, allow me to politely decline, alright?
 Heheheh."
He intentionally spoke in a teasing kind of tone, but Beato showed no reaction.
......Battler hung his head and clicked his tongue...
"I\'ve circled around October 4th and 5th over and over again, but it looks like I\'m finally going to be free of all that now.
 ......This way, the boat will come tomorrow."
"...That\'s right, then the seagulls will return to the harbor.
 ......I\'ll finally be able to hear Rokkenjima\'s signature "nyaa nyaa" cries.
 After all, when I came to the island, they weren\'t there at all, maybe because of the weather."
".........‘When the seagulls cry, everything will end’, basically.
 ......Done and done, all over, the end.
 Man, what a relief."
".........Exactly what is it that you\'re misunderstanding?"
"Hm?
 What do you mean what?"
".........I said that nothing would end.
 With this, everything will be abandoned.
 The game will be forgotten, and the pieces on the board will be left where they lie.
 There will be no advancing, no retreating, no taking or being taken.
 No victory, no defeat, not even a tie.
 Just abandoned."
"............Doesn\'t that mean it\'s over?"
"Wrong.
 On my turn, the game will stop for all eternity.
 Your turn will not come.
 So there will be no victory, nor defeat, nor a tie."
".........In the past, I could not allow you to do that to me.
 That was because I had the goal of victory against you.
 However, I have lost interest in that.
 So there is no longer any point in me making any further moves."
"............What do you mean by...my turn won\'t come...?"
I\'d thought that Beato getting tired of the game meant I\'d be released, and I\'d be able to escape Rokkenjima.
But for some reason, the meaning of Beato\'s repeated words about the difference between abandoning the game and settling it...
...was starting to bother me...
.........Just what has she been saying, ...and why the bad mood......?
Suddenly, I heard a voice from behind me.
When I turned around, ......there was someone I thought I might, or might not, remember from somewhere...
......A mysterious girl, with no light in her eyes, was standing there.
".........What she means is something like this.
 ......Putting the lid back on this game, leaving the pieces as they are.
 Without ending, the game will be locked away for all eternity."
"The only way for you to return to your original world is to win against Beato.
 .........So Beato abandoning the game would mean...
 ......Get it?"
Suddenly, in another place, there was a girl wearing a bright pink dress.
......I had a feeling I\'d met her somewhere too, but I couldn\'t remember.
More important was the meaning of the words she said.
{n}......The game being abandoned means......huh?
".........That\'s all there is to it.
 No match can reach its conclusion without two opposing sides.
 .........It means that you\'ll never be able to win and escape this world for all eternity."
"In the end, ......it\'s kinda like taking the key to the cage that you\'re locked in,
 fastening it to the collar of a pigeon or something and letting it fly, I guess."
"............This isn\'t funny, Beato.
 We didn\'t come all the way here to watch a boring game like this.
 Just wrapping it up here? You have to be kidding me."
".........I\'m with Lambda.
 I came here to make Battler win, and to make you thrash about in defeat.
 I still haven\'t achieved that goal.
 ......I couldn\'t bear for the game to be abandoned here, for you to just run away on me."
"I acknowledge that the way the curtain has fallen on this game has made for a disappointing end for you ladies.
 ......However, I, the host of this tea party, am after all fickle.
 Once the fun is gone, I know no way of entertaining.
 ......I believe that to be what makes me the witch I am in the first place.
 There should be no problems with this...?"
"..............................
 ......True.
 I won\'t go against your creed."
"I won\'t stand for this...
 ......Don\'t you dare, how much do you think I\'ve supported you...
 All that preparation, and you want me just to pack it all in now?
 I don\'t think so...!!"
"I am saying that I have tired of it.
 Nothing more, nothing less."
"That\'s not happening...
 You\'re going to continue this game.
 You want to win against Battler, right?
 You want to win and make him submit, right?!
 You\'re almost there!
 Isn\'t she~?!"
".........D‐don\'t turn to me for agreement.
 ......That said, I do have an opinion too.
 If you\'ll let me say it."
"............What."
"You brought this fight to my door.
 I\'m prepared to settle this fight one way or the other.
 ......I\'ve come close to surrendering many times,
 but I\'ve never had any intention of escaping part‐way through, leaving the match undecided."
"......As long as I\'m here, showing the will to fight,
 ......don\'t you go running away, {f:5:Beatrice}."
"............I agree.
 Getting Battler involved and then leaving without giving him victory or defeat is just beyond irresponsible."
Suddenly, even Gretel was there.
{n}......And everyone was criticizing Beato for being irresponsible.
"Hoh.
 .........It seems that the greatest reason I am being called irresponsible is that Battler will be stuck as an opponent."
".........In that case, Battler.
 Will you step down from being an opponent, as I shall?
 That way, there will be nothing to criticize me for."
"If I step down, will I be able to leave Rokkenjima...?"
"Of course not.
 Just be covered in dust and let it pile up on your shoulders."
".........Stop being so stupid.
 Just how irresponsible are you?
 You\'ve killed all this many people.
 On top of that, using your witch\'s power, you\'ve done it over and over.
 In gruesome ways!
 .........There\'s no way I can allow you to escape without taking responsibility...!"
"Responsibility.
 ......Hoh, what is it I should do to take this so‐called responsibility?"
"Fight until a resolution is reached.
 Battler will sit in the chair across from you, never giving up, and fighting until he beats you.
 So you too fight until you\'re defeated.
 If you don\'t want that to happen, then try and defeat him...!!"
"I won\'t let you...leave everything unresolved and abandon Battler in this chair,
 ......lock him up forevermore and never let him return...
 .........I won\'t let you......!!"
"......Gretel."
To be perfectly honest,
 I didn\'t really understand from what standpoint Gretel was trying to save me.
......But in her words,
 I could feel a strong determination to save me from this crazy game world no matter what.
So, I also responded to that.
"Beato.
 Face this way."
"....................."
"I am here.
 Across from you, in the rival\'s seat.
 ......Get it?
 As long as I continue to sit here,
 I won\'t permit you to escape.
 ......So don\'t run away. Fight."
"You started this fight, dammit.
 All the crap you\'ve pulled, again and again and again, the total shitshow you\'ve turned this whole thing into!
 And now after all this time you think I can let you end it because you\'re {i:tired} of it?!!"
"I am your opponent!!
 As long as I\'m here,
 there\'s no way I\'m letting you escape!!"
"Are you listening, you goddamn Witch of Irresponsibility?!
 Why don\'t you say some{-}thiii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}ing!!!"
After I yelled at her, ......Beato went silent for a while.
Whether my words had reached her, or whether she was thinking about something completely different...I couldn\'t tell.
But for a while, she was silent,
 ......gazing at me with an expression I could read no emotion from,
 ......and when she realized that I noticed, she averted her gaze.
Then she turned her back to me, ......and said this...
"So you ladies say that......since Battler will not quit as my opponent, you cannot accept my abandonment of this game."
"............In that case, I shall ask...
whether the man over there was qualified to be my opponent in the first place."
".........Qualified?"
"...Probably has something to do with that test or whatever just now."
"...............What are you planning to do...?"
"...Y‐...you aren\'t gonna—"
"I will now question you to determine whether or not you are qualified to be my opponent."
".........Listen, now, Battler.
 If those qualifications are acknowledged, I will stay in my seat and continue the game.
 And I shall promise to fight for all eternity until the outcome is decided."
"Heh!
 I was ready for that from the beginning."
"............However,
 if you are not qualified,
 ......you will disappear.
 If the opponent disappears, there is no game.
 I can leave this place openly.
 .........Are you ladies satisfied?
 I will not permit interruptions."
"..............................
 ......Go ahead, do as you like."
"......B‐...Battler...
 You......make sure you answer well..."
"The very reason I\'m here is because I\'m qualified, right?
 Heh, there\'s nothing to be scared of...!"
".....................
 .........Y‐......you couldn\'t be......"
Gretel grew suddenly pale.
 ......I\'d thought her to be the calm, collected type, so her expression surprised me.
"......Well then, Battler.
 I shall have you repeat in red."
"Y‐you\'re giving me a repetition request?
 Heheh... Damn you, stealing my signature move.
 ...But can I do the red truth too?
 How...?"
"............Ju‐just will it to be so and you can do it.
 It\'s easy."
"{p:1:My name is Ushiromiya Battler}.
 ......Wh‐......whoa, pretty cool."
"Stop it!!
 I know what you\'re after...!!
 But don\'t do it!
 He\'s......!!"
When Gretel yelled, Beato glared at her.
{n}Then, her form was wiped away in an instant.
"Shut up.
 You leave your seat for a while.
 You too, ladies.
 If you are going to interfere, I will not hold back."
"...............We won\'t get in the way.
 Go ahead, do as you like."
"B‐Bern, this is bad!!
 She\'s trying to erase him, she\'s trying to erase Battler!!"
"......What......?
 What is it she\'s......scheming here......?"
"Well then, I shall question your qualifications.
 ............Interesting.
 Attack and defense are reversed from a normal game.
 This is a very precious experience, coming at the very, very end.
 .........Ready? First listen carefully.
 I will speak with the red first."
{p:1:I am the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}}.
{p:1:And I opened this game in order to fight Ushiromiya Kinzo\'s grandchild, Ushiromiya Battler}.
"......I know that.
 So what?"
"Repetition requested.
 .........‘Ushiromiya Battler\'s mother is Ushiromiya Asumu’."
"Whaa?!
 ...Why\'s Mom\'s name popping up all of a sudden......?"
"I do not require chatter.
 Just repeat it in red."
Beato urged me with the same indifferent tone.
......But I don\'t have a clue what she\'s trying to do.
{n}......I\'ve done absolutely nothing wrong that I\'d hate to be confronted with, and there\'s nothing that I\'m hiding.
There\'s nothing she could demand for me to repeat that would cause me any trouble.
{n}......So, why something like this...?
"Sure, I\'ll repeat it.
 {p:1:Ushiromiya Battler\'s mother is Ushiromiya Asumu}.
 ......The red sure is convenient.
 No need to bother myself with bringing a copy of the family register."
"I do not require chatter.
 I will continue.
 "Your name is Ushiromiya Battler"."
"......Sure.
 {p:1:My name is Ushiromiya Battler}."
"It was from Ushiromiya Asumu that Ushiromiya Battler was born."
"{p:1:It was from Ushiromiya Asumu that Ushiromiya Battler was born}."
"It was from Ushiromiya Asumu that you were born."
"{p:1:It was from Ushiromiya}...
{m:-5:—}—...
...hhnguh...
...{nobr:{m:-5:——}—}?!
 {nobr:{m:-5:——}—}?!?!"
All of a sudden, my throat closed...
{n}I was suddenly assaulted by a shortness of breath that felt as if I had been choked.
Wh‐.........what\'s going on......?
 O‐......one more time......
"It was from Ushiromiya Asumu that I was born...
 ...Dammit...
 It was from Ushiromiya Asumu that I was born..."
"............Wh‐what the hell?
 Even though I was doing it so easily a second ago, I suddenly stopped being able to get the red to work...!"
"........................Do you decline to repeat it?"
"I\'m not declining...!!
 It\'s not working for some reason...!!
 It was from Ushiromiya Asumu that I was born...!!
 Why?!
 Dammit, why can\'t I use the red?!
 What the hell?!?!"
"..................tch..."
"..........................."
My Mom is Ushiromiya Asumu!
{n}Why can\'t I say that fact in red?!
{n}What\'s going on...?!
 Th‐this is......gghh—!!
"If you try to forcefully speak red that cannot be spoken, you will choke.
 There is no need to strain yourself.
 .........Allow me to use the aforementioned fact to press you in blue."
"......Do you remember?
 The blue is used to proclaim a theory for the opponent to deny.
 They are then burdened with the responsibility of denying that in red, and if they do not, then it is victory.
 .........Then let me begin."
{p:2:Due to the previous repetition request, and the refusal to repeat,}
 {p:2:I proclaim that you are not qualified to be my opponent}.
{p:2:After all,}
 {p:2:{f:5:Beatrice} opened this game in order to fight with "Ushiromiya Kinzo\'s grandchild, Ushiromiya Battler"}.
{p:2:This gave you the responsibility, as my opponent,}
 {p:2:to declare in red that you are "Ushiromiya Kinzo\'s grandchild, Ushiromiya Battler"}.
{p:2:You declined to repeat that}.
{p:2:This means the loss of your qualifications}.
"......D‐......deny something about that in red...
 ...Quickly!!"
"S‐sure...
 I,
 {p:1:I am Ushiromiya Battler}...!
 Given that I\'m able to repeat that in red, that should mean that I\'m your opponent!!"
"It may be a fact that you have the name Ushiromiya Battler.
 However...
 {p:2:People\'s names are not exclusive}.
 {p:2:It is possible for multiple humans to have the name Ushiromiya Battler}."
"
{p:2:What it comes down to is this}.
 ......{p:2:You are a different person with the same first and last names as Ushiromiya Asumu\'s son, Ushiromiya Battler}."
"Wh‐......what......?!!
 Don\'t be so stupiiiiiiiiid!!
 I\'m Mom\'s kid!!
 Ushiromiya Asumu\'s kid!!"
"
{p:1:It was from Ushiro}miya Asumu that...
—...
hkkhk—
......nn\'g\'g\'gkkhh......!!!
 ............*gasp*!"
"Shit!!
 Why?!
 Why can\'t I say that I was born from my mom?!
 How could something so stupid be true?!"
"No need to suffer.
 I will not toy with you.
 ......This is checkmate.
 {p:1:You are not Ushiromiya Asumu\'s son}."
...............Wha—...............
"You\'re.........
kidding......me..............."
"Who are you?
 What person calling themselves Ushiromiya Battler?"
"W‐...wait a second...
 ......I am...Ushiromiya Battler......
 It was from Ushiromiya Asumu that I was born, and I\'m Mom and Dad\'s son...!"
"No.
 There is no way that you are the Ushiromiya Battler with qualifications as my opponent.
 And as proof..."
"Proof?!"
"You do not know of that sin six years ago."
".........Uh,
 .........th‐that\'s............"
"No, if you were the true Ushiromiya Battler, you would not commit a sin.
 But consequently, a sin did occur, a span of six years became a blank space,
 and a man who knew nothing of that time appeared on Rokkenjima calling himself Ushiromiya Battler.
 ............The truth of it all...goes like this."
Six years ago, ......the true Ushiromiya Battler, qualified to be my opponent, was already dead.
You were involved in a plot by Rudolf having something to do with distribution of the inheritance...
a body double set up in Ushiromiya Battler\'s place.
"I, ......I\'ve never heard anything so stupid.........
 .........That\'s......just......absurd............"
"......B‐Battler......!
 Get ahold of yourself...!!"
"...........................Well.
 ...If he can\'t counter back, there\'s nothing more to do.
 ...Battler did not possess the qualifications.
 That\'s how it is."
"A‐are you okay with that, Bern?!
 If you accept that, you\'ll lose too, you know?!"
"Uh, and you\'ll win.
 ......Why are you taking Battler\'s side......?"
"Mgh, ............mghhh..."
"How disappointing, Battler.
 .........It really is disappointing that you didn\'t have the qualifications to be {f:5:Beatrice}\'s opponent.
 I was careless myself.
 I can\'t believe I bet on an unqualified piece.
 ............You\'ve defeated me utterly, {f:5:Beatrice}."
"......There is no victory or defeat.
 The opponent will simply disappear.
 Perhaps I should say that he was never there in the first place."
"But then......who.........am I......?
 Am I......not Mom and Dad\'s kid......?!"
"Who am I...... What am I......?
 ............If I\'m not Mom\'s kid, ......then what, are you saying I\'m some total stranger\'s kid with no relation to them at all?!"
"If that is the case, it would mean that you do not share Kinzo\'s blood.
 Either way, you are not qualified to compete in this game."
"...............Absurd.........
.........absurd..............."
"Enough.
 ......I was slightly aware that you might not be Ushiromiya Battler in the first place.
 ......So, I had to question you.
 I had to ask about something the real Battler would have known."
"............What a shame.
 I even bet on the one in a quadrillion chance of a miracle,
 that you might really be Ushiromiya Battler.
 However, it looks like you\'re a different person with the same first and last names after all."
"............kh.........uuunghhh............"
Bit by bit, Battler\'s form......began to be clouded in darkness...
No, maybe it was the other way around.
 ......The whole world was becoming clouded in darkness, leaving only Battler behind...
Battler was down on all fours, hanging his head and repeatedly questioning himself.
......However, he would never be given an answer......
In the world stained with darkness, Beato spoke something, and {f:5:Lambdadelta} ran up to Battler yelling something very quickly,
 but it already seemed very far away, and it didn\'t reach his ears...
............Then he,
 .........not knowing who "he" was,
 ............erased...
himself............
"BATTLEEEEEEEEEEER......!! ......nn...gh........."
"Now the opponent has disappeared.
 ......Well then, if you would excuse me.
 And ladies, you should prepare for your journey.
 No more festivities are prepared for in my territory.
 It was good seeing you.
 ......Goodbye."
Without saying anything more,
 Beato clouded her own form in darkness as well, and disappeared......
"A‐.........are you......alright with this?!
 Battler......d‐disappeared, you know?!
 Someone who hates losing as much as you do is okay with this?!"
"..................Weren\'t you betting on my defeat?
 Then you should be over the moon.
 Congrats, Lambda.
 Well then, let\'s meet again in some other world, okay?"
"That said, there are endless fragment worlds out there.
 The probability of us having some connection again somewhere is probably truly less than one in a quadrillion.
 ............Alright, it was fun.
 Bye‐bye."
"Ah, ...wait up, Bern...!!!"
Chasing after {f:5:Bernkastel}, who had disappeared first, {f:5:Lambdadelta} disappeared as well...
Then, after everyone had disappeared, .........there was no one left in the study.
It returned to silence, almost as though no one had been there from the beginning.
{n}......No one was here in the first place.
The silent study told of that wordlessly, and the sound of the wind and rain began to fill the room bit by bit......
In a world where everything had sunk into darkness, Beato questioned herself.
"......The fact is............from the very beginning, magic should only have been used within Mariage Sorcière."
"............Yes.
 ...I thought that too,
 ......when Ange happened."
"The witches\' alliance began with you and me.
 Just two people.
 ......Mixing in other people was the first mistake..."
".........It was just so much fun.
 ...That\'s why we wanted to add other people close to us into that circle.
 And in that way, we wished for the witches\' alliance to grow forever larger,
 so everyone could have fun using magic together, and all become happy."
"But.........in the end, you and I were the only ones able to understand magic."
"We\'re......the only two witches in this world, brought together by a miracle.
 .........As long as I have you, Beato, I don\'t need anyone else anymore."
"............Nor I.
 As long as you are here, I no longer need anyone else."
"In the very first moment that Mariage Sorcière was formed,
 ......it was already complete."
"...............That is...so.
 That is truly so......"
It was a witches\' alliance to make everyone happy together, with magic.
{n}......I wonder when it got this screwed up?
What was I trying to do when I started this game?
{n}......I can\'t really remember even that.
No, I may remember,
 ...but that\'s a feeling I now wish to throw away to the far side of oblivion.
".........It\'s alright.
 Let\'s just forget everything, okay?
 Our little two‐person Mariage Sorcière.
 ......We\'ll accept each other.
 And no one will be able to hurt us.
 So we won\'t be hurt anymore. We won\'t cry."
"Let\'s forget everything.
 ............Okay, Beato?
 ......We...are eternal......"
"..............................Maria......
 ............uuuuuuuu, .........uuuuuuuuuuuuu...!!""Amakusa, could you turn that off?"
"Whoops, my bad.
 You don\'t like {nobr:M. Zakky}?"
"I\'m just not in the mood."
Amakusa turned the radio off.
The world of cheery sounds was immediately swallowed up by the roar of the sea,
 and blotted out by the ocean\'s gray......
".........See it?
 Over there\'s where the harbor was at the time."
".............................."
The boat captain pointed, but I couldn\'t really recall how it looked twelve years ago.
......I had believed that my memories of back then would come flooding back into my mind,
 ...but no memories were coming back to me at all.
After the incident, the island was sealed off and left to the wild.
......Probably that\'s understandable, I had to tell myself, to stop myself from feeling somehow...sad and hurt.
.........Ah, but I at least remember one thing.
You could say that it would probably be the same anywhere on the sea, ......but at least this one thing, I do remember.
The cries...
of the seagulls.
 I do remember those.
......I almost never went to the ocean when I was young.
...So, to me, everything that symbolized the ocean meant Rokkenjima, and my family getting together.
In short, ......it was a symbol for the happiness of going out with my family.
However, at this point in time, it even seems doubtful whether that was happiness at all.
In my younger days, the trip had felt like a relaxed family vacation, but considering my parents\' situation at the time,
 it was surely a very difficult trip to handle, with the distribution of the inheritance filling the place with the smell of flaring tempers and fuses about to blow.
I can remember giggling all over the place, completely ignorant of my parents\' feelings...
"Rokkenjima, ......is it.
 The beginning of everything, and the last stop for all journeys."
Amakusa tried too hard in an attempt to speak for my innermost feelings.
The boat slowly rounded the island.
 ......As the angle changed, I hoped that my memories of the island\'s silhouette at the time might come back just a little,
 but in the end, even as the inlet was completely hidden by the cliffs, I wasn\'t able to remember anything...
"......Captain, that thing you mentioned...
about the other harbor...please tell me about it."
"Mmhm.
 .........They say Rokkenjima\'s only got one harbor.
 But that\'s only its outward appearance."
"An extra hidden harbor on the back of the island.
 .........That\'s Rokkenjima all over.
 It has a second face, which no one knows about..."
"............Rokkenjima is an island in the possession of the Ushiromiya family.
 But it has another face, as an island owned by Kinzo‐san personally......"
"One island, two harbors, two mansions, ......is it.
 He sure spent a lot just so he could keep a mistress."
"Who knew about this other harbor...?"
"Not many.
 Kinzo‐san, Genji‐san the butler.
 Those of us involved with the boats,
 and a very small number of the oldest servants.
 ......The last owner of the Nanjo clinic and that Kumasawa baa‐san knew as well.
 Naming \'em off like this makes it sound like there were a bunch of \'em, but I tell you now, it was only a very small number who knew."
"Please...tell me about that other mansion."
"......All\'s I was told is there\'s a mansion called Kuwadorian.
 Wasn\'t allowed to leave the boat, so I never once saw the place, though."
"So it was far away enough that you couldn\'t see it from the harbor?"
"Beats me.
 ......But it was a hidden mansion after all.
 Probably was built where you can\'t see it from the outside.
 ...Anyway, Kuwadorian was that island\'s biggest secret."
"There\'s a theory that {f:5:Beatrice} was being made to live in Kuwadorian,
 or else was being confined there... What do you think, Captain?"
"......I carried over sundries meant for Kuwadorian, too.
 Oftentimes that included stuff only women would use, and fancy stuff at that.
 ......No doubt in my mind, that theory is true."
"So does that mean you never saw this {f:5:Beatrice} woman directly, Captain?"
"Never.
 Came and went for close to twenty years, and never saw her once."
"Twenty years...!
 Whew, so that\'s at least plus twenty onto her age.
 Well, that shoots down my hopes for a mademoiselle."
"But one day, bang, all trips to and from Kuwadorian stopped.
 That was about thirty years ago,
 ......so around {ruby:Showa 43:1968}, I think."
"Bang?
 You mean suddenly?"
"......We\'d come by the back on a specified schedule to carry food and trash one way or the other.
 ......Uh, when I say the back, I mean the harbor on the Kuwadorian side."
"I get it.
 ...So then?"
"So one day, I get a sudden message from Genji‐san.
 And he tells me, until you hear differently, we don\'t need you to go to the back anymore."
"And did you hear differently?"
"Not in particular.
 To cut a long story short, one day, suddenly, I was told they didn\'t need regular service at the back anymore, and not to bother taking food there either.
 ......Thought I\'d been given the boot at first."
"But it wasn\'t long before I realized.
 ......And I kind of got the picture from the reactions of the servants who knew of Kuwadorian, as well."
".........{f:5:Beatrice} died, and there was no longer any need to take food or people to care for her?"
"That\'s what I think.
 I\'ve never been told to take another boat to the back since.
 But after that, Genji‐san came to see me face to face,
 and got real pushy, demanding me to take everything about "the back" with me to the grave."
"So, if that hidden mansion was abandoned for twenty whole years,
 .........why was Aunt Eva there?"
On that day twelve years ago...
......Ushiromiya Eva somehow escaped harm alone in a hidden mansion two kilometers away from the regular mansion.
Why was she in a hidden mansion that had been forgotten for twenty years.........?
"I saw that on the talk shows.
 Even I can\'t make heads or tails of that.
 Not once did I show Eva‐san to the back.
 I don\'t have the first damn clue how she knew about Kuwadorian or how she got there."
"I wonder if it was possible to go to the back where Kuwadorian is by land."
"......If, as we heard, the forest was dense and uncultivated,
 I seriously doubt a well‐dressed lady person\'d be able to push through it."
"So what about by sea?
 Maybe there was a motorboat or something."
"Are you kidding?
 That two‐nighter typhoon was awful.
 No way you could\'a used a boat."
"What if there was......an underground passage or something between the mansion and Kuwadorian.
 It would have been a pain to have to charter a boat each time he wanted to visit his mistress\'s house, right...?"
"A tunnel long enough to connect mansions on opposite sides of a two‐kilometer island like Rokkenjima...?"
"...Well, I\'d like to laugh at the thought, but this is a guy so rich he made a whole hidden mansion for his mistress.
 Guess I can\'t deny the possibility.
 ......What do you think, Captain?"
"I\'m a man of the sea.
 No good asking me about holes.
 But the Japanese military dug a {i:twenty‐five}‐kilometer tunnel on Iwo Jima.
 Wouldn\'t surprise me one bit if {i:the} Kinzo‐san could dig at least two."
".....................This really is a strange island.
 Even now, not one of us really knows a thing about it."
The boat reached the shore.
 There would be a short walk to reach the mansion.
"......I\'ll wait here.
 The mansion\'s that way.
 The path from back then\'s probably still there, but I\'ll bet it\'s covered with plants.
 Make sure you don\'t get yourself lost."
"Right, off we go, then?"
"Thanks, Amakusa.
 But you wait here too."
".........Eh, I had a feeling you\'d say that."
"I\'m just delivering something.
 You\'ll just be trouble for them if you\'re with me.
 I imagine your toxin is strong."
"Toxin?
 Hmm."
"I\'ll be back soon.
 Our main goal today is Kuwadorian.
 ......After I deliver this, I\'ll come right back."
Ange put on her knapsack and grabbed the flowers she was planning to offer.
"Take the hint, young\'un.
 ......Go on, gal.
 Your family\'s waiting for you."
I had never been on a road like this, but I had no trouble finding my way.
{n}If I walked straight ahead, it would probably guide me to the final destination for everything.
The vegetation certainly was incredible, and you would lose track of the path if you were careless enough to let your attention drift.
......But the road that was left was much better than I had imagined.
Still, that didn\'t change the fact that it was a bad road.
......Contrary to the distance shown on the map, I was forced to walk a long way......
......The forest was deep and dark.
At the time, I had been threatened into staying away from the forest because a witch lived there.
Of course, that fear is gone now, .........but I feel it.
Other people may not be able to,
 ......but I can feel the presence, like an aura, of the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}...
Massive, oddly shaped rocks scattered here and there. Overgrown trees and ivy.
 ......The voices of birds and bugs.
Yeah, I can feel it.
 .........I can feel...that the witch...is here......
Ahead, an ivy‐covered construction site fence and warning sign stood.
"NO ENTRY — TOKYO METROPOLIS".
 That was written on it.
Oh, right.
 When you think "Tokyo", you tend to think of a city,
 but address‐wise, even Rokkenjima is a rightful part of Tokyo Metropolis.
......Apologizing to the sign for my mistaken impression, I climbed over the fence.
When I made it up the steep slope beyond that, ............my field of vision rapidly expanded,
 and a fresh sea breeze blew through my hair......
It was like the top of a little hill.
......Below me was a vast view of the island.
I could only see desolated forest and rocky crags spread out below me.
 ......But, somehow, I realized that the mansion was probably somewhere around there.
The steep downward slope beyond this hill had probably been caused by landslides from twelve years of wind and rain.
It had become a slant filled with crags that you might even call gentle cliffs,
 and though it would be easy to tumble down, it looked like climbing back would be pretty difficult.
.........It seemed that proceeding any further would be impossible.
If I continued any further, I wouldn\'t be able to return.
{n}In other words, .........this is...the border.
Between 1986 and 1998.
 That day and today.
{n}And this world and the other.
"............This is...
...this journey\'s...final destination, it seems."
As the strong wind blew Mammon and Sakutaro\'s hair, they looked down from the hilltop...
"......I can\'t make out a thing from here.
 Where\'s the mansion?
 Let\'s get closer."
‘Uryu, ...we can\'t.
 We won\'t be able to come back.’
......We won\'t be able to...come back...
huh.
He\'s right.
 ......This is 1998,
 ......and I am the Ushiromiya Ange who has been left all alone.
At first, it was a journey to die.
 But not anymore.
{n}It has become a journey to accomplish something......
"Yeah.
 ......So, I\'m sorry, you two.
 As I was back then, on that day, I would have gone down this cliff without any hesitation."
"Come on, this is pretty lame for the skyscraper‐jumping Ushiromiya Ange."
"Sorry."
‘This place is just as good.
 .........Because you can feel the wind of that day.’
"..................
 ......Was the wind...really like this?"
‘Yeah.
 They will come any moment.
 ..................Everyone.’
Sakutaro said it as though it was completely natural.
{n}......And...I believed it.
Mom.
 Dad.
 Onii‐chan.
{n}All of my relatives, and those fun servants.
{n}And............Maria onee‐chan.
"It\'s me.
 ......It\'s Ange.
 ...............I\'ve...come back."
When I started my final journey to expose the past of twelve years ago, its goal had been abstract, and I hadn\'t understood.
But now, ......I have no doubts.
This journey............was induced by all kinds of thoughts and fates over twelve years.
A journey to end things...for me, Ushiromiya Ange.
And a journey to end things...as the final witch of Mariage Sorcière.
I came here as the final daughter of the Ushiromiya family,
 and as the final witch......
"......Mom, Dad, Onii‐chan.
 ...Sorry.
 Let me greet Maria onee‐chan first."
A strong gust of wind from behind urged me on.
That gust took just my soul out from inside my body, ......to the vast forest beneath me.
And, though I couldn\'t see it from where I stood, I believed that it would fly me to the mansion on that day,
 to where everyone was...to where Maria onee‐chan was.
And so,
 ......even though my body was on the top of the hill, a strong wind blowing against me,
 .........my soul was now certainly dancing through that sky......
The vast, vast sky of Rokkenjima.
{n}......Below me was the green of many trees.
But...I can tell.
 I can comprehend the presences of my family and relatives, and all the servants.
 .........And...Maria onee‐chan too.
I could even comprehend......Maria onee‐chan as a witch.
It was vast, more vast than any space I had imagined up until now.
".........Maria onee‐chan.
 Can you hear me......?
 Listen......!!"
Ange shouted to the Maria of that day.
That she had been through a long journey.
And that she had learned just how much she had wounded Maria on that day when she was young.
Having understood magic, I now understand everything about the world Maria wanted to show me.
It is so warm, and overflowing with kindness and happiness.
......She had wanted to become even happier by sharing that world,
 but I had trampled it.
"So now, I finally understand everything.
 ......I understand...magic...!
 Our magic is surely a very humble thing that exists all around us.
 ......But it isn\'t something that just anyone can see with their eyes.
 ............Magic is...
...yes, I can say it clearly."
{m:-5:—}—Without love, it cannot be {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen}.
I\'m sorry, Onee‐chan.
......I\'ve already been excommunicated from the witches\' alliance, but...
{n}...after all this time, I now understand how wonderful it is.
And.........I know that after that day I wounded you, Mariage Sorcière was...
...transfigured into something different from what you truly desired.
.........Back in those days, even magic that allowed you to vent your anger by cursing people was probably important to you.
Your environment was unhappy enough for you to be allowed that.
"But...
......now, those unhappy days...are over.
 ......So,
 ......let\'s return your witches\' alliance...
.........back to the original, gentle Mariage Sorcière."
The grimoire was in my hands without me realizing it.
......The strong winds were rapidly blowing its pages one after another......
It had been a kind world at first.
What to do to create magic so that candy rains from the sky.
What to do to create magic so that tomorrow\'s dinner becomes cream croquettes.
What to do to create magic so that tomorrow\'s weather is good when you go out, and you have a fun day.
New magics of happiness were created one after another, coloring her world with kindness...
Those days were flipped through one after another,
 .........and the days and months began to flash by like memories...
The pages with drawings that were colorful...
gradually changed into pages colored only with black ink......
......Eerie magic circles, and demon summonings.
{n}Evil magic for harming people.
What to do to create magic so that the class bully catches a cold.
What to do to create magic so that you‐know‐who in class gets seriously injured and dies.
What to do to create magic so that a bus with all the bullies on it falls off a cliff.
Malicious magics were created one after another,
 ......filling the pages and her heart...
"It was because I hurt you, Onee‐chan...
that Mariage Sorcière ended up like this.
 .........You aren\'t a black, evil witch.
 ......You were a white, ......pure, innocent,
 ......kind witch......"
"......I\'ll...return you to how you were.
 Originally, when you were scattering magic to make people happy across the entire world.
 ......I\'ll turn you back into that Maria onee‐chan."
"......That is the reason I came here.
 I was guided by fate.
 ............Onee‐chan, can you hear me......?
 Show yourself.........before me.........!!"
That voice rode an even stronger wind, and was sent twelve years into the past......
Then,
 ......the wind gradually ceased,
 .........and silence fell......
Crunch, crunch.
 ......I could hear the sound of gravel being stepped on.
I heard those footsteps, and was surprised at that miracle.
{n}......Without a doubt, those footsteps were Maria onee‐chan\'s.
"............Ma‐......Maria onee‐chan........."
"Kasumi.
 ......Looks like I finally found you, eh, Ange‐chan.........?"
"........................"
......Before I knew it, Aunt Kasumi and her black‐suits, a total of seven people who didn\'t resemble Maria onee‐chan in the slightest,
 were standing there, surrounding me.
And it felt like my voice had been just about to reach Maria onee‐chan, too......
...Because of these guys\' toxin, .........the magic got interrupted...
Ange clicked her tongue at that, but Kasumi probably didn\'t hear it that way.
"............Oh?
 Are those flowers for your deceased family?
 ......How admirable.
 You\'re going to throw them, right?
 That\'s alright, we\'ll wait that long."
......Before what.
{n}...Ange could more or less guess.
The way the black‐suits had their hands unnaturally stuck into their pockets made me realize that they were obviously in possession of handguns.
.........This is a deserted island.
{n}There could be no more convenient place to dispose of someone.
I have absolutely no interest in the family matters of the Sumadera family.
...But if I die, all of that wealth will roll right into the Sumadera family coffers.
Unlike me, they probably have a great deal of interest in it.
Of course, the Ushiromiya Group has a stake in this, too—it seems that if the massive amounts of stock I own suddenly go to the Sumaderas,
 it\'ll be pretty bad for the Ushiromiya Group as well,
 and so they\'ve apparently gotten themselves embroiled in a secret feud over me.
......That\'s probably why President Okonogi gave me Amakusa as a guard.
............Having Amakusa wait on the boat was a regretful mistake...
"How long have you been waiting here in ambush......?"
"Since early morning.
 And I was getting thoroughly tired of waiting for you.
 There are no cafés or powder rooms here, you see."
"No toilets either, so I guess you had to elegantly drop a load behind a tree.
 .........ack—"
"One who, in spite of herself, is a lady with half Sumadera blood flowing through her veins will not use such filthy words.
 .........You really are Sumadera Kyrie\'s child, aren\'t you?
 Not a trace of grace."
She grabbed me by the hair and forced my face up to hers.
{n}And then spat in it.
......My words are filthy, but her spit\'s not to be outdone.
".........Every time you talk about me, it\'s always with reference to Mom.
 ...Am I really that much like my mother?"
"Yes, you are.
 ...............That impertinent gaze.
 Your mouth and nose are the same too."
"......Unrestrained and irresponsible.
 ......She thought nothing of the long history and tradition of the Sumadera family, and selfishly flew out of the house.
 My entire life has been wiping up the messes she left behind...!"
"I guess that makes your life one giant pile of shit."
I was slapped on the cheek, my ear took a heavy hit, and for an instant, my head rang...
.........She pulled me around by the hair, and threw me onto the ground.
And without a moment\'s pause, she kicked the ground, covering me in sand.
"Yes, you truly have become so very like Nee‐san.
 That gaze!
 That gaze like you\'re somehow making fun of me.
 Yes, it\'s all coming back, all of it!"
".........You are pitiful.
 I imagine that since you were young, you were always compared against Mom and looked down upon.
 ......And for the entire rest of your life, you\'ll never be released from that misery."
"A little brat like you couldn\'t possibly understand.
 ......Your mother, you see, is a loser who threw away everything and ran away from the Sumadera family.
 Do you know how much...
how {i:much} trouble I went through because of that loser?!!"
"Any trouble you went through has nothing to do with me.
 Can\'t really do anything about what happened before I was born."
".........When is your life going to begin?
 ......It\'s never going to happen.
 You will continue to be sneered at by my dead mother, for ever and ever for all eternity until you die.
 ......In fact, why {i:don\'t} you die?
 Why are you alive?"
"You little insolent pissant...!!
 Men...!
 Make her some tea."
"Heheheh...
 Leave it to us..."
"You big‐mouthed shitty brat.
 Let us teach you a little lesson."
The black‐suits dashed up to me, violently grabbed me by the collar, and dragged me down.
"Do as you like until I finish this smoke.
 Teach my darling niece a little of her place."
Sumadera Kasumi.
 She was a pitiable person, to think of it.
To the outside world, the women of the Sumadera family were trained to be in a position to support and defer to the men in the prominent positions.
......But in actuality, strong leadership was demanded of them so that they could manage all of the people under them.
The role demanded of them was that of a female commander.
Taking charge of the Sumadera family with all its proud history required an extraordinary level of commanding presence.
It was an unimaginably heavy responsibility.
Normally, this would have been demanded of Kyrie.
Kyrie had undergone that harsh training.
{n}And Kasumi, as the younger sister, should have been able to just take it easy.
No, in fact, she had lived like a lazy, selfish, and affluent princess, sneering at Kyrie, who had been given the heavy responsibility.
......However,
 Kyrie was suddenly disinherited.
She had refused the fiancé her parents had arranged, and had gotten pregnant by her lover, Ushiromiya Rudolf.
From the Sumadera family\'s perspective, even though the Ushiromiya family held a vast fortune, it was a family which had already collapsed, a family not in their league.
And to become not even a legal wife, but a {i:lover} to the second son of that family...
Normally, no one would be shown mercy for something so dishonorable, not even a daughter of the main family.
They would wrap her up in a mat, stand a pole on end,
 and throw her either into the Pacific Ocean if the pole fell to the right or the Sea of Japan if it fell to the left.
.........But Kyrie\'s punishment was nothing but disinheritance, an unbelievably lenient decision.
After that, the Sumadera family began receiving preferential treatment from a section of the Ushiromiya Group.
 ......There must have been some kind of backroom deal.
In other words, Kyrie took advantage of the Ushiromiya family\'s financial support to leave the Sumadera family openly.
Kasumi watched it happen in shock.
{n}No, she even disparaged her dishonorable sister as a loser.
......But eventually...
...she learned that the heavy responsibilities Kyrie had borne would be passed on to her,
 and then, for the first time, she realized that she had been outwitted......
"Because of your mother, my life was turned into a mess.
 ......No, you could even say she killed me once.
 On that day, I was killed once and cast down into a hellish life..."
".........Isn\'t that just what you get for thinking you can breeze through life?
 ......gyack!
 .........*cough*, *cough*......"
"This girl doesn\'t know when to shut up!
 Oorrrrah!"
The black‐suit punched me in the gut, and I doubled over.
{n}But I was quickly grabbed by the collar and made to stand up again.
As she continued to cold‐heartedly look down upon Ange, Kasumi blew out smoke......
{n}The hard days after Kyrie left were floating through her mind.
Until then, she had been allowed to be simply a rich young lady, unrestrained and unaffected.
{n}......Only Kyrie, the older sister, had been strictly trained, and she, the younger sister, had been able to live as nothing more than a princess.
Then, suddenly, everything was turned over to such a degree that her life tumbled and crashed......
"My life, lifestyle, way of living, ......everything was stolen from me.
 .........Do you know how much I was maligned based on my sister\'s dishonor by those relatives who didn\'t know the details...?
 ......I detested her.
 I detested your mother enough to make me spit blood..."
"Glad to hear it.
 I hope it continues for many years to come.
 .........gagghh!!"
A kick landed in Ange\'s side as she lay prostrate on the ground.
{n}Ange didn\'t stand up again.
......So she continued to lie there like a caterpillar, getting kicked every time she spoke up.
"......I saw Nee‐san at an Ushiromiya Group party once.
 ......She was with her husband,
 .........looking very happy,
 ......and laughing.
 ......She...
...pushed everything onto me,
 ......and found happiness...
......only for herself........."
".........So what?
 How is taking it out on me going to make you happy?
 Is taking it out on me going to turn back time and change history for you or something?"
".........Ugugggh,
 .........gah,
 .........*cough*......!!"
"You said something a short while ago...
 When is my life going to begin?
 .........No matter how much I despise you or take it out on you, I cannot turn back time.
 ......So am I doomed to keep on hating Nee‐san like this for the rest of my life, even though she\'s dead?"
"Not if I can help it.
 ......How long must I be tormented by Nee‐san\'s ghost?
 And so I thought.
 .........If I could pull this off, I would be able to forget all of my hatred and start over."
Ange was about to respond to this with another bitter comment, but stopped.
{n}...Because she would be kicked again if she responded.
......Even if Kasumi didn\'t say any more, it wasn\'t difficult to imagine what she meant.
{n}Kasumi was thinking of bringing an end to her hatred of Kyrie by taking revenge against her daughter, Ange.
.........Talk about pushing your problems on other people.
"Come on, stand up.
 If you like this island that much, I\'ll bury you here deep.
 .........You don\'t want to die at your age, right?
 Don\'t you want to say "Sorry my mother caused you so much trouble", or something?"
".........You...
...wish.
 .........gkkhhh,
 .........glk, ......!!"
‘Uryuu!!
 Ange, Angeeeeee...!!’
"Ange‐sama, no...!
 You mustn\'t provoke these guys...!!
 You should at least make it seem like you\'re going along with them, so you can buy some time...!"
".........They do say...
that you should throw your foolish pride...
out with the garbage......"
‘Wh‐what about Amakusa‐san...?!
 If Amakusa‐san comes, I just know he\'ll......!’
"......No, it\'s no good, I can\'t see him...
 ......You idiot, Ange‐sama...!
 Why did you come without Amakusa...!"
I don\'t need you to tell me that, Mammon.
{n}......I\'m already right in the middle of regretting it.
I walked a long way to get here.
 The forest was very thick.
{n}......There\'s no way that the disturbance here will reach the boat......
As Kasumi took her sweet time smoking that single cigarette down to the filter,
 I was continuously laid into by the black‐suits however they deemed fit.
The moment I grabbed my head to protect it, the top of my head was kicked by someone at a bad angle, and my head filled with stars......
{n}This feeling of stars flickering in a world twisted with gray...
...was one I knew well.
My life was very similar to the one Sumadera Kasumi led.
...Because I was tormented constantly with all kinds of bullying under the guise of education and training, to make me a worthy "successor to the Ushiromiya family".
Yes.
 Having the inside of my head filled with stars like this...is a feeling I know well.
When being reprimanded for some error in manners I seemed to have made,
 the lecture always turned to whether I was fitting to be the successor to the Ushiromiya family or not.
......On and on about the honor of the Ushiromiya family, and how important it was.
......By the time her rant reached that point,
 I would forget what mistake I was being blamed for in the first place.
No, actually, it was the same way for Aunt Eva too.
After all, sometimes she would ask herself "Umm, what was I saying again?"
...But in the end, she wouldn\'t be able to remember, and would say something like:
"The fact that I\'m angry must mean that you did something wrong.
 So whatever wrong thing you did is the problem, and it isn\'t important that I can\'t remember what it was any more."
...There\'d be some ridiculous reasoning like that, and then she would continue punishing me.
Yes.
 Aunt Eva\'s punishments weren\'t something that would continue until I learned something, or acknowledged my mistake, or apologized.
.........They would continue until Aunt Eva wanted to stop.
{n}So even this violence was a bit nostalgic, in a way that made me want to vomit.
......I opened my eyes, ......and oh look, there\'s Aunt Eva.
Right next to Kasumi, who was smoking her cigarette,
 I could see Aunt Eva, the two of them looking almost as though they were laughing at me together.
When I think about it, even Aunt Eva\'s life might be worthy of sympathy.
......The responsibilities and pressures of members of the Ushiromiya family, which she had so often mentioned to me,
 were all things that she herself had suffered.
Because people cannot voice insults that they have never been subjected to themselves......
It was probably the same way for Aunt Rosa as well.
{n}......As the youngest child of the glorious Ushiromiya family, she must have gone through many tough times.
So, just as Aunt Eva acted towards me...
{n}And just as Sumadera Kasumi is acting right now...
{n}......Aunt Rosa must also...have been the same.
People push the suffering they have been made to bear onto other people.
{n}Otherwise, they can never escape from it.
......So on and on, in eternity and perpetuity, the chain of suffering and sadness never ends.
That is the reason............Maria onee‐chan\'s magic was...
...so incredible.
With her magic, ......she did not have to bear the suffering from Aunt Rosa.
That pain was probably pushed onto her.
{n}Its weight probably tormented her.
......But Onee‐chan did not carry that burden on her own shoulders.
.........She exorcised it...and filled her world with happiness.
So, I\'m sure...
...that even if Maria onee‐chan had had children in the future...
...she would never have pushed the suffering forced down through the generations onto them.
......The chain of suffering and sadness,
 which had been inherited by and forced upon each generation for who knows how long,
 .........was, by Maria onee‐chan\'s magic, broken.
"............What is it?
 Do you have something to complain to me about?"
In the past, I would have snapped back.
{n}......And cancelled out her hatred with hatred of my own.
...No, I cancelled out nothing.
 The weight of that which had been forced onto her bears down hard on my shoulders as well.
After all, even now, ......I hate her.
So,
 ............now that I knew of magic,
 ......I looked at the human called Ushiromiya Eva again.
.........What I could see through to...
...was the sad form of a human, no different from me, who had lost her family and who bore deep wounds in her heart.
Unable to withstand the pain of that torn heart,
 she was doing nothing except howling with a sad voice—like a lion crying in pain—like a child.
......It turns out...Ushiromiya Eva was also a person deserving of compassion.
She had needed someone to understand the difficulties and pain of her childhood days,
 .........and she, too, as the only survivor of the Rokkenjima incident,
 who was faced with the inquisitive eyes of all of society, who was publicly slandered, who had salt continually rubbed into her wounds,
 ......had needed someone\'s compassion.
In order to let her forget her pain and sorrow for least a moment,
 ............the black witch, the very same that possessed Aunt Rosa, ......taught her magic.
It was the same magic of anger and sadness that {f:5:Beatrice} had taught Maria onee‐chan,
 when she was mourning for Sakutarou after he was torn apart.
......That same magic, that witch, had surely dwelled inside Aunt Rosa too.
............So I was wrong to hate Ushiromiya Eva.
...Perhaps...
......I alone was supposed to have become her ally,
 the only person in the world who could understand her.
......What did I say to her when I was young, when she returned alive all alone...?
Could it be...
......that the way I acted towards her was...
......as if she had come back by herself after killing all my family......?
...........................
 ......I can\'t believe it.
...Aunt Eva, who throughout my life has never been more than an object of and synonym for hatred,
 .........is turning into a...{i:human} who I can understand......
And so.
 .........I looked right next to Aunt Eva, ......at the form of the black witch who taught her the black magic......
Aunt Eva...was crying.
It was only natural.
.........Not only did she have no one who would understand her pain of having lost her husband and son all at once,
 ......but even I, her only relative, insulted her, ......saying "Give me back my mom and dad".
.........I can make the excuse that it was the mercilessness of youth.
...But......to her at the time,
 that was probably cruel enough to sever her heart\'s last thread.
..................In the following days, the talk shows and magazines publicly slandered her.
The truths of her late husband\'s business and character, and even those about her beloved son, were denied.
She no longer had anything left.
She could do nothing but cry and howl, ......trying to forget the pain and sadness for just a few moments.
Because only while howling could she feel the slightest bit of release.
And so, .........the black witch taught her how to howl.
The one I hated...was the black witch.
 The black magic probably did release her from that suffering for just a short time.
......However,
 it would never lift that weight from her shoulders.
To the contrary, it would force that weight on further victims,
 .........filling the world with the weight of hatred.
...............If Aunt Eva was to have a true witch nearby, one who knew of white magic...
......wasn\'t that...
.........supposed to be...
...me.........?
I had learned the magic to create happiness from Maria onee‐chan.
.........If I could have saved her......with that magic,
 ...............might we not have...
......built up a future with a completely different relationship?
All this time,
 .........I have hated Aunt Eva.
{n}...So I never noticed the black witch beside her.
......Without love, it couldn\'t be {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen}.
{n}I didn\'t have...
...any love for her......
So now, finally...
.........I\'ll glare at the black witch,
 ......the one I truly should hate.
"......Oh?
 .........What\'s thiiis?
 You can {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} me?
 Ehheheheheh...!"
"..................Yes, I can.
 ......The one I should\'ve hated wasn\'t Aunt Eva.
 ......It was you."
"Hey, you\'re pretty good.
 To think that a lowly {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} could {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} a witch like me.
 ......And so?
 Are you trying to say something with that glare?
 Do you hate me?"
"...............Hate?
 ......Yes, I do.
 ......But...that\'s not quite it.
 ......I just...find you a little sad."
"Sad?
 
......*giggle*giggle*, ahhahahahahaha!
 What\'re you saying, come on, you can get mad!
 Why don\'t you just hate me with all your strength forever?!"
"......I won\'t hate.
 ......Hating you...
......means I\'m doing nothing more than inheriting Aunt Eva\'s hatred.
 ......I\'ll break the hatred.
 ......I\'ll accept Aunt Eva\'s suffering, .........exorcise it, and throw it away."
"Ahhahahahahahahaha!!
 What kind of epiphany do you think you\'ve had?
 Is your head alright?
 I mean, why don\'t you just give up and die foreveeeer?!"
"Kyaahhahhahahahahahaha!
 You guys, kick her more and more, okay?
 Not her face, though.
 It wouldn\'t do any good kicking her pitiful face only to make it better!"
"Guhhkk!
 .........*cough*!!
 ...............g\'......"
The black‐suits persistently kicked my stomach and back.
{n}......As though they had been ordered to by the black witch.
"......Dear me, still nothing to you, is it......?
 ............You keep staring right at me.
 You hate me?
 I\'ll bet you do.
 I hate you too.
 *snicker*snicker*snicker*......"
Kasumi sneered at me.
 ......But for some reason, I had the feeling that she was crying behind that expression.
She\'s had a life just as unfair as mine forced upon her, and the pain of that never, ever heals.
......The sad lion continues to howl, gasping in pain from the thorn he can\'t get out...
"Hey, Sumadera Kasumi, take a look.
 That over there is what you used to be."
"......Doesn\'t that make you feel so much better?
 You used to be standing there, but now you\'re on this side, you know that?
 Eheheheh, isn\'t it delightful?
 Now the shoe is on the other foot!"
"...............Yes, it truly does feel...
......delightful.........
 Ahhahahahaha, how can you make that kind of face, Ange...?!
 Go on and cry, you want to, right?!"
"Kyahhahahahahahaha!!
 Yes, yes, of course she wants to cry!
 Go on, make her cry."
"You were made to cry back then, weren\'t you?
 So make her cry too.
 *giggle*, and Ange, it\'s alright, okay?
 Why not cry foreveeeeeeeer?!
 Kyaaaha‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah!!"
"...Aha, ...ahahahahahahaha!!
 Cry, Angeee!
 I want to see your crying face!
 Cry, and try saying "I\'m sorry, Aunt Kasumi"...!!"
"Yes, make her say those words.
 ......Those words hurt, right?
 Being made to apologize for something that isn\'t your fault......hurt a lot, didn\'t it......?"
"Make her go through the same thing...
 By doing that, you can relieve your pain."
"......Ehheheheh, yes, that\'s the way.
 Be more honest with yourself.
 Why not spit out your emotions more and more and more foreveeeeeeeer?!"
......The black witch stirred Kasumi up.
{n}And Kasumi began to give herself over to that dark emotion.
......She was doing nothing more than turning her deep sadness into cheap booze and forcing it down,
 trying to forget for just a brief moment.
The words Kasumi insulted me with...
......were themselves...
...sad.
And...I couldn\'t forgive the black witch for taking advantage of Kasumi\'s sadness.........
.........I had gone limp on the ground, which seemed to have sapped the black‐suits of their enthusiasm for kicking.
...Or maybe the kickers had finally gotten tired too.
Kasumi hadn\'t ordered them to stop, but at some point, the violence had halted.
However, I was reflected in Kasumi\'s eyes, and they were burning me with flames of hatred.
......She had been tempted by the witch into doing that in order to relieve her own pain.
".........Sumadera Kasumi.
 You aren\'t done.
 You\'ve got much more trampling to do.
 Can you forgive what happened to your entire life with just this little bit of violence?"
"...I can\'t forgive what happened.
 ......It\'ll take a lot more than this for me to forgive that."
"Right?
 There\'s no way you can forgive!
 Do it more!
 More of the flames of hatred!
 Nothing can warm you except the flames of hate.
 You are freezing in the snow fields of anger and sadness, and the only flame that can warm you up is hatred...!!"
"Come on, say it!
 Scream it!!
 Why don\'t you burn yourself to ashes with a roar of hate foreveeeeeeer?!"
"U‐......USHIROMIYA ANGEEEEEEEEE!!
 Loathing you......is what allows me to draw breath!!
 Ehhehe{0}he{0}ha{0}hha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"
"Sumadera Kasumi, that bouquet of flowers.
 .........These flowers are for your dead family, right, Ange?"
The black witch grinned at me unpleasantly, and used her chin to signal Kasumi to pick them up.
Kasumi picked up the flowers I was going to offer,
 .........brought them all the way over to me, dropped them in front of me, and made a show of trampling them...
Her expression was filled with hatred, ......and a frantic quality that simple hatred couldn\'t explain.
...It was as if trampling them over and over again was the only way to prevent the sadness inside her from reaching the bursting point.
So the sound of her trampling was downright sad.
".........Oh, this isn\'t enough to get to you?
 Then what about this?
 Sumadera Kasumi!
 Use this one."
"......N‐.........no......
 ...Not that........."
The object the black witch pointed at.........was Maria onee‐chan\'s grimoire.
Kasumi also noticed it, and picked up that book, which was heavier than it looked...
"What\'s thiiis?"
"*giggle*.
 ......Why not read it and laugh forever?
 Eheheh, you might split your sides laughing..."
Kasumi opened the grimoire,
 ......skimmed over the contents, and snorted derisively.
"Give it back......
 That\'s......Onee‐chan\'s............"
Of course, my hand couldn\'t reach.
......My stomach was once again kicked by the black‐suits, and I curled up on the ground...
"See?
 See how important this book is to Ange?
 Mock the things that are important to her.
 That works better than punching or kicking for a girl like her.
 ......You know that better than anyone, right...?"
Kasumi\'s face twisted for an instant, as though remembering something painful.
......But that quickly disappeared, changing into a scornful smile directed towards me.
"*giggle*giggle*.
 Wowww, what a freaky book.
 ......Did you write this.........?"
"......Stop it...... Give it back........."
"*giggle*giggle*giggle*, *giggle*giggle*!!
 Look at that face...!
 Mock it more, mock it more...!
 Teach her the pain of having your dignity trampled, that\'s the only way to soften your own pain...!"
"Heh, heheheheh, what\'s with this embarrassing book...
 ............I know some people develop a little interest in make‐believe fortune telling when they\'re young girls."
"But isn\'t this taking it a bit too far?
 Oh god, it says "magic".
 ......You\'re one of those, aren\'t you.
 You know, that thing in cartoons where they say some "blabbity‐blibbity‐woo" spell and transform into a witch.
 You\'re one of those people who like doing that, aren\'t you?
 .........This is just painful.
 *snicker*snicker*."
Cackling, Kasumi opened to a random page and showed it to the black‐suits.
The black‐suits looked too, and guffawed.
That laughter wouldn\'t wound me.
......But I couldn\'t forgive it.
 ...After all, that laughter was ridiculing Maria onee‐chan.
I don\'t hate Kasumi.
 ......For exploiting Kasumi\'s unhealing anger and sadness, ......I cannot forgive the black witch...
That black witch ate into Aunt Eva, Sumadera Kasumi, and Aunt Rosa,
 ......tormenting them for an eternity without letting their wounds be healed.
.........I can\'t forgive her......
{n}......I can\'t forgive.........the black witch......
"Oh my god, this is priceless...!
 ......Magic for making candy rain from the sky, ......it says!!
 Ahhaha{0}hahaha...!"
"Let\'s see.
 Dissolve sugar in cold water purified by the sun...?
 Dip the magic wand in, and say the incantation, .........*cackle*cackle*cackle*, ahhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!
 What the hell?!
 Ahhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!!
 Criiiiiiiiinge!!"
The black‐suits also rolled around, guffawing.
Then, grinning, the black witch whispered something into Kasumi\'s ear.
......Then, after glaring at me with a grin, ......Kasumi took that page—
"......Ah—"
Kasumi grabbed hold of that page, tore it out, crumpled it up, ......and threw it away......
‘Th‐......that\'s so mean... ......That was...Maria\'s magic.........’
"Oh, really?
 Heheh, how sad."
......It was one of the magics to summon happiness...
...that Maria had made with Sakutarou.
Anyone knows that making sugar water, coloring it with paint, and leaving it by the window...
...isn\'t going to make candy rain from the sky.
But after repeating that every day, ......one time when she got back from school...
...she found several pieces of candy scattered around that place...
.........How happy must that miracle have made Maria onee‐chan.
......What good care she must have taken of those candies, savoring them during her nights all alone with Sakutarou, to distract herself from her loneliness.
That......magic which Onee‐chan had created...
......was torn out, thrown away,
 ...and disappeared......
The entire miracle of happiness created by that magic,
 ......she tore out and threw away......
"Oh, this one\'s another classic...!
 Magic to make dinner be cream croquettes?
 Ahhaha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!
 ......What\'s this next one?
 Magic to make bell peppers taste nice?
 This is amazing, ridiculous!
 Ah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah...!!"
"Tear that too.
 Eheheh!!
 Why not tear it more and more foreveeeeeer?!?!"
With a cruel‐hearted, loud laugh,
 ......the black witch made her tear out Maria onee‐chan\'s magics one after another......
She...sneered at those happy magics,
 ......ripped them out,
 ......and threw them away......
"Stop it... Stop it......!!
 Don\'t......defile Lady {f:5:Maria}\'s magic...!!
 Don\'t defile it......with your filthy toxin...!!"
Mammon cried and yelled, ......but she had no way of reaching Kasumi.
"Who cares, why don\'t you just be defiled foreveeeer?!
 Magical miracles?
 Magic to bring happiness?
 Doesn\'t exist, there\'s no such thing!"
"Pain and suffering, you see, can only be healed by pushing them onto someone else.
 ......Now you, you were what they call a "magic friend", right?
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*!
 Sumadera Kasumi, open up to her page."
"What\'s this?
 Magic friends, it says.
 ............The Seven Sisters of Purgatory?"
"Ahah, what a creepy name!
 *giggle*, it says they can fly at awesome speeds, and finish off the enemy for you.
 Ahhaha, Ange, if you can use this kind of magic, shouldn\'t you use it right now?
 .........Ahhaha{0}hahaha.
 Stupid!"
The pages that wrote of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory were also heartlessly torn away.
......The pages themselves were just paper.
{n}They weren\'t Mammon\'s vessel or anything.
But the tearing, denying toxin burned Mammon from the inside......
Mammon\'s face twisted from the heat and pain...
".........ghhh, ...............kkkhhh, ........."
‘Are you okay, Mammon?!
 Hang in there......!!’
"......I can......handle it...
 ......It\'s not me......but Ange‐sama.........who\'s in pain........."
However, Mammon\'s expression was twisted in unbearable pain and humiliation......
‘Stop it, black witch......!!
 Why are you doing something like this?!
 Why......can\'t you use magic for happiness?!!’
"......Oh, you\'re a magic friend too, right?
 *giggle*, I\'ll defile you too.
 Sumadera Kasumi, look for this guy\'s page, too."
"What\'s this one?
 What\'s with this crappy scribble of a lion?
 ......Sakutarou?
 What a weird name!
 My best friend, it says.
 Really?
 This is your friend? Your close friend?
 This lion is? Is it, is it?"
"Ahhahahahahahaha!!
 It really is a crappy scribble.
 So this butt‐ugly lion is you."
"To think she had something like this as a friend... That Ushiromiya Maria kid\'s mind is so unbelievably wretched my sides are hurting.
 .........What a morrrrron.
 Why not give up and die foreveeeeeer......?"
‘U...ryu......
 .........Don\'t make fun......of Maria......’
"...............St......op......it.........
 ...Don\'t rip it........."
""No waay.""
There was a shrill tearing sound.
 .........And the page was filthily ripped out...
The picture of Sakutarou...
...that Onee‐chan had drawn...
...was violently ripped in half.........
"What a shhhhhitty drawi~ng.
 Kyahhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!"
"You all laugh too.
 Aahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!"
Obeying the pair, the black‐suits laughed crudely,
 ......and heartlessly trampled all over the paper that had been torn and thrown away......
‘Uuuuuuuuuuuu, ......hic!
 ......Uuuuuuuuuuu......’
"......Sakutaro, ......be strong........."
‘I\'m...not sad......
 ...I just......can\'t stand it......
 ......Maria\'s being made fun of,
 .........and I can\'t do anything about it...
 ......I can\'t stand it......’
"........................
 ......To {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s who can\'t {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} us, ......it\'s as though we don\'t exist...
 ......We can only interact with {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s that need us.
 ............That\'s why.........we\'re furniture........."
As Sakutarou and Mammon......supported each other,
 ......they slumped down, ...sobbing...
I couldn\'t stand it either......
 ......Only those who can {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} the world of magic can understand how wonderful it is.
It can\'t be explained to humans who can\'t understand.
 And so it is mocked.
{n}.........If only you could show it...
......But you can\'t......
Because, in front of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s who are filled with the anti‐magic toxin and who can\'t understand magic,
 .........magic cannot be used......
"I really don\'t get it.
 From this delusional diary, I\'ve got to assume that something\'s wrong with your head.
 ......It really is interesting to take a peek into your happy‐go‐lucky little mind.
 You creepy child."
"You and Maria.
 ......And that stuffed animal and the furniture over there too.
 *giggle*giggle*giggle*!!
 Ahhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!"
"Aah, I could laugh.
 You don\'t have any friends, do you?
 You\'re allllways all alone, and stuffed animals are your friends, right?
 What a pitiable child."
"Ehheheheheheheheheh...!
 Don\'t worry, I understand.
 I know what it\'s like to live that way.
 .........So I\'ll be the one to recognize you for what you are.
 You really are a pitiful little child.
 Ehhehehha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!"
.........So, to you,
 ......she looks like a pitiful child.
Yes, I\'m sure she does.
If a hundred people were to read Onee‐chan\'s diary and grimoire, all one hundred would probably get that same impression.
......I used to be one of them.
But you know,
 .........in spite of all that,
 ......Maria onee‐chan...
...still called this a world of happiness.
.........Don\'t deny...
......that magic, ...that happiness......
"Such a stubborn child, you are.
 ......Alright, fine.
 This is the last one.
 I\'ll tear apart the source of the absolutely ridiculous magic that you and Maria believed in.
 Sumadera Kasumi, read this page."
"Hmmm, what is this colorful page......?
 ...Let\'s see.
 .........Magic to...
...always be friends with Mama who I love...?"
‘N‐noooooooooo!!
 Not that page......!!’
"Oh?
 This magic is really simple.
 I think even I could do it without any practice at all.
 .........Even I can remember an incantation this short.
 Shall I give it a go?"
"*giggle*giggle*, it really is a short incantation, isn\'t it?
 Alright, give it a try, let\'s all burst it out!"
With expressions that ridiculed it from the bottoms of their hearts, the black witch and Kasumi......puckered their lips in the most exaggerated way they could,
 ............and said it aloud......
"Uu‐uu."
The black‐suits stared blankly, asking what that was supposed to be.
{n}Then Kasumi answered, cackling.
"This is supposed to be the "incantation".
 Are you kidding me...!
 Ahhahahahahahaha...!!!"
"Come on, why don\'t you guys try it too?
 Uu‐uu‐uu."
The black‐suits imitated that moaning voice, making fun of it......
{m:-5:———}—“Uu‐uu.”
{n}That was the incantation...for the magic that would let her always be friends with the mama she loved.
"What is this stupidity...!!
 If you could make family relationships better just by saying "uu‐uu", we would have world peace forever.
 Ahah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐ha!!"
"Uu‐uu‐uu!
 A stupid moaning voice!
 If you do this over and over again, people are going to think you\'re a poor kid with mental problems!
 Are you retarrrrrded?!
 Waaahahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha, waaaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"
‘Stoooooop...... At least don\'t mock......that magiiiiiiiic......’
............One day when Maria onee‐chan and Aunt Rosa had gone on a picnic together.
It was written that this was one of the five happiest days of her life.
And Onee‐chan was singing her mama a song that she had just learned from her.
......Onee‐chan was happy to see that her mama was enjoying it very much.
 But partway through, she forgot the lyrics.
But her mama was enjoying it so much, so she tried to sing until the very end.
With "uu‐uu‐uu".
......She sung it with fake lyrics, but her mama was very pleased......
After that, "uu" remained as an incantation to remember that day she had spent in fun and happiness with her mama.
Of course, even though Aunt Rosa thought it funny at first, eventually she tired of hearing it,
 and later on, started to scold Onee‐chan whenever she said it,
 ......but to Onee‐chan, it was a memory of a fun day that she could never forget......
So among the magics that Maria created, it was the oldest and the first......
Kasumi stuck her fingernails into that page too......
"......Stop,
 ............don\'t tear it......
 At least spare...
......that page........."
"Ehheheheheheheheheh!
 No waay!!"
............With a shrill sound, a girl\'s world of happiness...
was...
erased.
"Uu‐uu‐uu!
 Aaaa‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah, aaaaahah‐hah‐hah‐hah!!
 Is this your magic of happiness?
 Hilarious, hilarious...!!"
"Why would you ever think that magic could make people happy?!
 Magic—listen now—is made of...anger...and hatred!"
"Happiness is what you call the feeling of release you get only when you\'ve pushed all of the hatred you bear onto someone else.
 The happiness you all are talking about is a phantom that doesn\'t show up outside picture books!!"
As Kasumi laughed her head off, she slammed the grimoire against the ground, and stepped on it.
"Can\'t stand it?
 Well? Can\'t stand it?!
 You white witches of happiness?
 If you can\'t stand it that much, why don\'t you show us?!
 Show us your magic!!"
"If it exists, then you just have to use it and show us, riiiiight?
 .........A witch that can\'t use magic isn\'t a witch!!
 So we are the real witches.
 You\'re just brats trying to escape reality with a dream of magic!!"
...............Then,
 .........if I can show you magic, ......will you...
......believe in Onee‐chan\'s magic.........?
"Huh?
 Kyahhahahaha, oh yes, oh yes!!
 I\'ll believe!
 If you {i:can} use magic and show me, that i~s!!
 Go on then, do it, you shit‐for‐brains little braaaaaat!!"
...........................
 .........
Silently, slowly,
 ......I stood up.
 ......The sensations of this small world, such as the pain in my body, felt truly insignificant......
"Oh, looks like you\'ve still got enough energy to stand up, Miss Great Witch?
 *snicker*snicker*!"
"Now that you\'ve stood up, what are you going to show us?
 Go on, show us your magiiic...!"
".....................Magic...exists."
"Whaa?
 What\'s this kid coming out with now...?!
 Did you guys hear that?!"
"Quiet!!!
 ............Heh, isn\'t that interesting.
 ...You people have always declined to show this power of miracles because of the anti‐magic toxin.
 .........Disciple of the white witch {f:5:Maria}.
 Try showing me magic...!!"
"..........................."
"......Do you have any clue how many humans have believed in that miracle and been betrayed?"
".........*giggle*.
 Every one of them believed!
 Every one of them was betrayed and despaired!
 And they all learn that true magic can only be gained by the power of black witches like me...!!"
"...............Taking your hatred out on someone else is nothing more than a crime.
 That isn\'t magic.
 .........I\'ll show you what real magic is."
"...............Y‐you..............."
The black witch winced slightly.
{n}However, Kasumi sneered at me even more.
"Show me, then.
 So? What kind of magic are you going to show me?
 Magic to make candy rain from the sky?
 Or else magic to make cookies multiply?"
"............Wagh?!"
The instant I opened my eyes, a tremendous wind arose.
"Wh‐......what is this, all of a sudden.........?!"
"Come, arise, the Seven Sisters of Purgatory."
".........Whaaat......"
There was a flash behind me, and in an instant, seven high‐level furniture were gathered there.
{n}It was a power that far surpassed the magical power I\'d had in my prime.
{n}It was a power that matched even Maria onee‐chan and {f:5:Beatrice}.
"The Seven Sisters of Purgatory, right here...!!"
"......A‐Ange‐sama......!"
"You said it once.
 ......Because I lacked magical power and resolve,
 ......I could not use you or your sisters.
 ............This isn\'t some cheap emotion, like wanting to get back at my bullying classmates."
"...In order to protect Maria onee‐chan\'s, .........Mariage Sorcière\'s world,
 ......I now order you to show me the miracle of magic."
"I‐it\'s impossible...
 There\'s just no way, not with such a mass of toxin in front of us........."
The Seven Sisters also remembered what had once happened in that classroom.
{n}......If they could have obeyed Ange\'s order, they would have.
......However, ......surrounded by the toxin that runs thick in {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s, they hadn\'t been able to display the miracle of magic.
......And they remembered very well how deeply that had hurt Ange......
But Ange spoke very quietly.
"In that case.
 You all believe too."
"......Huh?"
"............Mariage Sorcière was created to make people happy.
 ...And also to fight the black witch."
"The foolish black witch denies the world created by one of the founders, the Witch of Origins, Lady {f:5:Maria}.
 ......In order to show her that miracle,
 ......and in order to protect that world,
 .........believe.
 In magic.
 In witches.
 Right now—in the miracle...!"
Kasumi gave an order to the black‐suits, and one of them took out a gun and pointed it at Ange.
"You\'re going to show us magic, right?
 Then show us, if you would.
 Use magic to shoot this man down with a fireball or lightning or something."
"You get one chance.
 .........Show us before I count to three, alright?
 If you can\'t, then you had best prepare yourself, okay?
 Ehheheheheh!"
"...........................
 ..................Shoot me."
"What\'s with this kid.
 Hehheheh, she\'s fuckin\' crazy."
The black‐suit pointing the gun laughed at Ange\'s composure.
"Ahhahahahahaha!!
 Are you serious?!
 This girl\'s living in cloud cuckoo land!
 In that case, get yourself shot! Why don\'t you just die foreveeeeeeer?!"
‘Ange...!!
 ......I‐it\'s impossible!
 You can\'t block bullets with magic......!!’
"No.
 There\'s nothing to be afraid of.
 ............To my magic, to the Seven Sisters of Purgatory, bullets are like nothing."
"A‐Ange‐sama........."
Mammon was flustered by Ange\'s absolute trust.
{n}......She would have loved to live up to that trust, if only she could.
 On that day as well.
But, ......she had been unable to do anything, and she had hurt Ange.........
"Hehheheh, you little shit.
 You can use magic, huh? Then goddamn show us already."
"What\'s the hold up?
 Show us some magic, right now!!"
"Come on, no need to hold back!
 Shazow!
 Blast me with some magic, I dare ya!!
 Hihhehhehheh!"
The black‐suits jeered at her.
{n}But Ange simply concentrated her mind in silence......
"Why not just shoot and kill her forever?!
 She\'s even telling you to shoot her!"
"......This kid\'s already lost her mind from fear.
 Bye‐bye, Ange‐chan.
 ......Go and play witches as much as you want in heaven.
 ......Shoot her."
"Heheh, you sure?"
"Shoot!
 Die, Ange!!"
"Magic it up, brat, if you can!!!"
The black‐suit cocked the gun, and, sneering, he...pulled the trigger.
"................................."
A gunshot rang out,
 .........and the world...stopped.
A red spray scattered,
 .........and chunks of flesh flew.
"...uh, ...............ah......"
"What are you doing, Mammon?
 ......You would let this boorish pebble of a bullet reach Ange‐sama?"
Lucifer had lined up the bullet perfectly, and with a single swing, ......had sliced it in two......
And......in the chest of the black‐suit who had apparently fired the gun......there was a hole as big as a fist...
".........Every once in a while,
 it\'s alright for me to go first, right?"
Half of Leviathan\'s body was covered with blood, and she wore a cold smile.
......Then, slowly, .........the pitiful prey that she had brought down...fell over.
"Y‐......you pierced...a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}......!!!"
"Idiot!
 Do you still not believe?!
 In our master\'s magic power...!!"
"Are......you...kidding me.........?!?!
 You ma‐manifested...in front of this many {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s?!?!"
"Wh‐.........what the...what?!"
Kasumi and the rest were thrown into confusion...
He certainly seemed to have fired the gun......
{n}However,
 ......it hadn\'t hit Ange,
 .........and why...
...was the person who fired...
...instead......?!
"......This is...magic.
 ......Great job, Leviathan."
"I am most honored...!!
 You foolish {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s who dare oppose our master!
 Now is the time of judgment! Prostrate yourselves!!"
"H‐how......?!!!
 You shouldn\'t be able to bring magic into the world of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s...!!
 They shouldn\'t be able to {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} magic, they shouldn\'t be able to be touched by magic!!
 ......How?!!"
"............Because this...is true magic."
"...... ......aaaaaaaaaaaaaAAAAA...!!"
"Wh‐what are you people doing?!
 K‐kill her, kill her!!!"
One of the black‐suits who had finally come to his senses pulled his gun, aimed,
"Did you think I\'d overlook the disrespect of pointing a gun at our master......?
 Die."
Those words were his funeral.
 ......The man had already been struck through the chest by Lucifer, who had become the Stake of Pride in an instant.
Thump!
 The sound of the second person falling brought it home to the black‐suits that their lives were unmistakably in peril...!!
"Aaa...waaaaaaaagggh!! Hel‐hel‐heeeeelllllp......!!!"
Almost paralyzed with fright, the man turned on his heels in an attempt to escape from that place,
 ......and in that instant, the Stake of Sloth......
"............Be thankful that this is the only recompense for your violence against our master.
 Die!!"
A hole as big as a walnut opened in his right eye, and his head split.
Belphegor was sprayed with blood, and her face twisted demonically with the joy of being able to use her full power...!
"Ahh...waaaaaaagghhh?!
 Who?!
 Who\'s there?!
 Where are you?!"
The black‐suits panicked, pointing their guns in every direction.
{n}But they didn\'t understand what was happening.
They only knew that something terrifying was coming for them from somewhere,
 but they didn\'t know where...!!
"Idiots!!
 Th‐the enemy is right in front of you!
 The witch\'s furniture is after you!!!"
But they could not {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see}...!!
{n}Because they couldn\'t believe in magic, they could not {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see}...!!
Just as the black witch said, Satan was standing boldly right in front of the black‐suit.
However, the black‐suit couldn\'t {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} that at all...!
"*giggle*...!
 You think {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s could see our forms?
 Perceive us?
 Ahhahahahahahaha, you stupid {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s!!
 Time to pay your foolish compensation for forgetting your awe of magic!!"
"H‐hieeiiiiiie!!!
 What is this?!
 What\'s going on?!"
".........You cannot {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see}.
 Because you have no love."
"......Impossible!!
 There are so many {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s here, the anti‐magic toxin is everywhere...... How can you manifest your magic?!
 What...are you?!?!"
"............A witch.
 And unlike you, a real one."
"Khhh... Wrraa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aagghhh, damn youu{-}u{-}u{-}uuu, you biii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}iitch!!"
As though announcing his candidacy for the fourth victim, one of the black‐suits pointed his gun at Ange.
......And pulled the......
Ange glared at him coldly, and simply ordered.
"F‐fucking diiiiiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeee!!"
"Next.
 Satan."
"Satan the Wrathful, already right here!!"
"Slowpoke!!
 You think a simple bullet could hit Ange‐sama or any of us now?!!!"
The Stake of Wrath......pierced and smashed the bullet fired by the black‐suit,
 and continued straight on, towards the man\'s face—
".........Know your foolishness, and regret it in hell!!
 Die!!"
With a terrible explosive sound, the upper half of the man\'s head was smashed.
Bathed in scattered flesh and blood, Ange quietly asked one more time.
"...So, Aunt Kasumi.
 .........Do you still...
not feel like believing in magic?"
"Th‐
this is crazy...
 ......This can\'t be real...!!
 I, I won\'t accept it...!!
 There\'s no way magic is real......!!!"
"Yes, that\'s right...
 There\'s no way magic exists...!!
 There\'s no way witches exist!!"
‘Ma‐......magic exists!!
 Witches exist......!! Uryuu!!’
".........Yes.
 Magic exists.
 Witches exist.
 ......And in this world filled with anger and sadness, you can make them into the key that opens the door to a world of happiness...!!
 I won\'t let someone like you......deny that!!"
‘Everyone holds the key to a world of happiness in the palm of their hand...!
 And no one......has any right to steal that away......!!’
"You poor {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}, who cannot understand this...
 .........If there had been magic in your life, it would surely have been very different, and much more peaceful."
"Not once in your entire life were you ever able to meet with a true witch, and for this,
 ......I pity you."
"Eee......eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeekkk!!!"
Kasumi let out a piercing scream.
At the same time, the two remaining black‐suits came for me at once, and thrusted their guns against my head.
......Like they were trying to use me as a hostage against something their eyes couldn\'t {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see}.
.........Against the Seven Sisters of Purgatory, high‐level furniture who had now reached the level of weapons, this was completely and totally pointless.
"Dammit, where are you?!
 You don\'t stop attacking, and this bitch is dead!!
 Show yourself!!"
"Kyahhahahahahahaha!!!
 What\'s this guy on about?! And his guts look so tasty too.
 .........Ange‐sama, leave the next one to me!"
"Go ahead. Kill him."
"I am so {i:very} grateful...!!
 Diiiiiee!!!"
The man\'s chest split, and his guts poured out.
 ......This terrible way of dying threw the other man into a total panic.
However, Asmodeus\'s form was already at his back,
 embracing his neck with her arm, ......and smiling obscenely......
"What a cute kid.
 ......Hey, where do you want me to pierce you?
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*, Ange‐sama, do you have any preference?!!!"
"Head."
"Certainly, my masteeeer!!
 Die!!"
The final black‐suit had his head smashed by the Stake of Lust,
 and as his insides scattered, he twisted and fell.
In that gruesome world where six people lay in a sea of blood,
 .........witch and {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} confronted each other.
".........Sumadera Kasumi.
 I sympathize with your pitiable life from the bottom of my heart.
 ......I can give you magic to seal up that unfillable hole in your heart.
 If you will believe in that magic, that is."
"D‐don\'t be so......ridiculous......!!
 This, this is, ...I won\'t accept it!!
 Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeekk!!"
As Kasumi slowly retreated backwards, scared out of her wits,
 .....she picked up a handgun that someone had dropped.
Then, shaking, she pointed it at Ange...
"That\'s right, Kasumi...!
 Shoot her with that gun...!!
 Turn your hatred into a bullet and shoot...!!"
"Hiee...hiie...!!
 I\'ll kill you... I\'ll kill you...!!
 If I don\'t kill you, my life will go unrewarded......!!"
"Yes, kill her!
 Pull the trigger!!
 Take all of the anger and pain from your shabby life until now!!
 Use it all against her!"
"If you don\'t, you won\'t be released from your pain and anguish!!"
"............Stop it, Aunt Kasumi.
 ......You mustn\'t lend an ear to the black witch."
"I\'ll kill you...... I\'ll kill you......!
 Because of your mother,
 ......my entire life...
...has been a wreck......!!"
"Then maybe, starting now bit by bit, you can turn that life into something bright and peaceful, with my magic.
 If you simply believe in magic and have a change of heart,
 it can open the door to a new world for you."
"There\'s no such thing!!
 The salvation she speaks of is obviously just some fairy tale!"
"Your life is already covered with thorns until you die...!!
 Let her hear your cries of agony!!
 You can\'t regain anything that was lost... Right? Sumadera Kasumiiiiiiiiii?!?!"
"Yes, you might not be able to regain anything.
 But I\'m sure you can create something new.
 So, Aunt Kasumi.
 Throw that gun away.
 .........I might be able to teach you of a world of happiness too."
"Hiee...
......hiie...hieeiii......!!
 You,
 .........you don\'t know......!!
 Because your mother ran away,
 .........I was forced to marry her fiancé as a substitute...!!"
"You know I had a man who promised to spend his life with me?!
 You know I was forced to break up with him?!
 You think you understand how I felt when I was made to wed in your mother\'s place,
 ......and was forced to consummate the marriage with a man I had barely even talked to?!?!"
"I wanted to kill her!!
 But Nee‐san just went and died on her own!
 That\'s why I\'m going to kill you!!
 Otherwise, my thorn‐covered life will never eeeeeeeend!!"
......From Kasumi\'s eyes,
 frenzied tears dripped down.
This poor woman...
 ......Even she had such clear and beautiful tears.
But for that very reason, ......she hadn\'t been able to withstand her sad pain,
 and had had no choice but to listen to the black witch\'s temptation...
"..................I feel so sorry for you.
 ......In that case, the least I can do is to forever release you and your soul from the bonds of resentment.
 .........That might be the only bit of charity I can give you now."
"Diiiiiiiiiiiee, Ushiromiya Angeeeeeeeeeee!!!"
"Goodbye, Aunt Kasumi.
 .........Take a long rest in a quiet world."
I no longer feel any anger or hatred towards you.
{n}I just want...
to let your soul rest in peace.
Kasumi\'s handgun spat fire.
Slowly, that bullet continued through a world frozen to the utmost limit, ......making its way towards {f:5:Ange}\'s forehead.
"Mammon."
"......Y‐......yes!!
 Mammon the Covetous, right here...!!"
"Thanks."
"......Huh?"
"It was because I met you and Sakutarou that I was able to understand everything."
‘......Ange......’
"Look away, Sakutarou.
 .........Mammon.
 Release that woman.
 And...protect the honor of Mariage Sorcière...!!"
"Ye‐.........yes!!
 ......Prepare yourself, Sumadera Kasumi!!"
Even though the world was frozen, the Stake of Greed flashed like lightning,
 .........and was already through Kasumi and out the other side...
"If you possess the slightest virtue, you shall have an audience again on the mountain of Purgatory!!
 .........Diiiiiiiieee!!!"
The upper half of Sumadera Kasumi\'s head shattered.
......Her cage of flesh was broken,
 ......and she was finally released......
".........And now...it\'s just you.
 ...........The black witch.
 ......At this point, I feel bad for even seeing a resemblance to Aunt Eva in you."
"Heh, ......heheheheheh.
 ...If my form still looks like Ushiromiya Eva,
 that means you still haven\'t been able to forgive "me" inside yourself."
"I understand, Ange.
 ............You also want to be released from your thorn‐covered life more than anything."
"...................................."
"In that case, ......I\'ve thought of something interesting.
 I\'ll show you magic as well.
 .........I won\'t be the one to kill you."
With the worst smile on her face,
 the black witch changed her form into something like a black mist,
 ...or else a vast swarm of black flying insects, which began to swirl around me.
Then that black mist began to amass bit by bit, ......shaping itself into the form of a human.
".....................What\'s this supposed to be......"
Ehheheheheh!
 I think you know very well what!
That woman you hated and despised the most!
And that woman hated and despised you the most as well...!
When the black mist cleared,
 .........over there was...
.........Aunt Eva\'s form,
 ......as she had been while alive.
......In her hands...she was holding a gun.
"...............Aunt Eva...
...died."
"*giggle*, long time no see, Angeeee.
 ......I\'ve returned from hell to kill youu!
 *cackle*cackle*!!"
Aunt Eva glared at me, laughing madly.
"But......I\'m not that surprised.
 Aunt Eva was that kind of person."
"I imagine my funeral cleared your mood up quite a bit, didn\'t it?
 It did for me too, because it meant that I never have to see your face again...!
 But I did have just one regret.
 And this is it!!"
".........Killing me?
 ............Was that your last request?"
How pitiful.
 ......Even after death,
 ......Aunt wasn\'t released from her suffering......
"It was the black witch\'s power that was the source of my magic.
 Anger and hatred taught me how to work hard and persist.
 Completely different from the escapist magic that you speak of!"
"......The magic you speak of is nothing more than stress reduction through outbursts of anger.
 ......Our magic is different.
 It can remake the entire world.
 .........It\'s of a completely different class than your ill‐natured magic."
"*snicker*!!
 In that case, I\'ll settle it here, once and for all—which comes out on top, black or white...!!
 By my black magic, I have performed a miracle that has allowed me to revive and point a gun at you like this, even after death.
 With what kind of miracle will your white magic fight back?"
"I have taken you in amongst the anti‐magic toxin.
 You won\'t be able to call the Seven Sisters any more.
 That miracle just now won\'t occur again...!!"
"...............But it will, regardless—that\'s the reason it\'s called magic.
 ......Alright.
 Mammon. Lend me your power."
......But Mammon didn\'t respond.
 She didn\'t appear.
Certainly, as she said,
 the anti‐magic toxin had burned everything up like a wasteland parched by a blazing sun...
.........This might be a little tough.
"It\'s useless to call out.
 Never again...
will the Seven Sisters of Purgatory answer you!"
"Like I said.
 I can call them anyway... That\'s what makes it magic, right?"
"........................
 ......You\'re a sad child, Ange.
 So long.
 The simple days we spent together were reasonably fun.
 This is goodbye.
 ......It must be nice for you that this was your final stop."
"Yeah, totally.
 That\'s very thoughtful of you."
"Thanks.
 Then this is farewell."
The barrel of the gun rose slowly,
 ......so that you could see all the way down it.
And,
 .........the trigger was slowly.........
Then,
 ......there was a loud bang from the gun.
...Not in the sense that it fired.
 ......It {i:exploded}.
............You\'re...kidding me......
......In shock, inside frozen space,
 ......Eva looked at the exploded gun.
When time unfroze, the fragments would probably smash into her face all at once...
"......Mammon the Covetous.
 Right here."
".....................You\'re...kidding me..."
Behind Eva\'s back, Mammon stood.
 .........She had already penetrated the target I had given her.
 ......Which was...the gun.
"Is this......enough magic for you?
 ............Aunt Eva."
"......A‐
.........Angeee........."
Then, time unfroze.
{n}Fragments of the ruptured gun and gunpowder gas burned her face.
{n}Letting out a shrill scream, she rolled around covering her face......
......It was pitiful.
"......Unlucky.
 ......This is game over.
 Aunt Eva."
I signaled to Mammon.
 ...To free Eva quickly from her pain as she writhed around with her burnt face.
"............Thank you, Mammon.
 ...I\'d like to apologize again, now, from the bottom of my heart, for calling all of you powerless on that day in the classroom.
 You were excellent furniture for protecting witches."
".........It is I who should be grateful.
 ......I feel truly honored to have been able to meet a good witch and a good master in the end, and to have had the opportunity to fulfill my duty as furniture...!"
Mammon understood.
{n}This would be the final job I would ever give her.
Mammon quietly walked close.
{n}Then, she looked down upon her.
"......Aunt Eva.
 Thank you for sticking with me until today.
 This is farewell.
 <Have a nice dream>.
 <See you in hell>."
"<Cool>."
Then, ......the light sound of her forehead being perforated rang out.
......The battle of gunpowder smoke, delirium, ......and white and black magic...was over.
It felt like it had been a long, .........truly long journey.
{n}And the world slowly...
...sank into darkness.........
The stars that should be sparkling.........lay not in the sky, but were scattered beneath me.
......When I recognized that the pearls and rubies were creating a river of white and red,
 I realized that it was a vast nighttime scene that was spread out below me...
I was in the sky of that nighttime scene, neither standing nor flying,
 ......but simply floating in the air.
......From nowhere in particular, I could hear the sound of one person clapping—
a truly dull applause.
I understood.
 ......It was the one who ordered me to go on this journey,
 ......{f:5:Bernkastel}.
"...............Congratulations,
 Endless Witch, {f:5:Ange Beatrice}.
 At the end of your travels, you understood everything about magic."
"......Yes.
 .........I now...understand everything about magic.
 .........I am...a witch.
 ......The last witch who inherited the magical world created by Mariage Sorcière."
".........No one besides you...can tear {f:5:Beatrice}\'s world to pieces."
"And it was through coming to know magic.........that I learned also how to resist it."
"................................."
"......Magic is made of love and sadness and anger.
 ......No matter how cruel a witch {f:5:Beatrice} might have been,
 the source of her magic is exactly the same."
".........And that\'s why, honestly, I wish I could leave that world of hers alone.
 ......After all, in her eyes at least, that world is complete as it is."
"............But then you\'d have to give up on your family."
".....................
 ......That\'s right.
 So, although I feel bad about it, I have to fight.
 .........Because the very reason I left on this journey to become a witch...
...was so that I could bet on the small probability that I could take my family back."
"Unless you kill {f:5:Beatrice}, only worlds of isolation can exist for you.
 ......As one who has traveled through billions of fragments, I can guarantee it."
"............I understand.
 ......I don\'t have room for compassion.
 ......I must make my heart a demon,
 .........and tear her heart to pieces."
"......It is good that you are steady in your resolve.
 I was worried that, as another witch like her, you might grow attached and lose your will to continue."
Coming from a person like her, whose face was almost always expressionless, those words felt a bit hollow.
{f:5:Bernkastel}.
 ......The enigmatic witch who invited me on this journey.
{n}....................................
"There were moments when I suspected that you might have been lying to me."
".....................Why?"
"......I am the Ange of 1998, so even if I save my family, that will only bring relief to the Ange of 1986.
 ......It won\'t do anything for me.
 So I sometimes felt like I was being deceived."
"........................
 ......That is correct.
 I deceived you."
"......But now I\'m grateful.
 .........After all,
 in the end, you did teach me the way to take my family back."
"............I didn\'t teach you anything.
 ......If you have come to know that, it\'s a state of understanding that you reached on your own as a witch.
 That place you have reached is different from mine.
 .........I myself cannot comprehend it, but if it is as you say, then congratulations."
"I am not a player in this game, but a piece.
 You said this to me, right?"
"............Yes, I did."
"Now, I fully understand that role.
 ...............A piece doesn\'t need emotions.
 It just has to give its all for the sake of victory."
"............Yes.
 That\'s exactly right.
 A game is where you each make the best possible move, right?
 If you allow your moves to get distorted by hesitation and indecision, your opponent will be confused as well."
..................Sorry, {f:5:Beatrice}.
But...don\'t hold it against me.
{n}......“Ushiromiya Ange” still needs her family.
So I have the right to fight you...so that I can take them back.
And you have the responsibility to accept my challenge.
.........So please...don\'t hold it against me.
In exchange...
if you do win in this game,
 I\'ll give you my blessing as well.
Now, let\'s go.
 .........As the piece I am, it\'s finally time for my true turn.
Sorry, {f:5:Beatrice}.
{e:120:I can\'t hand Onii‐chan over to you...!!!}The world whitened......
It wasn\'t "white".
 ...It was the blindingly bright color of gold.
That place......was the beautiful Ushiromiya family rose garden.
However, the roses were all gold.
......The nectar was also golden.
 The butterflies gathering there were gold as well.
............This is...the Golden Land............
The promised land that the witches of Mariage Sorcière would ultimately be guided to...
There, all wishes come true, and all magic and dreams come into being.
............In that garden of gold roses...
............were two, and only two, witches.
At my uninvited appearance,
 the atmosphere trembled with unrest.
.........What was to them an ominous wind shook the golden roses.
The incredibly beautiful scene formed by the golden rose petals scattering in the wind...
was, without a doubt, something not of this world......
The two who had been taking a walk through the golden roses noticed me and reacted in surprise.
"......Ange......?
 .........Beato, it\'s Ange......!!"
"...............How did you get here...?
 .........Leave us alone.
 I no longer invite anyone here."
Beato spoke coldly.
 .........She seemed like a completely different person from the boldly sneering woman she had once been.
She had closed off her heart, and shut herself up in a world where she was alone with Maria onee‐chan.
A world where she could always be alone with friendly Maria onee‐chan,
 conversing about magic while drinking tea.
......No one to hurry them, and nothing to hold them back.
A world where not a single person who might hurt them existed.
Yes, to the two of them, that was a small and complete universe......
".........Sorry.
 ......I can\'t have you shutting yourself up in here.
 .........The game won\'t move on unless you come back."
"I said I was tired of it and I\'m done with it.
 I will not return to the game anymore."
"...............Beato is going to be here all the time with me.
 We\'ll drink tea here together, and think of lots of ways to play...!
 You can play with us too, Ange."
"......{f:5:Maria}.
 We decided against that.
 As long as I have you, I am satisfied.
 Tell me that you too are satisfied as long as you have me."
".....................
 ......Yeah.
 ......Thank you.
 The only person who needs me that much is you, Beato.
 So I\'ll be with you.
 Just us is enough."
".........{f:5:Maria}...... ......Thank you......
 ............I am grateful........."
Beato held Maria tight,
 even creating a small, warm universe within their joined arms...
.........It was probably the birth of the smallest universe in the world.
{n}...The smallest universe in the world, which a pair who needed each other could create...
No matter how small it was, that world was complete.
{n}............But I have to tear it apart.
{n}.....................
"......Sorry,
 .........but I can\'t let things be that way.
 I came to smash this Golden Land of Mariage Sorcière."
"............Why...
...would you break...
...my world.........?
 Wh‐who has this world inconvenienced, outside Maria and myself......?!"
"This game that you started, and then walked away from without finishing,
 is keeping Onii‐chan waiting forever!
 If you don\'t return to your seat, the match will never end...!!"
".........Hahahahaha...ha...!
 There is no longer even a single player in that game.
 Battler vanished, and I came here and vanished as well.
 That game is already over."
"It is not over!
 You started that game, didn\'t you?!!
 Take proper responsibility and see it through to the very end!"
"Either defeat Battler, and give birth to the world you truly wished for,
 or be defeated and release everything swallowed up by your magic!!
 Take responsibility until the very end!!"
"...............Don\'t, Ange.
 Beato will spend her time in this world with me, just the two of us together for eternity.
 ......And I don\'t need anything else either, as long as I have Beato.
 ......All wishes come true here.
 Everything is here."
............This Golden Land is made up of nothing more than the crystallization of Maria onee‐chan and {f:5:Beatrice}\'s thoughts and feelings.
......To drag Beato out of this world,
 ......I have to...
...destroy it.........
..................Destroy this Golden Land,
 .........which must be the final world of peace for {f:5:Beatrice}......
"Onee‐chan. That\'s wrong.
 This Golden Land is a liar.
 It hasn\'t granted the one wish you truly wanted to come true."
".........That\'s not true!!
 Everything is granted here!
 Look, there\'s even a nice Mama here!!"
Gold butterflies gathered behind Maria,
 forming into a kindly smiling Aunt Rosa.
.........And after smiling sweetly at me,
 she softly became golden petals and crumbled.
"Anything can be created here.
 Even you can be, and Battler, and George onii‐chan, and Jessica onee‐chan...!!
 You can summon as many as you want, and everyone is nice...!!
 You come too, Ange, let\'s play together......!!"
............Sorry, Onee‐chan............
"And what about Sakutarou......?"
".........—"
Upon hearing Sakutarou\'s name, Onee‐chan\'s face looked like she was choking.
"Stop it......
 Do not speak that name......"
Beato\'s expression changed as well.
{n}And she put her arm around Maria, hugging her as if to protect her.
.........Sakutarou\'s name was still taboo for Onee‐chan.
"Why can\'t I say it?
 It\'s the name of Maria onee‐chan\'s best friend."
"......Why won\'t you invite that close friend to this wonderful Golden Land?
 Why, in this Golden Land where all wishes come true, is Sakutarou the only one you can\'t summon?"
"Th‐...that\'s because......
 ......It\'s alright, {f:5:Maria}.
 You don\'t have to remember Sakutarou—"
"............Sakutaro was killed by Mama!!!!"
Maria onee‐chan flew into a rage with a terrible expression on her face.
Surprised by that voice, butterflies flew up throughout the garden,
 ......blowing around like a typhoon of flower petals.
"Yes, I know.
 Aunt Rosa......took your precious stuffed animal Sakutarou, and tore him apart......!!"
"GYAAAAAAAaaaAAAAAAAAAAaAAAaaAAHHHH!!!"
Maria\'s scream became a storm and violently scattered the golden petals and leaves.
It was truly a storm of gold.
"Stop...!!
 Stop stop stop...!!!
 Why are you trying to reopen the wound in {f:5:Maria}\'s heart...?!
 Don\'t defile the sleep of a dear friend precious to both Maria and myself...!!"
"In that case, why won\'t you revive that precious friend for her with your magic?"
"I would have if I could...!!
 But that stuffed animal was an article Rosa created herself!
 The magical meaning of that unique object being torn apart is—"
"You aren\'t fooling anyone.
 Why can\'t you revive Sakutarou?
 There\'s only one answer.
 It\'s because you aren\'t a real witch!"
".........I most certainly can revive him...!!
 With my magic, I can revive him as often as I want, like this!!"
"I could even bury this garden in Sakutarous...!!"
"Yeah, I\'ll bet you could, with your magic!
 But Onee‐chan definitely wouldn\'t be able to see the Sakutarous you create!"
"............You know why, right?
 I\'ll say it again.
 It\'s because you aren\'t a real witch...!!"
"Stop iiiiiiiiiit!!
 Why do you keep saying such mean things, Ange...?!
 Beato can use a lot of magic...!
 She\'s a very wonderful witch...!!"
"Sakutaro was the one thing she couldn\'t revive, ......but she can do anything else...!!
 So I can......put up with...
not having Sakutaro......"
"No, Onee‐chan, that\'s wrong.
 .........There\'s nothing a witch can\'t do.
 As soon as she couldn\'t do that,
 {f:5:Beatrice} was not a real witch."
"Tha‐that\'s wrong......!!
 It\'s because Sakutaro\'s stuffed animal vessel was something Mama made by hand herself, and—"
"And that\'s why she can\'t revive him?
 Is {f:5:Beatrice}\'s... Is your magic that inconvenient?"
"Gah, .........i‐......in that case, ......do you claim that you {i:can} revive Sakutarou?!
 Can you do that with your magic?!"
"I can."
".........What........."
"Maria onee‐chan!!
 I\'ll show you some real magic.
 I\'ll revive Sakutarou for you!!"
"......Re‐
.........really......?
 Even {f:5:Beatrice} couldn\'t do it, you know......?
 ...Ca‐
.........can you really......?!"
"Yes, I can!
 In exchange, promise me.
 Once I\'ve revived Sakutarou..."
"Yes...!"
"Leave this Golden Land."
"............!"
"I, I will not permit that...!!
 This world is {f:5:Maria}\'s and mine together!!
 If {f:5:Maria} leaves,
 ......it will break...!!"
The minimum amount of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s it takes to create a universe is two.
{n}If that breaks down, the world is destroyed.
To drag out the witch who shut herself away in the Golden Land, I have to destroy this world...!
"......Yes, and that is the proof that you are not a witch.
 ......A real witch can create a universe alone."
"The Mariage Sorcière Alliance of Witches!
 ......The very existence of this alliance proves that you are not a witch...!!"
"N‐no...!!
 I will not give up {f:5:Maria}...!!
 I hate you, leave right now...!!
 Get out of heeeeeeeeeere!!"
"Dragging everyone into a game of your own accord, then getting bored and chasing them out when your mood changes!!
 How selfish can you be?"
"Watch and learn, {f:5:Beatrice}!!
 And you, Maria onee‐chan!!
 This...is true magic.........!!!"
"Ca‐......can you really revive Sakutaro...?!"
"There\'s no way!!
 This is a Golden Land for Maria and me alone...!
 There is not a single piece of magic that an outsider like you could use here!
 As you are now, you couldn\'t even create a single butterfly!!"
"Be quiet, Beato!!
 Don\'t get in Ange\'s way...!!"
When Maria yelled,
 ......the storm abruptly stopped, and the area returned to silence.
.........As the massive amount of golden petals that had been blown upwards quietly drifted down,
 ......that scene looked so fantastical, as though a golden snow was falling......
Maria, thinking about this unlikely, if‐only miracle,
 unconsciously joined her hands together as though praying.
......Beato\'s heart raced as she watched Maria do this.
.........If the extremely unlikely were to happen,
 ...Maria would,
 ......this world would......
But......it\'s inconceivable......!
 An absolute impossibility...
That stuffed animal, the only one of its kind in the world, was torn apart and thrown away,
 and not a thread remained.
Reviving it is an absolutely certain impossibility......!!
{p:1:This is my Golden Land}...!
{p:1:A world where magic that isn\'t mine certainly cannot exist}!!!
"G‐
......go right ahead,
 ......I defy you to do it, Ushiromiya Angeeeee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}eee!!!"
At Beato\'s scream, the world lost its sound.
I slowly...recited the incantation...for true magic......
"...............Come, try to remember.
 Maria\'s close friend Sakutarou."
".........Try to remember what form you had."
".........Try to remember what a lovable stuffed animal you were."
"Huh, ..................ah, ...ah........."
"....................................!"
......Expressions of shock rose to both of their faces.
Then, ......pushing Beato\'s elbow aside, Maria dashed forward......
".........kutaro.........
 .........Sakutarooo.........!!"
Then,
 ............she threw her arms around him and me both.
"......It\'s alright.
 Sakutarou...won\'t disappear.
 ............
 ‘Uryu,
 Maria. I\'m back.’"
"Sakutaro,
 ......Sakutaro......
 ......uuuuuuuuuuuuuuu,
 waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaauuuuu!!
 Sakutarooooooo......
 I missed you......
...so much..............."
It was, unmistakably,
 .........that lion,
 ......that Sakutarou stuffed animal.
Maria had forgotten its softness, its texture, its stitches,
 .........its everything.
But,
 .........the instant she hugged the stuffed animal, everything came back to her vividly......
‘Uryu.
 Maria,
 ......I\'m back.’
"Sakutaro, Sakutaro...!!
 Is your body alright?
 You aren\'t hurting anywhere?
 Even though something so......horrible was done to you, you\'re alright everywhere......?!"
‘Uryu...!
 Ange revived me with magic, so I\'m perfectly fine...!’
"I\'m so glad......
 I\'m so glad......
 Welcome back, Sakutaro......
uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!!"
‘I\'ll always be with you from now on, Maria.
 Together forever.
 ......So don\'t...
let go of me, okay.........?’
"Yeah, ......won\'t let go......
 ......Never ever....................."
Then, still hugging Sakutarou,
 she looked up at me with tear‐filled eyes...
"......Thank you, Ange...!
 .........Your magic is amazing......
 ......Why?
 Why were you able to revive Sakutarou?!
 Even Beato couldn\'t do it...!"
"..................Impossible...
 ......Impossible......
 ......How?
 ......How can a human other than me use magic in my Golden Land?!?!
 This is...
......completely impossible.........!"
"What are you so flustered about, {f:5:Beatrice}?
 ..................This is...magic, right?"
"It cannot possibly be magic...!!
 {p:1:This is my Golden Land}!!
 {p:1:A world where magic that isn\'t mine certainly cannot exist}!!
 And my
 {p:1:magic was not able to revive Sakutarou}...!!"
"There\'s no way it could!!
 {p:1:That stuffed animal was a special stuffed animal}!
 {p:1:Rosa made it for her daughter\'s birthday, and in the entire world, only one of its kind}—
.........—
...............u...
...............hh......"
".....................See,
 ...it\'s magic, right?"
"Ah...
......oh......
......ahh...
.........aaahhh,
 .........aah...h...hh...hhhh......"
With this miracle that she could not possibly accept,
 .........Beato...understood all of my magic......
And she looked at Maria and Sakutarou innocently frolicking around,
 ......looked at me,
 .........and then...
......fell to her knees,
 ......with even her hands pressed to the ground,
 ...............and cried.
"{f:5:Beatrice}...! This is really magic, right...?!
 It\'s magic, right?!
 {f:5:Beatrice}...!!!"
"...............Mm.........
 ......It is magic......
 ......That is...
......true...
......magic........."
"How can Ange use a magic that even Beato can\'t do?!
 How?!
 How?!
 Ange\'s awesome, Ange\'s an awesome witch!
 A real witch who\'s much, much more amazing than me......!!!"
"Yes, that\'s right, Onee‐chan.
 ...............I am the Witch of Resurrection, {f:5:Ange}.
 ......There is nothing that cannot be revived by me."
"Oh wow, oh wow!!
 Even Beato said that the magic of resurrection was the hardest!!
 {f:5:Ange}, you\'re awesome!!
 A real real Great Witch......!!!"
At that moment, Maria\'s and Sakutarou\'s forms flashed gold,
 ......and the two became golden flower petals, and crumbled away......
As the two became a golden wind and swirled together,
 .........they left for some other place of peace.
Beato had, ......as promised, banished Maria from the Golden Land.
"......Goodbye, ...Maria onee‐chan.
 And be happy forever.
 ............It\'s alright, I\'m sure "you" exist in Onee‐chan\'s world as well.
 But that {i:doesn\'t refer to you}."
"...............I am happy for you,
 ......Maria......
 ......As your close friend,
 .........I celebrate this reunion...from the bottom of my heart........."
On Beato\'s face......was a mixture of what was probably every expression a human could muster.
That expression—
it was joy,
 it was anger,
 it was sadness.
".........That is the basis of magic, isn\'t it.
 ............Without love,
 without sadness,
 without anger,
 ............magic cannot be {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen}."
The ground shook.
 ......An earthquake.
.........It gradually caused greater and greater fissures,
 and began to tear {f:5:Beatrice}\'s final paradise apart.
Golden butterflies fluttered about trying to escape, but there was nowhere to escape to.
{n}...Nor for {f:5:Beatrice}.
The Golden Land began to crumble away.
The earth gave way like a floor falling through,
 .........and {f:5:Beatrice} was sucked into the depths of a jet‐black darkness.
Then, she was mercilessly slammed against a jet‐black floor.
......It was a small, nondescript, and very dimly lit smoking room.
There was no door to exit by, and while there were windows,
 ......they let no light into this place—{f:5:Beatrice}\'s smoking room.
Even as Beato moaned from the pain of being slammed against that cold hard floor,
 she shakily rose to her feet......
A seat was there.
......And the game table, ......still just as it had been when she had left it.
The game board, too, was preserved in the same state in which Beato had abandoned it.
"That is your seat.
 Sit."
"...............So, this is the only seat...
......for me to sit in........."
Beato put a hand against her own seat, ......and laughed sadly.
"Win, or lose.
 That is all you are given.
 A tie during the process of reaching that point will probably be permitted."
".........But the one thing I will {i:not} allow is for you to suspend the game and throw it away!
 Either win and survive, or lose and disappear!
 Until one of those two things happens, you will not be permitted to rise from that chair!!"
"Isn\'t that your only duty as the host of a witch\'s game, as the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}...?!!"
Laughing weakly, Beato...
...sat down.
......Then she rested her elbows on the table, covered her face with both hands,
 .........and managed to put together a smile with just her mouth.
".........Not permitted to escape an unwinnable game.
 .........Very well, then.
 ......Why don\'t I repeat this......until I lose......"
"Spare me the pity show!
 Win.
 Use the very best moves you have...!!
 You started this game!
 You have a duty to make the best moves possible!!
 Enough with all this indecisive fooling around!"
Just then, there was a heavy sound.
{n}......Beato felt a cold and pitiful sensation on her leg.
"......Gotcha...!
 I finally got you, eh, Beato~?"
"Oh, if it isn\'t the great Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}...
 .........To think that you were still here."
Beato\'s foot was locked in an ice‐cold steel shackle,
 ......fastening her to the chair she sat in.
......She would no longer be able to escape from this seat.
"Oh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho!
 You won\'t be able to escape anymore, got it?
 I\'m more persistent than I look. Surprising, huh?"
"............I\'m more surprised that you weren\'t already aware of it."
"You are not permitted to leave early or suspend the game.
 You\'ll fight for all eternity, in order to win, of course.
 .........You don\'t want to lose, right?
 You wanna little peek at the kind of wonderful world you\'ll be thrown into if you loooose?"
"Don\'t worry...
 You can win... {i:Until you do}, I, the great Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}, will stick right by you and look after you for all eternity...!!"
".................................
 ......Hmph, ......hahahahaha.
 .........But even if I wish to fight, I have no opponent across from me, correct......?"
".........It\'s alright, I\'ve found Battler."
When {f:5:Bernkastel} appeared and clapped her hands,
 Battler appeared from the sky and plopped into the opposite chair.
Battler\'s eyes were slightly opened, but there was no sparkle in them, almost like a doll.
Without the one pillar that established his soul,
 ............he had fallen into the very depths of darkness, and had been drifting about all this time.
......By rights, he should have dispersed and vanished like mist.
{f:5:Bernkastel} had managed to scrape him together.
{n}It was surprising that she had managed to bring him back into a human form.
However, even though his body had returned, his soul had not.
{n}......It was blown away when his existence was denied by {f:5:Beatrice}.
{n}It wouldn\'t come back easily.
"...............Battler won\'t run from this fight either.
 Not until he beats you.
 ......We won\'t permit such boorishness as to throw everything away and run just because the chances of winning have grown slim."
"Not even he himself wants that.
 ............Right, Ushiromiya Battler...?"
Battler didn\'t answer.
 ......His heart was still...dead.
His eyes wavered slightly at the question, but he couldn\'t answer.
"Battler...!
 Get ahold of yourself!
 You are here.
 And the enemy is before your eyes...!
 Fight!
 Fight to win!!"
Battler lazily and incoherently parroted her words.
.........He was back.
But the trauma inflicted on his soul was no small thing.
That was only natural.
{n}{f:5:Beatrice} had woven her red, and he had been denied.
He had learned that the mother he had respected was not his birth mother,
 .........and he didn\'t know who he was.
......I am not...
...Ushiromiya Battler............
"Don\'t talk stupid!
 You are Ushiromiya Battler and no one else!"
"No matter who else admits that or denies that, make sure you believe it yourself...!!
 You are the only one who can create your own world, you know.
 Don\'t lose the world where you are Ushiromiya Battler!"
"...............Then,
 ............who...
...am I.........?
 I\'m not Mom\'s kid......
 Where was I born from......?"
Battler asked while gazing lazily up at the ceiling, with eyes that still hadn\'t regained their sparkle.
Of course, she answered right away.
"Yes, that\'s true.
 Beato declared it with the red truth.
 ......So I\'ll declare it too.
 {p:1:Ushiromiya Battler is not Ushiromiya Asumu\'s son}."
".........Hmph, ......in that case, he is not qualified to be the opponent in my game, is he..."
"Repetition request for {f:5:Beatrice}.
 "Ushiromiya Battler is not Ushiromiya Kinzo\'s grandchild"."
".............................."
As Beato wrinkled her forehead,
 ......a pained smile rose to her face.
"Declining to repeat, I see.
 Beato declared two red truths:
 "{p:1:You are not Asumu\'s son}",
 and
 "{p:1:No one except Kinzo\'s grandchild Battler is qualified to be her opponent}"."
"The following theory will see you accepted as qualified without any contradictions.
 This is my blue truth—listen to this...!"
{p:2:The one who is qualified to be Beato\'s opponent is "Kinzo\'s grandchild, Ushiromiya Battler",}
 {p:2:and whether that person is "Asumu\'s son" or not is not an issue}.
{p:2:In other words, you can be Kinzo\'s grandchild even if you are not Asumu\'s son}.
{p:2:As long as you are Rudolf\'s son}!
"Hmph, what a stupid word game."
"...............Blue truth, valid.
 Beato, your counterargument with the red truth?
 If you cannot counter it with the red truth, there is no problem with Battler\'s qualifications as an opponent."
"................................."
.........Battler was still out of it.
{n}He still couldn\'t really understand what she was saying for him.
......But even so, his spirit was starting to come back bit by bit...
"..................Then,
 ............who...
......am I......?"
"Get ahold of yourself!
 You are Ushiromiya Battler!
 Yeah, maybe Asumu okaa‐san didn\'t give birth to you.
 But so what?!
 That doesn\'t change in the slightest the fact that she was a mother to you, right?!"
".........For example, what is Ushiromiya Ange to you?
 You might not share the same blood, but she\'s still your little sister, right?!
 It\'s not about blood, it\'s about bonds, isn\'t it?!"
"............Well...yeah......
 ......Even though we don\'t share the same blood, ......Ange is...
......my little sister."
"Say it in red!
 Say that Ange is your little sister!!"
".........
{p:1:Ange is......my little sister}.
 .........ah, ............it worked."
She hugged Battler, who was still out of it and slumped in his chair, strongly from behind.
 So strongly that it hurt.
"I don\'t know why Asumu okaa‐san wasn\'t your birth mother.
 But still, until today you believed that she was your mother, and you still do, right?!
 In this world, there are plenty of people without even a mother,
 ......without even a family!!"
"Did Asumu okaa‐san ever let you feel lonely?
 Never, right?!
 Don\'t throw your peaceful family away so easily!!
 Your family bonds have gotten way too thin after leaving your family for six years!!"
"You have to feel those family bonds much, much more strongly!
 Remember!!
 For Asumu okaa‐san\'s sake, don\'t lose your affection because of some stupid ravings from a witch!"
"...........................
 .........You\'re right......
 ......Mom was......always on my side......"
"...............Where is this place......?
 ......It\'s dark......
 ......I wanna go home......
 Where\'s...
all of my...
...family.........?"
The light still hadn\'t returned to Battler\'s eyes.
{n}But......tears formed there.
"Your little sister is waiting at home for you to come back.
 She needs you at least to come back, ......or she\'ll be all alone forever...!
 For your little sister\'s sake if nothing else, please win this witch\'s game...!!"
"............Ange......
 My...
...little sister.........
 ......But the thing is...
......I don\'t know anymore...
 .........Why do I...
have to keep repeating this incomprehensible, cruel game with Beato forever......?
 ......I\'ve...
...had enough........."
"In that case, hurry up and finish off this game and go back home!!
 Ushiromiya Battler, how long are you going to play around in a place like this?!
 Your little sister is waiting for you to come home!!!"
.........That\'s right.
Battler was caught up in this strange game before he even knew it.
And, unable to understand what he was fighting for,
 he was taken along at the witch\'s pace, toyed with and made to fight, for a very long time.
That should have been the simplest and first question.
......Not understanding that is why he loses his purpose for fighting...!!
It\'s why my voice doesn\'t reach his ears...!
What he needs is not some vague purpose, like winning against the witch, or because she\'s unforgivable.
......He needs to become aware of a purpose for which he {i:must} win.
".........That\'s right......
 ......I want to go home......
 ......To Mom and Dad,
 ......and Ange......
 .........I\'ve had enough,
 ......enough of this place......
 ......I\'ve had enough of witches, I\'ve had enough of games and murders......
......enough,
 enough......"
"Battler\'s soul...is starting to come back."
"...............But it can\'t quite reach."
"You\'ve had enough, right?!
 Then fight so you can return to your family!!
 Destroy {f:5:Beatrice} and come home!!"
"No, ......no more witches...!
 Enough of Beato, ...enough of everything...and you too, you\'re probably just another one of the witch\'s allies...
 I could be betrayed again at any time...!!"
"{p:1:I can\'t trust anything, I can\'t trust any words that aren\'t red}...!!
 Leave me alone, leave me alo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}ooone!!"
Battler\'s soul howled.
 She hugged his head from behind, so tightly that it hurt.
"{p:1:Hurry up and come home, Onii‐chan}!!
 {p:1:Don\'t leave me all alone}!!!"
"...............Huh......?
 .........Who...
...............are you......?"
"{p:1:It\'s me, it\'s Ange}...!!
 {p:1:No one\'s coming back home, Onii‐chan, not you, not Mom, not Dad}!!
 {p:1:I\'m so lonely}!!
 {p:1:Please, hurry up and come home}!"
"......A‐.........Ange......
 .........So you were.........Ange............"
"{p:1:That\'s right, I\'m Ange}!!
 {p:1:The Ushiromiya Ange of a world where no one comes home}...!!
 .........{p:1:My entire family...never came home from Rokkenjima that day}...!!"
"{p:1:The witch before your eyes stole away my whole family, even you}...!
 .........{p:1:Only you can finish her, Onii‐chan}!!
 {p:1:Finish her}...!!"
"{p:1:And take your family back}!!
 {p:1:And then.........come home to me}......!!!"
"...............Beato stole...
...my family........."
"......Hmph, ............as she says.
 I will not run away or hide from it.
 ......I stole Ushiromiya Ange\'s family away from her."
"Battler is my toy!
 His father and mother too, all of them are my toys.
 ......I won\'t give them back to you.
 ......You may continue to wander alone forever, awaiting the return of your family that is never to be......!"
From Ange\'s arms that held him, ............the very painful, sad, and lonely days...
...that his little sister, left all alone, had gone through...flowed into Battler......
......Because he had been playing around in a place like this,
 ............his little sister had been left all alone, .........and had been forced to endure...
.........such painful days...............!!
"...Ange, .........Ange.........!!
 Shit, ......I\'ve, .........what have I been doing.........?!!
 Thanks a bunch, Ange...
 Onii‐chan......has been forgetting something important this whole time......!"
Battler tried to turn around,
 but Ange was clutching his head with an incredible force, so he couldn\'t.
......Sweat?
Hot drops splashed the back of Battler\'s neck.
......What they were...he discovered by holding Ange\'s arm as she clung to him.
.........Because it stained Battler\'s hand...his fingers...red.
".........Blood...
 ......A‐Ange?!
 A‐are you alright?!
 H‐hey......?!"
It dripped and splashed.
He didn\'t know what was going on.
Battler couldn\'t tell for sure because he couldn\'t turn around,
 but the hot drops staining his entire back were surely......blood.
"............In order to save you, Onii‐chan,
 in order to come here,
 there was a single rule that I wasn\'t allowed to...
...break...
 .........This...
.........was it.
 .........Letting you...
......find out...
...that I was...
...Ange........."
......It was so hard.........
My onii‐chan was right before my eyes, ......and I couldn\'t even tell him.........
If I\'d just followed the rule, ......I would have been able to stay by your side forever.
.........You and me together...
...playing the game against the witch...
...for eternity......
"But...
......that\'s no good."
"............Onii‐
......ah...
.........chan,
 ......you have to go back."
".........Back home,
 ......your sister is waiting for you......"
".........That person isn\'t me,
 ............but this way, your sister...
will find her salvation........."
"Ange?!
 Ange!!
 There\'s so much blood...!!
 So much, so much!!"
He wanted to turn around, but he couldn\'t because of how tightly Ange was gripping his head.
However, judging by the blood that was pouring out and Ange\'s pained breathing,
 he realized that something seriously wrong was happening to her right now.
"............Don\'t...worry.........
 ......I am just......a piece......
 .........You know, in chess, ......they have this thing called a <sacrifice>......"
"Sacri—......what?!
 Who cares about that!!
 Let\'s get you some first‐aid quickly!!
 Let go for a second, Ange...!!"
".........A <sacrifice>...is a thrown piece.
 For the sake of the strategic vision, you intentionally let a piece go, in full awareness of the loss..."
The ultimate goal in chess is victory against the opponent.
{n}......So sacrificing a few individual pieces is no problem if that can bring you to victory in the end.
Ange had made a levelheaded decision.
.........She had been told over and over again that she was a piece, not a player.
......In order to act like a piece and save Battler, right now, she herself needed to become a sacrificial piece.
............Battler had to be made aware.
His purpose in playing this witch\'s game must not be something abstract like finishing off the witch.
He needs to win the game, he needs to release himself, and he needs to bring his family back home.
Why?
 .........Because he has family—a little sister—waiting for him to come home.
A being created to bring Ushiromiya Ange\'s voice to him...
{i:That} is who {f:5:Ange Beatrice} is—who I am...!!
I will use the piece I am as a sacrifice...
to give Onii‐chan the will to fight, to give him purpose!
Onii‐chan, my purpose is not to play with you in a witch\'s game for all eternity!
I came to bring you Ushiromiya Ange\'s mourning and sadness!
 That is my unshakable purpose!
"......Ange!!
 Ange!!
 Aaaaaaaaaarrrghhh!!!"
The white, skinny arm holding Battler......was pale and transparent, almost like wax.
...But it was stained, so cruelly, with fresh blood......
"...I\'m.........
...going to disappear now, but......
......you fight with all you\'ve got,
 .........and make sure you...
...come back to me, okay........."
"............I\'ll be waiting,
 ............always...............
 ......I planned on helping you out a whole lot more than this,
 ......but I couldn\'t do anything.
 ......Sorry....................."
"D‐don\'t worry about that......!!
 You......taught me, didn\'t you......?!
 You taught me why I have to win...!
 And that...I absolutely have to win, and come back to you......!!"
"What have I.........been doing, lazing about playing in a place like this......?!!
 Yeah, I\'m not playing around here anymore...!!
 I\'m gonna come back, you better believe I\'ll come back!!
 I\'m definitely gonna come back, bringing a souvenir, I promise......!!!"
".........I don\'t need one,
 .........so just promise me one thing......"
"What is it? I\'ll promise anything...!!"
"......In a second, I\'m going to take my hand away......
 It must have hurt, right......?
 I held you so tightly...
 .........Sorry........."
".........I\'m alright,
 ......you don\'t have to turn around, so...
.........before I go...
...show me you at your...
...coolest.........
 ......Rise from your seat,
 ......point at the witch before your eyes,
 ......and declare that the game will recommence........."
Ange\'s hand......slid...
......and disappeared behind me.
The stark marks of her fingers were left behind in the blood that had been oozing from her fingernails...
But I turned around right away.
{n}To take care of Ange\'s wounds...!
"Angeeeeeeeee...
eeee...ee.........
........................
 ......Ange...?"
"Aa~ah, and you even promised that you wouldn\'t turn around..."
"......A‐......Ange.........
ah, aahhh, ...wh‐where\'d she......"
Behind my chair,
 .........as though......about ten watermelons packed with blood...
...had all been smashed,
 ......there was a sticky, pulpy...
...mountain...
And around that mountain of blood and minced meat,
 ......the clothes and shoes Ange had been wearing...
...lay crumpled as though they had been thrown off...
......As though a human\'s insides alone had been pulverized and discarded.
......As though Ange, who had been standing there until just a second ago, had been crushed.........
"Ange......?
 Wh‐......where is Ange......?
 Where did Ange disappear to......?
 H‐hey!
 Where did Ange disappear to?!"
The two young‐looking witches said nothing,
 .........and just silently looked at the mountain of blood and meat and clothes.
But, ......I didn\'t want to accept it.
{n}......I did not want to accept it!!!
"..................I was right in front of you.
 .........Watching the whole time.
 Watching what happened.........to Ange behind you."
"......D‐......do you know......?
 .........Where did...Ange go.........?"
".........While she still lived,
 pinch by pinch, massive red‐hot pincers...
...tore chunks of flesh the size of a thumb off of her,
 ......and threw them away."
".........I was watching.
 I watched as countless cruel tools, red‐hot from the witch\'s furnace, approached Ange from behind,
 and one bit at a time, ......pecked at her flesh, twisted it off, ripped it off in chunks, ......and tore her to pieces."
"............Ange should be proud.
 In order to exchange her last words with her brother,
 ......she withstood the gasps of pain until the very end...
 ......She should be proud of that."
......Like hell that happened......
But......rolling there,
 ......on top of that mountain of flesh and clothes,
 ............was, without a doubt, what she had been wearing on her head: those pink‐bead...hair ornaments.
To be honest, I was thinking they were a bit too childish and didn\'t really suit her...
......So I remembered them well.
...............Why has Ange been wearing these cheap hair ornaments all this time......?
No, no,
 ......this can\'t be Ange,
 ......it couldn\'t be,
 ......uug...uuuuhhhuuuuuuu...!
".....................That was honest, Beato."
"Battler didn\'t see it,
 so you could\'ve just said that she turned into butterflies and flew away, or something."
"......Y‐
...you guys also...
.........s‐......saw...
.........that happen......?"
"Y‐
......you watched Ange...
...get torn into...
...little bits...?"
"You were watching,
 .........and yet...
...you kept your faces...
...that calm.........?!"
Without answering, {f:5:Bernkastel}, {f:5:Lambdadelta},
 and {f:5:Beatrice} looked at me,
 ......some in pity, ...others in derision.........
She was calling herself Gretel,
 so after what happened with {f:5:Virgilia} in the last game, ......I was thinking up until now that she might be Beato\'s underling,
 and I was making sure not to trust her even though she was on my side...
And then,
 .........just as I learn that it was actually Ange,
 ......I\'m not permitted to see her face...
.........and when I turn around,
 ......I find...
......something...
......like this...
 ............uuuuuuoohhhhh.........!
"What does it matter?
 .........About your little sister."
"......What......did you say............?"
"You will never return from this place in any case.
 .........Whatever happens to your little sister in a world where you don\'t come home has nothing to do with you."
"As long as you play here, the Anges of countless worlds will live in isolation,
 and the same pain of her final moments just now will be forced upon them, diluted over a period of more than a decade."
".........However, that is of no importance, correct?
 It cannot be {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen} by you from here.
 You cannot observe it.
 An unobservable truth cannot be proven except by the red truth."
"Therefore, your anxiety over Ange\'s future unhappiness might well be an ungrounded fear.
 ............She might, surprisingly enough, have an easy life ahead of her, never needing to work, thanks to Rudolf\'s inheritance, right?
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!"
......That was...
...a lie.
From Ange\'s arm, every part of the sad world that follows had poured into me in an instant.
It\'s all because...
......I keep on...
......lazing about forever...
......and playing in a place like this.........!!
......I...
never thought about anyone but myself......
I have to defeat her!
 I have to take back my family,
 ......and come back to Ange who\'s waiting for me, ......as soon as humanly possible.........!
Because even as I hang around with the witch like this,
 Ange\'s heart continues to be torn to bits by sadness...!!
"............Ange, ......is {i:this}...
......what you wanted to see......?"
......Towards the cruel witch who had indifferently spoken of Ange\'s brutal last moments, slowly,
 ......and yet...
...with all my might,
 ......I pointed......
".........{f:5:Beatrice}......"
"Mm."
"............Resume this game.
 .........I won\'t run away anymore, ......and I won\'t let you get away, either."
"As I like it.
 I can no longer escape or hide.
 .........Let us settle this between us for certain.
 .........One will win.
 One will lose, and be destroyed.
 No other resolution exists."
".........I will win.
 No matter how long it takes, I will definitely defeat you...!!
 In this match, there will no longer be any compromise, interruptions or losing by default!!
 I won\'t run away!
 You won\'t get away!!"
"Come take me down, with everything you\'ve got...!!
 There\'s no need for any stupid tricks or deceptions, no need for interacting with each other weirdly or acting all friendly!!
 You and I are enemies...!!!
 I have to settle this as soon as possible, .........and bring my family back to Ange!!!"
......Unwavering purpose.
 ...Absolute, certain willpower.
A {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}\'s certain willpower becomes certain magical power.
......That acts as a miracle, and makes it a promise.
Yes, this is a promised {i:certain miracle}.
..................Is there not even a one in ten‐billion chance...{n}
no.........is it {i:certain that there is not even a fragment of a miracle}...{n}
that could make my victory happen?
Before I knew it, a cold, stiff chain had bound my other leg without a sound,
 fastening me to the chair...
............All that is left to me is either to be killed by Battler and be defeated,
 or resist that, and repeatedly tie for all eternity.
......No, I guess that\'s "repeatedly tie until I prepare my heart for death".
Either way.
.........I must now fight only to lose.
I have already been bound in eternal chains.
And Battler won\'t let me escape either.
......Should I pathetically beg for his forgiveness...?
Should I ask for compassion by appealing to his pitying heart...?
Should I disregard appearances and prostrate myself?
Because of the chains, even that will not be granted me.
......Checkmate.
The perfect endgame.
.................................However.
I am the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}.
The demon lord of gold who reigns over the Golden Land.
It may be a losing battle, but still there exists an attitude befitting my stature.
And I have the right to beautify my death in a manner fitting for me.
".........And I likewise.
 I will make you accept the existence of my magic, and open the door to the Golden Land on this island.
 You shall become the guest of honor at the very first tea party."
"Everyone besides you has gathered already, you see?
 Because the arrival of the guest of honor has been delayed, the tea party cannot begin.
 Your father, mother, cousins, and everyone else are getting tired of waiting for your arrival."
"Yeah, suits me, suits me absolutely perfect!!
 Magic and witches, what a load of bullshit...!!
 I\'m done playing games with you!!
 Here we go, {f:5:Beatrice}...!!!"
"I suggest you hold nothing back, for there will be no compromise, interruptions or losing by default.
 One will win, and one will be destroyed."
"If you have no desire to lose, then you must defeat me, kill me.
 However, I will not go down without a fight.
 I can resist repeatedly, until you prepare a fitting end for me."
"Are you capable of doing that?
 ......Yes, I\'m sure you can.
 I know you can.
 Now...come kill me.
 ..................
 .....................Am I making you uncomfortable?
 Then let\'s go with something more familiar.
 ....................."
"Hyahhaha!!
 Like hell I\'ll be killed,
 even if I can\'t win, I can still frustrate the hell out of you by not giving you the victory, rii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}ight?!"
"Hoh, that\'s a good look on your face!
 ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*,
 uhhyahhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha,
 aaa{0}kkya{0}kkya{0}kkya{0}kkya{0}kkya!!"
"Try and kill me,
 just try and kill me, Ushiromiya Battleee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}eer!! Rrrrr{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}h{0}h{0}h{0}h{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhhh!!!".........I don\'t have a clue what to make of all this.
Please, someone explain what happened yesterday in a way that I can understand.
I continued helping myself to the food in the mansion\'s kitchen.
That massive commercial refrigerator had everything.
{n}I could eat and drink as much as I liked.
......I\'d have more than enough to eat even if the typhoon didn\'t clear up for a week.
With a bottle in one hand, half of which I\'d already drunk, I helped myself to some sliced ham.
I wonder just how expensive this stuff is.
Man, you ingredients are out of luck.
 If only you\'d had Gohda‐san cook you, you could\'ve been reborn as much more incredible food.
I looked at the clock.
 Very soon, it would be midnight.
{n}October 5th, the second day, would end.
.........The insanity of yesterday\'s October 4th didn\'t seem real.
{n}...That was how......little had happened after my so‐called test.
Nothing was happening.
No phone calls, no letters.
{n}No one coming to see me, no one coming to attack me.
Not a goddamn thing.
Gimme back all the time and energy I wasted being on edge.
 .........An entire day, a full twenty‐four hours.
......And aaaabsolutely nothing happened.
{n}And I\'m sure that nothing will continue to happen as well.
.........A full twenty‐four hours ago...
{n}...I was called to the front of the mansion by {f:5:Beatrice}.
There, I was given some kind of weird test to do with determining the successor to the head or something.
I gave a serious answer in my own way, but unfortunately, we just didn\'t seem to be {i:getting} each other.
{f:5:Beatrice} got bent out of shape for no reason and stopped talking to me.
I yelled at her to say something, but she wouldn\'t say a word.
Then I asked where Maria was, and she just told me to go to the chapel, and went away.
What an astounding anticlimax.
 ......Stupid as it was, it was still a test, so at least tell me whether I\'ve passed or failed, for hell\'s sake.
What, is she trying to say "Good work, your results will be mailed to you later" or something?
{n}......Annoying bitch.
In any case, I then headed to the chapel.
......Both George‐aniki and Jessica had been killed after failing their tests.
{n}I couldn\'t let Maria be killed too.
......Besides, I thought this could be a chance to catch whoever it was while they were in the process of trying to kill Maria.
When I was young, Jessica often told me that I\'d get in trouble if I went near the chapel,
 so I\'d never been there, but I at least knew where it was.
I couldn\'t sense anyone there,
 .........but there was a bundle of keys lying in front of the door.
I thought this might be a message to open the door to the chapel, but after trying all of the keys, I found that none of them fit.
I also called Maria\'s name, but there was no answer whatsoever.
{n}I searched around the chapel, but there was a limit to what I could do in the pitch black with just a flashlight.
I realized that this key bundle might be a set of master keys, which could possibly open the door to the mansion.
Finding no sign of Maria, I returned to the mansion.
The mansion was wrapped in silence.
 And in a horrible stench.
Still, it\'s pretty amazing how good humans are at adapting.
Technically, that smell was still pervading the entire mansion.
But I\'d grown completely used to it and stopped minding it by this point.
It didn\'t feel like anything more than any old house where someone had burnt some meat.
The stench knocked me back on first entering, but I ignored it and decided to head to the dining hall...
......where I found all those corpses that were in such a sorry state that Gohda‐san and Kumasawa‐san had hesitated to speak of them in any detail.
They were the remains of the very first victims: Aunt Natsuhi and the rest.
Each of them had half of their head dramatically splattered out,
 and it was such a gruesome sight that even without knowing a thing about examining corpses, I could pronounce them one hundred percent dead...
......And on top of that, the remaining half of their faces were left like normal, so it was even easy to identify them.
...They\'d really pulled out all the stops for these corpses.
And finally, the bodies here weren\'t just the six of the first twilight—they had grown in number, and now included one more.
The seventh corpse............was Maria.
She was lying next to Aunt Rosa, as though sleeping alongside her.
...............I cried.
At the death of an innocent young girl.
 And at the cruel way my dad and the others had died.
I ran about the mansion swinging my hat‐stand spear, yelling "Come out here, you bastard".
......But there was absolutely no sign of anyone else.
......Thinking that they might be hiding somewhere and scheming to attack me from behind, I went around searching for possible hiding places,
 sometimes being cautious,
 sometimes intentionally letting my guard down, trying all kinds of things, but in the end, not so much as a kitten appeared...
Then, morning came.
......My tension and fatigue, mixed together with my drowsiness, made for the worst kind of dawn.
Humans are pretty incredible.
......Even though I didn\'t know where the hell the murderer was hiding, I was prioritizing drowsiness and fatigue over worrying for my own life.
......By this time, I was starting to feel pretty ridiculous.
I had walked around the mansion for a full six hours until dawn broke, yelling at them to show themselves.
I had done a painstaking search, tired myself out, and even let my guard down.
{n}{i:Still} no one was coming to attack me.
And so at that point I just said screw it, do whatever you want.........
The boat wouldn\'t come until the typhoon passed.
 They were saying on TV that it wouldn\'t pass until tomorrow, so I had a whole day to waste.
The idea of just lazing about didn\'t seem very appealing,
 ......so, even though I knew it would probably make the police mad, I decided to play detective a bit.
First: the dining hall, where the very first murders occurred.
The six who were killed in the beginning really were pitiful to look at.
......The weapon was probably a gun.
 Maybe their heads were split by something powerful, like a magnum bullet or a shotgun.
That seemed like valid reasoning.
In comparison, Maria, who was the seventh body, had died in a far better and cleaner way.
At a glance, there were no external wounds, and it wasn\'t clear how she had been killed.
But there were signs that bubbles had been foaming from her mouth,
 and it looked like a typical death by poisoning that you might see on a TV drama.
Wasn\'t Maria called out to the chapel and given her test there...?
......Then why is she here in the corpse‐filled dining hall, lying next to her mother, dead......?
Assuming that the cause of death was poison, ......who gave it to her?
Her clothes aren\'t disturbed at all.
 It\'s hard to imagine that she was forcibly pushed down and given an injection of poison.
.........It\'s probably better to assume that she was given a poison capsule or something and made to swallow it.
That said, compared to the violently mutilated corpses scattered about this room, Maria\'s corpse was far too clean.
With a gun, all you need to do is pull the trigger.
 But poison, whether injected or made to be swallowed, would take a lot more effort.
Bearing in mind the culprit\'s brutal nature, too, I felt that Maria\'s death alone had clearly been given special treatment.
Why was Maria alone given a sleep‐like death?
.........She {i:was} killed, so in that sense, I still felt very sorry for her—there can be no doubt about that—
but for some reason, the manner of Maria\'s murder in particular seemed very courteous to me......
Maria had her hands joined on her chest, in the way that the dead often do.
......Did Maria do that herself before dying......?
{n}......Isn\'t this usually something done by someone else after the person dies......?
Maria was resting in peace, as though sleeping together with her mother, whose head was half crushed.
......For some reason, the contrast really bugged me.
There are probably a lot of mysteries surrounding Maria\'s death, starting with the cause...
And more than anything else.
The biggest mystery of this dining hall......was the "pitfalls".
{n}......The "pitfalls" that both Uncle Krauss\'s group and Gohda‐san\'s had mentioned.
After the six had been killed, five more had fallen through "pitfalls" and been captured.
.........What are pitfalls?
{n}Those things that suddenly open and you fall through them, right......?
The floor was firmly laid with a majestic, if a bit worn‐out, carpet.
......It was clearly a single piece.
If pitfalls are meant to open up in it, there would have to be a seam in that one place.
......And anyway, if there was some trick like a pitfall, wouldn\'t it creak when you walked on it??
No matter how much I walked over or ran my hands over the carpet, I just couldn\'t imagine that a pitfall was hidden here.
In the first place, it would be one thing if a single person had fallen, but it was a full five people.
......From what I could piece together from all of their stories, each one of them had fallen from a different location,
 so at the very least, there had to be five separate places concealing pitfalls.
...............So what does this mean?
Was this room actually made with pitfalls across the entire floor,
 so that with a single button press, you could open up a pitfall in the location of your choice......some kind of contraption like that??
That kind of ridiculous mechanism would be surprising even in a ninja mansion.
......But even so, if Dad and the rest heard about this,
 maybe they\'d say "I wouldn\'t put it past Grandfather—you bet he\'d do this, he\'d make this".
......In any event, I didn\'t learn anything more than that from the dining hall.
Do the pitfalls not exist?
 Or do they exist, but I just can\'t find them, amateur that I am?
I can\'t say for sure.
Since they claimed that the pitfalls were there,
 ......I can\'t ignore the pitfalls even if I can\'t find them......
The next ones to be killed had been Jessica and George‐aniki.
{n}I\'d already discovered George‐aniki, when I was called out for my test.
He was called out to the arbor in the rose garden, ......and shot in the forehead, probably with a gun.
As for Jessica, she was called to her own room on the second floor of the mansion.
I found the door to her room locked.
{n}But that wasn\'t a problem at all since I had the master keys.
And the inside of the room.........was horrible.
...But the corpse was nothing I hadn\'t already familiarized myself with in the dining hall, ......so I\'d built up a bit of an immunity.
The phone receiver was dangling off the hook.
{n}......Was she killed while on the phone with me?
Jessica was leaning against the wall right next to it,
 ......with half of her head splattered out.
As far as I could tell by looking at the scene, ......it looked as though she had been killed while on the phone.
In that case, had the culprit been there before her eyes?
.........I hadn\'t gotten that impression from Jessica\'s voice over the phone.
I\'m pretty sure Jessica said......“They got me”.
It\'s probably best to assume that she had already received a fatal wound at the time of the phone call.
That\'s right, and she also said this.
"By the time you get here, I\'ll be a corpse with half my head spilled out."
Yes, she definitely said that.
.........From what I could tell by looking at Jessica\'s corpse, there were no wounds on her other than the damage to her head.
Then...she was injured seriously enough that she steeled herself for death, and then died halfway through the phone call?
But it feels like, with the way she was talking on the phone, she was out of danger for the time being.
You shouldn\'t be able to have a casual conversation over the phone if the killer is right in front of you.
So...did the culprit come partway through the phone call and kill her......?
.........No, that can\'t be right.
{n}After all, this room was locked.
......No, like hell that counts for anything.
......If the culprit had stolen a master key from one of the victims, the fact that it was locked is meaningless.
But there are no external wounds other than her head.
.........In which case, should I assume the fatal wound she was prepared to die from and the actual wound that destroyed her head were two different events,
 both of them made to the same part of the body......?
In other words, Jessica was struck severely to the head, and received an incredibly bad wound.
Then she called me, ......and either lost consciousness or died while on the phone.
Then the culprit came and destroyed her head for real...or something.
After being called to this room, Jessica was attacked by the culprit and seriously injured.
And the culprit thought they\'d killed her, and went away for the time being.
......But then Jessica miraculously started breathing again, and called me with a literal dying message.
Then the culprit realized that they had failed in killing her, and rushed back to deliver the final blow to Jessica, who had lost consciousness from massive blood loss......
...............That seems to make sense, more or less.
Except for how Jessica was able to accurately predict the form of that final blow.
And there was one more thing that bugged me about the phone call from Jessica.
Jessica said this...
"George nii‐san didn\'t make it either.
 Instant death, that was."
......She said it almost as though she had witnessed George‐aniki being killed.
But while you certainly could see the rose garden from the window in Jessica\'s room,
 the arbor that George‐aniki had been called out to was very far away—you could only just make out the roof.
Add on the fact that it was the night of a typhoon, and it\'s very hard to imagine that she was able to witness everything that happened by the arbor from this window.
......And most important of all.
Jessica left before George‐aniki.
{n}So she shouldn\'t have known that George‐aniki\'s test had taken place by the arbor.
How did Jessica know......that George‐aniki had been killed......?
.........Then, in the course of my search of the entire mansion, I found Kyrie‐san\'s corpse as well.
She was in an old guest room tucked away on the first floor.
 This was where all of us relatives used to stay before the guesthouse was built.
......The situation with Kyrie‐san was just like Jessica\'s.
She was probably killed during her phone call with me.
 The receiver was hanging untidily, ......and Kyrie‐san was collapsed beside it.
But the way she had been killed was very different from Jessica.
Her head wasn\'t smashed.
 ......Instead, something like a stake with an occult‐like design was buried into her forehead.
......It was too gruesome for me, ......so I pulled it out.
It was only after pulling it that I realized that this might get me into trouble with the police later.
So, even though it was probably a little late now, I laid it by Kyrie‐san\'s side.
Its tip was sharp, and stained with enough blood that it must have penetrated fully to the brain.
I didn\'t know what kind of metal it was made of, but it was about as heavy as a paperweight.
{n}Certainly, if you were stabbed all‐out with something like this, it might cause a terrible wound.
.........I...probably understood what this stake meant.
......Yeah, I know this.
{n}It\'s the method of killing from the fourth twilight onwards in the witch\'s epitaph.
{n}......That "gouge with a stake and kill" thing, probably.
However, the human skull is very hard.
 .........Even with all one\'s strength, could you really pierce through it this sharply......?
No.
 ......The way I reason it, this stake wasn\'t the cause of death; it was just used to damage the corpse after death.
She was probably killed by being shot with a gun or something, like George‐aniki,
 .........and the stake was stuck into the hole left by the gun.
......Thinking about it that way, everything works out.
But......was Kyrie‐san really killed with a gun?
She had said this on the phone as well—Kyrie‐san was under attack even though she was holed up inside a locked room.
And this room actually {i:was} locked.
......And...
...she had said something about a golden thread‐like thing flying in through the keyhole and attacking her.
And in fact, there {i:were} four places around Kyrie‐san\'s corpse with holes that could have been caused by some kind of attack.
.........But still...
 ...A golden thread...
......attacked her through the keyhole...?
I looked at the door from Kyrie‐san\'s perspective.
If it had been one of those old locks like you see in old mystery movies,
 where you can peek through to the other side, then you could understand that something might potentially have come through it.
But even though the doors in this mansion were old‐fashioned, the locks were the familiar, average cylinder style that you could find in any normal house.
......In other words, there {i:was} no hole going all the way through, by construction.
So no matter how thin an object it might have been,
 it\'s impossible to imagine that it could have penetrated through the keyhole from the outside and attacked her.
.........Cylinder lock.
 .........Keyhole.........?
But Kyrie‐san had definitely said that something like a golden thread had flown in through the keyhole,
 ......and spun around and around, aiming for her, attacking her......
"A golden thread attacking through the keyhole".
 .........I couldn\'t understand what it meant at all.
Wait, actually.
 ......Kyrie‐san predicted that I probably wouldn\'t be able to understand all this.
And not just Kyrie‐san.
 Jessica said it over the phone too.
......No, since the very beginning, from the time we talked with Gohda‐san and Kumasawa‐san, and got the phone call from Uncle Krauss\'s group,
 everyone has been saying the same, consistent thing.
.........Grandfather is summoning witches and demons, and killing people with magic.
We witnessed it happening with our very own eyes.
{n}No tricks, no illusions.
{n}No choice but to believe it.
......They all said it, with one voice.
When that mysterious woman calling herself {f:5:Beatrice} appeared,
 even I pretty much believed that she was a real witch and might start summoning goat monsters right and left.
......However, after being left alone for a whole day, once my feeling of tension faded completely,
 I had a level enough head to think that this was way too stupid to possibly be true.
In that extraordinary situation where their lives were exposed to danger,
 did they just lose their heads a little, and mistakenly think that a witch was attacking them with magic?
............But multiple people testified to the same effect, and on top of that, none of their opinions contradicted one another.
......If it had been a single person\'s statement, I\'d be able to suspect that they just didn\'t see what they thought they saw,
 ......but doing that now is pretty...difficult......
Then, right next to the back door, I found Uncle Krauss with his head half destroyed.
......Even though he\'d escaped the dungeon of Kuwadorian,
 and somehow made it out of the secret underground passage and all the way here, ......he was killed.
Buried into the gruesome cross‐section of his half‐destroyed head...
...was a stake with an occult design, just like the one that was driven into Kyrie‐san\'s forehead.
And in this situation, it was very hard to imagine that this stake was the murder weapon.
......He was killed with a powerful gun like the six in the dining hall,
 and after death, he was stuck with a stake, like Kyrie‐san.
I wonder if the golden threads that Kyrie‐san spoke of attacked Uncle Krauss too.
Does there exist some kind of tool, like an endoscope, which is very thin but can be moved about at will.........?
And that can also attack people......?
{n}No way. I\'ve never even heard of anything like that.
But even so, ......if I voiced that suspicion to one of my relatives,
 perhaps they {i:would} say "I wouldn\'t put it past Grandfather to make one"...
Since I can\'t refute the existence of a golden thread X that can be moved at will and attack people,
 my only options are either to accept this completely incomprehensible weapon, or else,
 ......to accept that these murders were committed with magic.
To find the next corpse, I had to go out through the back door and search around outside a bit.
Behind the mansion, in the wild‐grown bushes that were almost swallowed up by the forest, there was something like an old well,
 ......and right next to it were the corpses of Doctor Nanjo and Shannon‐chan.
Both corpses had their heads smashed.
......And there was a stake lying right next to each of their destroyed heads, though they weren\'t stuck in.
......All of the corpses were atrocious, but having to look directly at Shannon‐chan\'s lovely face, half of which was blown off, was very painful......
Then, there was the well.
Inside which, I was told, was a secret underground passage to the mysterious mansion, Kuwadorian.
...By this time, I was beginning to think that {f:5:Beatrice} and her accomplices...
might have used this underground passage to leave for Kuwadorian.
There were supposedly ten or more of these guys, and I hadn\'t seen hide nor hair of any of them.
......It made a hell of a lot of sense to think they\'d already escaped somewhere else.
They had this typhoon to contend with.
 They couldn\'t go out to sea.
Same for the forest.
 There was no way they could traverse such a deep, uncultivated forest on foot.
In that case, there was only one place for them to go.
The mysterious hidden mansion, Kuwadorian.
{n}......The secret underground passage at the bottom of the well...!
......By this time, I had entirely lost my fear of being killed if I happened to come across the enemy.
Screwing with me like this...!
{n}This time I\'ll march into your mansion...!
".........Ah...... ...Wh‐what the hell...?!
 D‐......damn it...!!"
The old well had a firm cover on it.
The cover was an iron grill.
The gaps between the bars were perhaps twenty centimeters square.
 You could peer inside, but it really wasn\'t something a human could pass through.
If I hadn\'t known better, I wouldn\'t have thought it to be anything more than a simple cover to protect against falling in.
......But from what Kyrie‐san had told me, I knew that it had been made to prevent intruders from entering the secret underground passage at the bottom...!
But the cover was fixed in place extremely firmly, and no matter how much I pushed or pulled, I couldn\'t even get close to removing it.
I couldn\'t find any obvious lock.
 Maybe it was sealed by some mechanism.
But no matter how much I investigated it, I couldn\'t find anything to release it.
.........The underground passage in this well is the biggest piece of information I have, that Kyrie‐san gambled her last moments trying to tell me about...!
"Don\'t think you can stop me with something like this cover...!
 I\'ll smash it to bits...!
 I\'ll search for a tool...!"
I had an idea of where to get one.
 ......Because I\'d seen the various tools in the gardening shed when we locked Gohda‐san and Kumasawa‐san in there.
But the shutter to the gardening shed was locked.
{n}On top of that, the key was with Gohda‐san, who was inside, dead.
......In other words, this gardening storehouse was a locked room.
{n}There was no way to open it from the outside.
In that case, I would have to break the shutter.
{n}I wonder if there\'s a tool for that somewhere...
......It kind of felt like I was going in circles.
Then, while searching for that, I learned that the source of the stench that had been permeating the mansion this whole time was the underground boiler room.
The boiler room was dimly lit, humid, had a terrible stench, and on top of all that, was incredibly creepy.
But there were several large tools there, and I was able to find a fire hatchet and a massive bolt cutter.
And............Grandfather\'s corpse too.
No, strictly speaking, I should probably say that I found the burnt corpse of a person who was probably Grandfather.
Someone\'s corpse had been stuffed into the blazing fires of the boiler......
However, by coincidence, I was able to notice the number of toes on the corpse.
......Both feet had six toes.
......Yeah, actually, I might have heard that from Dad at some point, long ago.
Something about Grandfather having polydactyly, with extra toes.
It was apparently an old Ushiromiya tradition for people with extra fingers or toes to be treated as a good omen, saying they had good fortune or something.
......And that\'s why Grandfather was selected to be the next head...or something along those lines.........
But I wonder if I can be certain this is Grandfather\'s body just from the number of toes.
After all, Grandfather was supposed to be the leader of the group of culprits.
I don\'t have a clue why he\'d be dead and stuffed in a boiler in a place like this.
A mysterious corpse, burning and belching out a terrible stench amid the flames.
......If it really was Grandfather,
 ............did that mean that the leader of the group of culprits wasn\'t Grandfather, but that {f:5:Beatrice} after all......?
Grandfather was used because he was convenient, and was then thrown away at the end?
.........Unfortunately, it didn\'t look like I\'d be given a chance to hear Grandfather\'s explanation...
Now that I had obtained a tool, I thought about immediately taking on the cover to the well,
 but I decided to break the shutter to the gardening shed first.
......I had plenty of time to kill anyway.
 I thought I should check on the condition of Gohda‐san and Kumasawa‐san\'s corpses.
I hit the shutter with the hatchet, breaking into it,
 stuck the bolt cutter into the crack,
 and scissored it around, opening up a hole.
Then, I came face to face with Gohda‐san and Kumasawa‐san\'s corpses once more......
As a result, I learned some new facts.
First, they did not die by being hanged.
{n}Their feet were solidly on the floor.
......And both of their foreheads showed signs that they had been shot with a gun.
When I thought about what a normal noose was like, the ropes seemed considerably on the long side.
On top of that, the length was different on each to match the height of each person.
In other words, the lengths had been adjusted so that both Gohda‐san, who was tall, and Kumasawa‐san, who was short,
 had their feet solidly but barely on the ground.
Also, while the ropes carried both of their weights as their heads lolled, both of them had some slack below their knees.
This meant that if they stood upright with these nooses around their necks, there would be some extra length.
In other words, these ropes were a bit unsuitable to hang someone with.
The direct cause of death was probably the shot to the head.
It was gruesome.
 Their insides were still dripping out from those deep holes, staining their faces a deep red.
Then they were hung up by their necks and left on display—that probably makes the most sense.
......If they were shot with a gun, they would probably have been lying down on the floor.
......If that had been the case, you wouldn\'t have been able to tell they were dead by peeking through the window.
The mountain of stuff would have gotten in the way, so if they had been lying down, they would have been hidden.
To make the deaths of these two known to the rest of us who couldn\'t get inside,
 they had to hang them like this so we could tell from the outside.
.........Was this......to get back at us for thinking that the two of them would surely be safe if we left the key with them......?
I wonder where the shutter key we gave Gohda‐san, which should have ensured their safety, is now...
That key.........was in his trouser pocket.
{n}The gardening shed key had been kindly left there, and even the tag was still attached.
In other words, the gardening storehouse was a locked room after all.
And that gave rise to another question.
{n}......Because this hanging was inexplicable.
If they didn\'t commit suicide, then the nooses were set up by the culprit.
......It might have been possible to shoot them through the window, but I really can\'t imagine that someone could have tied two ropes to the beam from the outside.
And on top of that, they would have had to lift up the heavy corpses—there\'s just no way.
 In other words, to do all of this, they would have had to go inside.
But the key was in Gohda‐san\'s pocket, and the shutter was still locked.
In other words, the gardening storehouse was a locked room.
Gohda‐san had said that there was only one key for this shutter.
......But is it possible that there was a copy,
 ......and that the culprit was in possession of it......?
If we\'re allowed to theorize that there were actually multiple gardening storehouse keys, and that Gohda‐san just didn\'t know about them,
 then this isn\'t even close to a locked room.
.........But why is it that, despite the fact that almost all of the other corpses were shot to death and left almost completely alone,
 these two corpses alone were intentionally hoisted up?
I couldn\'t help but feel something a bit odd about that......
Assuming that the mystery corpse in the boiler was Grandfather,
 ......the deaths of 16 people had now been confirmed.
There were 18 people on this island.
 There\'s me, and 16 corpses.
Kanon‐kun\'s corpse was the only one I hadn\'t been able to confirm yet.
According to Kyrie‐san, he was killed while climbing out of the well, and fell down into it.
So with the well closed up like this, it was impossible to check.
I tried shining a flashlight through the bars, down into the darkness in the depths of the well.
But it seemed that the jet‐black darkness had no intention of showing me its innermost depths with this inadequate light...
It looked like I\'d have to break the bars after all.
Using the hatchets and things I\'d dragged out of the boiler room and the gardening shed, I tried breaking the cover of the well.
But the metal bars were extraordinarily sturdy, and breaking them wasn\'t easy.
......I hit them with the hatchet over and over, until my hands started feeling weird, and eventually gave up on breaking them......
......It was impossible.
 If they were at least wood, I might have been able to break them.
{n}But this metal...
Yeah, there\'s no way you can slice through metal bars like butter with a human\'s strength.
......I can\'t even begin to understand......that story about how Kanon‐kun cut through the metal bars.
She told me that a light like a red laser beam grew out of his arm,
 and he used it to slice through the metal bars like a knife through butter.
Cutting through metal bars like butter...?
......And what\'s with the red laser beam.
{n}Does that mean he snuck in a burner or something,
 and used that to burn through the bars......?
Still, just what kind of laser.........could cut through metal bars like {i:butter}?
...It sounds exactly like the kinds of laser beams that showed up in those robot anime I loved as a kid.
Does stuff like that actually exist......?
{n}And how did Kanon‐kun get that laser beam......?
As much as I want to ask him, he\'s already been killed.
{n}Plus, even his corpse is now at the bottom of the well, beyond this cover.
If Kanon‐kun managed to slice through those metal bars, I\'m sure he could handle this metal cover in a single swing.
......It kind of feels like the locked room just now, with Gohda‐san locked inside the gardening storehouse holding the key.
Only one person can open the door, but they\'re locked inside......
......If only I had that power of Kanon‐kun\'s, I could do something about this cover myself......
 .................................
Just who is Kanon‐kun?
 He couldn\'t really be......an inhuman being capable of using a strange power, right?
Even Kyrie‐san told me to believe in witches, and I\'ve also met an insane woman calling herself one.
...Could Kanon‐kun possibly be...
...a human on the witch side...?
{n}......Or else...
......the culprit?
............What the heck.
{n}......Am I gonna start treating him like the culprit...just because I can\'t find his corpse?
Hoh, ......treating him like the culprit simply because there is no corpse...?
And who was the one babbling about the suspicious being innocent......?
.........Very well, I couldn\'t bear having you push all the crimes on Kanon and making that into a human culprit theory.
 I will guarantee it with the red...
{p:1:Kanon is dead}.
{p:1:Among the five in Kyrie\'s group, he was the first to die}.
{p:1:In short, he was the ninth victim}.
"......Since there\'s no corpse, ......I can\'t say for sure...
that Kanon‐kun is dead."
So, my whispering in red does not reach the piece you.......
{n}.........But it did reach {i:you}, right.........?
At a glance, this appeared to be a mass murder committed using something strange that could only be thought of as magic.
......Golden threads that attacked through keyholes.
 No, we even had testimony that something gold had flown around the dining hall during the first six murders.
The two might have been the same weapon.
Then there was the locked‐room murder of the garden shed, and the laser beam that could cut metal bars.
......And that wasn\'t all.
There was much, much more...like the group of goat monsters,
 the talk of a witch who could create pitfalls just by snapping her fingers, the rabbit‐like demons who had fired golden threads...
I think there were more, .........and each and every one of them was ridiculous.
I couldn\'t possibly accept it, and was forced to suspect that there was some kind of trick or mistake.
......But why in the world had everyone spoken with one voice, saying the same thing without contradictions in their testimony...?
It\'s not only the magic.
Maria\'s mysterious death.
Jessica somehow knowing that George‐aniki had been killed.
The mysterious burnt corpse which I couldn\'t confirm actually belonged to my piece‐of‐shit grandfather.
......And more, and more.
All stuff I just don\'t get......!
I tilted the bottle and glugged it down noisily.
{n}......I didn\'t have a clue what was going on.
After dinner last night, we kids were shooed out of the mansion and told to go back to the guesthouse,
 .........and then there was a massacre in the dining hall.
Kyrie‐san and the rest were dropped through pitfalls and captured.
Then Jessica and George‐aniki were called out to a test or whatever and killed.
Kyrie‐san\'s group managed to escape the dungeon somehow, but all of them were killed in the end.
And at the very, very end, even Maria was killed, leaving me all alone.
.........In short, I had done nothing except be locked up in the guesthouse.
During that time, a huge incident had occurred, and ended, before I knew it.
What could I call it except incomprehensible?
{n}I don\'t have a clue anymore!
"Now I\'m nothing but a pig.
 You plan on leaving only me alive...?
 Hurry up and show yourself and come kill me already.
 I can\'t be bothered to look for you anymore."
"You show me your true form yourself......!
 I won\'t run or hide, so come at me with arrows or bullets or whatever...!"
I haven\'t had any sleep since yesterday, and I\'m tired as all get‐out.
{n}You wanna kill me, be my guest.
I decided to return to the guesthouse and boldly rest on the bed.
......As I exited the kitchen and passed through the lobby,
 .........that portrait of the witch came into view.
The big clock did too.
{n}......At that very moment, it was exactly midnight.
And the sound of the bell, proclaiming that it was midnight, rang out......
As I listened, ......I looked up at {f:5:Beatrice}\'s portrait.
Exactly twenty‐four hours ago, I met you.
What were you trying to say to me...?
{n}And where did you go?
Just who in the world are you.........?
{n}Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}.
I haven\'t solved a single one of the riddles surrounding you......!
Show yourself...
{n}.........And fight with me...!!
Then......the witch showed herself.
 Like a guest of honor finally appearing, she showed herself on the landing at the top of the big staircase......
"So you finally show yourself......
 ......I\'ve been kept bored for an entire day."
"...............Yes.
 I gave you a whole day.
 Were you able to sufficiently exercise the rights of the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} side?"
"Yeah.
 I was bored, so.
 I had a good go at it."
"............Ange...was a good piece."
"Don\'t you......speak Ange\'s name."
".........She appeared through a miracle, and sacrificed herself to give you the tenacity for certain victory."
"Don\'t you...speak Ange\'s name."
"............That brutal death was something that you needed.
 If you hadn\'t seen that death, you would not have grown serious.
 Without the wake‐up call of Ange\'s ill‐fated future, the tenacity for victory would not have arisen within you."
"I told you not to speak Ange\'s name...!!"
"............In short, she was a necessary sacrifice.
 Otherwise, an anger great enough to kill me would not have been born within you.
 The rivalry between us cannot be destroyed."
"Curse that Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}—this was no piece, it would be more fitting to call it a trump card.
 ......No matter how helpful a piece is, it will never stray from the board.
 But a trump card, no matter how powerful its effect, is always discarded after it is used."
"Ange was truly a good trump card for you."
"Don\'t you...speak Ange\'s naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaame!!!"
At Battler\'s outburst of rage, Beato finally stopped talking.
"......You know, I have no more time to spend playing around in a place like this.
 ......Even our draws are keeping Ange waiting."
"............I am going to break through you,
 ......take my family,
 ......and go back home!!
 I don\'t have a single second to waste playing witches with you!!"
"In that case, I assume you know.
 What must be done."
"Yeah!
 I\'ll beat you down!!
 I\'ll blast away all witches, magic, illusions, and delusions!!"
"Alright, let\'s do this!!!
 I won\'t ever let you trick me again!!
 The game\'s restarting, you ready?!
 I\'ll tear apart the witch\'s veil that conceals the outright lie you are!!!"
"You talk too much.
 All you have to do is simply say "I will kill you"."
"Yeah.
 If those are the words you want, ......I\'ll say them for you.
 This is the first and last wish of yours that I\'ll lend an ear to."
"............I thank you."
"I will.................."
"..........................."
“I will kill you......!!!”
"Then by all means!!
 Let us begin, Battler...!!
 Come, it is time for the witch hunt...!!
 Try and chase me, try and corner me, try and kill me! I\'m expecting a lot from you!!
 Try and show me what your little sister gave you in her last moments...!!"
"Bring it oooooooooooooooooooooonnn!!!"
......Battler\'s cry burned the world with a white light.
And when one\'s eyes were opened to that brilliant light, ......the two of them could be seen in a rose garden......
".........Who takes the first move?"
"Me."
"How brave."
The rose garden, where beautiful rose petals danced.
{n}The color of those rose petals...was red.
Was that a proof, or simply a claim, that the two of them facing each other in this beautiful rose garden...
was the red and only truth?
.........That must be why...the roses are red.
But in the language of flowers, roses are passion.
{n}......Not truth.
The flower for truth is a forget‐me‐not.
{n}That flower......is blue.
"I\'ll pierce through everything with my blue truth.
 .........From the very beginning of it all.
 I\'ll start from the very first game!"
"Very well.
 Show me your skill.
 ...Come."
"Here I go.........
 I\'ve already proclaimed it, but I\'ll say it again.
 ......This isn\'t just for the murder of Doctor Nanjo in the last game.
 This will tear apart every scene from every game since the beginning...!!"
"{p:2:Ushiromiya Kinzo is already dead}!
 {p:2:Therefore, the true number of people on the island is 17}!
 {p:2:By adding an unknown person X to that, it becomes 18 people}.
 {p:2:By supposing that this person X exists, the crime is possible even if all 17 people have alibis}."
"{p:2:By this, even though the number of people reaches 18, it is still possible for culprit X to exist and carry out the crime even if all 18 people seem to have alibis}!!"
You can break through all of the murders in Episode 1 by supposing an unknown person X.
Furthermore, it is even possible to explain the mystery of Kinzo\'s evaporation from the locked room sealed by the receipt,
 by making the bold assumption that Kinzo wasn\'t there from the beginning.
Unless Beato countered this with the red truth,
 the witch illusions of Episode 1 would be completely smashed.
.........The blue truth was valid.
The wedge of blue truth that Battler had released stabbed right through the top of Beato\'s left foot.
......Was the red blood that poured out from there her defense in the red truth...?
Beato shut one of her eyes tight, enduring the unbearable pain from the wedge of blue truth that denied her.
"Hmm, not bad.
 ......But I am still far from denied, far from killed.
 ......That is not close to enough.
 .........The following games contain mysteries that cannot be explained with that alone, do they not?"
"......Which mysteries?"
"In the final stages of the second game,
 George, Gohda, and Shannon barricaded themselves in Natsuhi\'s room, and were killed.
 The key by which they unlocked Natsuhi\'s room was locked up inside the room, and all of the remaining keys that could unlock the door were in the hands of Rosa.
 Even if culprit X existed, it should be impossible to construct a locked room."
The blue wedge piercing Beato shook.
{n}She was resisting, fighting to push it out.
"No, that doesn\'t shake my blue truth.
 If culprit X was in possession of a master key, that\'s not even close to a locked room."
"No, it was impossible for the culprit to obtain one.
 {p:1:All of the master keys were under Rosa\'s control}!"
"But that\'s meaningless if Aunt Rosa was an accomplice to the culprit!
 {p:2:Aunt Rosa handed a key over to culprit X by some method, assisting in the locked‐room murder}!
 {p:2:And after that, she retrieved the key by a similar method}!"
"You\'ll have to do better than that, Beato!!
 I already put forward that theory at the time!"
"......*cackle*... So you did......"
"...Gwaaargh...!!!
 .........agh, ......nghh..."
The wedge that had been gradually losing its brilliance, and seemed as though it was about to come out,
 regained its strong blue again thanks to Battler\'s additional blue truth, and dug into Beato again, eating into her foot.
Beato let out a moan of anguish at the pain of it.
".........guh, ......ohh......
 .........Not yet...
 This is still nothing......
 Not yet,
 .........not yeeeeeeeet!!"
"Continuing on to the third game.
 The six linked locked rooms, the murders of Auntie Rosa and Maria, the deaths of Dad and the others in the hall, and the murders of Uncle Krauss and Aunt Natsuhi...
all of them
 {p:2:can be explained if we suppose that Aunt Eva was the culprit}."
"This argument was already won back then.
 And even that final riddle you proposed through {f:5:Eva},
 {p:2:the murder of Doctor Nanjo, can be explained with an 18th unknown person X}.
 Now I\'ve broken through the entire third game!!! Can you counter that?!"
"Mgh, gh...!!
 ......O‐of course......!
 This much is......nothing to worry about......!"
"In that case, how do you explain George\'s disappearance from the guesthouse?
 I shall add to the red truth.
 {p:1:George did not go down the stairs of the guesthouse}.
 He flew out through the window!"
In the final stages of the third game, George suddenly vanished from the second floor of the guesthouse.
Eva, who had been on the first floor, claimed that no one had come downstairs,
 but if, as the blue truth claimed, she had carried Krauss and Natsuhi\'s corpses outside, there was the possibility that George could have secretly gone downstairs during that gap in time and escaped.
But by adding on to the red truth, Beato had disproven that.
To go outside without going down the staircase to the first floor, he would have had to leave by the window.
 But all of the windows were locked from the inside...!
"So what.
 It\'s just like you said.
 He flew out the window, right?
 Even if he did jump down, you couldn\'t tell by the grass, and it was raining so hard.
 Any light traces would have disappeared."
"I will repeat the red truth.
 {p:1:All windows and doors leading to the outside were locked from the inside}.
 {p:1:Furthermore, it is impossible to lock any of those from the outside}!
 George had no technique by which to lock them...!"
"I will repeat the blue truth.
 I said it myself at the time.
 {p:2:In that case, everything works out as long as someone locked the window after George‐aniki escaped through it}!
 Nothing difficult about it!!"
"Gwaaaaaaaahhaaaaah...!!
 Gguuuuhhh...... Is this not......enough to resist...... Is it not enough......?"
Beato couldn\'t remove the blue wedge that was buried into her foot.
{n}The fake witch was burned more and more by the strong blue......
"In all games up to the third, there is still nothing that shakes the blue truth.
 ......In that case, the only game that can prove you\'re a witch......is this game, the fourth game."
"......As I have not countered with the red truth, that is indeed the case.
 I will have to prove witches with only this game.
 .........Very well.
 Hold nothing back."
"There\'s nothing strange about the six murders in the dining hall.
 {p:2:The 18th person X went wild with a gun and killed everyone}.
 {p:2:Regarding the pitfalls, there is every chance that pitfalls truly were hidden there,
 and it\'s also possible to explain them with Kyrie‐san\'s theory hypothesizing the existence of a poison‐dart‐shooting device X which can knock a person out instantly}."
"{p:2:The murders of George‐aniki, Jessica, and those who escaped from the dungeon can also be explained with guns, just like the dining hall}.
 There\'s nothing strange about it!"
"But I know you, you\'ve got a counterattack, right?
 Bring it on!!"
"Your greatest sword, this 18th person X, is based on the theory that Kinzo was already dead.
 I knew that you would make that claim.
 That is why I took Kinzo out of his study."
"Everyone at the family conference welcomed that Kinzo, did they not?
 {p:1:All of those present at the family conference acknowledged the existence of Kinzo}!"
"Uh‐huh.
 But Grandfather\'s supposedly been seriously ill, confined to his bed, hovering on the verge of death for ages, right?
 Even if he was so worn out that he looked like a different person, maybe no one would have paid that any notice, what about that?"
"I\'ll come back at you with this.
 {p:2:That Grandfather was a different person, a body double}.
 {p:2:A different person who the relatives mistook for Grandfather}!"
"Then I\'ll respond with this.
 {p:1:No person would mistake Ushiromiya Kinzo by sight}.
 {p:1:No matter what the disguise, they would not mistake Ushiromiya Kinzo by sight}!"
"Then how about this.
 {p:2:By declaring with the red truth in the second game that the number of master keys was five, when in the first game the number was more than five,
 you changed the premises of the later games}."
"{p:2:In the same way, there is a possibility that Kinzo\'s life or death status was changed for the fourth game}."
"{p:2:Therefore, Kinzo\'s existence in the fourth game does not serve as proof that he existed in the previous games}...!
 {p:2:Therefore, even if we suppose that the six murders in the dining hall were carried out by Grandfather himself, it doesn\'t create any contradictions}!"
"Then I\'ll counter with this.
 {p:1:Kinzo\'s life or death status is the same at the start of each of the four games}.
 {p:1:The setup was not different for the fourth game alone}...!"
"Repetition requested.
 "Kinzo was alive at the start time of every game"!"
"Decline repetition.
 I won\'t answer, Battler.
 I will not respond with the red truth you desire...!"
"......Damn it......old man, you\'re standing in my way...!!
 Are you putting yourself on the line to protect {f:5:Beatrice}, your beloved witch?!"
My goddamn grandad wavered into vision.
......Heh, is he trying to be some kind of knight, blocking the way between me and Beato...?!
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*, Battler.
 Are you capable of surpassing me...?"
"I won\'t let you reach, I will not let you reach, ......not to heights of the Golden Witch, ohhhhhhh no!
 Fuhha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!
 Your shallow logic cannot even surpass me alone!
 Die!!!"
Kinzo\'s jet‐black cape spread as though it would swallow the world,
 becoming the snout of a vast black dragon, which came at me, trying to swallow me in one mouthful.
......As I faced the roaring of the black dragon, I calmed my breathing and closed my eyes lightly......
"I\'ll swallow you up in a single gulp!!
 Begone, you witless, inadequate foo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}ool!!!"
".........Shut your trap, you damn undying ghost."
"Hoh, so you call me a ghost.
 You intend to see it through to the end, then, this theory that I am already dead!!
 That will be your undoing!!
 On the first twilight of the fourth game, the darkness shall swallow you up!!"
The black dragon\'s vast mouth, its snout, its fangs...threatened to swallow Battler whole...!!!
In that instant, Battler suddenly opened his eyes!
"Thanks, {f:5:Beatrice}.
 Your third game was the foothold I needed for my counterattack."
"What...?"
"See ya, my old old bastard.
 This is goodbye.
 .........I lay out the following theory to demonstrate that I can apply the dead‐Kinzo hypothesis even to the fourth game!"
"So be it! Come at me with all you have, my descendant!!"
"Here I go, you sack of old bones!!
 {p:2:My theory is that Kinzo\'s name is passed on as the title of the Ushiromiya family head}!"
"{p:2:Ushiromiya Kinzo was already dead}.
 {p:2:And he passed {i:his name} on to someone else}!
 {p:2:Everyone acknowledged it}!!
 {p:2:And, therefore, ‘all of those present at the family conference acknowledged the existence of Kinzo’}!!"
"{p:2:There wasn\'t even any need for this person to disguise themselves as Grandfather}.
 {p:2:Because everyone recognized a new ‘Kinzo’}!
 {p:2:Therefore, they didn\'t actually ‘mistake Kinzo by sight’}!!
 {p:2:As long as the preceding theory is not disproven, nothing can change the fact that you\'re dead}!!!"
"This is the final blow.
 Old geezer, this repetition request is for you.
 "Not one person present had multiple, differing names"!!"
"I... I...can...not............!!
 Gah, gwoooooooooooooooooooragghgghghh!!"
"Rest in peace, you old grandbastard.
 You should thank me—you were finally able to die.
 This is your requiem, take it and drop dead!!"
"{p:2:Ushiromiya Kinzo was already dead}!
 {p:2:Yeah, poor old you—whenever we find your corpse, it\'s always completely burnt}.
 {p:2:That was a gimmick to prevent discovery of the fact that time had passed since your death}!!"
"{p:2:And you passed your name onto someone else}!!
 {p:2:With this theory, even though {i:you} are dead, {i:"Kinzo"} can still appear at the family conference}!!!"
"{p:2:How\'s that? This is checkmaaaaaaaaaaaate}!!"
Several dozen blue stakes bored into Kinzo\'s ghost.
 Their terrible destructive power would never permit the ghost to recover......!!
"......{f:5:Be......atr...ice}........."
".........Kinzo...
 Thank you for everything.
 ......Rest...in peace......
 I will not forget......the days I spent with you........."
Dispersing along with the shadow of the black dragon as golden flower petals scattered,
 ......Ushiromiya Kinzo became a gold‐colored cyclone and disappeared......
Even after death, you fought for the sake of the woman you loved.
{n}......Your love and madness were, without a doubt, the real thing......!
"...............ngh, ............Battler............"
"No hard feelings.
 ......Let the dead sleep.
 Don\'t wake them.
 ......You\'re next.
 And you\'ll be the last."
Beato still couldn\'t pull out the blue wedge that pierced her foot...
{n}Beato realized that she was on the verge of death...
"I\'ve gone along with you a whole bunch.
 I think I\'ve more than fulfilled any responsibility to play with you.
 ......But it\'s about time to finish things up.
 I\'ve got a lonely little sister waiting at home."
"......Me and my family are going home...!!"
"......Then kill me.
 ......Then try and kill me!
 ......I will not run or hide—at this point, even dodging is beyond my capabilities!!
 Come ooo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}oon, Ushiromiya Battleee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}eer!!!"
"You got it!!
 With the 18th person X from the dead‐Kinzo theory, everything remaining is pierced through!"
"{p:2:George‐aniki and Jessica\'s deaths in the fourth game can also be explained by culprit X}!!
 {p:2:And the five who escaped from the dungeon and were killed, and the two in the gardening shed, and Maria in the end}!
 {p:2:All of those can be explained with an 18th person X}!!
 {p:2:There\'s nothing strange at all}!!"
"This concludes the explanation of the culprit, with humans, for all games!!
 {f:5:Beatrice}, ......this here is...checkmaaaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aate!!"
"Uuhk......uaaaaAAAAaaaaAaAAaaaaaahhh......aah—hhk—"
Several blue stakes were driven into {f:5:Beatrice}, who could not dodge, skewering her......
Beato grabbed the stakes, trying to pull them out somehow...
.........Aaaaaaahhhh,
 ......he got meee......
 .........It huurts.........
...Yeah, this\'ll.........kill me.........
 ......If I don\'t pull these out,
 .........I\'ll die......
 I don\'t want pain......
 ......I don\'t want to...
......suff.....er.........
With both hands, ......Beato firmly grasped one of the blue stakes.
......Naturally, the power of the blue truth to deny witches burned her hands.
...Unable even to hide her tears at the pain, Beato howled and tried to pull the stakes out with all her might......
If I can\'t pull these out, .........I\'ll die.........
 ......This is.........the final counterattack...............
"Then Battler......
 ......All my numerous displays of magic, .........how do you explain those......?
 .........The very first time they appeared......was in the second game, when I fixed Maria\'s pumpkin marshmallow for her.
 At that time, Rosa definitely witnessed that magic."
Certainly, Rosa had witnessed gold butterflies gather and fix a marshmallow by the miracle of magic.
"......*cackle*cackle*...
 ......Rosa alone witnessing it isn\'t very credible, right...?
 That\'s why I increased the number of witnesses to the uppermost limit.
 ......Which is what......this last game was all about......"
"The summoning of my minions!
 And those brutal magical murders!
 All of them were witnessed by a great many people...!!
 That is itself......proof that my magic exists...!!
 How do you......explain that, Ushiromiya Battleee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}eerr.........!!!"
".........Stalemate."
"...............Wh‐......whaat......?"
"‘Magic exists because magic exists’.
 I believe the rules of our Braun tube trial say that that kind of argument doesn\'t work."
".........Ye‐......s, ...you\'re right.........
 ......Heh.........mmhk...ghhh..."
"No matter who—!!
 Or how many people—!!
 Witness magic—!
 That will never be proof of magic\'s existence!!"
"Whether all the magic you\'ve shown exists or not, I can ignore it all and explain things with {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s.
 That\'s my inviolable right.
 ......Am I wrong?"
At those words, the blue stakes let out an even brighter light, repelling my hands away.
......As I feared,
 .........I can\'t pull them out after all.........
 ............ggghh.........
As Battler is now, even if I cited each individual piece of magic and demanded an explanation for each, he would probably use any means available to him to deny all of them.
......Not just the marshmallow magic that I showed Rosa, ...but all of my magical miracles.
I can no longer even {i:claim} to be a witch without entering into debates about how something like a marshmallow was fixed...
I am in such an inferior position that I am forced to fight over trivialities like that......
It might be.........impossible for me.........
......I knew this...
This was a game without victory from the very beginning.
...So it was only natural that the day of my defeat would eventually come.
Have I fought Battler...
up until today...
......just in order to lose to him.........?
............I began these games...thinking I might be able to win.
Even if I wouldn\'t be able to win easily, I believed that in a game repeating endlessly, a miracle would eventually occur.
......After all, I had the absolute determination to win for certain.
......But now, I have completely lost that miracle.
And...absolute, certain determination resides in Battler, ......leaving {ruby:watashi:me} with no miracle for certain.
No, perhaps I should say with no {i:miracles or certainty}......
No victory, and no conclusion through a draw.
......The only resolution permitted is...
...defeat......and until it is given to me,
 .........all I can do in this game is continue on resisting......
That\'s right, I\'m...
......fighting.........only so that I can be killed by Battler.........
......I looked into Battler\'s eyes.
{n}It was not me inside them.
.........Reflected in those eyes were the figures of the little sister waiting for his return, ...and the family he had to bring back to her.
He no longer sees me......even as an individual.
...Of course he doesn\'t.
 From the very beginning, he has been fighting to deny the individual I am.
............Ahh, ...that last game...
 ...That was so much fun......
All it was was a little bit of a trick,
 ......but for even just a short period of time, it felt like we understood each other, ......and it was so much fun......
......That\'s right,
 ......I should have settled right there and then...
I should have continued for eternity with Battler totally fooled...
............But...
......that just wouldn\'t be any good, would it...
 .........That...
just wouldn\'t be true victory.........
"............Is this......checkmate?
 {f:5:Beatrice}."
Run through with several blue stakes, Beato was still in a standing position, skewered to the ground many times over.
Unable even to fall over because of this,
 .........and still looking up into the sky, ......she was sewn in place......
Her tragic form might have been a fitting end...
...for the cruel witch who had endlessly toyed with 18 people\'s lives, and who had killed constantly for hundreds and thousands of years.
Gently, ......as though someone was mourning for something, ...rain began to fall.
......Amid that rain, Beato was exposed to the elements, ......crucified......
"......Is it over, Beato?"
"...............There is...
......nothing I can say........."
"No way you\'re done.
 You aren\'t a woman who\'ll let things end with just this."
"........................
 ..........Don\'t be...
.......unreasonable......
 .........How can you look at me,
 .........and think that this isn\'t...
......over......?
 ......Hurry up and deliver the final blow........."
".........................................."
"...Just say it.
 ...With your...blue truth.
 ............‘Therefore,
 ......witches do not exist’...
......
 .........Just say it.........
 ......With that single blow,
 ......take my last...
............breath away........."
"That\'s no good."
"............Hoh......
 .........You ask me to......continue subjecting myself to.........humiliation...
 It is already settled......"
"Stand up.
 Our brawl still isn\'t over."
"..................‘Still’, ......you say........."
"What I see there isn\'t you losing.
 You\'ve just resigned, decided you\'ve had enough."
".........What\'s...wrong with that......
 ......Resigning...
 ......It still means your victory.
 .........You should...
...return to your little sister...
right away......
 Just abandon me,
 .........right here........."
"Didn\'t I tell you?
 I won\'t run away.
 And...
I won\'t let you get away either."
"................................."
"Who are you?
 And what in the world was your purpose?"
If you want to know, ......why don\'t you just try your favorite move......?
"...............What does it matter...
 ...Just...
......a fantasy,
 ......an illusion......
 Can\'t you...
...leave it at that......?"
"That\'s no goddamn good at all.
 I won\'t let you...
run away."
"......................................."
"I\'m going to defeat you.
 Like hell I\'m going to let you escape."
"................................."
"I won\'t let you run back into the darkness of illusions, leaving you all vague like this.
 .........I\'m going to break through you.
 Completely.
 So on your feet.
 Don\'t act all frail like that!
 You\'re still hiding several moves!
 I can tell!"
"...............Why......won\'t you just let me escape......?"
"Dad, Mom, and Ange.
 All of my cousins and all of my relatives.
 And all of the servants.
 All those times you killed them, all those times you toyed with their lives...!!
 I will never forget and I will never forgive your inhumanity!"
"I can still feel......Ange\'s arms on my shoulders...!!
 I will {i:not} forgive your inhumanity...!!
 So I won\'t let you get away like this...!!!"
Battler\'s eyes burned with the flames of hatred...
......The days when I could earn his passion by appearing frail are now a matter of the distant past.
......Having been tricked once, Battler will never sympathize with me again.
Never mind the wolves and sheep puzzle,
 .........this is like the boy who cried wolf, isn\'t it...............
............What am I supposed to do.........?
 .........What should I do............?
......I guess fighting endlessly just to avoid admitting defeat......is an endless torture fitting for the Endless Witch.
...............I guess endlessly harassing Battler to avoid giving him victory...is part of being the Endless Witch as well.........
...............It\'s so sad......
.........Is this really...
......the Endless Magic.........?
I\'ve...
......had enough.........
Of endlessly...
......being made into a witch\'s plaything...
 ............I\'ve...
...had enough......
No victory, and no conclusion with a draw.
......In that case, there is only one conclusion that can release me.
......Heh, ......hahahahahahaha......
Since the time I descended to the path of witches.
Since the day I made that contract with demons.
.........Was it not promised that tragedy would be my ultimate fate.........
"What\'s wrong!!
 Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}!!
 If you are the ruler of Rokkenjima, face your end with appropriate majestyyyyyy!!!"
Lightning.
......The world was smashed with white.
{n}.........Fitting last moments...for the ruler of Rokkenjima.
Haha, .........hahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha.........
"Hahhahahahahaha......wahha{0}hha{0}hha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha...!!!"
"..........................."
Still pierced by the blue stakes, ......Beato faced the rainy sky, and let out a laugh.
Then she slowly raised her face, ......and fixed her eyes on Battler.
".........Fool.
 ......I was considering handing you the victory in praise of your good fight...
 .........You shall regret your complacency......"
"Victory is not something for you to hand over.
 It\'s something I\'m gonna snatch from you!!
 And don\'t pretend you\'re any different!!"
"You couldn\'t accept victory being handed to you on a silver platter when I started saying stuff like "Maybe it\'s alright for witches to exist", and that\'s exactly why you intentionally fell apart like that in the end last time...!!!
 That\'s right, that one time last game, you showed mercy on me!!"
"So now I\'m making us even! Stand!!!
 My enemy, my Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}!!!"
"Hahhahaha......
 Idiot."
".........You idiooooooooooooot, hhahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!
 Ssssimpleton...!!
 Don\'t think you\'ll ever get another chance!!
 Uuuaaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aagh!!!"
When Beato yelled, the blue stakes that had been piercing her chest blew to bits and disappeared.
......However, the blue wedge that had pierced her foot in the very beginning did not disappear.
"You haven\'t pulled it out yet.
 You haven\'t pulled out the blue truth of the 18th person X...!!"
"I will respond to one of your repetition requests.
 As you reasoned,
 {p:1:Kinzo is already dead at the starting time for all games}!"
"However, in that case, all I need to do is take one person out!!
 {p:1:Thus far, I have been declaring that no more than 18 humans exist on this island}.
 {p:1:I will lower that by one for Kinzo}!!"
"{p:1:No more than 17 humans exist on this island}!!
 {p:1:That excludes any 18th person}.
 {p:1:In short, this 18th person X does not exist}!!
 {p:1:This applies to all games}!!!"
"I goddamn knew it.
 You still had some crazy stuff up your sleeve after all......
 This island only had 17 humans on it, but all this time, it\'s been made to look as if there were 18.
 And now that we\'ve taken one off and brought it down to 17, we\'ve finally reached the correct number."
"............Now the wedge I knocked into you has been removed.
 We\'ll have to start the fight over, back from square one...!"
The blue wedge that had sewn Beato in place broke apart.
{n}.........There was no longer anything piercing Beato.
The scars on her body had disappeared completely.
There, just as Battler had hoped for, ......stood the imposing figure of the Golden Witch who ruled Rokkenjima.
"......Now come, Battler.
 Once more from the beginning.
 Try to break through everything with the blue truth.
 I too will no longer play, run, or hide."
"If you prove to be good for nothing, then I shall decide this match right here and now.
 I will make you forever regret not settling for the victory I handed you!!!
 Come, starting from the first game!"
"Right!!
 From the first twilight of the first game!!
 {p:2:There is nothing strange about the murder of the six relatives that were found in the gardening shed in the beginning}!
 {p:2:The crime was possible for any of those who didn\'t have an alibi}!!"
"Valid.
 Continue—what about the next locked‐room murder, with Eva and Hideyoshi?!
 Even the chain was set for that locked room!
 I shall add to the red truth."
"{p:1:Both deaths were homicides}!
 {p:1:It is not the case that, after the construction of the locked room, one of them committed suicide after murdering the other}!
 {p:1:Furthermore, the murder was carried out with both the victim and the perpetrator in the same room}!
 {p:1:No method exists for the perpetrator to commit murder from outside the room}!"
"{p:2:Suppose that the culprit was a human without an alibi}.
 {p:2:In other words, the dead}!
 {p:2:Among the first six corpses, there were some made unidentifiable because their faces were smashed}."
"{p:2:One possible theory is that one was actually a fake corpse, and that some culprit X killed those two after pretending to be a victim and hiding away}!
 {p:2:Then, after the locked‐room murder was constructed, the culprit hid under the bed, and waited for all of us to leave}!!"
"Very well, next!
 Kanon, killed in the boiler room, correct?
 I shall add to the red truth.
 {p:1:All of the survivors have alibis}!
 {p:1:Let us include the dead as well}!!
 {p:1:In short, no kind of human or dead person on the island could have killed Kanon}!"
"{p:2:If no one could kill him, then he might have been the one to kill}!!
 {p:2:Meaning Kanon‐kun might have killed himself}."
"Repetition requested!
 "Kanon‐kun did not commit suicide"!"
"{p:1:Kanon did not commit suicide}."
"One more."
"Repetition requested, "Kanon‐kun\'s death was a homicide"."
"I decline to repeat."
"That refusal still admits the possibility of a homicide, but you\'ve already declared in red that no one could have killed him.
 In other words, it wasn\'t a homicide.
 This is the same as the linked locked rooms from the third game."
"{p:2:Kanon‐kun died for a reason that was neither suicide nor homicide}.
 {p:2:Though the circumstances are unclear, he died from an accident}."
"{p:2:By the Devil\'s Proof, I refuse to explain what kind of blunder could have led to an accidental death where a stake was driven into his chest}!!"
"Hohoh, now that you have borrowed the power of the devil, you are without peer!
 It is valid!"
"In that case, what about the murders after that in the parlor, of Genji, Nanjo, and Kumasawa?!
 Naturally,
 {p:1:Maria, who was in the same room, did not kill them}!
 {p:1:And of course, their three deaths were homicides}!"
"{p:2:We can explain it with the one who carried out the murder being a culprit X who used an unidentifiable corpse to disappear}.
 {p:2:In the first place, their three faces were also pulverized}.
 {p:2:It\'s completely possible that one of them was a body‐double corpse}!"
"{p:1:I guarantee the identities of all unidentified corpses}.
 {p:1:Therefore, there were no body‐double tricks}!"
"{p:2:Then I can explain it with simultaneous murders}.
 {p:2:Each of the three had a gun, pointed it at another in a clockwise pattern, and they blew each others\' faces off at the same time}!
 {p:2:After that, Maria collected those guns and hid them}!!
 How about that?!!!"
"Wha‐......what a ridiculous argument!!!
 I, I like it...!!
 Then what about Natsuhi in the end?!"
"I shall add to the red truth!
 {p:1:Natsuhi\'s death was a homicide}!
 {p:1:There are no corpses of unknown identity, and all of the survivors have alibis}!"
"{p:2:You can explain it with an indirect murder by trap X}!
 {p:2:Something was done to Aunt Natsuhi\'s gun}.
 {p:2:You can explain it if that was a trap gun, built to send a bullet right into the forehead of anyone who tried to hold it up and shoot it}!!"
"{p:1:The bullet buried into Natsuhi\'s forehead was not fired from Natsuhi\'s gun}!"
"{p:2:There is the possibility that Aunt Natsuhi was lured out by that letter of unknown contents}!
 {p:2:And she was called out into the hall}.
 {p:2:Then, she was forced into standing at a specified location at a specified time, and murdered by some trap X, which used a gun that had been installed there beforehand}!!"
"Splendid!!
 Your absurd arguments even feel pleasurable to me now!
 I shall surrender the first game to you out of respect...!!
 I am impressed!!"
"............Gaahaagh!!!"
The instant Beato admitted defeat in the first game,
 the stakes of blue truth once again pierced her chest, letting out a terrible sound...
"......g......g\'g\'h............gaaaaghaahhh!!!
 This much won\'t...stop me...... It\'s not over yet!!
 Come, the second game!!"
Beato just barely pulled the stakes that had pierced her chest out,
 ......but even though there was no hole left behind, it seemed to be a deep wound which let out a massive amount of blood.
And an intense pain of equal measure tormented her...
But Beato grinned, grinding her teeth, and pushed for the next game to start.
But I won\'t feel any sympathy.
......Just by her existing there, we will be killed and made to suffer over and over,
 .........and Ange will be burdened with a future of isolation...!!
"That is correct, just by my being here and laughing, the eternal hell will continue...!!
 I will not give you back to your sister...!
 She can spend a thousand years crying over the family that is never to return...!!"
"Bastaaaaaard!!
 No pity, no mercy! Here goes the second game!!
 I\'ll start with the first crime!"
"I already saw through the locked‐room murder where the six were killed in the chapel at the time.
 {p:2:Someone secretly borrowed Maria\'s key, and secretly returned it to Maria\'s bag after the crime was over}!!"
"{p:1:From the time Maria received her key to the instant Rosa unsealed the envelope the next day, the key did not pass into anyone\'s hands}!!"
"{p:2:There is the possibility that the door to the chapel had an auto‐lock just like Gramps\'s study}.
 {p:2:In other words, it was unlocked before the crime, with a rock or something wedged in so that it couldn\'t close completely}.
 {p:2:Then they gave the key to Maria}.
 {p:2:Because the lock was automatic, it is possible to make a theory where the key wasn\'t needed}!"
"{p:1:No door with an auto‐lock exists other than Kinzo\'s study}!"
"{p:2:The victims locked the door from the inside}.
 {p:2:One of the six was the culprit, and this person killed the other five, then pretended to be dead}!!"
"{p:1:The six were all already dead by the time they were discovered}!
 {p:1:All of their deaths were homicides}!
 {p:1:All six were pure victims; they did not take part in a mutual murder}!
 {p:1:There were no simultaneous mutual murders}!!"
"{p:2:There existed humans with no alibi at the time, e.g. Kumasawa‐san}.
 {p:2:If we assume that such a person killed the six, and was hiding inside, then there are no problems}!"
"{p:1:There was no one hiding in that chapel}.
 {p:1:Therefore, your ‘killer hiding in the building’ locked‐room scenario does not hold}!"
"What\'s wrong, Ushiromiya Battleer, is that all?!
 It\'s not so easy once you get to the second game, riiiight?!"
A tremendous exchange of red and blue truth.
The stakes and wedges of blue truth that I sent flying darted at Beato one after the other, and one after another, Beato cut them down with her red truth, her red treasured sword, knocking them out of the air.
But the blood she had lost from the first game was probably awful.
 This intense exercise was putting her under even greater strain.
I could see her breath growing ragged.
That\'s why I can\'t hold back now!
{n}......I\'ll corner that witch!
And this time...I\'ll break through her!
"I\'m not done yet... Yeah, that\'s no good, that\'s no goddamn good at all!!
 My twisted logic isn\'t finished yet!!
 Then what about this!!"
"{p:2:The food they were given had small bombs in it, which exploded from inside their stomachs}.
 {p:2:In other words, the crime is possible through trap X}!
 {p:2:The details of a bomb that they could swallow without noticing and that could blow open their stomachs is a Devil\'s Proof}!
 {p:2:I refuse to explain}!!"
"Bfft...hahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha‐hahhaha‐hahha!!
 What the hell is thaaaaaat?!
 Small bommmmmmmbs?!
 Waa‐hahhahaha‐hah‐hah‐hah!!"
But Beato failed to knock down the blue wedge as it flew at an angle like a curveball.
It let out a loud {i:thunk}, and gouged itself deeply into her left shoulder.
However, despite being on the receiving end of it, it seemed she couldn\'t stop laughing at how much of a curveball it was.
......Yeah, no wonder, even I\'m amazed at how screwed up this reasoning is...!!
"Ha, laugh as much as you want!!
 Is there a problem with it?!!"
"None!!
 Your wild arguments are my pleasure!!!"
"And the next, the locked room with Jessica and Kanon?!"
"No problems there!
 {p:2:If the culprit was one of the servants, they could have used a master key}.
 {p:2:It\'s not even a locked room}!"
"After that, there was an attack in the servant room from a mystery person who seemed to be Kanon, and Nanjo and Kumasawa were killed, right?!
 I had already declared Kanon\'s death in red before that time.
 Then who was that Kanon?!"
"{p:2:If Kanon‐kun\'s death was declared with the red, there\'s no way he was alive}.
 {p:2:Therefore, there is a chance that it was someone else in a disguise that would make the group that was attacked mistake this person for Kanon‐kun}!"
"{p:1:They would never mistakenly think any other person was Kanon}!"
"{p:2:Then, just like the heredity of Kinzo\'s name, there is a possibility that Kanon\'s name was inherited by someone}.
 {p:2:You could suppose that Kanon‐kun was killed, a different person succeeded his name, and this person attacked them}!!"
A sound like a watermelon being squashed rang out, and a blue wedge was buried deep into Beato\'s left flank...
It looked like she felt that one—maybe it hit her in a bad spot.
After leaning over and moaning for a while,
 ......she laughed it off as though trying to make it seem like no big deal.
Yeah, I can tell.
 That must have hurt like a bitch...!!
"Hyahhaaaaaaaahhh!!
 Once again, you\'ve set up some {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} as the culprit as if it were nothing!!
 You truly are gabbing on about things you would never say on the game board in a million years!!"
"But it is valid!
 Your verbal assault tickles me!!
 ......Such pleasure.
 .........This is not pain, ......it is pleasuuuure!!"
When Beato howled, the wedge that had pierced her was blasted away.
{n}But the wound remained, and continued tormenting her with intense pain.
"You ready? I\'ll keep going.
 The blue truth given for the final murders in the second game, the three who died in Aunt Natsuhi\'s room, should still be valid even with the 18th person X denied!
 Do you have a counterargument for that in red?!
 If not, the second game is all mine too!"
"No, nothing!!
 It would be no fun at all to fight over such trivial matters!!
 You may have it, you may have the second game!!"
"Gwaaaaaaaaagghghh!!!!
 .........*gasp*, ......gwoo{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}oohhhh.........!!"
The instant she admitted defeat in the second game, this time two blue stakes gouged through Beato\'s chest...!
The witch\'s lungs were gouged, and her intestines.
{n}The witch\'s face twisted in anguish.
{n}Her body twisted as she gasped in pain.
"Does it hurt......?"
"Huuuuurt?
 ......No, no, this just tickles.
 Uhhya{0}hhya{0}hya{0}hya{0}hhya{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhh!!"
"Compared to having your entire body torn to bits and turned into a pile of scrap meat, like your sister, that iiiiiiiiiiis?!
 I\'ll make you scrap meat too, then you two siblings can be all mixed together like ground beef and pork, aaakkya{0}kkya{0}kkya{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhh!!"
"U‐......uuurrraaaaaaaaaaaagggh!!
 I\'ll beat you to death, I\'ll tear you to bits the same way!!
 Next!
 The third game!!
 Come on, where\'s your energy?!!
 This is where I knock you down to hell!!"
"......Guh......gah......ooooaagghhh!!
 Naturally, as if I could let this wear me out!"
"Yes. It is still far from over!
 Come, let us begin the third game, starting with the first six linked locked rooms!"
"You penetrated this locked room at the time, and by all rights it should have remained that way.
 But then you went and {i:killed off Kinzo}...!!"
At the time, I hypothesized that Gramps was the culprit,
 and that after killing the other five and stringing the keys across each room, he constructed his own locked room in the boiler room,
 where, in the middle of carrying out some kind of scheme, he had an accident which resulted in him burning to death in the boiler.
But now I\'ve gone and declared that Gramps was already dead.
{n}So I\'ve denied my own theory.
{n}The irony...!
 However—
"There\'s no problem!
 {p:2:There are plenty of people who could have committed the crime besides Gramps}!
 {p:2:You could even claim that the adults who were in the middle of a family conference at the time were all in on it and committed the crime together}!"
"{p:1:All five master keys were discovered, each in the pocket of one of the servants}!
 {p:1:The individual room keys were found inside envelopes alongside the corpses}!"
"{p:1:In short, all keys related to the linked locked rooms were locked {i:inside} the linked locked rooms}!!
 {p:1:No key could have been returned from outside the room using a crack in a door, a crack in a window, a vent or any place of the sort}!!"
"{p:2:Then they were killed with poison gas}!
 {p:2:Even if a key couldn\'t pass through, gas could, right}?!
 {p:2:The murder was carried out from outside the locked room}!!"
"{p:1:All of them had fatal wounds that appeared to be gunshot wounds}!
 {p:1:Murdering them from outside the room would have been impossible}!!
 {p:1:I shall say more with the red}!"
"{p:1:When the five other than Kinzo were killed, the killer was always in the same room as them}!
 {p:1:I already declared in red at the time that there were no suicides}!!"
"{p:2:After the murder of each person in their respective rooms, the culprit constructed a linked locked room}.
 {p:2:But there was no way for the culprit to return the key for the last room to the inside of the locked room}.
 {p:2:But they did manage to return it}.
 {p:2:The first person to discover a corpse just had to pretend to find the key and pull it from the corpse\'s pocket}!!"
She couldn\'t fully block that blue stake\'s retort...!
 Pushed back by the blue wedges unleashed one after another, Beato finally failed to block one, and once again took a severe wound.
"Gi...ggi......gyaaaaaahhh!!"
As she howled in pain, she pulled out the blue wedge that had pierced her right arm.
......Beato\'s entire body had been slashed and pierced with blue wedges, stakes, and blades, over and over again,
 and by now, her whole body was covered in blood.
But even so, Beato grinned.
{n}Cackled, as though she was enjoying it...!
"Fuhhahhahhaaaaaaahhh!!
 How could a man who promised to come home to Ange with her parents speak of a theory where those parents are the culprit?"
"Fine by me, that\'s just fiine by meeee, you knoooooww?
 You can be a big, happy family getting their hands dirty with mass murder,
 and return to Ange stained with blood that will never come oooooooooff!!"
"Isn\'t that perfectly fitting for the survivors of the witch\'s islaaaaaaaaaand?
 Just like that mincemeat Angeee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}eehyahhaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhhh!!!"
"Aaaaaarrrrgggghhh, shut uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuupp!!
 I\'ll kill you!!
 I\'ll tear you apart!!
 Don\'t worry about begging for your life, I\'ll make sure you get the worst kind of death by my very own hands!!"
"Yes, you\'re capable of it, I\'m sure...!!
 I trust you to give me an end fitting for a witch who has explored the depths of cruelty over a thousand years...!!"
"Ooh, will it hurt?
 Will it be hard to bear?
 Or will it just ticckklllllleee?!
 Is this supposed to torment me?! Come on, Ushiromiya Battleeeeeeer, there are still mysteries leeeeeeeeeeeeft!!"
Beato had already countered my first powerful move, the 18th person X,
 by making the number of people on the island 17.
But just limiting the number of people to 17 doesn\'t overturn the theory that Aunt Eva is the culprit.
I can crush most of the murders in the third game with that theory...!
Blood was dripping from all over the body of the Golden Witch......
{n}I was cornering her—and this time, completely without mercy.
This isn\'t a game played only to determine a winner and a loser.
{n}......Yeah, we\'re not playing around here.
Even just playing and fighting like this here.........delays the trip home.
In her isolation, Ange will continue to have her heart torn apart by loneliness and sadness...!
I have to go back to Ange as fast as I can!!
"............You\'re a mess.
 Are you at death\'s door?"
"......*cackle*cackle*.
 ......This is still far......from affecting me......
 ......Something like this, .........nn.
 ......*cackle*cackle*, it merely tickles...!!"
"Guess I don\'t need to show you any mercy."
"You were never going to in the first place."
"I\'m going all out."
"I suggest you do.
 When our roles were reversed, I showed you no mercy.
 So you should do the same given the chance."
"Otherwise, I\'ll call another isolated Ange from a different world,
 and this time I\'ll tear off her arms and legs, stick her with a spear and roast her, okaaaaaaayyy??
 Uhhyahhaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhhh!!"
"Shut uuuuuuuuuuup!!
 Never again!!
 Not my family!
 Nor my relatives!
 Nor any of the servants!!
 Never again will you make any of them your toys!!"
"......I\'ve already broken through all of the mysteries in the fourth game with the blue truth.
 .........The only one left is the very last one from the third game.
 ......Only the murder of Doctor Nanjo."
"......Oho, .........have I already been cornered so far......
 ......*cackle*cackle*, I am in a precarious state, aren\'t I...
 ......Iiihhihhihhihhi, ......ghagh, *cough*cough*!"
She coughed violently, spitting up blood.
......Her insides had been punched through so many times.
 It was only natural.
"Which means that the mystery of Doctor Nanjo\'s murder is the last line of defense for you being a witch, right......?"
"............It would seem so.
 If this is broken, it will mean that all of my mysteries have been broken.
 .........Unless I counter one of your truths with some new red truth, or present a new mystery,
 I...will die."
"........................
 ......You don\'t look like someone who\'s been backed to the edge of the cliff.
 ......You still have some kind of hidden pitch up your sleeve, right......?"
"Well, I don\'t know about that...
 I have already tired of a life too long after a thousand years...!
 I\'ve started to think that it might not be so bad to have this life ended by a worthy adversary like you, who I met at the very end of it all."
"*cackle*cackle*, you {i:can} do it, I hope?
 Do it.
 ......Come onnnn, kill meeeee.
 I\'m always the one killing, and I\'ve never had the experience of being kiiiiiilled!"
"I\'ve killed the 18 of you hundreds of times, but I haven\'t been killed myself even once...
 I wanna experience it at least once myseeeeeeeeelf, uuhihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihii!!"
It was a graceless show of bravado, unchanged from before.
......But blood dripped from her mouth, her once beautiful dress was covered with holes,
 and blood poured from all over her body, making her physical appearance look very different from her attitude.
Perhaps she was still suffering from the shot she\'d taken to the flank—
the way she was unconsciously clutching it lacked any trace of elegance.
......But there\'s no room for compassion.
 As long as I feel sympathy for this witch, my family and I won\'t be released from this place.
......Until I defeat her, we won\'t be able to go home...!!
In this world we live in, even people who see each other as enemies can come to understand each other if the situation changes.
But absolute evil does exist.
 That is an evil which brings misfortune by its very existence, and is to be spared no compromise.
Just by continuing to exist, it is.........evil!!
"I do not feel sorry for you.
 Just like you didn\'t feel sorry for any of us...!"
".........Well, of course.
 All of you are just pieces in the game!
 It\'s just unbelievably fun to think about which six to kill in the beginning, how to kill the next two,
 and whether I can find a much, much more grotesque way of killing, you see{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}eee??"
"Come on, Battler, I\'ll reform a little, so forgive me this time too.
 And then I\'ll change the method of killing into something a little better, alright?
 I\'ll listen to how you want them to be killed and in what order, alriiiiiight?"
"It\'s so much funnnnnn, toying with people\'s liiiiiiiiives!!
 I\'m sure you could think of a way, a way to turn Ange into a pile of scrap meat much, much moo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}oore!!"
"Come, Battleeeeeer!!
 Try to expose the truth of Nanjo\'s murdeeeeeeeer!!"
The 18th person X was destroyed.
 But I won\'t give in...!!
{n}I\'ll stop that witch\'s breathing cold!!
The end of the third game.
It was declared in red that the four survivors at that point in time—Battler, Eva, Jessica, and Nanjo—
were all unrelated to Nanjo\'s murder.
And it was also declared that he was murdered directly, right before his eyes.
All other people had the strongest alibi of having their deaths declared in red......
............Without using the 18th person X, I have to...break through this......!
Think, don\'t stop thinking......!!
 Her red doesn\'t only bind me, it\'s also supposed to be her weak point...!
I\'ve got to somehow use it against her.........!
............That\'s right,
 ......there\'s still a gap......!
{n}Yeah, ......this way, I can break through it.
{n}{f:5:Beatrice}\'s legend of the witch is over.
"......True, the others probably were dead.
 {p:2:However, the time at which their deaths were declared in red was not the instant Doctor Nanjo died}.
 {p:2:Strictly speaking, it was in the fight between me and {f:5:Eva} after Doctor Nanjo\'s corpse was found}."
"
{p:2:In other words, if someone who was alive at the time that Doctor Nanjo was killed died before {f:5:Eva} proclaimed that death, you can sew right through that crack}!!
 {p:2:In other words, it\'s like this}."
"{p:2:The culprit was among those people who were not confirmed dead prior to {f:5:Eva}\'s declaration of the deaths,}
 {p:2:and that person had managed to skillfully play dead in the beginning and wait for us to leave them alone}...!
 {p:2:They made us think that they had died, while their death still hadn\'t been declared in red}."
"
{p:2:Then they killed Doctor Nanjo, ......and after that, they died for some reason}!
 {p:2:Then after that, {f:5:Eva} declared their death in red}!!
 That theory can explain Doctor Nanjo\'s murder!!"
How\'s that, {f:5:Beatrice}?!
When he forcefully asked that question, ......there was a terrible sound that could only be likened to that of a compressor,
 and a blue stake as thick as a log...
...appeared from under the earth and skewered the Golden Witch, Beato, pulling her up into the air......
Ugly tearing sounds rang out one after another,
 and each time, ......a blue stake or wedge appeared and impaled {f:5:Beatrice}\'s body.
......When that finally ended...
...her tragic form was exposed there, pincushioned by more than ten stakes and wedges all over her body and dripping with blood, ......dangling and crucified......
......There was none of the dignity of the brutal witch who had sneered at the honor of the dead, and toyed with and killed hundreds of the living.
The rain, which had started falling at some point, ......quietly tormented the crucified witch......
As Battler heaved with his breathing, he waited for some kind of answer from the Golden Witch...
......Although it wasn\'t long,
 it took the witch at least a little bit of time before she showed any signs of life......
"...............It hurts......
......it huuurts..............."
"......You got...what you...deserved.
 ......Know a portion of the pain of all those you\'ve murdered......"
Even as he said that, it seemed Battler had lost a little of his forcefulness at this extremely pitiful sight.
He couldn\'t help but avert his eyes from a woman exposed in such a brutal fashion,
 ......even if she was his enemy.
But even so, .........unless he destroyed {f:5:Beatrice},
 the battle...wouldn\'t end...
"............Battleer,
 .........I beg you...............
 ......*sob*..."
Huh......?
 ......Beato let out a sob...
"......It hurts............
 ......It really
.........huuuurts.........
 .........End it......
 .........End it.........
 ......Even now, I still...
......can\'t die......
 ...*sniff*......
 .........It hurts so goddamn much,
 .........and I still...
...can\'t die.........
.........hic...!"
"............What are you...
...asking...
...me to do...?"
"...............End it... .........
 .........Release me.........from this pain............"
Beato\'s expression......was a soggy mess of blood and tears.
Certainly, Battler had been tricked by her at one point.
 ......So he could probably have suspected her expression, and even her tears, of being an act.
However, .........Battler...believed those tears.
.........After all, those tears...
had the red of truth mixed in with them.
"......What do I do?
 What do I have to do to end your pain...?"
"............I\'m going to...
............lay everything...bare.
 .........It will be...
......my...
heart."
"...Your heart............"
".........ll......me."
"...............Beato..."
"......Ki
...ll
......me......
 ............Just...
......let
...me
......die.........
 ......*hic*,
 .........ueeeeeeee........."
Were those tears of pain and torment, ......or else...
Either way, that pitiful expression...
......was painful for Battler to look at, even after burning with such anger...
"......Quickly, .........go back......to...Ange........."
"It\'s not so that I can go back.
 .........I\'ll grant your request...in order to stop your pain."
"...............Than...
...ou......
 .........Battleeer.........
 ...ooooooohhhh..."
With her last breaths, Beato summoned up all of her remaining strength,
 and managed to close both of her hands into fists......
A red light began to gather at those fists.
......Then she lifted her arms,
 .........as though wishing for something from heaven......
"......I know you.........can kill me...
 .........Everything I am...
 ...My heart......
 .........Crush it.
 ............Pierce it.
 .........Okay......?"
The red light around both her arms got stronger and stronger......
"............Ple......a..........................."
She got that far into the word, ......and then her face tilted to the side a bit.
{n}Her right arm lost its light and flopped down.
......But her left arm alone did not lose its light, and remained held up towards the heavens.
Then, ............before Battler\'s eyes,
 another Beato appeared with a faint form, transparent like a curtain.
......The crucified Beato had already lost consciousness.
However, the newly appeared faint Beato quietly looked at me,
 ......her eyes expressionless,
 ............and spoke, in an uncharacteristically polite tone.
".........
{p:1:Ushiromiya Battler}.
 {p:1:I will now kill you}."
"..................And...?"
".........
{p:1:And right now,}
 {p:1:there is no one other than you on this island}.
 {p:1:The only one alive on this island is you}.
 {p:1:Nothing outside the island can interfere}."
......I...understood.
 This was the only thing left keeping {f:5:Beatrice} a witch—
the {i:final mystery}.
And Beato was holding it out to me.
{n}Entreating me......to solve her final mystery...
...and kill her......
"Come on......
 I\'ll accept......your final mystery."
".........
{p:1:You are all alone on this island}.
 {p:1:And of course, I am not you}.
 {p:1:Yet I am here, now, and am about to kill you}."
"Like a souped‐up version of the mystery of Doctor Nanjo\'s murder......
 .........So......?"
".........Who...am I...?"
"Is that...............your final question?"
{a:c:
"......Who...
...am I.........?"
}
Then, ......{f:5:Beatrice} slowly approached me, and held me, expressionless......
.........Yeah, I get it, Beato.
{n}I\'ll kill you.........don\'t worry.........
Slowly, I, too, held her head.
.........And then...my piece...
left the game board......Scattered over the big bed were cute jellybeans of various colors,
 and chocolate coins.
A fork was stuck into the shortcake peeking out of a gift box,
 and there were decanters with drinks of various colors lined up on the side table.
But the venomous color of the drink poured into the glass matched none of the decanters.
Someone had probably been playing around, mixing them together.
The taste aside, that was a lot of fun to do.
On top of the fluffy bed were several colorful, big pillows stuffed with dreams.
And on this big bed that looked like something out of a child\'s dream world,
 {f:5:Bernkastel} lay face down,
 and {f:5:Lambdadelta} lay face up, hugging a pillow and relaxing......
"Ahahhahahhahhah, this one was a real rush, wasn\'t it?
 I got re~ally anxious when Beato said she\'d stop the game."
".....................What a rude witch, to start a game of this scale and try to end it by throwing it away."
"Wasn\'t Ange a good piece?
 After Beato ran for it, Ange dragged her back and made her resume the game.
 It\'s too bad that she gave Battler a bit too much enthusiasm, though."
"..................Because she knew Battler is weak against emotions."
"No kidding.
 He looked like he might even go easy on his enemy Beato."
"............Based on the previous game, I was uneasy that he might start to feel compassion for Beato, and take the game in an odd direction.
 .........Ange was a trump card to get Battler back on track if and when he mistook his goal."
".........In truth, I wanted to have her support him a bit more before playing her out.
 She really did play and discard herself straight away.
 What a waste for a piece that required so much preparation."
"Ehheheheh!
 I\'m so~ glad I shackled her with the rule about not giving her name!
 If I hadn\'t set that up, the brother‐sister tag team would have swallowed Beato up and won in the blink of an eye."
"............I thought it was my chance to apply a lot of pressure at once,
 but you were watching her so closely that I couldn\'t make the best use of her.
 ......Aaah, what a waste that piece was."
"Well, yeah? That piece was super OP, I needed her out of there, like, yesterday.
 Well, in the end, she did a good job of preventing the game from being suspended, I guess, and that helps me out too.
 Her actions ended up matching both of our interests, so in that sense, she really was a wonderful piece."
"..................She was an innocent kid like Battler, so it was easy to get her to do as I said.
 .........An idiot or an impulsive type, one of those two is always best for a piece.
 ......Aaah, that piece really could have been so much more."
"And now she\'s mincemeat!
 Hey, let\'s make hamburgers out of that later on{p:0:☆}
 Oh wait, didn\'t you like gyoza more?
 I wonder what little sister tastes like, *giggle*, so funny!"
"..................Is it really alright for you to be so relaxed?
 Battler got fired up thanks to Ange.
 He started going after Beato like a madman, and now, the game has taken a big turn to my advantage, I\'d say...?
 In fact, didn\'t Battler just solve almost all of the mysteries so far?"
"Huuh?
 Not even clo~se!
 Almost all of Battler\'s blue truth is wrong!
 Beato\'s wishy‐washy red is full of holes.
 Anyone with half a brain could slip through it easily just by rattling off some random BS."
"......Ahhh, that really ticked me off.
 If that had been me, I\'d have made sure to cut down every one of those things with the red."
"............Oh, really?
 I was under the impression that those were all the correct answers.
 ......Well, of course, I did have my suspicions about all that stuff to do with swallowing small bombs."
"And Battler\'s blue truths, not all of them were even valid.
 ......Beato stated clearly that, within the first game, she
 {p:1:guarantees the identities of all unidentified corpses}!
 That breaks Battler\'s reasoning about the culprit of the Eva/Hideyoshi locked‐room murder being someone who used a fake corpse."
"Next, he said that Kanon\'s death in the boiler room was probably an accident, but...*giggle*!
 What kind of accident could end up with him driving a stake into his own chest?
 How dumb is that?
 I\'ll slice it with that red treasured sword or whatever."
"{p:1:Kanon did not die in an accident}!
 For the next one, the murders of the three including Genji in the parlor, the thought that it was a simultaneous murder where they shot each other in a clockwise pattern at the same time is laughable.
 {p:1:Genji, Kumasawa, and Nanjo were not killers}!"
"The final trap X for Natsuhi\'s murder is really dumb, too.
 {p:1:The thing that shot Natsuhi wasn\'t a trap, it was a real shooting murder with a gun raised and trigger pulled}!
 *giggle*, my condolences...!"
"......Stop that.
 You mustn\'t say something like that in red.
 That kid\'s trying to make it so that she killed Natsuhi by bouncing Natsuhi\'s bullet back at her with magic."
"Oh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho, oopsie, you\'re right, I forgot...!
 Even his blue truths for the second game were too naive."
"
{p:1:When the six were murdered in the chapel, the culprit was inside the chapel}!
 That guy tries to explain every little thing with trap X.
 What the heck is trap X, some weird mystery novel cliché?"
"And in the incident where Nanjo and Kumasawa were killed in the servant room, it\'s ludicrous to say that someone inherited Kanon\'s name.
 {p:1:The only one who can go by the name of Kanon is the person himself}!
 {p:1:No other human can adopt that name}!"
"And that theory about borrowing the master key from Rosa for Natsuhi\'s room is also worthless!"
"{p:1:After the master keys came into Rosa\'s control, never did any of them leave her hands}!
 {p:1:Except for the time when she lent one to Battler to unlock Natsuhi\'s room}.
 I could go on, but this is enough just for a quick look, I guess?"
"............A quick look? You\'ve just denied Battler\'s blue truth for the first and second games across the board.
 .........My, my, what a thing.
 Battler would faint if he heard that."
"......See?
 Beato wasn\'t cornered at all.
 .........I always thought she was a pretty good actress."
"I\'m sure the plan is to make it look like she got cornered this game,
 and then sometime next game, swish!, she\'ll slice it in half with a single red stroke and make Battler\'s eyes pop out."
"*giggle*, and then I\'m sure she\'ll say it with a huge grin on her face.
 "A witch is never in trouble~"!
 Pff, *giggle*giggle*giggle*!!"
"...............Then that whole tragic feeling as though Beato was getting cornered was all an act?"
"Obviously?!
 She really is a great actress!
 Even though she wasn\'t cornered at all, it felt like a last‐episode climax to put everyone else to shame!"
"She\'s totally the winner for best supporting actress this year!!
 Oh, but of course I\'m the sta~r!
 Or it could be you, Be~rn!"
"............At the end, she said things like "kill me" and laid out a big riddle.
 Wasn\'t that her last stand, with Beato to be finished for good if that riddle was solved?"
"*giggle*giggle*...!
 No way, you were tricked too, Bern?"
"That wasn\'t even close to a last stand!
 Beato still has some hellishly brutal moves she\'s keeping hidden.
 ......When she stuck out both arms to give the final riddle, did you notice how she brought her right arm back down?"
"......Ah, now that you mention it.
 .........So that\'s what that meant."
"Sure is!
 She still had plenty of hidden moves left!
 And none of the mysteries have been solved...!"
"That tension, as though she\'d been completely seen through and it was like "Tune in next time for the final episode!"
 She truly is a genius at acting.
 Ahh, I can\'t wait to see her knock Battler back down to rock bottom!"
"She\'s really taken to that "North Wind and the Sun Strategy" from the last game, I think!
 I bet Battler will sympathize with Beato again and fall for it completely...!
 A woman\'s single tear can trick a man, after all—now that\'s value, don\'t you think?!!"
"...............I wonder if Battler will get caught by that move again.
 I must do my part too, and light a fire under Battler to never feel sympathy for her again.
 ......Although Ange\'s mincemeat seems to have done that pretty well for the time being."
"A power‐up from an Ange‐flavored hamburger?
 Oh‐hoho{0}ho{0}ho{0}ho{0}hoho!
 Of course, I won\'t be beaten either.
 I\'ll be giving Beato my full support so she can make enough of a comeback to compete with Battler."
"......She won\'t lose. Beato.
 I mean, I\'ve threatened her with a wonderful penalty if she does{p:0:♪}"
"..................Your penalties are genuinely no joke, so you should go a little easy."
"I\'ve decided what to do next time I get to give you a penalty, Bern.
 Wanna hear? Wanna hear?"
"No."
"Come o~~n, listen{p:0:☆}
 Okay, here we go, here we go.
 I\'ll lock you in a wonderful, wonderful castle."
"The castle will be surrounded by pure white castle walls, {nobr:12 km} to a side.
 With a height of {nobr:10 m}.
 No magic and no cheating allowed!
 That\'s really not something you can jump over, right?"
"1,440,000,000 m³?
 .........You can stop there, I already know what you\'re going to say."
"Eheheheheh!
 And that place will start getting buried with gems, one every day!
 And I\'ll lock you in it until the castle walls are packed with them, and you\'ve been buried to death with gems.
 Isn\'t that a wonderful, romantic penalty?"
"..................I\'ll let you multiply the length of the walls by five if you make the height one‐tenth its current height, and you can even shut me in it right now."
"Really?!
 That would make it {nobr:3,600,000,000 m³}, you know?!
 The penalty would take more than twice as long!
 Aaahh, you\'ll be my prisoner for such a long time?!
 I love you Bern, I really love yo~u{p:0:♪}"
{f:5:Lambdadelta} playfully clung to {f:5:Bernkastel}, who yawned, looking bored, as she stroked {f:5:Lambdadelta} under the chin as though playing with a cat...
"So you\'re betting on Battler to win.
 And I\'m betting on the two of them getting draws forever.
 ............Isn\'t anyone going to bet on Beato to win?"
".....................It won\'t be me.
 Her chances of winning are zero."
"Oh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho!
 It must hurt to be told by the Witch of Miracles that there\'s zero chance of a miracle!
 I wouldn\'t bet on her either, of course.
 For certain!"
".........It must hurt to be told by the Witch of Certainty that it\'s certainly no good, as well."
Unusually for them, they giggled together...
"I wonder what kind of conclusion this game\'s gonna have...?"
"...............Now that, at least, we can\'t predict.
 ...That\'s why it\'s fun, after all."
"I won\'t allow any more escaping or suspending the game.
 I\'ll make them continue the game for certain, and I won\'t let them run away...!
 I can\'t even imagine how things are gonna unfold now,
 but I do know one way it\'s certainly not going to end."
"..................At the very least, we know it won\'t end with Beato\'s victory."
"I mean, think about it.
 Neither you nor I...
are betting on Beato to come out the winner!
 Which means, if it looks like Beato is gonna win, she\'ll be making enemies of both of us Great Witches...!"
".........Pretty much.
 Our powers are most in balance only when things are somewhere between a draw and Battler\'s advantage.
 If it tips too much in Beato\'s favor, both of us will align along the same vector, and drag Beato back."
"So the instant Beato finds herself on top, ......she\'ll have both of us as enemies to deal with.
 .........Ehheheheheh!
 A common front with Bern, sounds fu~~n{p:0:♪}"
".........Thanks.
 ......But I\'m not taking a konpeitou candy bath with you."
"Aaa~w, but I thought we could take a konpeitou shower together,
 while I cover you all over with melted marshmallows..."
".........That poor girl.
 She\'s a living toy, a doll that you caught so that you could play with me."
"I\'m good at playing with dolls.
 ......I really can play with them well, you know?
 I\'m proud of being able to get hundreds of years of playtime out of a single toy without getting tired of it."
"............You\'re her ally at some times, and oppose her at others,
 toying with her forever.
 ......I feel sorry for her. That kid is our doll, now."
"Ehheheh, that\'s right, that kid is our doll.
 No end is prepared for her except the ones the two of us wish for."
"So I can say for sure that this can only end with either an eternal draw because of me,
 or Beato being defeated and destroyed because of you.
 ............Heheh, ...as far as this game ending with Beato\'s victory goes..."
"...............I will proclaim it as the Witch of Miracles."
"Then I\'ll proclaim it as the Witch of Certainty."
""Beato certainly cannot win.
 And there will be absolutely no miracles.""
""Ahhahahahahahahahahahahaha......!!""
