`"Look, George‐sama!`
` They're so cute, look, look!"`
`Shannon found a pair of hammerhead sharks playfully swimming in the tank,`
` and made a fuss like a grade schooler seeing an aquarium for the first time.`
`"Yeah, they're really cute.`
` I almost want to eat them."`
`"I, I'd feel so sorry for them...`
` Did you know?`
` I hear that the only people in the world who come to an aquarium and say that the fish look delicious are the Japanese."`
`"Is that so?`
` ...I'm sure even Americans and Italians would want to eat these."`
`"...Uh,`
` ...um......`
`err..."`
`"Those clothes look good on you.`
` Really."`
`Shannon embraced her chest with both hands in embarrassment.`
`{n}...She apparently felt like she was being made fun of for wearing these clothes that she wasn't used to.`
`Even though George's face didn't show it, the truth was that even he was surprised at how easily those tremendous words had left his lips,`
` and he was as embarrassed as Shannon on the inside.`
`However, when he saw how embarrassed Shannon was,`
` he started to feel as though he was teasing the girl he liked,`
` and instead of embarrassment, ticklish amusement welled up in him.`
`......Wait, that isn't just a feeling.`
`{n}...I really am teasing the girl I like.`
`It pains me to admit it,`
` ......but I used to think that such embarrassing expressions had fallen so far out of use they no longer showed up even in manga.`
`On the contrary, if I'd seen a couple acting like that, I'd have felt like throwing rocks at them.`
`However, even if rocks were thrown at us now,`
` I'm sure they would be just like confetti celebrating us.`
`Now, I can't even remember those lonely days...`
`when I felt jealous of couples who were completely oblivious to their surroundings.`
`To use an old‐fashioned phrase, these would be truly rose‐colored days...`
`I was so entranced that I no longer even noticed the big tank of the world's largest aquarium.`
`Instead, I saw only Shannon happily playing with the fish, all her changing emotions showing on her face.`
`"...It's amazing, isn't it......?`
` It's my first time seeing a tank large enough for a whale to swim in."`
`"I heard that this tank is the biggest selling point here.`
` And that it's the biggest in the whole world."`
`"Is that so?`
` That's amazing.`
` ......It's really wonderful.`
` It doesn't even look like a tank at all, but rather like they sliced off a part of the sea with a knife and brought it here."`
`"It does, doesn't it?`
` This is a splendid little sea."`
`Despite its size, I hadn't thought of the tank as anything more than a tank.`
`That's why I thought her expression about slicing off a part of the sea with a knife was so interesting.`
`No matter how far humans broaden their experiences, in the end, they can only hold a single personal worldview.`
` Maybe that's why it's so interesting to interact with someone who has a different worldview.`
`I said that to her honestly.`
`{n}And she responded:`
`"Certainly, this might not be the real sea.`
` ...But, if those little guys swimming in there believe that it's a sea, then it certainly is a sea."`
`"Even though they're inside a finite tank."`
`"The sea is finite too.`
` No, even if it were infinite,`
` how much could we cover in our whole lives?`
` I'm sure that it would be so much smaller than a sea."`
`"...Certainly.`
` It's ironic, isn't it?`
` Even though the world is so vast, most of us live out our lives without ever leaving our own country."`
`"All it takes is the belief that it is a complete world...`
`for even the bottom of a narrow well to be a proper world, and a sea.`
` ...In the eyes of the frogs who live there."`
`Shannon, who spent her days as a servant on a small island ten kilometers in circumference called Rokkenjima,`
` said that with a smile.`
`After we finished walking through the whole aquarium, we had a slightly late afternoon lunch at a restaurant with a nice view.`
`Any boy's heart will jump about at the sight of a buffet.`
`I myself was like that in the past.`
`But with Shannon beside me, this buffet felt different.`
`{n}I couldn't shamefully make a huge pile of nothing but my favorite foods.`
`I was—how should I put it—worried about my appearance,`
` and chose a menu suited for a snob: toast, salad and coffee.`
`If I were by myself, I'd have made a pile of greasy stuff like yakisoba, mashed potatoes, gratins, and the like.`
`"Shannon, is that enough for you?`
` If it is, then I guess we men are animals with really bad fuel efficiency."`
`"...Umm,`
` I, I didn't mean to imply that......"`
`On Shannon's tray, there was only tea and salad.`
`{n}Maybe the very idea that she could "get away with at least one more dish" indicated I was thinking with my male stomach.`
`"What about you, George‐sama, will that be enough?`
` I think it's better for men to eat a little bit more.`
` ...You normally eat more than that for lunch, don't you?"`
`"Oops, right.`
` You already know how much I eat from when I have lunch on the island."`
`"Yes.`
` So, I was wondering whether your stomach isn't feeling well today..."`
`Shannon was showing concern that I wasn't feeling well.`
`{n}Apparently I had made her worry with my stupid attempt to impress her.`
`And in any case, it didn't seem like my stomach was going to let me keep this pretense up any longer.`
`"...Gah, ahaha...`
` I'll confess already.`
` I was just trying to look cool...`
` I just held back because I was with a girl..."`
`"I thought so.`
` Considering how much you eat during lunch at the family conferences, I thought that this wasn't nearly enough.`
` Please, don't be so reserved, and feel free to go and choose another dish."`
`"This isn't fair... All the embarrassment is on me.`
` What about you, then, Shannon?`
` Do you always manage your work for the Ushiromiya family while eating so little?"`
`"......Umm, uh,`
` ............au."`
`Shannon grew silent and blushed bright red.`
`Apparently, I wasn't the only one putting on a front.`
`{n}When I realized that, my embarrassment disappeared completely.`
`"That isn't enough for you either, is it?`
` Yes, normally, you eat more than this for lunch."`
`"A, a woman's stomach is made of magic, so this is enough...`
` au."`
`"This must mean that we were both trying to impress each other.`
` Let's not hold back anymore, shall we?"`
`I smiled to show that I wouldn't make fun of her anymore and stood up from the seat.`
`"We've come all the way to Okinawa—it would be a waste if we didn't eat some bitter melon.`
` I'll go get some fried bitter melon or something.`
` Come with me, Shannon.`
` C'mon, c'mon."`
`"Ah, yes...!"`
`To anyone watching us, we might have seemed like a pretty humorous—and above all embarrassing—couple.`
`But it's only after becoming a couple that you realize.`
`This banter means the world to us, and {i:is} our world.`
`{n}So, no matter how cold the looks we might have been getting from other people, we wouldn't even notice.`
`......Indeed, at this age, I finally understand the feelings of couples who want to endlessly flirt without any regard to their surroundings.`
`After I returned with a plate piled up with fried food, Shannon arrived with a lovely cake.`
`While laughing at our fake stoicism, we resumed our lunch.`
`"It's a shame that it's so cloudy, considering this restaurant has such a view of the sea."`
`Our window seats, which we were lucky to get, showed us seaside scenery so grandiose that it didn't even fit entirely within our field of vision.`
`However, because of the cloudy sky, it was a far cry from its normal beauty.`
`"Yes, it is.`
` If it had been clear, we would have seen quite the deep blue sea."`
`"Yes.`
` I imagine you're used to seeing the sea on Rokkenjima, but the sea here would surely have been an exceptional blue.`
` ...It's a real shame."`
`"Aah, but—no matter how blue it is, the sea I see during work might as well be gray.`
` But, today, I'm not working, so...I mean..."`
`Apparently, Shannon was doing her best to say an embarrassing line.`
` But I grade harshly.`
`"So close.`
` If only you'd said "when I look at it with you, even the grayest sea looks deep blue",`
` I'd have given you full marks and a reward."`
`"Uh,`
` ah,`
` I, I, I'm sorry......`
` nnnnnn..."`
`"Wanna hear what the reward would have been...?"`
`"Umm,`
` ......`
`uh,`
` if you wouldn't mind......"`
`"No.`
` I won't tell you.`
` Ahahahahahaha."`
`"Tha‐that's not fair..."`
`When I was in elementary school, I was always the kid that got bullied.`
`{n}When everyone teased me, I grew nervous and speechless, to the delight of the bullies.`
`Back then, I wondered why everyone teased me.`
`But now, teasing Shannon like this, I understand why.`
`{n}This is so much fun.`
`I can play with her emotions however I please,`
` ...and I can have them all to myself.`
`Right now, I can't think of any higher pleasure.`
`Which is exactly why I have to treat her lightly.`
`{n}I don't want her to get embarrassed and have a bad time.`
`{n}So I decided to end the topic there and then.`
`{n}It's not good to be too persistent.`
`"When you've finished your lunch, do you want to take a walk on the beach?`
` Perhaps the clouds will clear up and we'll be able to see a picturesque sea."`
`"That's a nice idea.`
` I'd like to do that."`
`"OK, that's what we'll do.`
` ...But that looks like a really delicious cake.`
` I wonder if I should get one like that too."`
`"You mustn't...`
` If you eat cake after already eating so much, you will get fat.`
` Hideyoshi‐sama's blood seems to run pretty thick in you, George‐sama, so if you don't take care, you will get chubby."`
`"So, Shannon, would you stop liking me if I got fat...?`
` I wouldn't stop liking you if you did."`
`"I, I didn't mean it that way...`
` I meant...if you don't take good care of your body, your health will...`
` au."`
`"Mother warns me all the time too.`
` Maybe I also need to take up Tai‐chi‐chuan or something to get some exercise."`
`"If you want to lose weight, it's best to start by reconsidering your eating habits, instead of doing intense exercise.`
` The exercise has to come on top of that, or you won't get any results, I hear."`
`"In other words, you're telling me not to eat cake, right?`
` Then, I guess I'll just have to gaze at you while you stuff your cheeks with that cake, Shannon."`
`"Uh,`
` er,`
` .........`
` ......Maybe one whole cake is too much,`
` ......but maybe just half of one would be alright.`
` Here, it's really delicious."`
`Shannon cut her own cake and tried to move half to my salad plate.`
`I had no doubt that she wanted to share the flavor of the delicious cake with me.`
`Even so, I deliberately and meanly pulled my plate away from her.`
`She blinked her eyes in surprise.`
` She couldn't seem to figure out if that was a refusal of the cake or not.`
`So I winked, opened my mouth, and said "aah".`
`"*giggle*.`
` This is what you wanted from the beginning, isn't it?`
` ......Gosh, you're such a pampered child, George‐sama."`
`"Okay,`
` say "aah"."`
`While still wearing an embarrassed, exasperated face, Shannon offered the cake to me with a fork.`
`Chomp.`
`It tasted like cheap chocolate cake you could find anywhere.`
` Still, it was exceptional.`
`Because eating cake in such an embarrassing way, as if we were the ultimate stereotypical lovey‐dovey couple, had been my dream for many years.`
`It made this cake's flavor heavenly...`
`If the Earth is destined to end someday, I wouldn't have had any regrets if it happened right then.`
`......It was such a moment of bliss.`
`After that, we gathered shells, ran from the waves, and enjoyed each other's company while walking along the beach.`
`In the end, the clouds never parted.`
` However, we both believed that our eyes were still reflecting a deep, blue sea.`
`".........Somehow, I'm so happy,`
` ...it makes me scared."`
`"You do say that from time to time.`
` What is it that you're afraid of?"`
`"...I'm...`
`......a servant of the Ushiromiya family.`
` For someone like me...to be here together with a member of the Ushiromiya family...`
` Um,`
` .........it just seems like too much for me."`
`"I'm also surprised.`
` I didn't just meet you today or yesterday, Shannon‐chan.`
` We've known each other for years now.`
` But we would only ever exchange greetings during family meetups, barely a few times per year."`
`"...I never imagined we'd become close enough that I could spend time with you like this.`
` It's the same for you too, right?"`
`"Uh,`
` ......I...`
`...umm..."`
`"Hm?"`
`"......I did...`
`...imagine.`
` No, umm, err!`
` Rather than imagination,`
` ......it was more like I was fantasizing......`
` You're always so considerate and gentlemanly, so I wondered, if we were in a relationship,`
` ......um, I just had fantasies of what it would be like......"`
`"Then, our relationship happened thanks to your believing heart.`
` Magic dwells in the power of dreaming.`
` So, I'm sure it was that magic that brought us together."`
`".........You're right.`
` ...I really think......that it truly was magic."`
`"But, you know, that's not quite right.`
` Every time we met, I saw you as more and more beautiful, and you grew to occupy a large space in my heart.`
` If the same thing happened to you,`
` then the fact that we are here today is simply an inevitable consequence, rather than something caused by magic or a miracle."`
`"...............No.`
` A miracle did happen,`
` George‐sama."`
`She stopped at the water's edge, and gazed beyond the sea.`
`" ......A miracle?"`
`"No, magic.`
` ...It happened."`
`I was bewildered by that slightly mysterious expression, which I sometimes heard her use.`
`"......Magic, you say?"`
`"Yes, magic.`
` .........You probably won't believe me even if I say it, so I won't.`
` But that magic definitely had the power to grant the miracle which brought you and me together."`
`"You mean, like a lucky chant to make your wish come true?"`
`"Perhaps.`
` Maybe it was something like that.`
` ...Except that it wasn't pretend—it really was real magic."`
`"...Hmm..."`
`Perhaps Shannon isn't alone in wanting to credit an encounter on a miracle, or on chance; it might be a universal thing all girls share.`
`For a man like me, an encounter with a girl is 70 percent effort to try to please her, and 20 percent raw courage.`
` And only 10 percent chance.`
`What she believes to be everything carries little relative weight within me.`
` ...Maybe that way of thinking is in itself calculating and typical of men.`
`But, were I to express that in words, any kind of magic would be broken.`
`I do think that to become this close has taken many fortuities, concessions, and great efforts from us both.`
`We have this private time together now only as the result of all those things put together,`
` and if she wants to call that "magic", that isn't strange in the slightest.`
`That's why I answered her the way I did:`
`"Yes.`
` ......If the same fate were repeated a hundred times, you and I might have gotten into a relationship like this only once."`
`"Our distant and formal connection could have continued right up to now, even as we both remained conscious of each other.`
` From the perspective of those otherworldly selves, we are undoubtedly in a miraculous relationship."`
`"It's not like that...`
` ......It really is magic."`
`"...Perhaps this is something that men will never believe, no matter how often you tell them.`
` Kanon‐kun didn't believe me at all, either."`
`"...I believe you.`
` ......Because I wouldn't want to break the magic by not believing in it."`
`"George‐sama..."`
`In a small voice, I apologized for making light of her magic.`
`Those words seemed to make Shannon a lot happier.`
`After all, if a pair of people believes in the magic of love, it becomes eternal.`
`"Oh, that's right.`
` I have a request, if you'd be willing to indulge me."`
`"...Yes?`
` What is it?"`
`"You know how you call me "George‐sama"?`
` It's not that I dislike it, but would you not call me that anymore?"`
`"Of course, you have to keep up your appearance with the Ushiromiya family, so I won't force you to do this during your everyday routine at Rokkenjima.`
` But, when we are alone, I'd rather you didn't call me that.`
` Yeah, let's create that rule."`
`"A, a rule?`
` Wh‐what would happen if I broke it...?"`
`"Good point.`
` Maybe rule violations do need to have some kind of penalty attached.`
` ...What should it be...`
` ......Wanna hear?"`
`"N‐no, I don't want to hear..."`
`"Ahahahahahaha.`
` I'll have to think about what it should be."`
`"Yes.`
` ......George...`
`san."`
`"...Yeah.`
` That sounds wonderful, doesn't it?`
` I'm so happy,`
` Shannon."`
`"I,`
` ......I...`
`...have the name Sayo...`
`......as well."`
`"Right.`
` Rules must be fair.`
` I'll abide by that too, and from now on, I'll call you Sayo.`
` Alright?`
` Sayo...?"`
`"Y‐yes."`
`I put my arm around her shoulder and held her close.`
`Her delicate body was pulled irresistibly towards me, and she leapt into my chest like a doll.`
` As I held her head in my arms, we looked at the horizon together.`
`"What a deep blue sea.`
` I'm so happy that we were able to see it together."`
`"......Me too.`
` It makes me very happy that I could look at such a deep blue sea with you."`
`As we gazed at the gray sea and a light rain began to sprinkle down,`
` we kept listening to each other's heartbeats...`
`The sound of waves soaked into my ears.`
` ...No, this was the sound of raging waves.`
` My body, bathed in painfully cold splashes, did not allow me to forget.`
`The memory of the day when my old fate was broken and smashed.`
`In the past, "tomorrow" had been literally like a mirror to me.`
`All I could see in it was the same me that existed "today".`
`{n}......My tomorrow would never be any different from my today.`
`That was my old fate.`
`...But at that moment, for the first time, I saw a different fate beyond the mirror.`
`The witch whispered.`
`She tempted me to take a bite out of the fruit of knowledge.`
`{n}She tormented me, saying that as long as I stayed in the paradise of God, I would remain furniture.`
`And so I learned of love, and decided to choose to become a person.`
`......Those days were like sweetly melting honey,`
` ......but then, I hadn't realized that they were the beginning of days filled with a new kind of suffering......`
`Taking a motorboat that I had just been told about, I made my way to this islet.`
`No, I couldn't possibly call it an islet.`
`{n}It'd really be more appropriate to call it a reef.`
`It had a torii and a small shrine for the local deity.`
`It was probably built to worship the guardian deity of Rokkenjima.`
`{n}......Even though I didn't know the exact meaning, I understood that it had a holy significance.`
`Despite being in a place like this, I took just one more look around to see if there was anyone observing me.`
`......The only things I could see were the stormy ocean, Niijima looming in the distance, and the waves breaking against Rokkenjima's steep cliffside.`
`I readied myself,`
` ......timidly approached the small shrine,`
` ...and took up the mirror that had been placed there.`
`It was an old‐looking mirror, dim and dirty.`
`{n}......If it were an ordinary mirror, that would probably give you a terribly bad impression of its value.`
`...However, since the mirror had been offered to this small shrine, that quality made me feel some kind of divinity from it.`
`......And I realized.`
`This was not merely a mirror.`
`{n}...Even if it was nothing more than an old‐looking mirror to a non‐believer like myself, in actuality, it was a mirror that had an important meaning.`
`......Is it really alright to break it after being captivated by honeyed words?`
`......No, this is no mirror.`
`{n}...It is the inescapable life I have lived until today—my fate.`
`Break it.`
`Break it, ......and seize a life from beyond the mirror.`
`{n}If I don't break it, my life will forever be a pair of facing mirrors.`
`{n}Nothing will ever change in the slightest...`
`The witch whispers.`
`She tempts me to take a bite out of the fruit of knowledge.`
`{n}Or maybe I have already had a taste of that fruit.`
`Because I ended up knowing those maddening emotions.`
`{n}Just as Adam and Eve felt compelled to pluck the fig leaf...`
`I can no longer...`
`...go without breaking this mirror.`
`I fought with conflict for many days.`
`{n}Inside my heart, the virtuous part of me and the part that sided with the witch repeatedly fought each other.`
`And now, here I am.`
`Did the part of me who is here win or lose?`
`There's only one thing I know.`
`{n}To obtain something, you must be ready to lose something.`
`The cowards who don't risk loss and never try to change anything will never be given the key to open the path to a new future.`
`The key is already in my hands.`
`It is—to break this.`
` To break it.`
`Is there any other effort I can make, as furniture imprisoned on Rokkenjima?`
`No.`
` There's nothing...but this.`
`Come, have courage.`
` I'll free myself from being mere furniture.`
`{n}And I'll accept my new sufferings, and become human.`
`{n}These are surely the small and large trials I must impose on myself.`
`Now,`
` ......break it.`
`Break the eternally unchangeable fate that imprisons me...into pieces......!`
`I raised it high,`
` .........thought back on all those days of conflict,`
` ......and, after a time far too brief to do them justice, I finished my reflections...`
`...`
`and threw it.`
`The thunder roared, ...crying out against me for my outrageous act.`
`{n}...It was truly the wrath of the angels, preparing to banish me from eternal paradise.`
`I looked down on the mirror tumbling at my feet, broken in two equal parts,`
` ...and, having made sure I had accomplished my task,`
` ......I looked up at the enraged sky, and screamed.`
`"...I,`
` ...............I kept...`
`......the promise...`
` ......Now,`
` .........it's your turn to keep your promise with me, right......?"`
`The thunder roared once more.`
`...I had already been banished from Paradise.`
`{n}So, I would have to struggle by myself in order to live.`
`The witch had said it.`
` That's the single element of the world.`
`To lose it—means to lose the world.`
`{n}...Like how a flask with a hole in the bottom can't be filled, no matter how much water you scoop into it...`
`"......I kept the promise.`
` .........Now, it's your turn to keep your promise.`
` ......Please, grant my wish!`
` {f:5:Beatrice}‐samaaaaaa!!"``My mind wandered.`
`Back to the days when I could barely imagine the happiness I have today.`
`I was a middle schooler at the time.`
`{n}An ordinary girl, who dreamed about love, as is normal at that age.`
`But I really should not have dreamed that dream.`
`...Because I am "furniture".`
`{n}Furniture is nothing more than a tool, and is not human.`
`For a person less than human such as myself, just receiving my education was more than sufficient happiness.`
`So even thinking about love was more than I deserved...`
`The Ushiromiya family conference was a customary event held every October,`
` but relatives would occasionally visit at other times as well.`
`{n}...Of course, they didn't come just to drink tea.`
`On this day, Eva's family had visited the head family on Rokkenjima.`
`The three people from Krauss's family and the three people from Eva's family had gathered in the parlor,`
` and were having a friendly chat as they updated everyone on their situations.`
`Genji had supposedly told Kinzo of Eva's family's arrival, but he hadn't come down yet.`
`...He was probably immersed in his own "research", and couldn't spare the time.`
`This often happened, so the others waited patiently for their fickle father to come down.`
`"Hoh.`
` That does sound promising.`
` Study a lot at your father's, and do your best to become able to help him soon."`
`"Thank you very much.`
` The mentors Father has introduced me to are providing me truly valuable study.`
` Everything I learn is something that can't be learned in school."`
`"It's not language or math you learn in school.`
` What you study is the attitude to have towards studying.`
` Once you form that basis, you can finally start a long period of study that'll last your entire life."`
`"People who don't get this will spend the rest of their lives with rocks for brains, totally unable to absorb knowledge.`
` They might get full marks in math and language, but they'll be useless for their company!"`
`"Mmhm, that is exactly right.`
` Hideyoshi‐san, your education policy is always truly excellent."`
`"You're not a full man yet, George!`
` Always keep that in mind, and embrace your studies."`
`"Oh, stop that, honey.`
` George is {i:always} doing his very best.`
` Aren't you?"`
`"Truly excellent.`
` I wish our Jessica would learn from him..."`
`"...Ughhh.`
` Are you {i:still} holding a grudge about my test scores?`
` I said I {i:am} studying for the exams, I'm doing it my own way.`
` You didn't have to bring it up here as well.`
` Cram it already."`
`When George was praised for his diligence, the conversation would nearly always turn to Jessica, who hated studying.`
`Jessica made an openly displeased face, as though she'd known it would come back to her.`
`"My, my...`
` In addition to studying, I think you need to learn to speak a little more ladylike, don't you?`
` It's quite shameful for a daughter who bears the Ushiromiya family crest."`
`"Oh, but this is charming in itself, don't you think?`
` Times change.`
` The times when we had to feign purity in order for a man to allow us to eat ended a long time ago."`
`"Yes, yes!`
` I knew you'd understand, Auntie Eva!`
` Eheheheh!"`
`"......Haah...`
` My headache is truly trying today."`
`"Are you alright?`
` Aunt Natsuhi, your face looks off‐color."`
`"Thank you, I am all right.`
` ......But time really has flown.`
` It feels like just yesterday when you would run around half‐naked by the beach and come back soaked."`
`"Wasn't Jessica‐chan the same?`
` And now she's a lady who fusses over how to put on makeup.`
` You really are particular about your eyebrows... You look really cute today."`
`"Thank you very much.`
` Nobody noticed, so my confidence was taking a beating."`
`A full smile rose to Jessica's face as the results of her own "studies" were finally noticed.`
`Eva smiled back just as widely.`
`{n}...Then, she turned that smile towards Natsuhi.`
`"Come on, Natsuhi nee‐san!`
` You must take notice of small changes in your own child.`
` Poor Jessica‐chan.`
` She must have wanted her mother to notice first, su~rely?"`
`"It's fine, it's fine.`
` She never notices anything like that."`
`"Jessica.`
` I do not think much of you calling your mother "she".`
` Apologize."`
`"......Later, I will speak to you at length about your language."`
`"Ugh...`
` If you've had enough of the annoying little kid, just say so next time.`
` I'm getting out of here.`
` This room is getting stuffy."`
`"Jessica...!"`
`Jessica was still at that unpredictable age with exams right around the corner.`
`{n}Recently, she had clashed often with her mother, who was enthusiastic about her education.`
`"Excuse me...`
` kya?!"`
`Jessica, making to leave the parlor in a bad mood, and Shannon, pushing a serving cart loaded with tea, bumped into each other.`
`"Ah, Shannon. Don't bother with my tea.`
` I'm just going to wander around the garden."`
`"...Mi‐Milady..."`
`"Shannon, the tea is getting cold.`
` Serve it quickly."`
`"My, my apologies..."`
`Shannon hadn't actually done anything wrong,`
` but Natsuhi, who felt like some shame to herself had been shown, lashed out at her emotionally.`
`...This was something that often happened in the Ushiromiya family.`
`{n}But it seemed that Shannon wasn't strong‐willed enough to accept it that way.`
`She shrunk back, and nervously prepared the black tea.`
`She had the unfortunate habit of making more mistakes when she felt intimidated.`
`Her pitiful appearance dispersed the peaceful atmosphere that had been there until just a moment ago.`
`That wasn't really Shannon's fault, but she thought she might be the source, and felt a pressure on her chest.`
`Her shaking fingers made the porcelain clatter, and you couldn't have called it graceful, not even as an empty compliment.`
`The more pitiful everyone thought that was, the greater the silence grew,`
` the more irritated Natsuhi looked, and the more Shannon cowered...`
`Shannon's thin neck felt like it was being choked and suffocated by the death god called tension.`
`Then, George spoke cheerfully, as if to blow away the stiff atmosphere.`
`"That's a nice smell.`
` What kind of tea is it?"`
`"Umm,`
` .........this is......"`
`"No, don't say it.`
` I'll guess.`
` It's a very distinctive smell, so I probably know it.`
` ......Is it...Earl Grey?"`
`"I, I think it probably is..."`
`"Ahahahaha.`
` It probably is Earl Grey.`
` When you get back to the kitchen, check the can."`
`"Hoh.`
` George‐kun, are you knowledgeable about black tea?"`
`"I'm currently in the service of a company president who knows a lot about black tea.`
` After enough time listening to his expositions, I picked up a little of it."`
`"Oh yeah, the president of Okonogi Foods.`
` That sort of in‐depth knowledge is his specialty!"`
`"The names of tea often refer to the place where it's made, right?`
` So is this something cultivated from a place called Earl Grey?"`
`"I have heard that long ago in England, there was an earl called Grey, and it was named after him."`
`"Incidentally, this distinctive smell doesn't come from tea leaves, but from a fruit called a bergamot, which is a relative of the mandarin orange."`
`"Is that so?`
` I never knew that.`
` Having that knowledge, the tea will taste even more delicious."`
`"Alcohol and cigarettes are the same.`
` With luxuries, you've gotta appreciate the romance.`
` Knowledge like this deepens the taste."`
`"It's the same with the advertising on medicine.`
` Natsuhi nee‐san, you should try reading the explanation on your favorite headache medicine someday.`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*."`
`"Hahahaha!`
` A fine idea.`
` Try it tonight."`
`"...Yes, I shall."`
`"Shannon‐chan, open that pot and have a look.`
` You should be able to find some dried bergamot mixed in with the tea leaves."`
`"Ah, ......yes.`
` It is in there.`
` Something like dried orange peel is mixed in."`
`"Yep.`
` That's probably bergamot.`
` The main ingredient in Earl Grey's scent.`
` The scent is vivid, so it gives the impression of having a sharp taste, but it's a docile taste that's easy to drink."`
`"It might be lovely to make it with milk—the scent should become more mild.`
` If there's anything left in the pot after you've poured for everyone, you really should make a milk tea out of it and try it out."`
`"Ah, ...yes...`
` Thank you very much..."`
`George gave her a small wink.`
`Shannon finally realized that George had been doing her a favor by calming down the atmosphere in the room.`
` And he had been doing it for her sake as she had lost her self‐confidence.`
`The Ushiromiya family did not pamper their servants.`
`{n}So if there was any awkwardness, they would be harshly punished.`
`So it didn't often happen that they were given a helping hand like this.`
`Thanks to George's concern, Shannon was somehow able to get ahold of herself and finish serving everything safely.`
`If she was calm when she worked, she could easily carry out her tasks elegantly and flawlessly.`
`By the time the black tea was laid out on the table and the elegant scent drifted around,`
` the room was completely back to how it had been, in a peaceful mood, as everyone praised George's knowledge.`
`Shannon wanted to thank him for saving her, but it didn't look like she would get the chance.`
`So she at least thanked him inside her heart, praying to God that George would hear it, and pushed the serving cart away.`
`"George nii‐san has always lent a helping hand in times like that.`
` By changing the topic or something."`
`Shannon and Jessica could be seen in the rose garden.`
`Jessica, having gotten into a fight with her mother, now felt unable to simply nonchalantly wander back into the parlor, and so found herself here, killing time.`
`"......When I think back on it, I feel that maybe this wasn't the first time he has helped me like that."`
`Whenever I made a careless mistake, and George‐sama was there,`
` he would always naturally smooth things over and make things harmonious, I think.`
`...Maybe it wasn't something as direct as picking up a fork that had been dropped.`
`But that was his way of caring.`
`{n}Even servants have pride.`
` They want to fix their own mistakes by themselves.`
`...Because if a guest helped them out with that, they would lose face.`
`"He's really good at reading between the lines in those kinds of situations.`
` Well, maybe that's George nii‐san's aesthetic take on things.`
` That guy's more of a show‐off than he looks.`
` Ahahahahaha."`
`"Tha‐that's not true...`
` ...I think he is a really wonderful person."`
`"Hmmmm...?!`
` ......Shannon, you haven't fallen in love with George nii‐san, have you?"`
`Shannon had refuted Jessica's words uncharacteristically forcefully, so Jessica caught on immediately.`
`"No, ...that's not it, I...think......"`
`"Come to think of it, I've never heard any of that kind of gossip about George nii‐san.`
` Wait...`
` Actually, didn't I hear him say that family‐oriented girls were his type?`
` Nice, that fits you perfectly, Shannon!"`
`"It, it, it does...?!`
` I don't—`
`I am not, umm,`
` ...qualified...for that..."`
`"You sure are qualified!`
` You've known each other for years, you're almost childhood friends.`
` They say that when you have a natural relationship where you don't think of each other as boy and girl, it's plain sailing once you do!`
` No doubt!"`
`Jessica loved teen magazines with these kinds of stories, and she was always on the phone talking excitedly with her friends about that kind of thing.`
`So she had a keen intuition for this kind of romantic topic.`
`So, this wasn't the first time a topic like this had been brought to Shannon.`
`But it was certainly the first time she had noticed George as a member of the opposite sex.`
`She was furniture, and George was an honored guest connected to the Ushiromiya family.`
`{n}......She had thought it impermissible to even imagine any deeper relationship.`
`So she hadn't thought about it.`
`Jessica was taking immense pleasure in poking fun at all this, since it didn't affect her.`
`{n}Shannon was doing her best to make sure that her blushing cheeks weren't discovered.`
`So if George showed up at a time like that, there would be no way that she would be able to keep her cool.`
`They saw George come out from the entrance hall of the mansion.`
`{n}It looked like he had seen them as well.`
`{n}He headed over, waving his hand.`
`Shannon had to frantically try to regain her ordinary composure before George reached them...`
`"Grandfather finally came down.`
` Now they're having an adult discussion, so they chased me out."`
`"Hahaha, escaping then was the right choice.`
` I'd sooner kiss a god of pestilence than go look Grandfather in the face."`
`"You shouldn't speak that way.`
` ...However, I think Grandfather may think of us as such pestilent creatures.`
` After all, we came over here specifically to ask him for money for business."`
`That's right—this wasn't the customary annual October family conference.`
`Eva's family had visited to apply for a business loan from the main family.`
`Kinzo had vast resources, and he lent those out to his children.`
`Of course, this was not money to lend because they had gotten themselves into financial trouble.`
`{n}...How would they expand their business, using the vast amount of money that they borrowed?`
`How much interest would be attached, and how soon could it be repaid?`
`This wasn't a loan for the have‐nots.`
`{n}It was a loan for those who were on the offense.`
`Kinzo judged strictly whether it was worth lending out his fortune, and afterwards, he strictly oversaw its use.`
`So there was occasionally this spectacle where relatives visited Rokkenjima and explained their business to Kinzo.`
`To the parents, it may well have been a meeting concerning the movement of large sums of money, forcing immense stress upon them.`
`But to Jessica, who lived on this isolated island called Rokkenjima, it was a precious opportunity to meet up with her cousins.`
`So even her bad mood from getting into that fight with her mother...`
`was immediately cured by this chat with the infrequent visitor George.`
`"My family's a total bunch of tightwads.`
` They've probably got money to spare, why not be generous with it.`
` I bet my Dad and Grandfather are both just being really tight."`
`"It's natural to be prudent when lending money.`
` Of course, my father has come with a plan by which he can expand his business with what he borrows, and which he can definitely repay.`
` Everything else will be up to the presentation."`
`"......Really, I would have liked to watch alongside and learn.`
` But Mother chased me out.`
` I'm a little let down."`
`"......It seems that the Master still scolds Krauss‐sama and Eva‐sama in just the same way he did when they were kids.`
` I'm sure she didn't want to show that to you, her son."`
`As Shannon hung her head, she thought back on those scenes she had grown used to seeing while working in the mansion.`
`Even Krauss, who acted haughtily towards his siblings, was still treated like a child by Kinzo.`
`...Shannon herself had often seen Kinzo slapping Krauss, or making him sit in {c:86EF9C:{i:seiza}}‐style.`
`......It was probably deeply humiliating to have that forced upon him at his age.`
`In the Ushiromiya family, taking care not to be present when this happened was one of the great tasks of the servants.`
`...Of course, that did mean that Shannon had been making mistakes by being witness to it.`
`"Probably.`
` ...Realizing that and going away may be my duty as her child.`
` ......Welllll!`
` All that aside, the flowers in this garden are truly splendid this year, aren't they?"`
`George stretched as he said that.`
`...And truly effortlessly, he changed the subject away from something that had become a little gloomy.`
`This time, Shannon noticed it too.`
`......This person, George, was highly sensitive to the mood of a group, and was always caring enough to change the subject to something harmonious.`
`It had been so smooth that Shannon hadn't noticed it until today.`
`Today, Shannon had to really admire that behavior of George's.`
`Almost all of the boys Shannon knew of her own age were her classmates during her education.`
`But they were all immature, ......and none of them had had the composure that George did.`
`Even though he had been just another guest until moments ago,`
` ...now, she couldn't describe him with just that.`
`But that was idle thinking, irrelevant to her work as a servant.`
`{n}Shannon tried to chase it away with a small shake of her head.`
`"Hm?`
` What's up?"`
`"Ah, no, it's nothing...!"`
`"Umm, shall I prepare some tea?`
` Uhh, ......I will prepare some more of that Earl Grey for you."`
`"Ahaha, so you remembered the name of that black tea.`
` I'm happy."`
`"Um, .........umm........."`
`"Hm?"`
`"...Umm, ......thank you for your concern back then..."`
`Shannon was finally able to put her thanks into words.`
`If you wrote them out on paper, they wouldn't seem like much,`
` ...but Shannon had needed just a little courage to say them out loud.`
`But George played dumb.`
`"What's this?`
` I don't remember doing anything I should be thanked for?`
` Heheh."`
`It seemed he was being a gentleman in his own way, saying that he hadn't helped her because he wanted to be thanked.`
`It seemed that George's response had been more or less predictable to Jessica.`
` She burst out laughing uncontrollably.`
`"Seeee?`
` This is it, isn't he a show‐off?"`
`"N‐no...`
` I don't think that's......"`
`Jessica made fun of Shannon as she remained silent, red‐faced.`
`{n}George didn't know the details, but he naturally joined in, laughing the same way.`
`The three of them lazily walked around the garden, talking about what was new.`
`George, as the oldest cousin, talked about his life experiences.`
`{n}Jessica talked about recent life on Rokkenjima.`
`{n}And Shannon talked about her recent work.`
`These silly little topics went round and round in circles.`
`Even when the others' stories had been fascinating,`
` Shannon had never felt particularly connected to their contents.`
`She was nothing more than a servant, and she had no intention of delving into her masters' lives.`
`She simply wanted them to enjoy their time speaking with her,`
` and was only pretending to listen intently, and nodding at the right moments.`
`But for some reason, she found talking with George deeply interesting today.`
`Even for things that she would normally ignore, she felt like she could feel a kindness hidden beneath the words.`
`For some reason, she wanted to know more things about George, no matter how trivial.`
`So...she stared fixedly at him.`
`She thought that as far as looks went, this person Ushiromiya George, ......was probably...`
`about average, and he didn't really stick out.`
`But he was diligent, serious, ...and deeply thoughtful in a way that allowed him to understand people's hearts and care for them.`
`But she had never been aware of these things until now.`
`{n}She might not have met him many times, but she had known his face for many years.`
`Even so, she had not noticed once until now.`
`{n}...So Shannon felt ashamed of this, and her cheeks went red.`
`Maybe George thought that Shannon was appreciating him talking about himself, because he continued to relate his personal stories.`
`...But Jessica didn't miss that slight change in Shannon.`
`So she turned the discussion around to the topic Shannon wanted to hear about most.`
`"......Oh yeah, come to think of it!`
` George nii‐san, did you finally get a girlfriend yet or what?"`
`"Wha‐what is this, out of the blue..."`
`Normally, just George's reaction would have been answer enough.`
`But for some reason, as she was now, Shannon found herself unable to understand it unless he said it clearly.`
`"Um, ...umm...`
` George‐sama is very nice,`
` ......so I'm sure...`
`umm......he must be very popular with the girls......"`
`"No, err, ...hahahahahahahahahaha."`
`"Quit it Shannon~.`
` That's pretty meeeean, cornering him like that...`
` *cackle*!"`
`"I, I wasn't trying to be mean........."`
`"Thank you for your happy wrong impression.`
` It's a shame, but I still don't have a relationship with any special girl.`
` As you can see, my looks are below average.`
` And I can't speak wittily in a way that can entertain a girl."`
`"I, I don't think that's true.`
` ......And...I think that a man's charm is decided by things you can't measure on the outside.`
` Tha‐that's why, umm,`
` ......I think that you might be a, um, ...very charming man, George‐sama..."`
`Shannon was uncharacteristically verbose.`
`{n}Compared to her normal self, she was being very wordy indeed.`
`George looked fairly pleased about hearing his own charm described, but he was just a little surprised at this high praise.`
`Jessica, sure now that her own imagination was right on, acted as though she could barely hold back her laughter.`
`"Thank you, Shannon‐chan.`
` I hope I soon run into a girl gracious enough to find me attractive."`
`"Yes, I'm sure you will.`
` ......I'm sure there's a girl not—`
`I mean, a, a, a lot of girls who will recognize your real charm."`
`She probably wanted to say "there's a girl not very far away".`
`...She avoided saying that much, drawing a final line as a servant.`
`"Re‐......really.`
` ...I guess I'm kind of...embarrassed..."`
`Maybe he had never been praised this much by a girl.`
`{n}George's face turned just as bright red as Shannon's.`
`As she watched the two of them, Jessica giggled sadistically.`
`"Well, I'm sure you'll eventually find a wonderful partner, George nii‐san.`
` But I don't think you'll be able to escort your partner as you are now, riiiight?`
` Your Braininess may be a diligent worker, but it looks like you're totally clueless when it comes to {i:that} aspect of your studies."`
`"...E‐excuse me for being ignorant.`
` I'll start studying that bit by bit."`
`"How would you do that by yourself?`
` Are you gonna watch movies about love?`
` Learn from Uncle Hideyoshi?`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"Tch...`
` You're milking it for all it's worth, aren't you?`
` Men aren't a match for girls in this kind of conversation."`
`Normally, when George and Jessica got together, their parents would say "George is diligent and admirable", and "Jessica is lazy and rude".`
`So it was probably irresistible fun for Jessica when their roles were finally reversed.`
`George also realized that, so this time, he was content with being the one who was teased.`
`"Then, George nii‐san, as long as you're okay with it, why not practice a bit with Shannon?`
` Keep Shannon entertained all day long on a date!`
` What do you think?!"`
`"Wh‐wha‐what are you...!`
` Mi‐Milady...!"`
`When she heard Jessica's audacious plan, Shannon's face turned bright red, and a donut of smoke rose from it with a "poof".`
`"Tha‐that's a very attractive plan, but...I'd feel bad for Shannon‐chan.`
` I wouldn't just be wasting her precious day off,`
` I'd also be butting in on the ideal moment when she'd be able to be alone with someone she really has feelings for.`
` I couldn't do something so boorish."`
`"I, I, ...I also, umm......`
`......don't have a person I have feelings for or anything, so, umm,`
` ...caring for me like that is—yes, it's, it's unnecessary...!"`
`Shannon's blood had all rushed to her head, and it looked like even she didn't know what she was babbling about.`
`Jessica, who knew how Shannon normally was, seemed to find that really comical.`
`She couldn't hide her cackling laugh anymore.`
`"...I‐is that true...?`
` I can't believe that a cute girl like you would be single, Shannon‐chan..."`
`"I, I, I,`
` ...I'm a servant, so, umm,`
` ......I don't have any opportunities to meet boys, and, umm..."`
`"Which means that, in the future, if Shannon's gonna have any chance of getting herself a wonderful guy,`
` she needs practice with relationships, right?`
` So you each want the same thing.`
` Alright, that'll work nice, *cackle*!"`
`Jessica irresponsibly cheered the two of them on.`
`{n}Now, George was also hanging his head, red‐faced.`
`"George, I've been calling for you.`
` Couldn't you hear me?"`
`Since Eva appeared in what was already an embarrassing situation, both of them became even more flustered.`
` Jessica was in stitches.`
`"Ah, M‐M‐Mother...!`
` Sorry, our conversation got complicated.`
` I didn't notice...!"`
`"Oh, Eva‐sama... My deepest apologies..."`
`"It sounds like you young kids were getting really excited.`
` You're all about that age.`
` I remember well what that's like—you must have no end of things like that to talk about.`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*."`
`"Oh, come on, Auntie Eva, you're still in your priiime!`
` Please tell us how you and Uncle Hideyoshi met!"`
`"Oh my, there's no way I could tell you that.`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*.`
` You're all so young.`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*."`
`"S‐so, what is it, Mother?`
` You called because you wanted something, right?"`
`"Your father and the rest have finished talking.`
` We're going to talk to Grandfather about you, so come on."`
`"About me?`
` What could that be?"`
`"The same topic you all were just having.`
` Remember, that topic?"`
`"Oh, ...oh, that topic.`
` That isn't really something we need to talk to Grandfather about, is it...?"`
`"What are you talking about?`
` Wait, George nii‐san, you aren't getting married to someone?!"`
`"Con‐...congratulations...!"`
`"No, no...!`
` Didn't I just say I don't have a special woman?"`
`"That isn't something to brag about, is it?`
` ...Seriously."`
`Eva smiled bitterly, looking a little exasperated.`
`"...Ah, ...I got it!`
` George nii‐san, it's one of those, right? A marriage meeting!"`
`"A marriage meeting...?"`
`"......nn, ......well, yeah.`
` ......Hahahaha..."`
`As a man, George undoubtedly wanted to find a partner by himself and carry her off himself.`
`So it seemed that he found the idea of meeting his partner for the first time in a marriage meeting arranged by his parents to be a little pathetic.`
`"Shouldn't marriage meetings be done at a more mature age...?!`
` I still don't feel like I've become an adult..."`
`"We don't intend on rushing you into an immediate engagement or marriage—of course not.`
` It isn't a problem if you deepen your friendship first, and then have her moved to our family register later when you settle down as you age."`
`From the forceful impression Eva was giving, and George's evasiveness, it seemed you could catch a glimpse of how this marriage meeting linked into everything.`
`Who this other person was remained unclear, but it was surely someone profitable to Eva's family in a business sense.`
`It felt almost like a political strategy; they wanted to create a connection between the two families, if not by changing registers, then at least by having them get engaged.`
`"Marriage isn't something you do after you start liking someone.`
` It's something you get used to after you do it.`
` If you marry just based on emotions, you'll definitely regret it.`
` There's definitely nothing wrong with choosing a person with a secure background as your partner in life, and then building up emotions of love."`
`"Auntie Eva, that's so rude to Uncle Hideyoshiii...`
` *cackle*!"`
`"I love him, you know.`
` I want to always be with him, and to live my life by his side."`
`"......Eva‐sama, that's wonderful.`
` Truly splendid..."`
`"Thank you.`
` But we built up those feelings while we were husband and wife, you see?`
` And I believe that in the future, we will be much, much closer than we are now.`
` I think that's the best way for a husband and wife to be."`
`"Although I don't think that makes it alright to marry someone you don't even like."`
`"And {i:that} doesn't make it alright to marry whoever you want just so long as you like them.`
` A wedding only lasts a moment.`
` But your life as a married couple after that is very, very long."`
`"So you should search with prudence, and not leave it up to momentary emotions.`
` And don't you think that your mother and the rest of us would be better at that than a person inexperienced in life like yourself?"`
`"......Tha‐that may be true, but..."`
`"You are my pride and joy—my only son.`
` You have grown into a fine man who could match up to anyone.`
` ...And with Battler‐kun leaving the register, you are the only grandson to carry Father's blood.`
` ......We must prudently choose a fitting partner for you."`
`As everyone related to the Ushiromiya family knew, Eva adored George so much that he was the apple of her eye.`
`But that didn't mean she had pampered him.`
`{n}She had raised him strictly, and he had grown into a charming man who wouldn't betray her expectations.`
` ...That's how he was the apple of her eye.`
`"We definitely aren't deciding your partner based on what we personally stand to gain from it.`
` ......I will introduce you to a truly wonderful woman who's right for you.`
` Right now, you may still have some immature youth inside of you that's turning you away from this."`
`"......But at least listen to what your mother says on this point.`
` Have I ever failed to think of what's best for you?"`
`".....................No, ......you haven't..."`
`"That's all you need to think of for now.`
` Come on now, let's go.`
` We're keeping Father waiting.`
` Hurry to the mansion."`
`"Well, sorry, you two.`
` See you later."`
`George bowed to the two of them, ...and after bowing once more to Shannon, he dashed off to the mansion.`
`"I'll be going as well, then.`
` Sorry for cutting your fun conversation short, Jessica‐chan, Shannon‐chan."`
`"Ah, no no.`
` Please don't worry about it.`
` Come on, Shannon.`
` Let's go."`
`"Ye‐yes...!"`
`"It's alright.`
` I'm sure you'll meet someone wonderful soon too, Jessica‐chan.`
` A wonderful person suitable for you."`
`"So if he's at the same level as me, hahaha, you mean a guy with bad grades?`
` Well that kinda frickin' sucks, hahaha!"`
`"And of course, you too, Shannon‐chan.`
` I'm sure that a wonderful man suitable for you will appear."`
`"Ye‐yes!!`
` Thank you very much..."`
`As Eva giggled and smiled, she approached Shannon's ear with a hand over her mouth, as though she was trying to tell her a secret.`
`".........Huh?"`
`"I'm sure you'll find a perfect match for a lowly servant like yourself.`
` ......Have you forgotten to be grateful for your schooling?`
` Know your place."`
`".........Th‐...that's not what I... ...I didn't..."`
`"George is the eldest grandson carrying Father's blood.`
` He's a person who may bear the burden of the Ushiromiya family someday in the future."`
`"To answer that expectation, he has studied tirelessly, entered a wonderful college, and is getting wonderful grades.`
` Do you reeeally think you're in his league, you incompetent, unqualified, uncultured seeerrrrvant?"`
`Those malicious words all poured into Shannon's ear without spilling a drop...`
`......To Shannon, it was like cold water was being poured in there.`
`".....................I, I...`
`...didn't mean..."`
`This was all whispered in secret.`
`{n}And with the same smile as before.`
`...Jessica, who could only see Eva's expression, didn't think it was anything other than Eva telling Shannon some embarrassing story about love.`
`When their secret conversation ended, Eva patted Shannon's shoulders, as though to underscore her message.`
`"Don't worry!`
` I'm sure that you'll find a partner just "perfect" for you.`
` Right?`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*.`
` ...Alright, Jessica‐chan.`
` See you later."`
`"Yeah, see you later!`
` And then, please tell me some stories about you and Uncle Hideyoshi~~!!"`
`"No waaay.`
` Ahahahahahahahahaha...!"`
`Eva laughed dryly and headed back to the entrance hall.`
`Behind Jessica, who was cheerfully waving her hand,`
` ...Shannon reflected very, very deeply on those words of Eva's, about knowing her place...`
`...I felt deep remorse for my brief moment of conceit.`
`I had forgotten.`
` I am furniture.`
`Furniture isn't human.`
`So I am a being who must feel gratitude for even being treated like a human,`
` and I am not permitted to wish for anything more.`
`Even if people develop affection for furniture that they're used to using,`
` that is an emotion on the human's side, and the furniture has no right to hope for that.`
`......They should just serve with simple honesty every day.`
`But that feeling I felt when talking with George‐sama and Jessica‐sama...is a forbidden drug for me.`
`In other words, it may have been an emotion I must not know.`
`"......Shannon.`
` You have been too distracted for a while now.`
` Are you feeling ill?"`
`"N‐no.`
` My apologies..."`
`Natsuhi's words "too distracted" were right on the mark.`
`...Even Shannon couldn't believe that she hadn't noticed Natsuhi until she had been called.`
`This was supposed to be the time when she had to concentrate on the cleaning.`
`But she had just kept sighing and hadn't accomplished anything...`
`"Even if there aren't any guests, you must always be alert.`
` Acting like this is shameful as a servant working for the Ushiromiya family."`
`"...Yes.`
` I will take care from now on..."`
`"The head and my husband will return very soon.`
` Have you finished cleaning the study?`
` Have you finished cleaning the staircase?"`
`"My, my apologies...`
` Not yet..."`
`"Yes, I know.`
` So I had Lunon do it.`
` While you were plodding around cleaning the hallway, she finished cleaning the study and the staircase."`
`"......That's because, umm,`
` ......I wanted to clean thoroughly, so it took some time......"`
`Shannon was simple and honest, so she would always carry out her tasks seriously and properly, without any omissions.`
`So she was always slow with her work.`
`In contrast, Lunon skillfully cut corners wherever they should be cut.`
`{n}So she could complete her jobs with a result that looked similar to an outsider, but in a much shorter time.`
` In other words, she was shrewd.`
`Compared to her, we should say that Shannon, who had just talked back to Natsuhi when she was already in a bad mood, was not shrewd in the slightest...`
`Of course, there was nothing that Natsuhi couldn't stand more than a servant talking back.`
`{n}Her forehead creased, and she spoke sternly.`
`And yet, her speech was slow and admonishing, which was terrifying beyond measure, and finally made Shannon realize she had said the wrong thing...`
`"In that case, you shall clean as thoroughly as you desire.`
` Shannon, I order you to clean the reception hall right now.`
` It is an important hall, where several pictures treasured by the head are displayed, and where honored guests of the Ushiromiya family are invited."`
`"Clean it thoroughly, so that not a speck of dust remains, and so that even you are satisfied.`
` Of course, you will finish today.`
` Until you finish and report to me, you will not be permitted any food or rest.`
` Understood?"`
`"Ye‐.........yes, Madam."`
`"That is good.`
` Servants should endeavor to use only those words.`
` The next time you talk back, I will give you an even more severe punishment, so keep that in mind.`
` Engrave these words in your heart."`
`"Yes, ...Madam.`
` ...Thank you for your guidance."`
`"You are welcome."`
`Natsuhi headed off down the corridor, making a gesture as if her headache was troubling her...`
`Once Shannon couldn't see her anymore, she hung her head and sighed.`
`......This happened because I let my thoughts take me.`
`I might be bad at everything I do, but I should at least be able to carry out the cleaning as well as an average person can, right?`
` I can't even do that properly—it's so pathetic it makes me cry.`
`And there's something even more pathetic.`
`Not only was I unable to perform a single bit of cleaning well,`
`{n}but just now, when Natsuhi was scolding me...`
`.........I was envisioning him appearing and rescuing me.`
`If only George‐sama had been here,`
`{n}perhaps he would have casually stepped in and saved me.`
`I'm sure he would show up cheerfully, intentionally acting like he doesn't know what's going on, nimbly change the subject, and make me forget I was ever reprimanded by Natsuhi...`
`I kept envisioning him...`
`suddenly appearing from the other side of the door...`
`or the other end of the hallway.`
`I envisioned the kind of person that would be an appropriate partner for him in a marriage meeting.`
`And I envisioned how unfitting I am for him.`
`Eva had told me that clearly.`
`{n}It had repeated endlessly through my dreams...`
`".........You're still as clumsy as always, Nee‐san.`
` Madam has been in a bad mood since this morning.`
` You spoke out of turn when you should have hung your head in silence."`
`"......Kanon‐kun..."`
`Kanon was suddenly there.`
`{n}......His footsteps were always quieter than a cat's, and he left no trace of his presence.`
`She probably wouldn't have noticed him no matter how long he stood there...`
`The expression on Kanon's face was...hatred.`
`{n}That expression he was making, he surely made for Shannon, who didn't know how to do so herself...`
`"Madam and Lunon can go to hell.`
` She knows where Madam checks, and only cleans those areas.`
` Her cleaning just now was like that.`
` I know because I was watching."`
`".........She wasn't cleaning in any real sense of the word.`
` ...She's just the worst kind of parasite, leeching off of your thorough work."`
`"You mustn't use such dirty words...`
` Dirty words pollute your clean soul, Kanon‐kun.`
` So don't use those words in front of me at least.`
` ......Alright?"`
`"............Hmph."`
`Kanon faced away, acting sulky.`
`It was a dishonest reaction, very like Kanon‐kun, ...but I was a little happy.`
`He got angry in my place.`
`"......Cleaning the reception hall will be tough.`
` I'll help."`
`"Thank you.`
` But I was the one Madam ordered, so don't worry.`
` ......Don't you also have your own work, Kanon‐kun?"`
`"...............It's a filthy job.`
` My soul was corrupted long ago."`
`Kanon then hung his head, and bit his lower lip...`
`"Just saying that you'll help is enough for me.`
` ...If you don't go back to your own job, even you will receive punishment.`
` ...And that would make me sad."`
`Shannon knew Kanon's character well.`
`{n}...Sometimes, he didn't reflect on himself.`
`If I don't refuse forcefully, he will help me even if it means neglecting his own job...`
`Kanon was a little sad that his favor had been rejected,`
` but he realized that in the end, going too far would also cause her pain, and he gave a single, small sigh.`
`"............`
` ...Fine.`
` ......Do your best, Nee‐san."`
`"Yes.`
` .........Besides, I am also partly to blame."`
`"You aren't at fault at all, Nee‐san...!"`
`"...No.`
` I am.`
` ......So go now."`
`Kanon‐kun's face showed that he still hadn't completely accepted it, but he stopped being persistent, and disappeared.`
`......Even though Kanon‐kun had given me words of comfort when I was down...`
`...Even so, I was still dejected because it hadn't been "him".`
`{n}That was, simply, a sin.`
`Far beyond any dream the likes of me could be permitted to see—know your place.`
`...Shannon, who had neglected breakfast, was already starting to feel her thoughts attenuate.`
`......But if she didn't finish cleaning the reception hall, she couldn't receive Natsuhi's permission to eat.`
`That cruel Natsuhi had surely told the kitchen of that.`
`...I have to respectfully receive Madam's punishment.`
`That's right.`
` My position in the world is furniture, ...and I had been intoxicated by a dream that is beyond me...`
`I finished cleaning the hallway and went to the reception hall.`
`Maybe hunger makes a nose more sensitive.`
`The kitchen was far away, but somehow I could smell the delicious aroma wafting from there, stimulating my empty stomach all the more.`
`...Until I finished up here, I could not get any soup.`
` I just had to prepare myself.`
`Several portraits were hung in the reception hall.`
`One of those portraits...was thought amongst the servants to hold a special meaning.`
`......It was the portrait of the witch.`
`{n}That wasn't its true name, but everyone in the mansion called it that.`
`The name of the woman with elegant blonde hair, drawn as the subject of that portrait, was {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`...It was whispered that she might be the former mistress of the family head, Kinzo.`
`{n}......And also that she was the great witch who had given Kinzo his legendary gold.`
`The witch, {f:5:Beatrice}, master of the night on Rokkenjima.`
`{n}She was gracious to those who respected her, but she would always curse those who made light of her.`
`It was in Shannon's character not to neglect rules and beliefs such as those.`
`...So she thought of the portrait of her other master as that person herself, and always treated it carefully, treasuring it.`
`...And it had become part of her daily routine to talk, inside her own head, to the witch who only existed inside the portrait.`
`......She was furniture.`
` Furniture doesn't complain.`
` Cannot complain.`
`{n}So she had no right to speak her mind about her difficult days.`
`{n}No right to open her mouth and say those words.`
`So, ......she at least spoke her mind inside her heart.`
`{n}Those words she couldn't say aloud, she spoke inside her heart, ...and protested to the formless witch.`
`Of course, the witch didn't answer.`
`{n}She never consoled, and she never laughed it off.`
`{n}......Shannon could only interpret that silence as she liked, as though the witch was at least listening attentively.`
`...{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
`......Please listen to me, worthless as I am.`
`As Shannon wiped the dust from the witch's portrait, she spoke inside her heart.`
`.........Just as Eva‐sama says, I truly am incompetent and uncultured furniture.`
`......I am not a person.`
`...So maybe I have no right to love...`
`......But in that case, why was I given a heart which can know love?`
`...Shannon paused there, and held back her tears for a time.`
`The sound of the rain which had started falling, along with the chill air in the reception hall, made her feel as though her shabbiness had increased another level.`
`"Real furniture...doesn't have a silly thing like a heart.`
` So they don't have to love people, right?`
` So they don't feel pain.`
` ......If I'm just another piece of furniture, ......why do I have a heart?"`
`".........If it's going to be this hard and this painful, ............I wish I'd never been given this stupid heart............!"`
`......I see.`
` To have given a heart to furniture.`
`Amusing games that one plays sometimes...`
`*cackle*cackle*...!`
`"e........................"`
`The witch who never answered or laughed...`
`...answered,`
` and laughed.`
`My imagination?`
` Hearing things?`
` No.`
`...After all, the next words became a "voice", and I could hear them, not with my heart, but with my ears...`
`"Humans have been continually searching for the elements that make up the world since before the Christian Era.`
` It is said that the ancient Greeks tried explaining the world with the four elements of air, fire, water, and earth."`
`"And after that, over several millennia, humans added several elements to those four,`
` trying to explain the world with a host of interpretations—the five elements, the six elements, the seven elements, the eight elements, the twelve elements—`
`but they could never explain the one true "single element"."`
`".........However, a single man appeared by the guidance of a star, and finally explained the single element that makes up the world.`
` Do you know what it is......?"`
`"...............e...`
`.........a...`
`.........wh‐`
`............wh‐who........."`
`Shannon fearfully turned around...`
`Right there, ......she "existed".`
`Not as an illusion—in reality.`
` The contrast made by the lightning made it clear that this was not just a daydream.`
`"......It is "love".`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`The witch of the portrait elegantly held a golden pipe to her mouth, and giggled.`
`...She laughed at the ignorance which caused mankind's thoughts to stray far from the most simple answer.`
`"That man explained everything in the world with love.`
` That is the single element.`
` With the smallest possible number, that man fully explained how the world was constructed."`
`"......How simple and clear, how splendid, exhilarating, pleasant and thrilling.`
` ...The year that man was born eventually came to be known as Anno Domini.`
` ......*cackle*cackle*!"`
`Shannon lost any words to speak.`
` She thought that when first meeting an unknown guest, her first words should ask that person's name.`
`But without saying anything, ...Shannon knew this person's name, so she refrained.`
`No, ......surely, as a person of this island, asking this person for her name would be the greatest disrespect.`
`Because...she was the other master of this island in addition to Kinzo.`
`"B‐.........{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama..............."`
`"Indeed.`
` I am {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` .........The face people make when they first see me hasn't changed after one thousand years.`
` ...*cackle*."`
`The witch giggled at how Shannon's reaction didn't betray her expectations.`
`Shannon realized that she had met with a being that mustn't be met with, and she took a step backwards.`
`......That's where the wall and the portrait were, so even as she gazed at the witch, she supported the witch's portrait on her back.`
`"Your worries are due to love.`
` ......Which is the single element of the world.`
` In other words, everything of this world.`
` ......When that is not whole, it means the world is not whole.`
` It is like continually scooping water into a flask with a hole in it."`
`"......Even if you scoop and scoop, it is never filled—an eternal desert of the heart.`
` The original sin that humans are founded upon and everything is made of."`
`"Understand?`
` What Adam and Eve learned when they put the fruit of knowledge to their lips was love.`
` ...Because of that, humans were chased out of Paradise and became "human".`
` Which means that what makes one human is knowing love, and suffering."`
`"......Girl of kind heart.`
` You should be proud.`
` Now that you have known it, you are no longer furniture.`
` Now, you are "human".`
` I recognize that upon my name."`
`".....................umm, .........u......"`
`"Hmph.`
` Is it hard for an inferior being to understand?`
` ...Oh, well.`
` *cackle*cackle*...`
` Forgive me.`
` It has been a long time since I have spoken with a human.`
` I shall apologize for my talkativeness."`
`Without expecting a reply from Shannon, {f:5:Beatrice} laughed pleasantly for a while.`
`"I am not sure that this is sufficient for an apology,`
` ......but I can use my power to grant that desire of yours, if you'd like?"`
`"...Huh...?"`
`The meaning of those words surprised Shannon even more than the witch's sudden appearance.`
`"I am offering to bring you and the one you love together.`
` ......Normally, I would demand something of equal value in return."`
`"...*cackle*, I am in a good mood.`
` And you have never failed to pay your respects to me in the past.`
` That is something worth rewarding."`
`"............Do, ............do you really mean it......?"`
`Normally, Shannon would have been shocked by this guest who lacked realism, and wouldn't have been able to speak.`
`......However, as though she had already been caught in the witch's trap,`
` ...Shannon responded to the witch.`
`"With my magic, it is no trouble at all to arrange for a pair of people with feelings for each other to be joined."`
`You do mean it, don't you...`
` ...Those words almost escaped Shannon's lips, but she held herself back, with her final reserves of reason.`
`A witch is a witch.`
` A sinister being.`
`The witch {f:5:Beatrice} is clearly trying to slip in through the cracks in my heart and take me prisoner......`
`That sort of temptation, which so many fairy tale picture books had warned me about when I was young, was right in front of me now.`
`"Fear too is a form of respect.`
` It may be pleasant for me, but we will make no progress this way."`
`"......I may be no different from the image of a detestable witch that you humans hold in your minds.`
` However, I respond with goodwill to those who respect me.`
` Aren't humans the same?`
` Although, I doubt any human would respond with goodwill to a hostile attitude like that..."`
`".........My, ......my apologies...`
` I didn't mean..."`
`Shannon finally realized that her hostility was rude to this guest.`
`And...she finally digested the words that had been spoken to her a short while ago.`
`― You are no longer furniture.`
` Now, you are "human".`
`......The more she reflected upon those words,`
` .......the more Shannon felt as though {f:5:Beatrice} could understand all of her suffering...`
`"......You said something...um...`
`...about a reward...`
` ......What did you mean?"`
`"I say that I can arrange for you to be bound to the man who has captured your heart.`
` You can think of it as a form of gratitude for diligently polishing my portrait all the time."`
`"................................."`
`"Calm yourself. I ask for nothing in return.`
` I am generous.`
` .........However, though I ask for nothing in return, I do have a request."`
`Look, here it comes...`
`The other Shannon inside her heart sent her a warning.`
`{n}This is what she had been so often warned of in all those scary picture books she had read when she was little......!`
`"Do you know of the small torii and shrine that have been constructed on a reef in the ocean very near this island...?"`
`...Shannon immediately remembered it.`
`{n}When you reached Rokkenjima by boat, there was a torii and a shrine on a reef which was too small to even be called an islet.`
`She had the feeling that Kumasawa had told her its history, but she couldn't remember that very well.`
`...A traveling mountaineering ascetic or someone had built it, or prayed at it, or something.`
`"...Yes, I know about it, but...`
`...what does...that.........?"`
`"I will not explain everything from square one to a person who does not know of demons.`
` To make a long story short, ......it is causing problems for me.`
` ...There is actually a certain mirror kept inside that shrine.`
` I want you to break it."`
`That was a very suspicious request.`
`Shannon didn't know its history, but anything that might be stored inside a shrine would have to be something sacred.`
`......And she wants me to break it?`
`{n}Why would someone as powerful as a witch be unable to do that herself, and be asking a human for help...?`
`There was no need for Shannon to speak her thoughts aloud.`
`{n}{f:5:Beatrice} started talking about this reasonable question before Shannon could give her answer.`
`"The magic power of that mirror opposes my own.`
` ......I cannot explain it well with human words.`
` ...By way of example, let us speak of the differences between utensils.`
` That mirror is a fork, and my power is soup.`
` You cannot drink soup with a fork, correct?"`
`"If only the imposition of that mirror were gone, I could prepare a spoon perfect for drinking soup.`
` ......If only I had that, I could drink soup, or even dig my way out of a rocky prison.`
` ...I could even scoop eyeballs out, ......is that what it was?`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"......I, .........I don't know what you are talking about.`
` ...If that is because I am uncultured, I apologize."`
`"It comes down to this.`
` If you spare the effort to break that most vexing of mirrors for me,`
` as a reward, I will grant you your wish."`
`"......I am in a very good mood today.`
` If you desire, you may change your wish, and I can give you all of the gold I bestowed upon Kinzo...`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"I, ...............I will have to decline........."`
`"......What did you say?"`
`When she heard Shannon's words, {f:5:Beatrice} realized for the first time that her expectations had been betrayed.`
`"If there is a reason, tell me.`
` If there is a misunderstanding, I shall resolve it."`
`"......I, ...I don't really know the reason.`
` .........But, ...until today, the island has been at peace, and nothing bad has happened.`
` ...So, even if I don't break the mirror, the peace that has existed until today should continue into the future."`
`"Hmm...`
` I see, I see, that is quite right.`
` It's just as you say.`
` If you don't break it, the same unbreakable days that have passed until today will continue into tomorrow, and the day after.`
` Why don't I give you an absolute guarantee?"`
`"Upon my name of {f:5:Beatrice}, I say to you:`
` {i:The same unbreakable days that have passed until today will continue into tomorrow, and the day after.}`
` And so forever, in perpetuity."`
`Shannon was seized by an eerie illusion.`
`The mirror was most likely something to restrain the witch.`
`{n}...So breaking the mirror should have been something done for the witch's sake.`
`......And yet, it felt as though Shannon had to do it for her own sake.`
`It felt like some premise had been switched...`
`"I have done nothing more than give you the opportunity to have your feelings fulfilled as a reward.`
` ......It's up to you whether you break it or not.`
` If you break it, I will grant your wish."`
`"If you do not break it, the tomorrows up until today will continue for all time.`
` Your wish will not be granted for all eternity.`
` ......Do you understand?`
` What I am saying?`
` *cackle*cackle*."`
`The witch was telling her.`
`She was pressing her, saying to break the mirror, if she wanted to be joined with George.`
`{n}And she was declaring that if she didn't break it, then her feelings would definitely never be fulfilled......`
`"...Please...stop it......`
` I don't...`
`...want to hear something like that.........!"`
`"To cause you pain was not what I wanted.`
` ......Well.`
` Feeling madness from love is the best thing about humans.`
` You should enjoy that emotion to your heart's content."`
`"However, if you wish to borrow my power, you can break that mirror at any time.`
` And you can yell my name and awaken me.`
` I will definitely keep my promise.`
` ......This way, you should have no complaints, right?`
` I won't force you to decide right now.`
` I take it that is easier for you?"`
`Was this deal ultimately something she could feel at ease with?`
`{n}......Definitely not.`
`To Shannon, who was burning with love, tormented by passion, being tempted forever by a way of escape was far too cruel a trial...`
`"I won't set a time limit on that promise,`
` ......but there is a time limit on the magic that can grant that wish.`
` ...That limit is not mine to determine.`
` It will be determined by your loved one himself.`
` .........Do you understand what I mean?"`
`"......I, I don't know."`
`"The limit is the time your loved one chooses the person he should pledge his love to.`
` ......I am a witch, but I am not a demon.`
` I possess no spell which can tear apart two who love each other, you see...?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`"I hear that your loved one will soon be attending a marriage meeting...?`
` You may have stronger feelings for that man than anyone else in the world.`
` However, that doesn't mean that you are the most appropriate for him, does it...?"`
`"I {i:know} who he will be having the marriage meeting with.`
` That girl is {i:the most suitable for Ushiromiya George} in the entire world."`
`"She came from a good school, achieved good grades, and has composure and prudence."`
`"She is more beautiful than you, wiser than you, {i:more suitable than you}."`
`"Why would an ignorant, incompetent, uncultured girl like you be suitable?`
` You know better than anyone.`
` You are the most unsuitable!"`
`"Even imagining that you and Ushiromiya George could be joined is sinful, and foolish, foolish foolish know your place!!"`
`"Have you forgotten to be grateful for your schooling?`
` Know your place."`
`"George is the eldest grandson carrying Father's blood.`
` He's a person who may bear the burden of the Ushiromiya family someday in the future."`
`"To answer that expectation, he has studied tirelessly, entered a wonderful college, and is getting wonderful grades.`
` Do you reeeally think you're in his league, you incompetent, unqualified, uncultured seeerrrrvant?"`
`"*giggle*giggle*, *cackle*cackle*cackle*ahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!!"`
`"Sto‐............stop it, don't bully Shannon!!`
` Who the hell are you?!!"`
`At that time, as Shannon held her head, trying to protect her heart from the blade of {f:5:Beatrice}'s words, Kanon ran in front of her.`
`Kanon didn't care who this woman was.`
`{n}As long as he knew she was an enemy tormenting Shannon, who he loved and respected as a sister, nothing else mattered.`
`".........Kanon‐kun—`
`stay back...!`
` This person is......!"`
`"................................."`
`It seemed that Kanon also realized that the being standing before him was the witch of the portrait.`
`...And also that she was a terrifying being.`
`"......I just wanted to make Shannon take her reward, but it seems I said too much, and ended up tormenting her.`
` I shall apologize."`
`"......But I will leave that promise as a reward to you.`
` If you need my power, call me at any time.`
` I have already told you how."`
`".........Well then, with that, let us disperse for tonight.`
` Hostile gazes may be pleasant, but they are bad for the figure, you see?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*..."`
`"Beat it...!!`
` I don't know who you are, but you're threatening Shannon!`
` Don't ever show yourself again!!"`
`It seemed that Kanon's words made the witch horribly displeased.`
`"......So, you do not choose your words carefully, lowborn?`
` ...I am gracious to those who respect me, but brutal to those who do not..."`
`While she still smiled, the witch's expression began to warp...`
`And an oppressive feeling that couldn't be described with any of the five senses gradually filled the room...`
`Even though they couldn't comprehend what it was, they immediately realized it to be something terrifying...`
`If you were swimming in the ocean, and something large went by in the water beneath you, you would want to escape to the land even before you learned what it was.`
` ...This was the same as that!`
`"Ple‐......please stop, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama!!`
` Kanon‐kun is still a child.`
` I apologize for his language!"`
`"..........................."`
`"........................!"`
`Kanon blocked the way to Shannon at the risk of his life.`
`{n}...There was tense sweat on his forehead.`
`In that moment, the witch certainly had Kanon's fate in her clutches.`
`{n}...She didn't even need to move a finger.`
`She had Kanon's fate so readily in her grasp that she could crush it completely with a single twist of her own smile...`
`Kanon also understood that.`
`{n}Which is why he was sweating,`
` and his knees felt weak...`
`However, {f:5:Beatrice} abruptly released that feeling of tension, and laughed.`
`".........Very well.`
` At your request, I will grant him special pardon.`
` ...Kanon, is it?`
` In deference to her, I shall forgive you tonight and send you off.`
` Be thankful.`
` Well then, we will disperse for tonight."`
`"............In parting, I shall leave a single souvenir.`
` Hold out the palms of your left hands, you two."`
`{f:5:Beatrice} grinned broadly, and snapped her fingers,`
` whereupon their left hands stretched out in front of them, and their palms opened, against their will.`
`It was a strange sensation, as though only their left hands had become someone else's.`
`It felt like their left hands alone had become puppets,`
` pulled by strings hanging down from the ceiling.`
`"Wh‐what......`
`do you think you're doing...?!"`
`Kanon resisted, but he couldn't take back the freedom of his left hand.`
`"Don't struggle.`
` It will not take long."`
`{f:5:Beatrice} held her pipe aloft, and from inside the smoke, gold‐colored sparkling dust hovered in the air.`
`......That glitter eventually became several gold butterflies.`
`The beautiful butterflies danced freely throughout the reception hall, creating a fantastical and beautiful world.`
`...And two of those butterflies alighted on the palms of Shannon's and Kanon's hands.`
`"?!"`
`"Ouch...!"`
`There was a sharp pain, as though they had been burned.`
`{n}When the two of them tried to examine their palms, there was no trace left of that inability to move their bodies, which had been there until a second ago.`
`".........Ah, ......a bruise...?`
` What is......"`
`On the palm of her hand, a small burn mark had been made, the size of a pea.`
`...Furthermore, it was shaped like a butterfly...`
`"Wha‐...what is this supposed to be..."`
`Apparently, Kanon had the same bruise on his hand.`
` He stared at the witch hatefully.`
`"It is a simple greeting.`
` I have no hidden motive.`
` ...It is nothing more than a bruise, so it will heal in just a few days.`
` It requires no treatment.`
` That is a mark so that tomorrow, you will not forget that I truly was here, and that I made a promise with you."`
`"............The impact of a meeting with me is strong.`
` ...Sometimes, at the next morning, people try to think of their meeting with me as a dream or an illusion.`
` ............You should think slowly and carefully, Shannon.`
` ...And you should probably take a good rest, look at my mark tomorrow morning, and try thinking again."`
`"I shall not force you into anything.`
` You should freely decide your future, by your own will.`
` .........However, to think that the object of your desire can be granted for such meager compensation...`
` It would annoy the great artists who write plays about blighted love to no end.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`"Well then, let us meet again when the chance arises.`
` It truly was entertaining to have a conversation again after so much time.`
` Farewell, furniture.`
` Ahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!"`
`{f:5:Beatrice}'s body crumbled like smoke and blew away.`
`...It was golden smoke—no, a flight of golden butterflies.`
`They scattered in all directions inside the reception hall, ...leaving a golden mist behind as they disappeared into thin air.`
`......After that, only the cold silence was left.`
`The extreme silence was enough to make both of them think that they might have been daydreaming until just a moment ago...`
`...Which is why the witch had left it.`
`{n}She had left a mark to make it impossible for them to think that this was a daydream.`
`As Shannon and Kanon thought back on the butterfly bruises on their hands, and the pain they had felt when those had been left,`
` they stood there for some time, stunned and motionless...`
`And from that day on...`
`......Shannon was tormented by days of suffering and conflict.........``"Eeeeeeeeeh?!`
` What do you mean "separate rooms"?!`
` Then, Shannon, you and George nii‐san stayed in different rooms on purpose?!"`
`"Ye‐......yes...`
` umm, ......was it that strange a thing to do......?"`
`Since Jessica's cheeks had been stuffed with chocolate‐coated chinsukou biscuit that Shannon had brought as a souvenir from Okinawa,`
` it all flew out at Shannon when Jessica cried out...`
`"...Sha‐Shannon, why did you even go on a trip up to Okinawa then...?`
` And even alone with George nii‐san!"`
`"That's because... I mean... Since there's a very big aquarium in Okinawa, I was invited to go and...`
`I...like fish and stuff..."`
`"No, I mean, like...!!`
` This is a young couple going on an overnight trip, right?!`
` And you're saying there weren't even any hugs and kisses?!`
` To say nothing of the fact that the guy and girl were staying in different rooms!!"`
`"As for ki‐kisses, no comment.`
` ...ah, but we did hug, though...?`
` George‐san's chest was warm..."`
`"That's not the point!!`
` Aah, geez!`
` Why do couples like this exist?!`
` Aaah, geez!!`
` It's so damn irritating!"`
`From Shannon's perspective, a lot of things had happened and it seemed to have been a very happy trip,`
` but it looked like the missed opportunity had left Jessica feeling greatly unfulfilled.`
`For a while, Jessica chewed on her souvenir,`
` writhing on her bed as she complained about their romance.`
`Shannon and George had chosen to go to Okinawa because there was a huge aquarium there.`
`That was because their first meeting had revolved around an aquarium.`
`Since they had started at an aquarium, having their first overnight trip also be to an aquarium must have held some commemorative value.`
`"This was your special commemorative trip, your turning point!`
` Your first overnight trip!!`
` Shouldn't there have been all kinds of progress?!"`
`"And yet!`
` Separate rooms for the guy and girl?!`
` A couple taking two single rooms?!`
` Aah, geez, really, what's wrong with you?!"`
`"...Err, umm, ......but we're both single...`
` ...George‐san says that respecting boundaries is good manners between men and women......."`
`"For hell's sake, this overnight trip was so you could overcome that, wasn't it?!`
` You're not at the stage of mere hugs and kisses any more!"`
`"Mi‐Milady, I don't know what you mean by that, but...`
` Geor‐...George‐sama was a real gentleman with me until the end."`
`"That is, I mean,`
` ......I also...`
`wondered if those things would happen, you know,`
` ...but we, we may be going out, but...`
`I mean, it, it's not as if we are married or anything..."`
`"The kind of things you seem to be expecting, Milady,`
` ......I mean, we must do so only after we properly make a vow in front of God, and, umm,`
` ......ww...we mustn't...`
` au."`
`Shannon's face was bright red.`
`{n}She was restlessly fidgeting, making a circle with both hands, then a chain link, continually intertwining, separating and making heart shapes with them.`
`Apparently, the dramatic progress Jessica had looked forward to hadn't happened,`
` but it seemed that it had been a very important experience for Shannon in her own way.`
`...So in the end, no matter how much Jessica envied Shannon or made fun of her, it didn't change the fact that Shannon had a huge lead on her.`
`"Aah, I want a boyfriend toooo!!`
` I can't believe you beat me to it!!`
` We promised we'd get boyfriends at the same time but you snuck ahead and beat meeee,`
` aarrrrrrgh!"`
`"U‐umm...`
` Milady, you are a wonderful person, so I'm sure you'll find someone even more wonderful than I did, before long..."`
`"Don't try to console me!!`
` Shannon, you traitor, get outta here, you suuuuck!!`
` *cough*cough*, *cough*cough*cough*!!"`
`Jessica threw several cushions at her.`
`{n}But midway, she had an asthma attack and started to cough pretty badly.`
`Shannon hurriedly ran over to her and took a look on top of the nearby side table.`
`An adorable basket was placed there, and inside of it was Jessica's inhaler.`
`Shannon picked it up and handed it over to Jessica.`
`Jessica's asthma attacks always came suddenly.`
` Because of this, she had to carry this medicine around with her at all times.`
`She breathed in the medicine, and after some time spent holding back her coughing, her asthma finally settled down.`
`Shannon thought this a good chance to leave, bowed courteously, and made to exit the room...`
`As she did, one more small cushion came flying and hit Shannon on the head.`
`She looked around, and saw that Jessica was on the verge of crying, half of her face buried in her last and favorite cushion.`
` That face was red and meek...`
`"......Mi‐Milady......?"`
`"Sha‐......Shannon...`
` ...Be honest with me...`
` .........Is my...`
`.........hairdo and stuff...strange...?"`
`"What are you saying...`
` I think that your hair is very beautiful."`
`"Then, ...then then, are my eyes strange, or maybe my nose?`
` ...Or is it the way I talk after all......?`
` Is that why I can't get a boyfriend......?"`
`"Of course not.`
` Milady, you are wonderful enough as you are.`
` And I think that your charm will keep on increasing more and more."`
`"......But, it's only me who can't get a boyfriend...`
` Saku and Hina managed to find one, but I can't, I'm the only one......`
` Is it because I don't have any charm after all......?`
` You know, everyone's gonna be bringing their boyfriend along to the cultural festival......"`
`"I was so sure I'd have a boyfriend by then, I've been grandstanding about it...`
` .........But I can't get a boyfriend to save my life.`
` I'm the only one, the only one......."`
`Before she realized it, Jessica was shedding huge tears.`
`Jessica hadn't really planned on crying, and of course, she felt like supporting Shannon's progress in love as a friend.`
`...However, as she had made fun of Shannon, her true feelings had suddenly gotten mixed in, and the tears had just poured out on their own...`
`...Shannon understood Jessica's innocent and easily injured heart.`
`Jessica's usual rough style of speech...`
`was all just an attempt to protect her own easily injured heart.`
`......As a daughter and successor to the Ushiromiya family, and as a girl isolated on Rokkenjima, the only person she could expose her true feelings to was Shannon.`
`Shannon understood that.`
`{n}So, ...she strongly regretted feeling a little too self‐satisfied.`
`"...S‐.........sorry...`
` Crying like this, I'm weird.`
` Sorry......*sniffle*."`
`"You are a wonderful person, Milady.`
` There is no way that a nice man won't appear for you..."`
`".........Sha‐Shannon, it's about time for you, right?`
` If you don't go soon, Genji‐san and Mom are gonna yell at you.`
` I'm totally fine, so get going...!`
` Heheh, sorry for crying like this.`
` ......I'm such a moron."`
`Jessica faced away as if to show she wasn't looking for attention,`
` and waved her hand as though to drive Shannon away.`
`Shannon took that as a sign that she didn't want to be badgered any more,`
` bowed her head, and left the room...`
`When her footsteps disappeared into the distance, Jessica lay down on her bed, still hugging the cushion.`
`...Her expression was still a little meek, with tears in her eyes,`
` ...but for the first time in a long time, she had a very, very quiet and honest conversation with her heart.`
`"I also...`
`.........want to fall...`
`in love..."`
`As Shannon watered the flower beds in the garden in high spirits, she sensed someone's presence.`
`She turned around, thinking that if one of the family had come to visit, she must greet them,`
` ......and what she saw was that witch.`
`"B‐......{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama........."`
`"It's been quite some time.`
` How are you?`
` Has your relationship with your special person progressed since last time?"`
`As {f:5:Beatrice} sat on the rose arch, she happily blew on her pipe.`
`Sitting in a place like that would crush the roses,`
` and it might have been dangerous if you fell off the arch, ...but after all, this was a witch.`
`That was surely an unnecessary concern.`
`"...Ye‐yes.`
` Thanks to you, ...it's going smoothly."`
`"Naturally; my magic is instantaneous.`
` ...You may even be feeling as if your meeting was a predetermined fate.`
` But that isn't correct; don't think for a moment this has anything to do with fate."`
`"......I, ......I understand that."`
`The witch was calling attention to something.`
` Two things, actually.`
`That originally, her relationship with George had been completely impossible.`
`{n}......And that her magic power was so great, it could manipulate that fate.`
`Shannon had become swept up in these sweet days, and had started to fall under the illusion that all fate was revolving around her.`
`...But the witch's words made her remember.`
`Her relationship with George had originally been impossible,`
` .........no, might also be impossible in the future as well...`
`"...*cackle*cackle*, sorry, sorry.`
` It's just like a doctor.`
` Even though you rely on them when you worry about your health, after you're healed, you forget even to thank them.`
` ......Witches have never known thanks, so I couldn't help acting a little rudely.`
` Forgive me."`
`".........I have never forgotten my feelings of gratitude.`
` ...I was able to achieve happiness thanks to your power, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` ......And without that power, George‐sama and I would have had no fate together.`
` ...I have never forgotten that."`
`"Sorry, sorry.`
` This was not my intent; I didn't come here to bully you.`
` Talking rudely is just my personality.`
` Do forgive me."`
`"...More importantly, I heard it through the grapevine...!`
` You two went on a little private trip.`
` I'm sure it was quite fun."`
`"Y‐yes!`
` It was very, umm, ...fun."`
`Shannon's face suddenly grew bright.`
`{n}The witch laughed lightly, as though that transformation was worth money.`
`"Already the person of your thoughts is no longer an object of one‐sided love.`
` You are a pair of lovers now.`
` ......To a pair filled with love, that alone is all they need in the world.`
` A wonderful, ideal world, so to speak?`
` Huhuhuhuhu!`
` Even witches would be jealous."`
`{f:5:Beatrice} laughed pleasantly.`
`{n}That smile was without a trace of malice, making her look as though she blessed the lovers' secret meeting from the bottom of her heart.`
`After that day, {f:5:Beatrice} had shown herself before Shannon every once in a while.`
`Even now, Shannon still thought of her as a creepy being.`
`...However, she was also hugely indebted to this person for bestowing the magic that had given her the relationship she had with George.`
`So Shannon was trying with all her might not to be surprised or scared.`
`"Oh, ...oh, yes.`
` ......Umm, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` I bought some confectionery as a souvenir from our trip.`
` ...Would you, umm, ......like some?"`
`"Hoh???`
` A souvenir for a witch.........?"`
`It seemed that even the witch who boasted of living for one thousand years hadn't been able to predict that she would receive a souvenir from a pair of sweet lovers.`
`When she saw that surprised expression, Shannon thought of the witch as a friend for the first time.`
`"Hohoh, Oriental cookies made from wheat flour and lard.`
` To wrap that in chocolate in the Western fashion is truly a blending of Japanese and Western style—the Silk Road of confectionery."`
`".........What?`
` What's so funny?"`
`"N‐...nothing.`
` My apologies."`
`This mysterious witch, who surely held a terrifying power,`
` was chomping down on the treats one after another, making a sound like a squirrel stuffing walnuts into its mouth.`
` After a while, Shannon couldn't conceal her laughter.`
`"Hmm, a fine treat.`
` ......I should serve you some Dolce Vita from Nero one of these days.`
` Roses are the symbol of eternal love.`
` I believe a rose dolce would be appropriate for you now."`
`The witch was in a great mood, having enjoyed the modern treats to the full.`
`"Umm, .........here.`
` I truly can't thank you enough.`
` I believe you have done more than enough for me already, so I'm returning this."`
`The thing that Shannon had softly set on the table was a gold‐colored butterfly brooch.`
`"There is no need to return it.`
` If you continue holding that, your relationship should remain firm in perpetuity."`
`"......I may have been given the chance to meet him through the power of magic.`
` But I think the effort that will make that encounter eternal should come from the two of us cooperating together."`
`"Hmm.`
` ......So love, too, is like a rose.`
` Too much fertilizer causes the roots to rot.`
` Some flowers cannot be raised without hard work.`
` In that case, do as you wish.`
` You may keep it in a box, rather than on your person.`
` That is my goodwill, given to you.`
` It would not please me to have it returned."`
`"Ah, ......my, my apologies...!`
` That's not what I..."`
`"*cackle*cackle*.`
` No harm has been done.`
` That brooch is already yours.`
` If you treasure that as proof of our friendship, that would comfort me a little."`
`"You may hold on to it, and gain its benefits.`
` You may also keep it in a box.`
` If you wish, you are even free to give it to another who is worrying about love.`
` ......But you should regard it as important.`
` It would certainly pain my heart if you did not take care of it."`
`According to {f:5:Beatrice}, she had appeared several times in the past in response to a person's summons so that she could give them an item imbued with some kind of magical power.`
`...However, most of them, after they used that power to resolve their worries,`
` would quickly come to think of that power as creepy, and, forgetting their feelings of thanks, they would throw away the items they had been given with disgust.`
`"Which is why I haven't often received thanks for my good will.`
` ......Let's see, is this the first time?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*."`
`The witch laughed heartily, but it looked like a sad laugh to Shannon's eyes.`
`She herself had been like that in the past—no, maybe she was still like that now.`
`{f:5:Beatrice} was definitely a witch, with a strange and terrifying power.`
`Most likely, no one would go along with her if they could help it.`
`And even though on occasion they had relied on her strange power, it had undoubtedly resulted in fear more often than gratitude.`
`.........It must have deeply hurt the witch when that repeated over and over.`
`From the moment that she realized this,`
` ...Shannon decided to stop being frightened of {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`That had surely tormented her for over a thousand years...`
`Maybe she really liked the treats.`
` {f:5:Beatrice}, who normally spoke abusively, praised the black tea that Shannon served her, and looked to be in remarkably high spirits.`
`On such terms, the witch and the servant grew animated talking about the trip with George.`
`Shannon didn't know much about {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`First off, she was a ghost‐like being who appeared in unexpected places at unexpected times.`
`{n}And it seemed that not everyone could perceive that she was there.`
`It seemed that each person had something called a wavelength, and that there was a great amount of individual variation in people's ability to perceive the witch.`
`Only Shannon and Kanon could interact with her enough to exchange words like this.`
`...There were a few people who could sense her presence, but most people couldn't even feel that much.`
`From what {f:5:Beatrice} said, Krauss and his wife in particular had zero magical talent.`
` And no matter how much she followed them around, they would never notice her.`
`Previously, when Shannon had messed up and Natsuhi had gotten really mad at her, {f:5:Beatrice} had started playing around, hitting Natsuhi on the head with her pipe.`
`...Indeed, Natsuhi seems completely oblivious.`
`{n}But Shannon, watching that, had burst out laughing without thinking, and had gotten scolded even more.`
`"Then, ......what about the Master?`
` I hear that he has been doing research in magic, so I'm sure he would be able to notice you, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama."`
`"............Kinzo is the same.`
` There is no one with a more pitiful lack of magical talent.`
` ...It's the blood.`
` He has so little talent, he is worthy of sympathy."`
`"..................?"`
`As soon as they started talking about Kinzo, it felt like the atmosphere around {f:5:Beatrice} changed.`
`She had spoken about Krauss and the rest's lack of magic talent as though she looked down on them, but she spoke of Kinzo in a different way.`
`Anyone connected to the Ushiromiya family would know about Kinzo's Legend of the Gold.`
`{n}...According to the legend, Kinzo had summoned the witch {f:5:Beatrice}, and had been conferred gold.`
`...In short, that implied she had some kind of relationship with Kinzo.`
`"So, you see, ......he attained that level despite not having a single scrap of talent.`
` ...It was through frenzied solitary study that he reached the tier of mage."`
`"That's.........something really incredible, right......?"`
`"......Mmhm."`
`The witch, who usually looked down on people, was unexpectedly praising someone.`
`...While she lambasted Kinzo, calling him talentless, she praised his efforts.`
`"And then, .........the Master summoned you with the power of magic......"`
`"Mmhm.`
` ......Well, I only answered the summons on a whim.`
` In this period where magic has long been denied, there I saw a being, without a scrap of talent, giving it his all.`
` It was just my luck that I'd decide to come and laugh at him.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*."`
`The words "just my luck"...showed that this had been a disaster for her.`
`Shannon hesitated over whether it would be alright to encourage her to continue, but {f:5:Beatrice} continued on her own, ignoring Shannon.`
`"The format and rules were all there, at least.`
` He'd mixed up a few of the procedures, but, well, in deference to his enthusiasm, I generously responded to his contract.`
` ......And I gave him a mountain of gold."`
`"Then the Master...used that gold and succeeded in business, and grew his wealth into what it is today."`
`"Mm. His talent in magic was nothing, but it seems he had talent in business and gambling.`
` ...Or was it because of his bravery and madness to stake everything on irrational bets?`
` ......Madness sometimes brings about magic.`
` Yes, if I look at it that way, maybe I can't really say that Kinzo had absolutely no magical talent.`
` *cackle*cackle*..."`
`Shannon felt like she was daydreaming.`
`While everyone in the Ushiromiya family knew of the story that Kinzo had delved into sorcery, summoned a witch, and been given gold, in actuality, it was all rambling that no one believed in.`
`And now the witch herself was telling her that it was true...`
`{n}Shannon felt a little flustered at this insane secret that only she knew.`
`"Then Kinzo, who had obtained a vast fortune, satisfied his every dream that could be granted in the human world.`
` .........And finally, he sought the truth of the world."`
`"The truth...of the world?"`
`"...The single element that makes up the world.`
` Kinzo, who had achieved everything one can obtain in the human world, wanted that, the final desire humans seek."`
`The single element.`
` .........She felt like she had heard the witch say those words before.`
`When {f:5:Beatrice} saw Shannon trying to remember what that was, she smiled awkwardly, waving her hand and saying there was no need to remember.`
`"......I underestimated Kinzo a trifle.`
` I truly hadn't thought that he would display such power."`
`"......And thanks to that, I'm in this state.`
` I've been sewn in place on this island for several decades now, without even a friend to drink tea with.`
` ...My voice reaches none I call out to, and I cannot go anywhere.`
` Such boring decades."`
`As she laughed in self‐derision, she tapped her teacup with her finger.`
` It made the clear sound of porcelain.`
`...Shannon didn't know whether the word "self‐derision" was really an accurate expression to describe the look on the witch's face.`
`Shannon didn't understand everything, but she could more or less figure out the situation.`
`{n}...And it was surely a topic that she should not press the witch on lightly, unless the witch started talking about it herself.`
`To sum up everything she had said up until now...`
`{f:5:Beatrice}, who had been summoned by Kinzo's magic, could not leave this island for some reason.`
` And she had lost her power and her form, living her days in boredom.`
`During that time, her words had reached Shannon, who never forgot to strongly respect the witch.`
` And she had made Shannon help her to regain her power, even if only a little bit of it.`
`...As a result, she had become able to drink tea with Shannon like this...`
`"......{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, what in the world was that mirror you told me to break?"`
`"Aaah, that topic.`
` .........It seems that a lot of things happened on the islands around this area, in the distant past.`
` Bad things gathered due to that, attracting bad distortions.`
` It seems that a traveling Eastern mage or someone built a shrine for the repose of souls and sealed them in there."`
`"...That in itself had nothing to do with me, but unfortunately the foundation of that magical power was different.`
` It created a strong interference with my own magic, and was extremely bothersome."`
`"Is that how it was...?`
` I just assumed that it had been sealing you, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama..."`
`"I was not its target.`
` But it was a divine mirror.`
` As a result, my power was sealed away."`
`"......If I were to use food as an example, maybe it would go something like this.`
` Let's say that I have ordered some Western cuisine, which is being made in the kitchen.`
` However, when it comes time for it to be served, the seating is in the Japanese style, and Japanese tableware has been laid out."`
`"So the kitchen is unable to take out the plate which would be out of place, and no matter how long I wait, my Western food won't arrive—something like that."`
`"So I had you destroy that Japanese‐style seating, and return the area to a blank slate for a time.`
` Thanks to that, the meal I had ordered was finally delivered, and my power came back, you could say.`
` However, so far, only the aperitif has arrived."`
`"It will still be quite some time before the main dish.`
` As I am now, I'm even more faint than a fairy in a shoe store."`
`".........pf...`
`...ahahahahahahaha."`
`"Mh.`
` What's so funny?"`
`"Nothing...`
` I was just thinking witches' analogies are so interesting.`
` I never thought you could use food as an analogy to talk about magic."`
`"I had thought it to be a skillful description, if I do say so myself, and I certainly did not imagine it would be laughed at.`
` I feel a little offended."`
`A slightly sulky expression rose to the witch's face.`
`{n}...It would not have been a strange expression at all to see appear on the face of two friends as they enjoyed their tea.`
`"......Although I may not look it, I was known for doing extremely brutal things in the past.`
` ...I've gotten soft.`
` Now I can even have a foolish discussion while drinking tea with a human."`
`She was probably talking to herself.`
`{n}As {f:5:Beatrice} gazed at the sea birds tracing the horizon, she put her tea to her lips again.`
`"...The clouds have come out.`
` When the ocean loses its brilliance, it's nothing more than a gray puddle."`
`"You think so?`
` ......I think the ocean is a beautiful deep blue, even if it gets cloudy."`
`"............Hmph."`
`Maybe the witch had noticed the deep meaning behind Shannon's words.`
`...She laughed lightly and set down her empty teacup.`
`"......It seems that those things buried in your eyes aren't black pebbles anymore.`
` So?`
` ......Do you understand the feeling of furniture being reborn as a human?"`
`"...............Yes.`
` ...I didn't know that the world was this kind."`
`Since her relationship with George had begun, Shannon's face had grown brighter more often.`
`Her smile had made everything go smoothly, and had even changed her luck.`
`......Shannon made fewer mistakes in her work than she had before, and the family members' opinion of her was starting to change slightly.`
`Just the other day, Krauss, who rarely exchanged words with her, had suddenly started talking to her, surprising her.`
`"You've been making a good smile more often lately, haven't you?`
` Has something good happened?"`
`"N‐no...`
` But......every day is fun, yes."`
`"Hmph.`
` Isn't that good to hear.`
` Coffee is obviously more delicious if it's poured with a smile.`
` ......Could I ask for another cup, with that smile again?"`
`"Ye‐......yes!"`
`That had become a chance for Shannon to gain confidence in herself.`
`Of course, it didn't go beyond her own heart, and it wasn't so big a change that everyone could see it.`
`...But she had begun to change, bit by bit.`
`Shannon understood it clearly.`
` To know love was to gain a soul.`
` ...And therefore, to be born again from furniture to a human.`
`There was absolutely nothing mistaken in {f:5:Beatrice}'s words.`
`{n}......By knowing love, Shannon had learned what it was to be human.`
`"......These have been unusual snacks.`
` It was time well spent.`
` It's probably about time for you to return to your work.`
` Let us end our tea party now."`
`"......After all, it seems there are some who dislike your drinking tea with me, you see?"`
`"Huh?"`
`The witch gripped a teaspoon and flipped it with her fingers, sending it up in the air.`
`...Then, it was flicked by the fingers of some invisible person in empty space, and flew straight into a bush close nearby.`
`The bush moved violently, and Kanon came out.`
`{n}......It seemed that he had been there for some time, and had been watching their tea party.`
`The spoon was gripped in his hand.`
`{n}...If he had not been able to catch it by reflex, it might have hit him hard in the forehead and caused him to start oozing blood.`
`"..........................."`
`"Calm yourself.`
` Our tea party is over now, Kanon."`
`"How long were you there?`
` If you had called to us, I'd have poured you some tea too..."`
`"I imagine that you didn't want to interrupt a pair of women talking, right?`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`".................."`
`Kanon kept silent, but it seemed that there was a slightly hostile look in his eyes.`
`...On the outside, he acted respectfully.`
` But unlike Shannon, Kanon did not trust the witch.`
` {f:5:Beatrice} rapped the table with her pipe, and the tea set turned into gold butterflies, which flew upwards in unison.`
`They scattered in every direction, and the cleanup was already done.`
`"It was fun, Shannon.`
` ...Let us meet again if the chance arises.`
` ......My magical power is still quite lacking.`
` It's tiring even to show myself."`
`"......If it tires you that much, never appear again."`
`Kanon had said it in a small voice, but it seemed the witch had heard it perfectly.`
`She giggled, but did not reply.`
`"Shannon.`
` Tell me more about George at our next tea party.`
` There are no snacks sweeter than a person's love life.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*.`
` I bid you farewell."`
`{f:5:Beatrice}'s body also became gold butterflies, which scattered in all directions and disappeared.`
`...It was a very fantastical and beautiful scene, like a blizzard of gold leaf.`
`For a while, Shannon quietly watched the witch's exit...`
`{n}Kanon approached her from behind, and spoke with a very different expression on his face than his sister's.`
`".........Nee‐san, didn't I tell you that you shouldn't hang around with her?"`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama isn't that bad of a person.`
` ...Yes, she might be a little strange, but—"`
`"The fact that only we can see her is suspicious enough...`
` She isn't human.`
` Who knows what she's planning."`
`"Kanon‐kun, I think that's a little rude."`
`Shannon spoke seriously, which was unusual for her.`
`{n}...To Kanon, who knew her well, it must have seemed extremely serious.`
`Kanon showed almost excessive surprise at Shannon's style of speech, and remained silent.`
`"It's true that {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama is different from humans.`
` She has a terrifying power, so I think she is to be feared and respected.`
` ...But I think it's really rude to loathe her just for the single reason that she's different from a human."`
`"............I know what you're trying to say, Nee‐san.`
` ...You've changed since she gave you that brooch.`
` It's like you're the witch's prisoner.`
` She mediated your relationship with George‐sama, and now you're indebted to her."`
`"...Don't say things like that."`
`"She isn't human.`
` We don't know what she's thinking.`
` You mustn't trust her.`
` .........And we aren't humans either,`
` Nee‐san."`
`Kanon's words became more serious.`
` ...Those words probably gouged at Shannon's heart.`
` Shannon bit her lower lip and hung her head.`
`"We are furniture.`
` ...Even if we receive names and are treated as humans, that won't change how we were born."`
`You are no longer furniture...`
`Those words {f:5:Beatrice} had given her, which had made her happiest of all, floated through Shannon's mind...`
`"I am not...`
`......furniture."`
`"No, you are.`
` We are less than human.`
` ......Nee‐san, you're acting like you've forgotten that, ...and you're just pretending to be human.`
` You should understand that yourself."`
`"I'm......not furniture.`
` ...I'm human...!"`
`"No, you aren't human.`
` From the beginning, we have been unqualified to love or be loved."`
`It seemed that Kanon's criticisms had shifted focus from Shannon's interactions with the witch.`
`...Shannon also noticed that quickly.`
`"I heard from Milady.`
` Seriously, what were you thinking?`
` I can't believe that you would go on a trip with George‐sama...!`
` You've forgotten your place as furniture.`
` You've just been tempted by that witch, and mistakenly believe that you became human!"`
`"Listen, Kanon‐kun.`
` ............We certainly are furniture.`
` Lesser beings, inferior to humans."`
`"...But if we were to gain the missing remainder...`
`...wouldn't that mean we'd have become human?"`
`"......That couldn't happen."`
`"No, it could.`
` If we can gain that, we won't be furniture.`
` We can become human."`
`"..................`
` .........Ridiculous.`
` ...As if we......could."`
`Kanon spat that out, ...but weakly, and turned away.`
`That was probably...resignation.`
` ......The baptism of days upon days of suffering being furniture had firmly sealed his heart...`
`"...You can too, Kanon‐kun.`
` ......You can become a normal human."`
`"...........................`
` Stop it, that's the witch talking."`
`"That's right.`
` {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama taught me.`
` ......By gaining the single element of the world, we can become human."`
`"No—nobody's human without that.`
` ......That's why people spend their entire lives trying to gain that single element."`
`"I have no idea what you're talking about, Nee‐san.`
` I don't want to listen to rambling."`
`"Then I'll teach you in a way you can understand.`
` .........Look, see what I'm pointing at?"`
`"......?"`
`Shannon pointed straight at the sea, at the horizon.`
`Kanon didn't understand what she was actually pointing at, and couldn't do anything except look between the horizon and Shannon's expression, which looked like it was posing a riddle.`
`"The ocean.`
` ......Kanon‐kun, what color does the ocean look to you?"`
`It was an all too simple question.`
`Kanon tried to guess the meaning behind that question for a while,`
` but since he couldn't think of anything, he gave his answer straightforwardly.`
`"...It's an uninspiring dark gray.`
` So what?"`
`Objectively speaking, the sea, laid out beneath a cloudy sky, could probably be described best by Kanon's words.`
`......But as Shannon closed her eyes and smiled, she shook her head slightly.`
`"It looks deep blue to me."`
`"......Is that what you mean?`
` Like {c:86EF9C:using the word {ruby:blue:"{i:ao}"} for a green traffic light}?"`
`"No.`
` ......The ocean is deep blue.`
` If I can see that, and you can't,`
` ...then...that's exactly the reason..."`
`Kanon bit his lower lip and was silent for a while.`
`"........................`
` .........I.........can't see it."`
`"Kanon‐kun,`
` ......stick out your hand?"`
`As Kanon stood bewildered, unable to understand what she was saying, she took his arm, and opened the palm of his hand.`
`Shannon softly set something there.`
`It was that magic brooch, which she had received from {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`{n}The magic charm, shaped like a gold butterfly, which could fulfill love.`
`"This is...`
`.........her......"`
`"No, this is mine.`
` ...So think of it as me and treat it with respect, okay?"`
`"....................."`
`After being told that, he couldn't just throw it away.`
`{n}Kanon didn't know what he should do, and he stood there confused for a while, the brooch still on the palm of his hand.`
`Shannon put the palm of her hand on top of Kanon's, and the brooch was warmed by both of their hands.`
`"This charm holds true magical power.`
` ......I'm sure that it will teach you an important emotion, Kanon‐kun."`
`"...There is nothing her magic can teach me."`
`"No, there is.`
` ......So wear it.`
` If that's embarrassing, I hear it's okay if you just hide it in your pocket."`
`"............Ridiculous...`
` As if I'd be led astray by her magic."`
`Even as he said that, Kanon couldn't be cold‐hearted towards something Shannon was pressing on him.`
`In the end, Kanon agreed reluctantly to take it,`
` saying he'd prove that he wouldn't surrender to the witch's power.`
` Shannon smiled and nodded back.`
`"I'm sure you can learn something important from it.`
` ......And I'm sure you can become human.`
` And when you do, I'm sure that this ocean will look a beautiful blue to you as well."`
`"...Gray is gray no matter how many times you look."`
`"That's wrong, Kanon‐kun.`
` ......It only looks like that because you have no{0}{nobreak:{m:-5:——}—}."`
`"Huh...?"`
`Because of the howling wind, he hadn't been able to catch the critical part of what she'd just said.`
`So Shannon said it once more.`
`...The single element of the world.`
` She spoke once more of a world full of that element, where the sea was deep blue.`
`"I'm sure you'll be able to see a deep blue ocean.`
` After all—"`
`{a:c:Without love, it cannot be {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen}.}`
`".........Who is there?"`
`"......It is Kanon, my lord."`
`It was rare for Kinzo to leave his study.`
`{n}......However, that in itself didn't mean his noble research had been suspended.`
`He may have left the study for a change of mood,`
` but the thoughts filling his head were no different from those he had inside the study.`
`So Kanon knew that no matter what the time, speaking to Kinzo when he didn't want to be spoken to would always be a disturbance to his research.`
`"The weather is heavy.`
` Will it get worse?"`
`"Yes.`
` According to the weather report, it could rain at any time.`
` ......Shall I bring you an umbrella, my lord?"`
`"That won't be necessary.`
` ......You should leave me alone for a while.`
` If my children ask, say that you do not know where I am.`
` I am busy on a journey through my own thoughts."`
`"......Certainly.`
` Then, if you would excuse me."`
`During the time that Kanon bowed to him, Kinzo had already returned to his own world, and had forgotten that Kanon was there.`
`And once again, he began rambling to himself.`
`{n}Amidst those words, ...the name of that witch was repeated many times.`
`"......Ooohh, {f:5:Beatrice}...`
` My hand does not reach your smile...`
` What should I do to revive you—what should I do so that you smile at me once again...?`
` ......What is lacking?`
` My research? My materials? A catalyst?`
` Or is it magical power or luck or an oracle...?!"`
`"Ooohhh, {f:5:Beatrice}, what must I do to see your face one more time...?`
` Ooooooooohhhhhhh......"`
`As Kanon listened to his master's weeping voice over his shoulder, he turned around just once.`
`When he did,`
` ............right behind his isolated old master,`
` ......was the silhouette of a person that shouldn't have been there.`
`It was......the witch.`
`At once, Kanon, thinking that the witch must be plotting to do Kinzo some harm,`
` quickly ran back to Kinzo, trying to become a shield himself.`
`But when he saw the expression on the witch's face,`
` ...that emotion of his vanished.`
`Because {f:5:Beatrice}'s expression was one of...`
`...sorrow,`
` ......or maybe pity.`
`"You fool, Kinzo......`
` ......I am right here, can you not {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} me?"`
`Right behind Kinzo, as he repeated the witch's name over and over, desiring to be reunited with her more than anything else, was the witch herself.`
`And yet, Kinzo couldn't notice a thing.`
`{n}......Even when {f:5:Beatrice} tried to rest her hand on his shoulder, he didn't notice a thing.`
`"...Why, why does my hand not reach {f:5:Beatrice}'s smile?!`
` Is it the phase of the moon,`
` the period of the comets,`
` the alignment of the planets?!`
` What is lacking, what, what?!!"`
`".........It's useless, Kinzo.`
` ...Without love,`
` it cannot be {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen}."`
`Kanon took the brooch he had received from Shannon out of his pocket.`
`......Could he learn something that would enable him, too, to {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} what he currently could not?`
`".................................`
` Without love, it cannot be {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen}."`
`He looked at Kinzo's back once more.`
`{n}......The witch was no longer there.``The biggest event for the Ushiromiya family in fall was the family conference in October,`
` but for Jessica, there was another one before that: the school cultural festival.`
`Jessica liked school; to her, it was a place where she could let out the stress she'd built up during the rigid lifestyle she was forced to lead at home.`
`For the cultural festival today, she had formed a group with her friends,`
` and would be performing casual pop‐rock on a temporary stage.`
`She had kept on preparing and practicing for that, and was really looking forward to today,`
` .........but there was one thing that had been worrying her.`
`She looked at the clock.`
` ...There was still a little time, ...but she was uneasy.`
`Would he really come?`
`As she was about to breathe out a stress‐relieving sigh, her heart jumped as all her friends suddenly started speaking in shrill voices.`
`"No wayyyy, Hina's boyfriend's a to~tal stud!!"`
`"He totally is, right?!`
` He totally is, right?!"`
`"Rin, your boyfriend looks hella smart!`
` So the guy's a hard S with glasses?! Like, for real?!"`
`"No way, no way, my man's a gyaru‐o!"`
`"""*giggle*{p:0:♪} *giggle*{p:0:♪}"""`
`......It's not necessarily the case that all girls are like this,`
` ...but at Jessica's school at least, the cultural festival was really a boyfriend exhibition.`
`Jessica didn't have a boyfriend.`
`{n}She had many friends of the opposite sex, but no "special one".`
`...But Jessica was a little famous around the school, and everyone naturally expected that she had a fitting partner.`
`Furthermore, her pride had caused her to act like that was the case.`
`Through such acting and dodging of questions, she had somehow managed to keep up the bluff until this year.`
`......But for various reasons, she hadn't been able to escape this year's cultural festival...`
`"Jessie~.`
` Is your boyfriend he~re?"`
`"Hweh?!`
` Ah, ah, no, looks like he's not here yet.`
` Maybe he's busy with work?`
` Ahahahahahahahahahaha..."`
`"What kind of guy is your boyfriend, Jessie?`
` At least give us a hint.`
` What type is he?`
` What type is he?!"`
`"Awesome, he's a working man, right?!`
` Is he gonna come in a suit?!`
` Of course he's gonna be sporting glasses, right?!`
` Kyaaa!!"`
`"Heeeeeey, but you don't really have one, do you?`
` If you come clean now, I'll let you join me!`
` Let's both flood this cultural festival with teeeeears!"`
`"No no no, I do I do I do, I'm telling you, I really do...`
` Ahahahahahahahahahaha...!!"`
`Jessica laughed awkwardly, covered with cold sweat.`
` ...It was extremely doubtful whether she really had deceived her sharp‐witted friends...`
`"Yes.`
` Then, how about making a fake boyfriend and taking him with you?"`
`"F‐f‐fake?!`
` Wh‐who......?!`
` I can't think of anyone...!"`
`Shannon's ridiculous plan surprised Jessica wildly.`
`Even so, it was a little more realistic than the unrealistic method running through her head of getting a boyfriend in a huge hurry before the day of the cultural festival.`
`"For example,`
` ......what about Kanon‐kun?"`
`"K‐K‐Kanon‐kuuuuuun?!`
` N‐n‐no way, no way!!`
` And anyway I'm sure Kanon‐kun will have work on the day of the festival—`
`I don't want to bother him and stuff..."`
`"Of course, I've already checked the schedule.`
` Kanon‐kun has that day off."`
`"......Wh‐...why are you always so clever at times like this...`
` No, wait!`
` It'd be even worse if he's off...`
` I can't pull him away from his precious break just for my own vanity!"`
`"If Kanon‐kun isn't pulled away, he'll always just be shut away by himself,`
` so I think forcibly dragging him around a bit would be perfect."`
`"Y‐y‐`
`......you think so?`
` ...No,`
` but,`
` ...I'd feel bad for Kanon‐kun......"`
`"Then I think you're out of options...`
` How about meekly confessing to everyone that you don't have a boyfriend?"`
`"...Oh, sure, sure, that may well cause you to experience some shame,`
` but you would only have to endure for the short and yet oh so loooong time before graduation.`
` To those couples in love, there's no sweeter honey than the face of a single person with an inferiority complex{p:0:☆}"`
`"Sha‐Shannonnnn~!!`
` You aren't really worrying for my sake, are you, you're teasing meeeeee!!"`
`Jessica wrestled about with Shannon, her eyes teary.`
`{n}But Shannon was unconcerned, laughing with her usual smile.`
`"Yes,`
` this is to get you back for making fun of me and George‐sama all the time."`
`At that comeback of Shannon's, the likes of which didn't happen even once a year, Jessica rolled around on her bed hugging her cushion, writhing and suffering.`
`Shannon's triumphant smile was unbearably frustrating, but right now, she was the only person Jessica could talk with.`
` She could wait until later to suffocate her with a cushion.`
`"Why not, Milady?`
` It's a cultural festival, but it's also a chance for you to have fun with Kanon‐kun."`
`"Well yeah, but...`
`ahh, nononono......!!"`
`Jessica buried her head in her favorite cushion to hide the fact that her face had grown bright red.`
`And she bit away at her thumbnail...`
`{n}...It really was a reaction to be appreciated.`
`Shannon and Jessica were about the same age, of the same sex, and they were also friends.`
`And they were both right in the middle of puberty.`
`{n}They could never talk enough about things related to love.`
`{n}That's why they were able to be open with each other about these topics.`
`So Jessica had heard in detail about how Shannon's and George's love was progressing,`
` and on the other side, Shannon had heard the details of what type Jessica liked, and what kind of man she might be interested in.`
`Judging by Jessica's reactions, it would probably be crude to talk about that in detail...`
`But we won't get anywhere with Jessica just rolling around on the bed forever, so—to be blunt—`
`Jessica had been thinking about Kanon ever since he had first appeared.`
`There were almost no young men on Rokkenjima.`
`{n}So maybe it was natural that Jessica, as a girl in puberty, had become interested in Kanon.`
`But if anyone said that, it would destroy the romance of a maiden's pure heart and of love at first sight.`
`Shannon had been with Kanon the whole time at the welfare institute, so she had known him before they had started working.`
`So Jessica had asked persistently about what kind of person he was, what his hobbies were, what his favorite foods were, what type of girl he liked.`
`.........Even Shannon could clearly tell that Jessica was infatuated with Kanon.`
`"Come on.`
` ...Isn't this a good chance to take Kanon‐kun on a date?"`
`"B‐b‐but but but...Kanon‐kun might also have someone he likes...`
` Wouldn't he take it badly if I made him go with me just to show off...?"`
`"People who aren't honest about their feelings, such as you, Milady,`
` ...what was that word again, I learned it from George‐sama.`
` That's right, they call them "{c:86ef9c:tsundora}".`
` Apparently they will be quite popular a few decades from now, you know?"`
`"Wowww, George nii‐san sure is incredible...`
` So, he's capable of foreseeing future trends now, is he?`
` Awesome.`
` ......No, wait!`
` You're saying I'm living in the wrong time period!"`
`"Waah, waah, waah, I'm dooooomed!!"`
`......Ultimately, Jessica wasted several days before finally agreeing to the plan of having Kanon pretend to be her boyfriend......`
`"......Yes, Milady.`
` Did you call me?"`
`Jessica realized that she had called him at a bad time, and immediately regretted it.`
`...Kanon always had a sour look, but even so, he had some good days and some bad days.`
`...Unfortunately, this reaction was the latter.`
`"N‐n‐no, umm, well,`
` ............errr."`
`"....................."`
`All that confidence and effort she had amassed by practicing in front of a mirror all night was wiped out in about five seconds...`
`Jessica turned bright red and hung her head.`
`Watching her, Kanon sighed.`
`{n}...Jessica thought he was getting fed up with her, and her face went pale.`
`".........I heard from Shannon.`
` Is this about me accompanying you to the school cultural festival, Milady?"`
`"Huh?`
` ......Ah, aaaaaaahhh!!`
` Nice, Shannon...!`
` ...I mean...!"`
`"Ye‐yeah, yeah.`
` Tha‐that's right, but, umm, err!`
` ...............Do, do you have any p‐plans that day...?"`
`"...I was strictly ordered by Shannon to work specially for you on that day, Milady.`
` I have never been to high school, so I don't really understand,`
` but I hear it's a place where girls feel very ashamed if they don't have a boy with them."`
`"...And I was particularly ordered to see to it that the daughter of the Ushiromiya family is in no way inferior to the common people."`
`"Waha...`
`wahahahahahahahahahaha, Shannon, I'll beat you to death laterrrrrrr!!!"`
`Jessica kept yelling with a strange voice, a broken smile, and steam pouring from her head as if she were a boiler.`
`As Kanon watched this, he sighed again.`
`Kanon wasn't an idiot either.`
`He fully understood what Jessica intended by inviting him.`
`......However, in truth, he found it nothing but bothersome to go along with the lady's game of love.`
`But Shannon had spoken to him persistently about it.`
` He was very indebted to her for many things.`
`{n}He couldn't refuse.`
`...And in his pocket was that brooch.`
`Couldn't this strange turn of events also have been brought about by the magic power residing in this brooch?`
`............Ridiculous.`
`{n}But those words of Shannon's came to mind.`
`...What did Shannon {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} that I cannot?`
`I don't understand Shannon's feelings.`
` We are furniture.`
`{n}...As if we could...become something more than that.`
`Jessica, still rambling on in a strange voice, and Kanon, sighing deeply, were a truly odd combination...`
`"Jessie, someone's here for you!!`
` Didn't you hear?!"`
`"Huh, ah, ah, sorry!!`
` Wh‐who...?"`
`As my friends all gathered together, ...they were looking this way with hard‐to‐describe expressions,`
` whispering to each other in low voices that couldn't be called low.`
`Even I felt kind of shameless.`
` Did I just say "sorry, who"?!`
`{n}Like I don't know who's shown up...!`
`{n}Aaaaaaaaah, crap, crap, crap, my mind is blank...`
`"Omigod, that's Jessie's boyfriend?!`
` He's sooo cuuuuuuuuute!!"`
`"She really had a boyfriend?!`
` No fake, serious, for reeeeal?!"`
`"Jessica, you traitoorrr!!`
` He's soo fine!!"`
`"He's younger?!`
` I never heard he was younger?!"`
`"Where where?!`
` Where where where's Jessie's boyfriend?!"`
`"She really does like young boys!!!!!"`
`"He‐hhhhhey!`
` Y‐you took a while, wahahahahaha!"`
`"......I didn't know where the entrance was.`
` I apologize for being late."`
`"R‐right, umm, ...that outfit suits you, doesn't it?`
` Wahahahahahahaha...!!"`
`"...Shannon...said my normal clothes wouldn't do, ...so we went and bought this yesterday.`
` It probably doesn't fit me..."`
`"Wa‐wahahahahahahahahahahahaha, that's not true!`
` Shannon, when I get back you're getting a posthumous two‐rank promotiooooon!!"`
`".........This place is kind of filled with girls... It's uncomfortable."`
`"Y‐y‐yeah, isn't it?!`
` C‐come on, let's not hang around here, let's go to the stage, alright?`
` 'Cause it'll be our turn really soon!`
` Come on come on come on!!"`
`It seemed that Jessica was just as uncomfortable.`
`{n}It looked like she was finding it difficult to cope while bathed in everyone's interested gaze.`
`...When he saw Jessica's appearance, Kanon thought that he might have made things difficult for her by coming.`
`"......I get the feeling that I'm getting in the way.`
` Am I a burden?"`
`"N‐no‐not at all, seriously!!"`
`"...If {ruby:boku:I} am in the way, please tell me at any time..."`
`((Kyaaa, omigooddd, he calls himself "boku"!!!!!!))`
`"Ahiiiiiiiii, you, you, you aren't a burden, Kanon‐kun!!"`
`(((Kyaaaaaa, she calls her boyfriend "kun"!!!!!!!)))`
`"......What should I do, Milady?"`
`(((Omigoood, she makes him call her Milady, like a butler, {ruby:omg:ktkr}!!!)))`
`"Nooooooooo, don't call me Milady todaaaaaaaaay!!"`
`".........Re‐...really?`
` Understood, Jessica‐sama."`
`(((Kyaaaaa, she's trained him to call her "sama"!!!!!!!!)))`
`"S‐ss‐sorry, Kanon‐kun, just for three seconds, could you close your eyes..."`
`(((Hiiyaaaaaaa, kiss, it's a kiss, she's going to kiss him!!!!)))`
`"O‐...okay, here goes."`
`BANG,`
` thunk!`
` BAMBAM,`
` SLAM,`
` CRASH!!`
`...When Kanon opened his eyes, for some reason, there was a horrible tragedy in the room.`
`{n}Everyone had been driven into the walls, their arms and legs outstretched.`
`Jessica put her brass knuckles in her pocket before Kanon opened his eyes.`
`"A‐anyway, let's go over to the stage.`
` Our turn is coming up soon, so wait in a seat for a bit."`
`"'Cause we have to get ready!`
` If you go straight to the end here, there'll be a temporary stage, so you'll know where to go, just wait there!"`
`Kanon seemed to be having a hard time adjusting; pushing him in the back, Jessica sent him out into the corridor.`
`Even though Kanon was confused by Jessica's attitude and show of agitation, which he had never seen before, he followed her instructions and headed in the direction she had indicated.`
`After seeing him off with an awkward smile, Jessica slammed the door shut and yelled loudly.`
`"There you go, you saw, right?`
` You saw, happy now?!`
` Wahahahahahahahaha, sucks for you!!!"`
`"......ugggggggh, I lost the bet."`
`"I was so sure that Jessie didn't have a boyfriend."`
`"That wasn't a boyfriend, right, she's just harassing one of her servants, right?"`
`"Waaaah, Jessie's boyfriend's incredibleeee...!"`
`"Sh‐sh‐shut up!!`
` Let's get ready, move it move it!!"`
`Jessica took the brass knuckles out of her pocket again, and everyone energetically returned to their tasks.`
`"...............haah."`
`Kanon went down the corridor as Jessica had told him to, and found a temporary stage set up where the vending machines should have been.`
`It was probably being shared in timeslots between the individual groups and clubs.`
`A student group was singing, and the place was already fired up.`
`Disliking that ruckus, he found a dark wall to lean against, alone.`
`......So this is what they call high school.`
`{n}It sure is noisy,`
` ...Kanon thought.`
`Then he remembered Jessica just now, acting in a way that he'd never seen before.`
`......Honestly, she was in such high spirits that alcohol might have been involved.`
`To him, the greatest virtue for a person was to always be composed and intellectual.`
`In that sense, it was very hard for him to get used to the atmosphere in a school cultural festival.`
`...He had the responsibility of reporting everything he saw or heard to the Master.`
`...So he would also have to report about Jessica's unrestrained behavior earlier.`
`......At the very least, it was not fitting for a daughter of the Ushiromiya main family.`
`The Master, Krauss‐sama,`
` ...and especially Natsuhi‐sama would probably be angry.`
`If I were to report it in a way that protects Milady, should I blame it on inappropriate school friends...?`
`".........What was all that?`
` ......So stupid."`
`Kanon thought back on how Jessica had acted earlier, and sighed again.`
`He could understand Natsuhi's headache a little now.`
`......Come to think of it, Natsuhi‐sama, as the president of the PTA, should have gone straight to a social after attending the ceremony in the gymnasium.`
`Hadn't she said that she wouldn't be there to see Milady's event?`
`{n}......That was probably for the best.`
`"............The crowds are unpleasant.`
` ...What in the world do they want?"`
`Several female students kept glancing at me.`
`It seemed they were all whispering the same sort of things that Milady's school friends had said, and it was really unpleasant.`
`Come to think of it, didn't Shannon warn me?`
`......That if I was going to walk around a school festival on my own,`
` I had better watch out because a lot of strange people would come and talk to me.`
`"He‐hello~, are you by yourself?"`
`Just as expected, a group of girls I'd never met started talking to me.`
`{n}Their stares started to make my back tingle.`
`......Didn't she tell me some magic words that could chase them off in times like this?`
` ...Ummm.`
`"......Sorry.`
` I'm with someone."`
`"Uh, oh, really...?!`
` I, I'm sorry!"`
`Ah, it worked.`
` Instant reaction...`
`Well, that got them to go away, but it hasn't really changed the number of people staring at me.`
`"No, it's that kid, Jessie's boyfriend!!"`
`"No way?!`
` That kid?!"`
`"I can't believe it, I was sure he was fake!"`
`"He's so cuuute, is he younger than her?!`
` I'm so jealous!!"`
`"...............haah."`
`...No way I'm ever coming to a place like this again.`
` Kanon sighed for about the hundredth time that day.`
`As he did, the lighting changed, and the standing audience started cheering.`
`Looking around, I realized that there were suddenly a large number of people here.`
`{n}And unlike earlier, they were all guys.`
`With this huge crowd, I couldn't even see the stage.`
` Fortunately, there was a fallen beer case nearby, so I tried using that as a footstool.`
`And I noticed that there was now a new group on the stage.`
`The leader was Milady.`
` She had changed into stage clothes, and was even holding a guitar.`
` ......I didn't know she could play.`
`No, maybe she could.`
`{n}I have seen her practicing air guitar before.`
`Natsuhi‐sama wouldn't approve of any hobbies outside of study.`
`Maybe she was always practicing in secret.`
`...Come to think of it, she's been returning really late from school recently, hasn't she?`
`...Maybe she's been practicing at school, far away from Natsuhi‐sama's prying eyes.`
`It really is for the best that Natsuhi‐sama didn't come.`
` ...If Milady were to get scolded by Natsuhi‐sama after putting so many hours of practice in, she would probably be very dejected...`
`"""Jessie‐samaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"""`
`"Everyone, thanks for gathering here todaaaayyyyyyyy!!"`
`I could hear Jessica‐sama's forceful voice through the speakers.`
`...Jessie‐sama?`
` Maybe that's her nickname at school.`
`The students in the audience kept calling out that name.`
`{n}...I was a little aggravated by that inferior name, which was inappropriate for Milady.`
`Jessica‐sama was in great spirits as they kept calling her Jessie‐sama.`
`...They were all probably her fans.`
`{n}With her mike performance, she was responding to that and firing the place up.`
`{n}...It was almost like a song program on TV.`
`............At first, I had thought all this was frivolous, but that feeling now changed into appreciation—this was pretty incredible in its own way.`
`Kanon had never listened to music of his own free will, but he had often heard the kind of music that the people of the Ushiromiya family liked.`
`...Since that was almost all classical music, Kanon had naturally started liking classical music too.`
`...So to Kanon, the songs Jessica and the others were singing were...how should you say it...`
`.........very modern.`
`In any case, he thought that if Natsuhi‐sama heard it, she would probably faint.`
`But everyone looked like they were having a really good time.`
`The die‐hard fans, who had even brought pen‐lights, sang along,`
` dancing crazily with the exact same movements, almost as though it had been planned ahead.`
`On the stage, Jessica‐sama also sang enthusiastically, dripping with sweat.`
`.........He couldn't find a single element that was appropriate for a daughter of the Ushiromiya family,`
` ...but it looked like she was having a lot of fun.`
`"""Jessie‐samaaaaaaaa!!`
` Jessiiiiie, Jessiiiiiiiiiiie!!!"""`
`"Thank you!! OK, next up, we've got a brand new one for you! Don't Call Me An Ordinary Magician!!"`
`...I couldn't keep up with the atmosphere, but...`
`......anyway, Milady was full of life and looked like she was having a great time.`
`As I looked at Milady having a great time, I thought...`
`Isn't this what Ushiromiya Jessica is really like?`
`...Don't I know better than anyone just how badly life on Rokkenjima kills your own sense of self?`
`Then the time she spends, ...not as Milady, the successor to the Ushiromiya family,`
` but as a single girl called Jessica, living life to the fullest, must be very important to her.`
`...I worked close to Milady, saw her in all seasons, and I thought I knew everything about her.`
`...But that was only a single limited side of her, Milady of Rokkenjima.`
`......We are furniture.`
`{n}We serve on Rokkenjima, and end our lives on Rokkenjima.`
`...So I had come to think that Rokkenjima itself was our whole world, as though—just like in the old geocentric theories—`
`the ocean spilled off the end of the world into an abyss.`
`But as I looked at Milady like this, I realized that this was a horribly narrow outlook.`
`...I still couldn't keep up with the excitement of the crowd.`
`...But I felt like I had seen something that "cannot be {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen}" on Rokkenjima.`
`.........Although I don't know if that was the {y:1:‘unseeable’}{n:1:unseeable} thing Shannon was talking about.`
`I still can't see the ocean as blue...`
`"Wasn't today the cultural festival at Jessica's school?`
` ...Has the principal been doing well?"`
`"...Yes, he seemed to be in good health.`
` Oh, that's right, Ms. Takamiya was also there.`
` She was particularly insistent that I give you her regards."`
`"Hmm, busy as usual?"`
`"It appeared so.`
` She is a very energetic person.`
` Oh, yes, there was also President Enomoto."`
`Naturally, the topic of Jessica's cultural festival came up at dinner.`
`School events often became social gatherings for influential people.`
`{n}It was the same for the Ushiromiya family, who were big names around this area.`
`As Natsuhi remembered the names of the important people at the social, she updated Krauss on the news concerning them.`
`...Jessica didn't really have any interest in that discussion, and rudely slurped her pumpkin soup.`
`"......Milady.`
` I would hesitate to call those appropriate manners."`
`"............Yeah yeah, sorry 'bout that."`
`"Jessica.`
` I am always telling you to do something about your speech."`
`"......Yes."`
`Jessica answered, discouraged.`
`{n}When he saw that, Krauss smiled a little and interrupted his conversation with Natsuhi.`
`"How was the festival for you, Jessica?"`
`"Huh?`
` Ah,`
` ......well, okay!"`
`"I was watching.`
` You did a good job."`
`"Huh, ......huh?!`
` Ah, ......ahahahaha, y‐yeah, I guess!"`
`Jessica's face turned bright red.`
`...She probably hadn't thought that Natsuhi would actually come to see her on the stage.`
`She felt a mix of happiness and embarrassment.`
`Actually, she hadn't wanted her mother to watch because she didn't want to be told that her music was inappropriate for the Ushiromiya family.`
`......But it wasn't as though it didn't make her happy to hear her parent say that she did a good job after watching her try her best...`
`"You appeared with both composure and dignity.`
` Fitting behavior for the students' representative."`
`"...ah,`
` ............oh,`
` ...yeah."`
`The smile that had been there a second ago crumbled like sand.`
`{n}...Jessica immediately realized that she was talking about something different.`
`Jessica was also the school's student president.`
`...She had no interest in something so annoying, but her parents had been pushy so she had grudgingly accepted.`
`Unfortunately, she was popular in school, so she had won the election easily.`
`So Natsuhi was praising her for the ceremony organized by the student council at the beginning of the cultural festival.`
`Actually, she had just carried that out halfheartedly.`
`{n}She had immediately met up with her friends, and had held a stage rehearsal for the rest of the time...`
`"The experience of standing above people and bearing responsibility will definitely be useful in the future.`
` It will surely help you mature as a member of the Ushiromiya family."`
`"But you spoke the greeting a little quickly.`
` You passed on content, but your fast style of speech dilutes it.`
` It would be good if you developed a habit of taking a breath every once in a while."`
`"............yeah."`
`After she finished eating, Jessica didn't feel like going straight to her room.`
`You could say that her room was the place where her parents had specified for her to be.`
`So maybe you could say that, for Jessica,`
` choosing not to return to her own room and instead disappearing to an unknown location in this large mansion was a meager form of resistance...`
`Jessica felt that even being in the mansion made it hard to breathe, so she went outside to the rose garden.`
`"...............`
` ...Well, even if she had come, she'd just have said something about how it wasn't appropriate for the successor to the Ushiromiya family anyway.`
` ...So what the hell's my problem.`
` Ahahahahahaha."`
`Jessica laughed at what she was sulking over.`
`...Laughed at what kind of words she would have had to receive to be satisfied.`
`......Ridiculous.`
` In the end, I'm just a spoiled little kid.`
`{n}I can't believe myself—it's almost funny.`
`"......Milady."`
`"wah!—Kanon‐kun...`
` D‐don't scare me like that, hahaha...!`
` *cough*cough*!"`
`Kanon had suddenly started talking to her just as she had tried to force a laugh, so she choked.`
`"What?`
` Something to say...?"`
`".....................`
`umm."`
`"......Yeah?"`
`Jessica's expression had become the one Kanon always saw.`
`{n}The listless Jessica from a second ago was gone.`
`If he still only knew Jessica as the successor to the Ushiromiya family, as he did until today,`
` ...he would have mistakenly thought that Jessica's mood had sprung back to normal.`
`......But that was wrong.`
`He now knew a part of her that he could not {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} until today, so he understood that there was no way that, on the inside, Jessica was just as she appeared.`
`"Ah... About today's cultural festival...`
` ...Well, thanks for coming with me so I could show off.`
` You really helped."`
`"......Your singing.`
` ...It was good."`
`"Wha?!`
` ......Ah,`
` .........ahahahahahaha?!`
` Re‐really? I'm embarrassed..."`
`Even though she had heard the words she had most wanted to hear,`
` ...Jessica became shy, and couldn't accept them frankly.`
`"......I cannot sing.`
` And I don't know how to play any instruments other than the harmonica and the recorder, which I learned in elementary school.`
` ...So I had just assumed that you were the same, Milady."`
`...Kanon hadn't been consciously looking down on Jessica to that degree.`
`But people playing unique instruments were always on the other side of the Braun tubes in the TV.`
`...He had got it into his head that it would be impossible for Jessica, at least.`
`"...I am furniture.`
` ...So I didn't believe there was any need to sing or play instruments."`
`But...`
`...I'm not sure anymore.`
`"......Kanon‐kun,`
` seriously, enough with that phrase "I am furniture"...`
` That's some kind of servant's mentality, right...?`
` That "servants should be living furniture" thing.`
` ...Genji‐san says it a lot."`
`"It isn't a mentality......`
` ...We really are...furniture."`
`"I know the kids from the Gospel House...receive assistance from Grandfather in various ways...`
`and I realize you feel gratitude for that."`
`"......But that doesn't mean...you should call yourself furniture.`
` Aren't you a human like us?"`
`"........................"`
`"Kanon‐kun, when you saw me singing, ...what did you think?"`
`"......It looked like you were having a lot of fun."`
`"That's probably not it."`
`"......Huh?"`
`"It wasn't that I looked like I was having fun,`
` ...you were jealous, weren't you?"`
`"...............`
` I......"`
`Even Kanon himself probably hadn't noticed that emotion.`
`{n}......Kanon had seen something he had never seen before, never known of before...and had probably become jealous.`
`And to trick himself about that emotion, he had called himself furniture over and over...`
`"I know I'm the successor to the Ushiromiya family or something,`
` ......and, well, I'm sure there'll be a lot of annoying stuff to do in the future too.`
` As far as that goes, I've just gotta resign myself to it—I was born under an unlucky star."`
`"...Probably, just like you had to live at the Gospel House, neither of us have a choice.`
` We couldn't choose the stars we were born under."`
`"...............That may be true."`
`"But there's one part where you and me are completely different.`
` ...Know what that is?"`
`I am furniture, and you are not.`
`{n}......He was about to say that, but stopped.`
`"...I don't know."`
`"Kanon‐kun, you think that your own fate is everything about you, and you gave up.`
` I can't accept this kind of fate, so I decided to do the best I can."`
`"......So as well as my normal constrained self who has to act as the daughter of the Ushiromiya family,`
` I've created another self who pours all her heart into the things she likes."`
`".........Another...self."`
`"Yeah.`
` ......Kanon‐kun, you've been telling yourself "I am furniture".`
` ......I'm sure there's been many tough things that have forced you to tell yourself that."`
`"...I think that's...`
`...really unfortunate.`
` .........But for that to determine your entire life, that feels so sad to me."`
`"................................."`
`"You know, people can always make another self inside themselves that they can really grow to like.`
` This isn't escaping from reality, okay?`
` ......When I'm that other part of myself, I can really feel like I'm living a great life."`
`"So no matter how constrained and boring everyday life is, I can definitely live without suffocating."`
`"......To make...`
`...another self that you can really grow to like...`
`inside yourself..."`
`To make another me, which isn't furniture...`
`Through her relationship with George‐sama, has Shannon given birth to a part of herself that isn't furniture?`
`......And did this other Shannon...see something that cannot be {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen} by furniture?`
`"Yeah.`
` .........Well, I don't know anything about your private life, Kanon‐kun.`
` But, ...I can sorta guess.`
` Your private life is...probably...nothing at all.`
` Bulls‐eye...?"`
`Kanon couldn't reply, but that was answer enough.`
`He had no concept of a private life.`
`So Kanon would always be Kanon.`
`{n}So furniture would always be furniture.`
`"......Kanon‐kun, that "Kanon" isn't your real name, right?"`
`The Gospel House gave new students new families and a new life, so it also made a point of giving each of them a new name.`
`......In his case, that was "Kanon".`
`".........Certainly, ......that name of mine may be a temporary thing."`
`He had thought that he wasn't anyone other than Kanon.`
`......But he remembered.`
`{n}...There definitely had been a part of himself that wasn't Kanon.`
`{n}But that was far, far away, beyond the distant fog of oblivion...`
`"So even for you, it should be alright to have times when you're Kanon‐kun, and times when you aren't.`
` ......Maybe the Kanon‐kun you are when you act as a servant calls himself furniture and strictly limits his own will."`
`"......But when you aren't Kanon‐kun, I think it's alright to live much, much more freely."`
`Those words definitely weren't just lip‐service.`
`Jessica had also been like this in the past.`
`{n}She had cursed her own birth into an environment different from all of her friends at school.`
`She had been the only one in a heavily constricted environment, forced to learn various things,`
` and she had even received words about the friends she played with.`
`......Though she had been sad about that, she had given up, thinking that she had just been born under that kind of star.`
`But one day, Jessica had stopped giving up and surrendering.`
`Stuff like the Ushiromiya family customs and pressure, those didn't matter.`
`She created a real "Jessica" inside herself, who could do what she really wanted to do.`
`"You know, I'm called by this nickname Jessie in school.`
` So when I'm Jessie, I live life honestly and to the fullest.`
` And because of that, I can do my best when I'm Jessica too."`
`"...Maybe you too could have times when you're Kanon,`
` and times when you're, umm,`
` ......your real name, and live a different way in each.`
` ......When you aren't Kanon, ...can't you try being another self who you can grow to like?"`
`"..................When...I am not Kanon."`
`He had thought that his real name didn't matter at all.`
`{n}So he had thought Kanon was all he was.`
`And now Jessica was saying that he should create a new existence, another self that wasn't Kanon.`
`"......Kanon‐kun,`
` if you don't mind, tell me.`
` ......What's your...real name?"`
`"................................."`
`He was silent for quite some time.`
`Maybe his real name had risen to the tip of his tongue.`
`...After hesitating for a long time over whether he should say it,`
` ...in the end,`
` ...he swallowed it back down.`
`"......I forgot.`
` ...My name doesn't matter anymore."`
`Those words signified a slight rejection.`
`"No matter what kind of real name I had,`
` ......the only truth now is that here, I am Kanon.`
` The past has nothing to do with anything.`
` ......Just as it does not matter the name of the tree from whose trunk a piece of furniture was originally made."`
`"......I said stop that!`
` You aren't furniture, you're human, you know?!"`
`"I am not human!"`
`Kanon clearly spoke his refusal.`
`{n}......It was with a rage that he normally didn't show.`
`Jessica couldn't say anything back, and was struck silent...`
`"...You are human, Milady.`
` So you are free to live any way you like,`
` and any kind of future is possible for you.`
` It's almost like you have wings and can dance through the sky like a bird."`
`"But I am not like that.`
` Even if you see me as a bird, I am nothing more than a domestic duck.`
` ......They may have wings, but they cannot fly."`
`"To speak of that dream of flight despite that,`
` ......that's just...`
`too cruel...!"`
`"...Furniture, ducks!!`
` What the hell is all this!!`
` ............No, ..."`
`Jessica had unconsciously gone along with Kanon's forceful manner of speaking, but she realized that she shouldn't fire back, and swallowed her words.`
`"...............I don't know anything about you.`
` I don't even know your upbringing, and I don't know the hardships you've been through.`
` ...So I can't even imagine why you started calling yourself furniture."`
`"......But know this.`
` You aren't furniture or a duck.`
` You're a real human."`
`"................................."`
`"If you want to say that the Kanon‐kun working as a servant is furniture, that's alright.`
` ......But, ...in that case,`
` ......don't you think you can make another self for when you aren't furniture, when you're human?"`
`"......Only a human like you can embrace that possibility.`
` ...I am not like that.`
` I have no future, no possibilities, and no dreams I am permitted to see."`
`"............So, Milady.`
` Please don't...`
`say any more...`
`....cruel things......"`
`"Why...`
` Why......are you saying that..."`
`"Because it seems that you are mistaking me for...a human just like you, Milady.`
` We are different beings.`
` I just wanted to make that clear."`
`"......I heard from Shannon.`
` Something about you taking a liking to me."`
`"Huh, ......huh?!`
` Ah, .........no, wahaha..."`
`"...I look almost identical to a human.`
` Therefore, .........like Shannon, maybe I could delude myself that I am human, and for a time, pretend to love."`
`"...But that would surely be fooling myself.`
` No, it would also be fooling you, Milady.`
` Shannon and George‐sama will definitely fall apart.`
` ...Shannon herself must understand that day will come, and yet she does this...stupid..."`
`"There, ......there's nothing stupid about it!!`
` Sure, George nii‐san's a brilliant person, and he's bearing both of his parents' expectations."`
`"...And yeah, when it comes to marriage, I'm sure Auntie Eva's gonna interfere in a bunch of ways, and, umm, I think they've got a really tough road ahead of them, alright?!`
` ...But you know, George nii‐san isn't the kind of guy who'll surrender to all that!`
` He won't turn Shannon into Juliet, he'll definitely make her happy!!"`
`"People and furniture cannot love one another.`
` ...I am trying to say that even if you can love furniture, I cannot love you, Milady."`
`"..................nn—"`
`Those words of Kanon's......crushed all of Jessica's bittersweet feelings from today.`
`There was no way she could have anticipated the emotions of such a blunt rejection...`
`In an instant, she lost the willpower that had caused her to try and unravel something stubborn in Kanon's heart,`
` ...and before she knew it, she was just standing there in shock...`
`"......Milady, if your feelings for me are due to my conceit, then I beg for your forgiveness."`
`"...N‐......no.`
` ...Well, uh, ...I won't deny it."`
`"......Thank you very much."`
`"Huh...?"`
`"For thinking of me as a human,`
` ...thank you very much.`
` Just those feelings truly make me happy.`
` ......And anything more would be too cruel, so..."`
`"No, tha‐...that's enough.`
` ...Umm,`
` .........sorry."`
`Jessica scratched at her head as she spoke, and tried to force her voice to sound bright.`
`"......I just kinda...`
`...ran on ahead by myself,`
` ...and caused you trouble.`
` ...I'm honestly sorry.`
` I'm really sorry...for using up your whole day off."`
`"No.`
` ......I was also...happy that I could see you having fun."`
`"...Then, let's be done for the night.`
` ......If I don't go back to my room and turn off the lights, Mom will get mad at me again.`
` ...Hahaha."`
`"That would probably be most appropriate.`
` ...I wish you a good night, Milady."`
`"......Yeah.`
` ............Good night........."`
`Jessica turned her back to him, and slowly trodded away, looking disheartened.`
`But suddenly, she started dashing pell‐mell, and disappeared in the direction of the mansion...`
`As he watched her go, ...for just an instant,`
` Kanon was tormented by the feeling that he had just made a huge mistake.`
`...But, no, he thought, this had not been a mistake at all.`
`......It was for her sake that he'd been forced to refuse her now, while her pain was still at its smallest.`
`"............Nice going, making a woman cry like that.`
` *cackle*cackle*.`
` I didn't expect you to refuse her that strongly.`
` ......Had you answered normally, another pair of lovers would have been born with my magic."`
`"How long have you been there...?`
` .........You're just horrible."`
`When he turned around, the witch was suddenly there.`
`{n}...It looked like she had been there the whole time, enjoying their performance as if it were a play.`
`"I shall forgive your reckless words towards me just this once in deference to that pleasant show.`
` ......Even after one thousand years, no more interesting show exists than complications between men and women.`
` To me, it's an addictive pleasure sweeter than any other.`
` ......nn?"`
`Kanon pulled that butterfly brooch out of his pocket.`
`{n}It was the crystallization of the great magic that the witch had bestowed.`
`Without hesitation, Kanon flung it hard onto the ground and stomped on it.`
`"......Hoh?`
` What is the meaning of this, when you know that was something given by me?"`
`"Just now, I figured it out.`
` ......What you are doing isn't as tasteful as being a cupid of love.`
` You are just a demon who enjoys showing love to those who can never be joined, and deceiving them."`
`"...............Hmph.`
` ...You are free to think that.`
` Most humans I have lent my power to have said the same thing."`
`"Don't play dumb!!`
` You didn't lend Shannon your power because you felt sorry for her.`
` ...You took advantage of a weak point in Shannon's heart as it burned with love, and made her break the mirror that sealed you.`
` And that's not all,`
` ...you're toying with her, when you know very well how it's all going to end!`
` Am I wrong?!"`
`"Hehheheheheh, *cackle*!`
` Furniture is a thoroughly pitiful existence.`
` So you have no dreams, no future, and even no love?`
` Good, good, there is nothing better than knowing your place.`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`".........khh..."`
`"Just as you suspected, there was a faint love growing in Jessica's heart.`
` You are under the impression that you have snipped it out, harvested it."`
`"......But did you know?`
` Trees grow thicker branches if you thin them out, instead of letting them grow rampant. ......A girl who loves furniture, interesting, truly interesting!`
` Shannon and George will also eventually reach a stalemate with their unfulfillable love, and will bear just the kind of large fruit I like."`
`"However, to my regret, they've been getting on so well that it just isn't interesting, you see?`
` In that respect, I think you two shall entertain me greatly, *cackle*cackle*!"`
`The witch laughed.`
` Even though she had known that the two could not be joined, she had lent magic to join them together.`
`However, they couldn't escape the fate that made it impossible for them to be joined.`
`......The witch knew that.`
`Even if they were joined, the relationships of Shannon and George, Kanon and Jessica would fail for certain,`
` and as they wandered through the eternal desert in the hell of love, they would be tormented by eternal thirst...!`
`"Did you think I would lend them that power without any compensation?`
` I'll lend a hand in love.`
` And my compensation shall be one ticket to watch the cruel fate that the two of them will eventually meet.`
` Even after one thousand years, no better show exists...!"`
`"Just look at Kinzo.`
` See how he ended up, an old, pitiful man who knew the taste of love and was thrown out of Paradise!`
` Look at how he lives, like a dead man who can't fully die.`
` *cackle*cackle*!!"`
`"You really are a witch.`
` Get out of my sight, you demon...!!"`
`"......I shall disappear regardless.`
` My power still hasn't returned, you see.`
` It is still tiring to continue showing myself."`
`"......I overdid it when I gave you lovers my power.`
` ...As I am now, it will not be easy to maintain that power without that brooch as a catalyst."`
`Kanon ground his foot even more into the stomped brooch.`
`{n}He felt it break under his foot.`
`Then, it dissolved as if into water,`
` and changed into butterflies that sparkled gold, which fluttered away from beneath Kanon's foot...`
`"I also find it a little difficult to continue preserving this form.`
` As you ask, I will hide myself for a brief period.`
` Just as there is no tide that does not rise, and no moon that does not wax, my magical power will surely become whole again.`
` ...And there will surely come a time that is appropriate for my revival."`
`"......I cannot imagine whether that will be tomorrow, next year, or even one hundred or one thousand years in the future.`
` But as long as there are those that entertain me, I will surely gain power and revive.`
` ......I will disappear for a short while, until that time comes."`
`"The bruise on the palm of your hand is already gone,`
` so if you wish, tomorrow morning, you can let my existence disappear like an illusion or a dream.`
` ......There is nothing more saddening for me than to be forgotten."`
`"However, I will definitely be revived.`
` Make sure that you won't regret that day's coming at any time.`
` I will surely have my second coming and control everything as this island's true master.`
` ...And at that time, the door to the Golden Land will be opened again.`
` ...The covetous and the greedy shall call me forth without fail...!"`
`"...Enough!!`
` Disappear, now, Golden Witch...!!"`
`Leaving behind a mocking laugh, the witch turned into a flight of gold butterflies, and scattered away.`
`...The whole area sparkled like a gold blizzard in a snow globe.`
`It was a fleeting fantastical scene that disappeared in a heartbeat...`
`The witch could no longer be seen.`
` ...However, Kanon felt like he could still hear that shrill, unpleasant laugh...`
`......Aahh, how entertaining, how entertaining.`
`Why is the human world so entertaining after such a long absence?!`
`Go insane with love. Go insane with gold.`
`Those that don't go insane from those are not human!`
`I see, then the word furniture is fitting indeed, *cackle*cackle*!`
`Furniture is created to serve humans.`
`And I toy with and tyrannize those humans to ease my thousand years of boredom.`
`What a truly entertaining rock‐paper‐scissors situation, that I cannot control furniture!`
`Kinzo, your enterprises are truly interesting!`
`Furniture, try and see if you can hunt me...!`
`Tonight, two seeds of love have been sown.`
`...Including the one already sown, that makes three!`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}...`
` Why...did you leave me alone in this painful world...?`
` ......I detest you.`
` You are yearned after this much, and yet make no attempt to answer... I will detest you for all eternity!"`
`"My lord, drinking any more will be damaging to your health.`
` ...Haven't you also been warned by Doctor Nanjo?"`
`"Be silent, Genji!!`
` You do not understand, you do not understand my grief and sadness!`
` Even though I believed that as my oldest friend, at least you would understand my pain!!`
` Why is it so incomprehensible to you?!"`
`"Oooooohhh, {f:5:Beatriceeee},`
` why did you leave me alooooone......?!!"`
`"..........................."`
`"Uuuuughhu!`
` Hic, hic...!`
` What the hell is all that furniture stuff?!`
` What is all that crap...!`
` Uuuuuuuuuughhu!!"`
`"......Ohhh, how heartrending, Jessica‐sama.`
` ...Even though her crying voice that I can hear from her room tells me of the situation, there is nothing I can do."`
`"...This is all a tragedy due to people who are too young getting too close, when the positions of their birth are too distant.`
` ...I can do nothing but understand Milady's feelings, and walk away quietly with silent feet..."`
`"...Umm,`
` ...wh‐`
`what...`
`......do you mean by that,`
` George‐san...?"`
`"I mean what I said.`
` ......I still haven't built up my castle.`
` Once I have, I will be able to think of myself as an adult for the first time.`
` ......When that happens, I want to marry you."`
`"......Tha‐`
`...that's, umm,`
` ......err..."`
`"But,`
` my heart won't let me do just that anymore.`
` ......So I want to give you an engagement ring."`
`"En‐...engagement...`
`...you say...`
` But, umm,`
` ......I'm...`
` ......f‐`
`............furniture........."`
`"That's right.`
` And furniture has to listen to what people say."`
`"...I am currently having a ring made that's worthy to be a gift for you.`
` I think I'll probably be able to bring it to the family conference coming up soon.`
` I'll give it to you then, so please, I want you to let me hear your answer."`
`"......If you accept my engagement proposal,`
` I will proclaim right there, to all of the relatives, including Grandfather, my engagement to you."`
`"Geor‐......George‐san............"`
`"I'm sure some people won't approve of our relationship.`
` ...But there's no need to look at their faces.`
` ...Because you only have to fill your eyes with me."`
`"I will definitely make you happy.`
` That, I promise you, definitely."`
`I look forward to seeing how it will ripen!`
`The gold butterflies do not swoop upon the juice of overripe and rotting fruit.`
`I cannot wait for the day of harvest to come! Is the time of the banquet here yet?!{n}*cackle*cackle*hahahahahahahahahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!!``They had eaten breakfast at a coffee shop in the station building.`
`...By chance, the inside of the shop had been decorated with Halloween colors, since it was October.`
`It seemed that Maria had really taken a liking to that.`
`Ever since, she had been making a fuss inside the train about wanting to have a Halloween festival, without caring that she was attracting the attention of others.`
`Halloween is popular in Europe and America, but people are hardly familiar with it at all in Japan.`
`The shopping district was colorfully decorated with orange pumpkins,`
` but the costume parades of children demanding sweets and saying "trick or treat" were nowhere in sight.`
`"Uu!`
` I want a Halloween festivaaal!`
` I don't want to wear these clothes, I want to look like a wiiiitch!`
` Uu‐uu!"`
`"The family conference isn't for playing.`
` We're going to meet Grandfather, so you have to dress up nice."`
`While it wasn't completely full inside the train, there were enough people here that almost all of the seats were occupied.`
`Among them, Maria was making a fuss, kicking her feet back and forth in her seat, while Rosa scowled at her.`
`Rosa had told her many times in a low voice to stop, but Maria was taking no notice whatsoever.`
`...Once Maria gets this way, no matter how much you try to explain the situation or calm her, she doesn't listen.`
`In the past, Rosa used to pamper Maria and give in to her at times like this.`
`But, that had probably been the problem.`
`Almost certainly, the young Maria had formed the wrong impression that if she kept complaining noisily, her mother would give in, and listen to her.`
`That error had been brought to Rosa's attention through an educational book, and since then, she had hardened her heart so as not to pamper her beloved daughter...`
`But Rosa could manage less and less mutual understanding with Maria, and it had become more and more common that she felt discouraged by her own powerlessness...`
`"Halloween, Halloween!!`
` Trick or treat, uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`"I'm not giving you any sweets!`
` You just ate breakfast!"`
`"Trick or treat!`
` Trick or treat!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`As Maria kicked her feet, a stout old woman sitting in the seat across from Maria picked a candy out of her handbag and gave it to her.`
`"Uu! Got a treat, got a treat!`
` Look, look, Mama,`
` Mama!`
` Happy Hallowee~n!"`
`"Maria! You can't just accept sweets from strangers, remember?!`
` Return it!!"`
`"It's alright, hoh‐hoh‐ho.`
` She's a lovely young lady.`
` How old is she?"`
`There may not have been any malice in those words from the old woman.`
`{n}...But it seemed that Rosa had taken that in an extremely humiliating way.`
`"Maria! I'm always telling you not to accept sweets from strangers!!"`
`"Uu!`
` Uu!!`
` This one's mine!!`
` Uu‐`
`uu!!`
` No, it's mine!!"`
`"Let go of it!`
` Don't I always tell you to listen to what Mama says?!!"`
`"It's miiine!!`
` Miiiine!!`
` Uu!!`
` Uuu‐uuu!!"`
`"I told you, stop making that childish whining noise!!"`
`"Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu‐uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!!"`
`Rosa reflexively hit Maria violently on her cheek.`
`{n}...In a flash, Maria started crying loudly.`
`Rosa immediately snatched the candy from Maria's hand and stuck it out towards the dumbfounded old woman sitting next to them.`
`"...Please, do not just give sweets to my daughter!"`
`"...............I'm, ...I'm very sorry."`
`Breathing heavily, Rosa once again held the candy out to the old woman.`
`...The woman looked confused for a moment about what she should say,`
` but then understood that perhaps her actions may have caused trouble for this parent and child, and she accepted the candy back, apologizing...`
`Then, Rosa finally took notice of her surroundings...`
`Her daughter's clothes were all messed up, she was crying and shouting with her nose dripping,`
` and there were many dumbfounded passengers watching them.`
`...Except for the sound of the train running, the railcar was completely silent.`
`Fortunately, that pitiful silence didn't last more than a short while.`
`{n}...However, in its place came an even more painful atmosphere as everyone whispered.`
`Maria shouted, cried, kicked and stomped her feet as usual, paying no heed to the people sitting around her.`
`...Impulsively, Rosa tried to slap her again,`
` but she noticed the cold eyes of the people in the train, and couldn't do that anymore.`
`When the train stopped, Rosa got off, forcibly pulling Maria by the arm, and almost dragging her along the ground.`
`As usual, Maria didn't stop crying.`
`Rosa took her to the end of the platform and hit her cheek again.`
`At the moment she was hit, Maria stopped crying for an instant, but before long, she shouted and cried even more than before.`
`Rosa, whose emotions had exploded, grabbed Maria by her collar, and pulled her hair as if to rip it out.`
`"Uu!!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!!`
` Uu!!`
` Mama, it hurts, Mama, it hurts!!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`"Can't you hear me, I'm telling you to shut up!!`
` That "uu‐uu" of yours!`
` I'm telling you to STOP it!!"`
`"That's the reason you can't make friends in class, don't you get it?!`
` Get ahold of yourself!!`
` Why are you always a kindergartner inside your head?!!`
` Why can't you do what Mama says?!!`
` Why!!`
` WHY!!!"`
`Along with those severe words, Rosa hit Maria's head over and over again.`
`{n}The more Maria cried and shouted, the more Rosa hit her.`
`{n}And the more Maria was hit, the more intensely she cried and shouted...`
`"Mama, it hurts...!`
` Mama, it hurts...!`
` Mama, save me, Mama, save me...!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`"WHY can't you just STOP that whining?!!`
` It's because you're like this that you can't make friends!!`
` It's because you're like this that Papa never comes back from his business trip!!`
` It's because you're like this that I...!!"`
`"E‐...excuse me, ...madam, is something the matter...?"`
`"Is there {i:something}...that you {i:want}...?!"`
`The one who timidly called to her was the station attendant.`
`{n}Rosa glared at him with a look that said "don't cut into the problems of a mother and child, stranger".`
`The station attendant surely hadn't wanted to talk to her.`
`{n}However, Rosa had been yelling on the platform for a much longer time than she had imagined.`
`...Her emotional scolding had caused the passengers on the platform to advise the station attendant that it would be a good idea to speak to her.`
`Rosa yelled at the station attendant that they would get on the next train and not to bother them anymore.`
`...And then, finally, or maybe we should say, for the second time, ...she noticed the passengers on the platform staring at her from the distance.`
`......Rosa sweated slightly; she felt the wind chill the sweat, tormenting her.`
`Maria was still crying, shielding her own head.`
`{n}......No—unless this beating stopped, she would probably keep crying forever.`
`"........................`
`......I've...`
`............done it again......"`
`As Rosa recovered from the evil heat inside her head,`
` ...she knew she had surrendered her soul to something bad again.`
`"Mama, Mama!`
` Mama, come back...!`
` Uu!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`Rosa fell to her knees and hugged Maria, whose face was all soggy with tears and mucus.`
`"......Maria... I'm sorry... I'm sorry..."`
`"Mama, ......Mama...`
` Welcome back, welcome back......"`
`Finally, ...Maria realized that her mother had turned back to being her mother.`
`{n}Then, she clung to her mother's body and cried, burying her face in her mother's chest.`
`"...Forgive your bad mama...`
` Forgive your bad mama...`
` ......I'm so...sorry...!`
` Please don't hate your mama......."`
`"Uu...`
` I'm perfectly fine...`
` Won't hate Mama.`
` ......Mama was just being possessed by an evil witch again.`
` ...But Mama came back, so it's okay."`
`"Yeah... ......Yeah...`
` ......Mama was...being possessed by an evil witch again...`
` ...I'm sorry, ......I'm really sorry......."`
`For a long time, the two of them hugged each other, asking for forgiveness and sending words of forgiveness back.`
`After a while, the two of them gradually calmed down and naturally drew their faces apart.`
`Maria's face, Rosa's face—both were deep red after crying their eyes out.`
`"...Do you want to have a Halloween festival, Maria?"`
`"Yeah.`
` ...I wanted to show the pumpkin marshmallow to George onii‐chan and Jessica onee‐chan......"`
`That was a sweet which had been alongside the cash register at the shop where they had eaten breakfast.`
`......It was a fancy sweet that had a big orange marshmallow in the shape of a jack‐o'‐lantern stuck on the end of a stick.`
`Maria had wanted that and had insistently pestered for it.`
`{n}...Rosa had disallowed it, saying that there was no way she would buy such a sweet right after they'd had breakfast.`
`"......Okay, then, Maria.`
` ......I don't know if they sell those in this town or not, but let's get off and try searching for one, okay?"`
`"u, ......yeah!`
` Love you Mama, love you so much...`
` Thank you..."`
`"I love you too, Maria......."`
`The truth was that they had no time to waste loitering around at a stopover station.`
`{n}If they missed the airplane, they would fall half a day behind schedule.`
`She should have left home with more time to spare, but she had ended up leaving late after spending too long choosing Maria's clothes.`
`...Because of that, Rosa had been a bit impatient since the morning.`
`She looked at the clock.`
` ...They should be getting on the next train immediately.`
`But her daughter had firmly joined hands with her to go buy the sweet together, and that hand was warm.`
`...To Rosa right now, it was more important to regrow her bonds with Maria.`
`...Maria was not only Rosa's beloved daughter, ...she was everything Rosa had.`
`Fortunately, she could see that there was a big supermarket right in front of the station.`
`{n}...Maybe she wouldn't be able to find a sweet exactly like that one, but Maria would probably accept something similar.`
`Besides, Rosa also couldn't show up with a face swelled from crying.`
`{n}She would have to fix her makeup.`
`"We might not find a marshmallow exactly like that one, ...but I hope we can find a sweet that's similar.`
` ......And let's surprise all your cousins with it."`
`"Yeah.`
` ...If it's a sweet I bought together with Mama, anything is fine."`
`The two left the turnstiles of the station in this unknown town.`
`{n}Maria walked across the pedestrian crossing together with her mother, feeling very pleased, as though she was walking in an amusement park.`
`Both faces were still deep red,`
` ......but warmth could be seen between the two of them, mother and child, as they smiled at each other awkwardly...`
`".........Dear.`
` What are you doing in a place like this?"`
`"Oh, it's you.`
` .........It's nothing.`
` It's just that this was a pleasant place to think."`
`"...I have finished all the preparations for today.`
` For now, shall we relax and wait while drinking some tea?"`
`".........Sorry.`
` I'm always pushing all my problems on you."`
`"...Please.`
` Can't you rely on me more?`
` ...I am your wife."`
`"......Naturally, I'm grateful for you always coming to my aid.`
` ......For that very reason, I am able to devote myself to my work."`
`"I understand that.`
` ......About your work.`
` ......And the topic of Father's inheritance, right?"`
`"............That has nothing to do with you.`
` It's nothing more than my greedy siblings scavenging for rotten meat."`
`"......It's alright, dear.`
` ...Everything will work out.`
` Your work has never once turned out badly."`
`"....................."`
`Natsuhi softly cuddled close to Krauss's shoulder.`
`She spoke words to reward Krauss for the difficulties of his work, ...but Natsuhi was herself the one who knew best that it wasn't going well.`
`...Krauss's enterprises were something like a seesaw where large amounts of money swung.`
`A big investment leads to a large return,`
` but the swaying of a large‐scale seesaw is large yet sluggish, and not something which shows immediate results.`
`At times, he would make more investments so that the seesaw inclined faster towards the good side.`
`......Naturally, he did that because he had the confidence that, in a not‐so‐distant future, he would be able to recover all the investments made.`
`......However, the seesaws Krauss chose never turned out as he would have liked them to.`
`...His foresight wasn't wrong, ......but times were slow.`
`{n}They never caught up with him.`
`For example, think of a literal seesaw, placed in a park.`
`Due to its great popularity, there was always someone playing on it, so if he wanted to play, he would have to wait a long time for his turn.`
`...And then, one day, he found that seesaw vacant, straddled it realizing he was the first to arrive, and had it all to himself.`
`However, ...nobody got on the opposite side of the seesaw, so he couldn't play on it.`
`And no matter how much time passed, nobody came to the opposite side of the seesaw.`
`The seesaw is a popular piece of playground equipment, so if you waited, another person would definitely show up.`
`......Krauss noticed.`
`The weather looked like it was getting worse.`
`{n}That's why nobody was coming outside to play.`
`But the seesaw is a popular piece of playground equipment, so someone would definitely come.`
`...If he vacated his place because the weather seemed to be getting worse, someone would definitely snatch his place away,`
` and he would end up only longingly gazing from a distance, at someone else having fun playing on the seesaw again...`
`On one side of the seesaw, he continued to wait patiently, all alone...`
`{n}That was Krauss's current enterprise, and situation.`
`"............If only I'd had a bit more courage, ...and the self‐confidence to believe in my own foresight...`
`I'd never once......have failed."`
`"...Yes, that's true.`
` Your foresight is never wrong.`
` ......You are the only one who inherited Father's gift.`
` You inherited an innate disposition that none of the other siblings did."`
`"......Yet, I was unable to believe in it!`
` I always closed my own projects like a coward.`
` ......Why can't I trust myself?!`
` Who would trust a man who can't trust himself?`
` Nobody!!"`
`"......I'm always sitting myself down in the seats where the losers must sit;`
` ......my father, my mother,`
` ...and my siblings, all of them sneer at me...`
` How long before I am set free of this complex......`
` How long........."`
`...Only Natsuhi knew.`
`She knew of Krauss's anguish.`
` As the eldest son of the Ushiromiya family, who would have to shoulder a big responsibility, he couldn't open his pained heart to anyone, and would always be compared to his father's great enterprises...`
`".........I have finished all the preparations, so you can devote yourself to the family conference.`
` ...All of them."`
`"............Sorry.`
` ......Will there be any problems...`
`...with Father?"`
`"No.`
` ......Genji and Doctor Nanjo are on our side.`
` ...I'll never allow those greedy siblings to meet Father."`
`"Hello, Gohda here.`
` ......Yes, please leave it to me!`
` I'm anxious to put my skills to work for the big annual job."`
`Ingredients of varied colors had been gathered in the kitchen, and the preliminary arrangements had already been started.`
`Even though it was still morning, the ingredients for dinner were already in saucepans and steaming.`
`Normally, he had to deal with several assorted matters other than cooking, but on the day of the family conference, he could devote himself to it entirely.`
`To Gohda, who was originally a chef, this was surely the greatest gala occasion of the whole year.`
`"Yes, dinner will be an excellent calf steak...!`
` A wonderful cut of meat is already in the refrigerator anxiously waiting for tonight.`
` Please, let the other servants know to look forward to tonight—I will not disappoint them either."`
`It was rare for Gohda to be in this good of a mood towards his fellow servants.`
`To Gohda, who boasted about being a chef who worked exclusively for the Ushiromiya family, being given the right to show off his cooking at the family conference was the greatest honor.`
`"......OK.`
` I'm leaving it in your hands.`
` ...Also, is Kumasawa there?"`
`"Kumasawa‐san?`
` I happened to see her earlier, but she is not here.`
` I wonder if she went to make preparations at the guesthouse."`
`"......So she's loafing around again.`
` ......No, that's fine.`
` Alright then, I'm counting on you."`
`"Yes, leave everything to me...!"`
`Genji placed the telephone back on the receiver, sighing lightly.`
`Thinking of Kumasawa, who was no doubt hiding and slacking off even though things were this busy,`
` and the ostentatious Gohda, who only felt like doing anything on a day when he could show off, Genji sighed once again.`
`"Excuse me.`
` All the rooms in the guesthouse have been prepared."`
`"......We received instructions from Milady to make preparations for four people so that the children can stay there—what shall we do?"`
`"...I hear Battler‐sama is coming this year for the first time in six years.`
` I guess Milady wants to stay up late with the other three cousins.`
` ......Get them ready.`
` No need to tell Madam."`
`"I see.`
` Certainly."`
`"......So tonight, we'll have the late‐night shift, followed immediately by the morning shift tomorrow.`
` It looks like these two days will be tiresome."`
`"Speaking of that, the weather forecast is saying a typhoon will strike right over here...`
` Will that be alright?"`
`"...Unless the typhoon diverts greatly, it may affect the family's boat trip back, depending on circumstances.`
` The family conference schedule may drag on until about Monday or Tuesday.`
` ......It will probably be a long haul, but I ask you both to be careful not to make any blunders."`
`"............Shannon, relax and don't panic.`
` Kanon, be sure to greet them with courtesy."`
`"......Y‐yes.`
` I'll be careful."`
`"...I'll be careful."`
`"Today we will be entertaining a very important guest.`
` ...Make extra sure that everything goes smoothly."`
`"......I understand fully.`
` ...Any guest who visits here is important."`
`"Kanon.`
` ......We welcome, today,`
` an {i:important guest} in the truest sense.`
` Make sure you're prepared."`
`"......Yes."`
`".........Shannon, what's wrong?`
` ...You've been looking restless... Did you promise to be somewhere?"`
`"Huh?`
` N‐no, it's nothing.`
` My apologies..."`
`"Nee‐san.`
` An important guest will be arriving today.`
` ...Detach yourself from your private life."`
`"I don't, ...I don't know what you mean by private life..."`
`As Shannon blushed just a bit, she turned her gaze away from the clock.`
`......Was it about time for the airplane carrying the family to arrive at Niijima?`
`{n}...She had thought she had been hiding the fact that her long‐awaited reunion with George was making her heart palpitate, but Kanon, who stood at her side, understood her perfectly.`
`".........Shannon, please accept this from me without a word...!"`
`...Inside a bathroom stall, George was practicing something over and over, taking out a small velvet box hidden in his pocket like a quick‐draw desert gunman.`
`"That's not it...`
` Shannon likes a man with traction.`
` It, it must have a more powerful feel to it...!"`
`"Shannon, put this on your ring finger.`
` ...Tha‐that's an order, okay...?"`
`"Aah, if I don't say properly that it's on the left hand, maybe she'll put it on the right hand!`
` N‐no, Shannon isn't that ignorant,`
` aaah, but, if there's no free will, that'd be a little, I mean,`
` uuuuuu, nnnnuuuuuuu, muuuuuuuaaaaaaaaahhhh...!!"`
`As he crossed his arms, moaning and groaning, someone knocked on the door.`
`{n}George was startled back to reality.`
`"Hey, George‐kun.`
` You alright?`
` Got a stomachache or something?"`
`"Ah, ahahahaha, Uncle Rudolf...!`
` It's alright, I'm fine!`
` No need to worry, ahahahahahaha...!"`
`"You sure...?`
` OK then.`
` Don't strain too much.`
` Your ass'll burst."`
`Rudolf washed his hands, laughing cheerfully, and left.`
`...George knew that the most embarrassing part hadn't been overheard, and he patted his chest in relief...`
`"Kyrie, isn't Rosa here yet?"`
`"Not yet.`
` She's pretty late."`
`"It's a good thing the weather's delaying our flight.`
` If the schedule had been like normal, she'd've missed the plane by now.`
` What would she have done then?"`
`"...Rosa‐san is an adult now.`
` She'd manage it somehow.`
` No matter how old they get, older brothers always treat their younger sisters like children."`
`"Dad's always a kid, no matter how old he gets."`
`"What'd you say? If I'm a kid, that'd make you a baby.`
` Come on, Battler‐chan, up ya go~!"`
`"Stop it, that tickles, wahahaha, stooop!"`
`"You two look more like a couple of naughty kids than a father and son.`
` ...Look, she's here."`
`"Ohoooooooooh!!!`
` If it isn't Rosa‐san!`
` Maria‐chan, long time no see!!"`
`"Long time no seee!`
` Uu!"`
`"Maria!`
` Shouldn't that be "It's good to see you again"?`
` Greet your uncle properly."`
`"Uu.`
` It's...good to see you again..."`
`"There you go!`
` Well said!`
` How about some candy as a reward?!`
` ......Oh, huh?`
` Where'd I put 'em..."`
`"Rosa‐san, it's good to see you again.`
` It's good to see you too, Maria‐chan."`
`"It's been too long, Kyrie nee‐san, Hideyoshi nii‐san.`
` ...And......oh my, Battler‐kun?!`
` Look how big you've gotten...!"`
`"Ah, come on, hahaha...`
` It's embarrassing hearing that from every person I meet...!"`
`"Hey, Rosa.`
` You're late.`
` If the plane was on time, you'd barely have made it..."`
`"I'm sorry.`
` We had some trouble making our train connection.`
` So we're waiting on the weather yet again?"`
`"Oh, don't complain.`
` I much prefer the thirty‐minute plane trip to spending six hours bouncing about on a boat.`
` Even if we're kept waiting here for an hour, it's still much faster overall."`
`"Is that Maria...?`
` She sure has gotten big...`
` She's at that growing age..."`
`"You last met her...six years ago?`
` Of course she'd change.`
` Women are creatures who can be born anew in a single day, and all it takes is a change of heart."`
`"......Uu?"`
`Maria noticed a big man who she didn't remember mixed among the relatives, and hid behind Rosa's back, glaring at Battler.`
`"Hey, Battler, say hi.`
` The last time you met her, she was just three years old, so this might as well be the first time."`
`"Yeah, I guess she wouldn't remember if she was three!`
` Hey Maria, long time no see.`
` You sure have gotten big!"`
`"Maria.`
` This is Battler onii‐chan.`
` Uncle Rudolf's son.`
` ...Understand?"`
`"............Uncle's son is...`
` Uncle's the son...`
` ............??`
` ......Uuuu!!"`
`She was obviously on her guard.`
`{n}She must have found it frightening for a large guy like Battler to suddenly start speaking frankly to her.`
`Battler noticed that as well, and thought of various ways he might approach her.`
`Then, he noticed the sweet she had in her hand.`
`It was the jack‐o'‐lantern sweet that Rosa had bought for her.`
`"Oh, right, it's October, so that must be for Halloween.`
` Ihihihi, trick or treee~at!"`
`If you try to take a treat away from a small child, normally, you'd expect them to cry and start a fuss.`
`The adults thought that method wasn't good, but surprisingly, Maria looked pleased, her face splitting into a wide grin.`
`"Halloween, Halloween!!`
` See, Mama, Battler knows about Halloween too, see, see!!"`
`"Hey, call him Battler onii‐chan!`
` Sorry, Battler‐kun."`
`"No, no, I don't care.`
` Call me Battler.`
` And I'll call you Maria, too.`
` Come on, Maria, it's Halloween!`
` Trick or treeee~at!!"`
`"Trick or treeee~at!!`
` Kyahahaha, *giggle*giggle*!!"`
`From inside her handbag, Maria picked out a jack‐o'‐lantern sweet identical to the one she had in her hand, and presented it to Battler.`
`It seemed that Battler accepting it was enough to confirm their friendship.`
`The adults felt admiration at how children have their own ways of communicating.`
`To Maria, who had been complaining that she wanted to have a Halloween festival,`
` it must have felt like Battler was a friend, since he knew about trick or treat.`
`Her defensive posture from before was completely gone.`
`{n}Now, she was all merry, as though they had been friends for decades.`
`"Yeah, Halloween's a minor event in Japan, isn't it...`
` You often see people parading around in costume on the news over there, but I've never seen it in Japan."`
`"I wanted to wear a costume too.`
` Wanted to do trick or treat with all the cousins wearing costumes..."`
`"Yeah, I bet you did. Let's us two do it together sometime!`
` What would you want to go around as?"`
`"A witch!!`
` {f:5:Beatrice}!"`
`"Oh, Milady, what are you doing in such a place?`
` Madam was looking for you."`
`"I'm here 'cause I don't {i:want} to be found.`
` ...I bet she only wants to nag at me anyway, all that crap like "is your appearance alright?" and "mind how you speak"."`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho...`
` Without a doubt."`
`"......You know.`
` When the day of the family conference comes, for some reason, I start getting weird feelings about this witch."`
`"Hoh...`
` Whyever do you say that...?"`
`"The family conference is the day when everyone related to Grandfather gathers.`
` ......Like, I hear Battler's coming for the first time in six years, this year.`
` ...Same kind of thing.`
` I always wonder whether some "relative" who hasn't shown themselves for several decades might suddenly turn up."`
`"............Hohoh.`
` Could a relative like that exist...?"`
`"I'm talking about that {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` ......Nobody knows her background.`
` Could she be Grandfather's mistress from long ago?`
` ......Maybe one of her descendants will suddenly show up and tell us to give back the gold we were granted or something, you know?"`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho...`
` Krauss‐sama and the others will probably have a discussion about the problem of the Master's inheritance this year too.`
` ...With such excitement abound over talk of the witch's gold, I don't suppose it would be strange at all if the witch herself who granted that gold finally made her appearance."`
`"Kumasawa‐san, you know,`
` ...sure, you're always quitting one moment and working the next, but you've been here as long as Genji‐san, right?`
` ......You know more, about {f:5:Beatrice}, don't you?"`
`"......Well, I wonder.`
` Hoh‐hoh‐ho...`
` Even if I try to remember, this old woman here can't even recall what she had for breakfast this morning..."`
`"Kumasawa‐san, you're always escaping with those excuses, but you know something, right?`
` Sometimes I feel a kinda devious atmosphere about you, like you know something and you're laughing behind our backs..."`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho... How harsh.`
` ...I don't have any secrets.`
` ......The only thing I can say...`
`is that {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama is the Golden Witch, and that she is the other master who controls the night of this island."`
`"That's second‐hand talk from Grandfather.`
` Even though you get paid, it must be a pain to go along with Grandfather's tales."`
`"......But, I can say this much."`
`"...What?"`
`"......In ancient times, Rokkenjima was feared, and called "{ruby:Azuki Bean Island:Azukijima}".`
` The story told among the fishermen is that "Azuki" was a mispronounced form of "Akujiki", and in fact it was called "{ruby:Evil Appetite Island:Akujikijima}"."`
`"I've heard this before.`
` It's that story about how, 'cause of all the sunken rocks and shipwrecks around here, the fishermen got afraid and stayed away as much as they could, right?"`
`"......Evil spirits had settled down in Akujikijima, devouring human souls from time immemorial.`
` ...There were all too many people who got involved with this island and were dispossessed of their lives."`
`"And it all settled down when a traveling mountain ascetic or someone built that shrine and laid those souls to rest, right?`
` ...What a shady story."`
`"They say that shrine was destroyed by an eerie violet thunderbolt this summer, which tore through the darkness of the night..."`
`"Kumasawa‐san, you really like those stories, don't you?`
` Sure, it'd be pretty creepy if a thunderbolt wiped out the shrine keeping the dead at peace.`
` But, well, it was all worn out from the start.`
` I bet it just got carried away by some large wave.`
` Hahahahaha."`
`"The evil spirits of Akujikijima woke up from their sleep, and summoned {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` .........So if {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama ever happened to come for the family conference, then..."`
`"Then...?"`
`Kumasawa kept silent for a moment there.`
`{n}...Jessica, who wanted her to keep going, found that silence very eerie.`
`Once Kumasawa was satisfied that she had spooked Jessica just the right amount, she grinned broadly.`
`"Well now, I wonder what would happen.`
` Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho..."`
`"Whoa, that sounds wonderful."`
`"It does, doesn't it?`
` Isn't it useful for your work to enrich your heart and have an elegant time every once in a while...?"`
`"I think so.`
` The heart and the wallet must be rich.`
` Got it, I'll keep that day open.`
` Please, make the reservations."`
`"Will do.`
` No backing out!"`
`"Yeah, let's make it happen.`
` I love you, Kyrie."`
`After kissing the receiver, Rudolf hung up.`
`...In front of his seat, there were many executives with their sleeves rolled up, eagerly awaiting the end of that phone call.`
`"Sorry about the wait.`
` Have we had contact from America?"`
`"Yes.`
` It's from our lawyer Dale Watanabe on the external line.`
` I'll transfer it."`
`"......Overall, how do you feel about the situation?"`
`"Well, I'm afraid......it seems it is not all that favorable.`
` It seems they have no plans of withdrawing from the trial."`
`"......Looks like we can't fool 'em after all.`
` Tahaha...`
` Please, transfer it here."`
`"Very well.`
` Right away."`
`The executive ordered the secretarial office to connect him to the external line.`
`{n}Immediately, the telephone in front of Rudolf started ringing.`
`"Hello.`
` <Hello, hello>!`
` Apologies for the wait, Ushiromiya speaking.`
` Good day, good day.`
` How is it going over there?"`
`"<Hello, President Ushiromiya>.`
` Let's skip the greetings and get right down to business.`
` I have good news and bad news; which one shall we start with?"`
`"...The bad news can go first.`
` I can't fight if there's no dessert."`
`"Very well.`
` The bad news is that they have started preparing to prosecute us.`
` Just a few days ago, a verdict was handed down in a similar trial, overwhelmingly in favor of the plaintiff.`
` The defendants were also making roughly the same arguments as us, but they were rejected in everything."`
`"I'm afraid to say it, but if we face the courtroom as we are now, the probability that our argument will be rejected in its entirety is extremely high."`
`"...So that other trial was a disaster.`
` ......And I was thinking their conditions were more favorable than ours.`
` That's tough.`
` Then, what about the good news?"`
`"I managed to get in contact with their executives.`
` I explained our situation to them,`
` explained that we have no intention of tarnishing their brand image, and I managed to get their understanding."`
`"They will offer us conditions in a few days, and if these are carried out, they promised to withdraw from the prosecution.`
` This comes straight from the number‐two man on their board of directors."`
`"Your impression?"`
`"Honestly, I expect the conditions will be extremely severe.`
` I would assume that changing the company name and the brand name will be inevitable.`
` Where we do have margin in the negotiations is the amount of settlement money, the appearance of a public apology in a major newspaper, and the amount of time needed to carry out those things."`
`"Why don't they just come straight out with it and tell us to go bankrupt."`
`"They changed to their second president only a couple of years ago, and the new president doesn't have a firm foothold on the position yet.`
` If we resist until the bitter end, they fear that the forces who want to go against the current president wouldn't hesitate to do some work in favor of the enemy."`
`"Hence, it seems the big shots over there want to settle this matter as fast as possible too.`
` Therefore, for the sake of a quick settlement, we may still have enough leeway to pull for some mitigation of the conditions."`
`"At any rate, an absurd amount of money will be necessary, I guess."`
`"You need to be prepared for that.`
` And even so, I believe it will be much cheaper than disciplinary compensation."`
`"Thank you very much.`
` If there's any more progress, please contact me.`
` You bill highly, so I can't even chat around idly with you.`
` Hahahaha.`
` <Thank you, thank you, goodbye>."`
`Rudolf hung up the phone.`
`It seemed that the executives sitting in the reception seats could guess what had been said.`
`"......You get all that, you reprobates?`
` Well, to sum up.`
` If we can just pay them off, they're gonna let it slide.`
` All we have to do now is turn our focus onto how much."`
`"But, President.`
` The sum that Mr. Watanabe estimated for the settlement is too much.`
` We don't have that much of a margin...!"`
`"If we'd have known this was going to happen, we never should have started diversifying..."`
`"The calculations were that we could escape the capital crisis if we were able to endure for three years.`
` ...To be stabbed at this juncture is just...incredibly unfortunate...!"`
`"I guess we tripped and fell at the "step" of the "hop, step, jump".`
` I could cry."`
`"We have no choice but to draw the money from the main bank."`
`"Banks are no good.`
` They only bet their money on winning horses.`
` ...The situation is getting better, but we can't show weakness to the banks."`
`"......President.`
` Do you have any funds which are unaccounted for?`
` Funds that we aren't aware of?"`
`"Stop that.`
` Do I look like that kind of man?`
` The contents of my wallet are all exposed to you guys, alright?`
` The account books over there show all that our company has."`
`"In that case, ......we need to raise money.`
` We need a sponsor, who can draw in several million dollars for us, as soon as possible."`
`"......President!`
` Couldn't something be worked out with one of your associates...?!"`
`"President!`
` President...!"`
`"...Aaaah, calm down, you bastards.`
` ......I'll find a way to raise the money.`
` You guys just maintain the business and try not to fall to pieces.`
` They're saying they'll forgive us so long as we hand over the money."`
`"We already have thick pipelines in Asia.`
` This'll probably have consequences all over the place, but we can still maintain our deals.`
` The point is, this is a problem that can be entirely resolved just by handing over money."`
`"Just watch, I'll settle everything.`
` I won't let you out in the cold.`
` Start feeling like you're in good hands!`
` When this is all over, I'll be rewarding all of you guys with a champagne tower.`
` I promise.`
` So, just shut up and follow me.`
` Alright?!!"`
`The airplane suddenly shook.`
` Probably because of turbulence.`
`That shaking roused Rudolf from his sleep.`
`{n}He had woken up early that morning, and had ended up drifting off to sleep while resting in his seat.`
`"...Are you alright?`
` You're still very drowsy, aren't you?`
` You've been so busy with work lately."`
`"It's a damned good thing I am busy with work.`
` If I suddenly find myself with nothing to do, we'll all be out in the cold starting the next day."`
`"You're right.`
` Battler‐kun's come back now, so I'm afraid we can't just go around begging if things get rough."`
`"......Yeah.`
` We've finally got our whole family back after six years.`
` ...The man of the house is gonna have to give his best so we can all spend some family time together..."`
`When he looked outside the window, he saw that the airplane was already starting to drop in altitude considerably.`
`The fishing boats, which had only looked like black grains until a short while ago, had become clearly visible.`
`".........If I could prostrate myself before Dad and borrow ten mil in exchange for a punch to the head, I'd take at least a dozen, but...`
` Failing that, he'd better hurry and give up the ghost."`
`" .........I've mooched off him so much over the years, and now I'm going for the inheritance.`
` ............I'm going to hell.`
` ...It won't surprise me a bit if he doesn't want to see me......"`
`"......Could it be that you don't plan on appearing at the family conference this year either?"`
`Nanjo looked at Kinzo's face, sighing.`
`{n}...Kinzo's eyes remained rooted to those strange magic books.`
`"I have no intention of joining those vultures in their discussion.`
` They can discuss how they will suck my bones as they wish.`
` ......They are not worth a moment of my time."`
`".....................`
` ...My, my.`
` How troublesome..."`
`Nanjo shook his head slightly.`
`...To him, children and grandchildren were to be adored.`
`{n}And he believed that their growth was the only enjoyment for old men.`
`He found Kinzo's words to be a very sad thing.`
`"If the time comes when I must leave this room, I will show myself then.`
` ......Just as that one does not show itself."`
`Kinzo raised his face, and in the direction of his gaze was the portrait of the witch, respectfully displayed on the wall...`
`".................."`
`Inside Kinzo's head, there was no conception of today being the day of the family conference, the day when all his dear family would gather together.`
`......There was only the face of the witch in the oil painting, who never smiled outside her portrait...`
`Everybody knew that when Kinzo talked about {f:5:Beatrice}, unnecessarily cutting in would instigate his wrath...`
`"Today, I will...perform a certain ritual."`
`"Hoh.`
` ...And what would that be?"`
`"......It would be more accurate to call it a gamble.`
` ...After all, no miracles dwell in magic without risk."`
`Nanjo had already heard this countless times.`
`{n}You could call it Kinzo's favorite phrase.`
`......It seemed that Kinzo believed in magic and miracles arising through betting his own fate with a certain kind of risky probability and beating the odds...`
`"Kinzo‐san, you may once have been called the Golden Gambler,`
` but I cannot imagine what kind of gamble you will take on with that aged body, when you could go to the other world at any time...`
` I guess this will be worth seeing..."`
`"Hmph...`
` ......I see.`
` So, if it were up to you, unversed in magic, even this secret ritual I have thoroughly researched would be branded as a gamble.`
` So be it."`
`"...............If it is I, a believer in miracles, who wins...`
`you will be able to understand clearly that all my research, which probably only appears as vagary in your eyes, did bear fruit on this day.`
` If you win,`
` ......it will all end as, just as you observed, nothing more than the vagary of an old man who could go to the other world at any time."`
`"Hoh...`
` I wonder what on Earth is this gamble you will start...`
` As your friend, I only pray that you come out from that bet—no, was it a ritual?`
` ...I only pray, from the bottom of my heart, that you can come out from that ritual victorious."`
`"Mmhm... ...I thank you."`
`"......Speaking of that, Kinzo‐san.`
` I hear that a long‐awaited guest will be present at the family conference this year?"`
`"What......?"`
`Kinzo reacted in a unusual way to Nanjo's words and turned around.`
`"You know, Battler‐kun from Rudolf‐san's family.`
` I hear he will be coming for the first time in six years.`
` I'm sure he has become a splendid boy."`
`"............Oh, Battler.`
` ...I wouldn't describe a guest who has been away a scant six years as "long‐awaited"."`
`Upon hearing Battler's name, he showed an ill‐humored expression, as though he had been let down, and turned his back to Nanjo again.`
`"I guess these six years went by in a blink of an eye to you, sunk in your research in this room..."`
`"Hmph.`
` ......Perhaps a truly long‐awaited guest...`
`......will pay us a visit.`
` .........Everything depends on the results of the roulette.`
` ...The roulette is already starting to revolve.`
` Rouge, or noir?"`
`"............Tonight, let us enjoy ourselves as we see what kind of miracle the roulette will show us.`
` ...The payoffs are large.`
` And I don't feel like losing...`
` ......{f:5:Beatrice}, ...you shall accept my bet........."`
`Just then, the telephone on the table rang.`
`That piercing noise seemed to displease Kinzo, and he picked up the receiver in order to preserve the silence as much as he could.`
`"......What is it?`
` I'm busy."`
`"It is Genji.`
` The family has arrived."`
`"And what does that have to do with me?`
` You can serve them some tea or something."`
`"...Certainly.`
` I will see to it."`
`Kinzo hung up the phone rudely.`
`Watching him, Nanjo sighed yet again, and shifted his attention outside the window.`
`As he was now, Kinzo would probably show no interest in any kind of guest.`
`...Was there any guest who could make Kinzo agree to come out when he should?`
`He had one person in mind, but that guest was one who could not possibly appear...`
`After a glance at the witch of the portrait, and her candid expression which he could not place as happy or sad, Nanjo gazed up at the leaden sky......`
`Now then, are the pieces all lined up......?`
`{n}Let us start a new game, with the pieces all lined up once more.`
`"Are there any problems...?"`
`"......Nope."`
`The witch looked at him in challenge while elegantly smoking her pipe.`
`And Battler?`
`{n}He just slovenly shrugged his shoulders as though she wasn't worth his time.`
`He wouldn't look her in the eyes.`
`{n}But that didn't mean he wasn't going to play.`
`...It signified his plain determination to never be taken in by the artifices of this being he faced.`
`{n}It was an expression of his powerful determination to fight.`
`"Don't tell me you don't have a plan...?"`
`"I don't know how you're going to play, so no, I don't have any plan.`
` ...Feel free to take the first move."`
`"Hmph... Naturally, I intend to.`
` In what way shall I destroy your defense?`
` In how many moves will I checkmate you?`
` ......That is how I will display my skills."`
`"............Whatever moves you come at me with, I will never believe in you!`
` ...As long as I stand my ground on that one point, I won't lose.`
` And what that means is this.`
` The way this game is made, you cannot win...!"`
`"Maybe you're right.`
` However...`
` I shall decide how many times we'll repeat this game.`
` It will be repeated over and over again, until I win and you admit defeat...!"`
`"In other words, this is torment.`
` Eternal torment that will continue until you surrender to me...!`
` Continuing eternally, until you acknowledge me and the existence of witches!"`
`"......In that case, I'll go along with you endlessly, any number of times, until you run out of patience.`
` I've never lost in such a "battle of wills"."`
`"Did some witch or other suggest that to you...?`
` *cackle*cackle*, that's just fine...!"`
`"I'm tired of listening to your rambling.`
` ...C'mon, get this started!"`
`"Come, let us begin!`
` I already know your moves far too well.`
` A defense doesn't amount to much if the plan behind it is known!`
` Don't think you'll be able to defy me with the same moves!!"`
`"......{f:5:Beatrice}.`
` I have only one thing to tell you before we start."`
`"What is it...?"`
`"You're free to say anything.`
` But when it comes to whether I believe or not,`
` that is always`
` for me`
` to decide...!"`
`"No matter how great your magic is!`
` My soul won't yield to you.`
` You think this will be torture for me?`
` You're wrong!!"`
`"Then, what would you call it...!"`
`"This is torture for you!!"`
`"Someday you will yield to me and give up!`
` Until then, you'll be tortured over and over again!"`
`"How amusing, a fine metaphor!!`
` Torture where we torment each other, how truly amusing!`
` Come, we shall begin that torture!!`
` Ushiromiya Battleeeeer!!!"``Every year, the relatives who visit Rokkenjima let out a sigh of admiration at the rose garden which first greets them...`
`They stood there talking with each other about the roses' beauty and the state of their blooming this year.`
`There was a single unhealthy rose among them, and Maria became overwhelmed with dejection at its state.`
`But George used his quick wits,`
` and saying she should look after it if she felt that sorry for it, he marked it with a candy wrapper, and immediately restored Maria's good mood.`
`And once Battler, with whom she had been getting along well all morning, raised the subject of Halloween that Maria loved so much, she began playing around energetically again.`
`To Maria,`
` those marshmallow jack‐o'‐lantern candies that her mother had bought for her were probably a treasure greater than any other.`
`...It seemed that several of them had been bought for her, and she demanded trick‐or‐treat from every person she met, giving them candy instead of the other way around.`
`"I wonder why Maria likes Halloween so much.`
` I thought that event was pretty difficult for Japanese people to get used to."`
`"Isn't that because it's a kid's festival where they get to parade around in costumes?`
` It's fun to play around in an outfit that's different than usual."`
`"No, ...I think there's probably a slightly deeper reason.`
` After all, she is Maria‐chan "the witch"."`
`"Come to think of it, when we were at the airport, didn't Maria say that if she was going to wear a costume, it would be a witch?`
` Does Maria like witches?"`
`"......Yes, she loves them.`
` So much that it becomes a problem."`
`"Well,`
` admiring fantastical stuff like that is to be expected at that age."`
`"If she'd at least chosen a heroine of some TV anime to admire, that would've been cute...`
` ...haah."`
`Judging by Rosa's reactions, it seemed that, as a mother, she did not find her daughter's love for witches pleasant.`
`Seemingly all the cousins other than Battler were able to understand this, and they shrugged their shoulders, smiling awkwardly.`
`"Hmmmm?`
` So if you like witches, you also like Halloween, is that how it works?"`
`"I guess I should just ask her myself if I don't know.`
` Hey, Maria.`
` What kind of relationship do Halloween and witches have with each other?"`
`As Battler asked that, George and Jessica let out a small "ah—" noise.`
`...It seemed they were too late.`
`It almost looked as though Maria had been waiting for that question.`
`After looking happy for an instant, her expression turned a little mean, as if to say "You don't know anything, do you?"`
`It was the expression of an enthusiast who has been enraged by the ignorant statement of an outsider with a wrong impression.`
`"Uu.`
` ...The Celts thought of the changing strength of the sun over the course of a year...`
`as its birth, its growing‐up period, its aging and death, and then its revival."`
`"I get it.`
` The sun, weak and warm in spring, starts to grow up and become hot,`
` and then it gradually gets weaker and worn out... Yeah, I can see how you could think of that as the passing of the sun's life."`
`"Yep.`
` So they thought that at the end of October, the sun died, rested its body in the land of the dead, and then revived again at the winter solstice.`
` And so, they celebrated the day that the sun ends its one‐year lifespan and dies, calling it New Year's Eve, or Samhain."`
`"That way of thinking is very interesting, to say that the sun is "revived" on the day of the winter solstice, when the daylight hours start to grow longer again.`
` It's an episode that makes you understand how much ancient people deified the sun."`
`"...I seeee.`
` And? What do witches have to do with this?"`
`It seemed that my casual urging forward had slightly infuriated Maria.`
`She glared at me with eyes that told me to let her explain without interrupting.`
`......Maria looked like she was having fun telling me, so I decided not to interrupt...`
`"In the interval between October and November, life and death become the closest they ever will.`
` ...The Celts believed that this was the time when the world of the living was at its closest to that of the dead and those not of this world,`
` and when they would be visited by many inhabitants of the other world."`
`"......It was like the Bon festival in Japan.`
` Kihihihihi."`
`At the time, the people believed that the souls returning to the physical world would go into people's houses or possess people to do bad things.`
`So in order to avoid harm from them, the people invented protective rituals.`
`One of those was to imitate creepy monsters and scare the souls instead, which was apparently a way to avoid being possessed.`
`"So that part became a festival, which turned into a costume parade.`
` ...Maria's really knowledgeable!"`
`"......Ain't it the truth.`
` Even I never knew Halloween had such a history."`
`"But where did the whole "trick or treat" thing come from?"`
`Her knowledge was so extensive that the adults had started listening in too at some point.`
` Maria, who was normally always treated like the youngest, puffed out her chest in pride.`
`Rosa tried to say this was just a kid's story, and that she wanted to quickly break up the circle and set the luggage down in the guesthouse,`
` but nobody else agreed, and she let out a heavy sigh.`
`"Uu.`
` Trick or treat is just for fun.`
` It has nothing to do with what was originally a Celtic ceremony.`
` That was created later when Christian customs were mixed in.`
` ...But I think that Halloween should be that way."`
`According to Maria, the souls of the dead weren't the only ones who visited from the world of the nonhuman;`
` there were also spirits that had an intimate connection to how people lived.`
`It was because humans received the favors of those spirits that they were able to earn a wonderful blessing,`
` and a year's worth of good crops.`
`"So in other words, Halloween was also a bit of a harvest festival?"`
`"I see.`
` ...Now you mention it, I get the feeling that October is a turning point in various ways, seasonally too.`
` I mean, it's exactly on the other side of the year to Japan's April.`
` ......Yeah, that might be a good place to mark it."`
`"Uu!`
` And you know, the witches, they held a coven during that time, called a Sabbat.`
` The witches would thank the spirits that gave out blessings of prosperity, and reward them."`
`"Halloween costumes are an imitation of the visitors from the other side.`
` ......So, then, the reason we give candy to them must be because of a feeling that they should be thanked for the yearly harvest."`
`"Uu!`
` Just like George onii‐chan says!"`
`"So Halloween is a time when this world and that world intermingle?`
` So, in other words, it's a precious opportunity for witches to interact with visitors from that world.`
` Is that what you want to say?"`
`"Uu!!`
` Just like Battler says!"`
`"So you know what?`
` You know what?!`
` October is the time when the power of witches and demons is at its most vigorous and prosperous!`
` Kihihihihihihihi, I'm sure {f:5:Beatrice} will come too!"`
`"And then, we'll eat the marshmallow candies together, and she'll take me to the Golden Land with her!`
` We'll sing magical songs together, learn magic spells together, learn how to draw magic circles together!`
` And then I'm going to learn the secrets of runes, and become a great witch really, really quickly!"`
`"My, my, isn't that wonderful.`
` It's best for kids to have dreams.`
` By the way, Rosa,`
` how old did Maria‐chan turn this year again...?"`
`"Ma‐...Maria...`
` That's enough of that topic!"`
`"Don't worry about it, Rosa‐san.`
` It's a dream that any girl has at one time or another."`
`"Tha‐thank you very much.`
` ...But Maria has already outgrown that age.`
` ...Hey, I'm telling you to stop!"`
`Rosa scolded Maria, trying to shut her up before her cheery discussion about black magic earned her the snickers of the relatives.`
`"Wow...`
` That's a pretty large‐scale dream.`
` ......By the way, who was {f:5:Beatrice} again?`
` ......What was it, umm, umm, I've heard that before..."`
`Battler had been gone for six years, and had completely forgotten about the legend of the Rokkenjima witch.`
`However, when he said that he didn't know {f:5:Beatrice}'s name, Maria's mood, which had been so bright until just now, became sour in an instant.`
`When he saw that, Battler immediately remembered that it was the name of the witch of this island, but the damage had been done.`
`...Until Maria's mood improved, many mysterious and fabulous episodes regarding the Golden Witch were drilled into his brain...`
`"That is enough, Maria.`
` Thank you, Battler‐kun, for going along with her stories."`
`"...Kanon‐kun, don't you have work to do?`
` Please leave now.`
` Gohda‐san, I think everyone wants to set down their bags for the time being.`
` Sorry, but could you guide everyone to the guesthouse?"`
`"Certainly.`
` ...Well then, everyone, I will guide you to the guesthouse."`
`"......Then if you will excuse me."`
`Led by Gohda, the relatives headed off in the direction of the guesthouse.`
`Their minds on setting down their luggage and taking a quick rest, they didn't notice that Rosa and Maria had stayed in the same spot.`
`After watching them leave towards the guesthouse, Rosa's features changed suddenly.`
`She let go with the hand that had been gripping Maria's arm the whole time.`
`...There was a bright red mark there, making it clear how much excessive force she had been gripping Maria's slender arm with.`
`That hand then smacked Maria over the head, and pulled her left ear up into the air, pinching it sharply...`
`"I'm always telling you not to talk about witches......`
` ...Haven't I always said that was our promise together......?"`
`"Mama, it hurts, Mama, it hurts... It hurts it hurts it hurts......"`
`"Halloween, Halloween, do you ever stop...?`
` A witch festival...?`
` Who cares about the Celts, who cares about black magic, are you an {i:idiot}......?`
` You are nine years old, nine..."`
`"Because you made that ruckus in the train, I had to go to all the trouble of getting off and buying you those disgusting monster marshmallows that look they have fluorescent paint on them...`
` We were even late because I bought them for you.`
` How much more will you have to embarrass me before you're satisfied......?!"`
`As Rosa cursed, she twisted Maria's ear up, making it seem like it was going to snap off...`
`An expression of anguish spread across Maria's face, and she stood on her tiptoes as though her life depended on it, trying to soften the pain on the ear that was being pulled...`
`Rosa suddenly stole the candy that Maria had been holding in her hand.`
`Then she threw it on the ground and stepped on it over and over.`
`To Maria, it was supposed to be proof of her memory of that span of time, however brief, when she had enjoyed going shopping with her mother...`
`But it was being trampled by that very same mother.`
`{n}...It was as though a brand was being pushed against Maria's eyes, leaving a mark that couldn't be erased...`
`"Who cares about this disgusting candy,`
` disgusting, disgusting...!!"`
`"This is {i:why}, you see?! {i:This} is why!!`
` Disgusting disgusting disgusting!!!"`
`She struck Maria's head over and over again with her palm as she spoke.`
`{n}...She didn't hit Maria's face. Because the red swelling would stand out.`
`Maria closed her eyes tightly, patiently bearing her mother's violence...`
` ...No, that wasn't quite it.`
`".......Come back, Mama, come back, Mama...`
` Save me, Mama, save me, Mama...`
` Beat the bad witch......"`
`She kept bearing it, muttering that over and over...`
`"Will you LISTEN!!`
` I TOLD you...`
`to STOP...`
`saying...`
`witch!!`
` You little...`
` You... You...!!!"`
`Rosa's shoulders shook as she breathed, tired from hitting.`
`...Maria grasped her hands together, withstanding it, hoping her "mother" would come back quickly...`
`"......Mama, Mama...`
` Come back quickly...`
` Save me, Mama......`
` Finish off the bad witch......"`
`"Why don't you, ...why don't you just stay there doing that forever!!`
` And then you can just stand there, mumbling about witches and Halloween forever!!"`
`After throwing those words at Maria, Rosa went off towards the guesthouse, leaving Maria behind.`
`...Maria, unable even to remember that it was alright to cry,`
` kept staring down at the trampled, unrecognizable jack‐o'‐lantern candy...`
`"Oh, Rosa.`
` Where did you go?"`
`"I'm sorry.`
` The roses were so wonderful, I got a bit carried away."`
`"Rosa, go set your luggage down, quickly.`
` We're going to greet Aniki."`
`"Hmm?`
` What happened to Maria‐chan?`
` Is she still by the flower beds?"`
`"...Yes.`
` It looks like there was a rose she liked, and she said she wanted to look after it and wouldn't listen.`
` I decided to let her do what she wants for a while."`
`"............We sometimes forget that girls have their own little world.`
` Sometimes, we have to respect that, right?"`
`"......That's right.`
` ...Thank you for caring, Kyrie nee‐san."`
`"...Gohda‐san.`
` Where is our room?"`
`"I will guide you. This way.`
` Allow me to hold your luggage."`
`"I'm fine, I can carry it myself. Thank you."`
`Rosa went into the room that Gohda had guided her to.`
`Closing the door somewhat violently, she threw her luggage on top of the bed.`
`".................................`
` ............"`
`She got down on her knees in front of the bed, ......and buried her face in it.`
`For a while, Rosa made as if to shred the sheets with her fingernails, sobbing continually...`
`".........Maria‐sama.`
` ...Are you alright?"`
`Kanon, who had been hiding behind a thicket, appeared after watching Rosa leave.`
`"...Kihi......kihihihihihihihihihi...`
` ...I'm fine.`
` ...Kihihihihi."`
`Maria laughed unpleasantly, but to Kanon, who had seen the whole thing, it looked like she was enduring as best she could...`
`"She's a horrible person.`
` I can't believe that was a mother......"`
`"......It can't be helped.`
` Such pitiful things enter such pitiful vessels.`
` ...I am just fine.`
` Kihihihihihihihihihi......"`
`Kanon got down on his knees and picked up the trampled candy.`
`......It was tragic just looking at it.`
`He thought about dusting it off and returning it to her, but really couldn't do so with it in that condition.`
`As he was at a loss at what to do, he met eyes with Maria.`
`{n}......No, they didn't meet.`
`{n}Maria was looking at the candy that Kanon had picked up.`
`...Right now, Maria's heart was surely the same as that trampled candy which had been crushed into a pulp...`
`Kanon realized this, but he didn't know what he should do...`
`"...I know...`
` ......I'll exchange it for the one I received earlier."`
`Kanon remembered that an identical candy which he had received from Maria was in his pocket.`
`Maria stuck out her hand.`
`......Kanon thought she was trying to accept it, so he held out the candy, but Maria didn't try to grasp it.`
`......Then Kanon realized.`
` ...She was asking him to give it back.`
`......No matter how tragic it was, the trampled candy was Maria's.`
`...Her mother had bought it for her.`
`No matter how tragic, it had to be this candy...`
`{n}If only it could be made pretty again by dusting it off...`
`...Kanon hung his head.`
`".........I can't do anything except dust it off.`
` .........Sorry."`
`Kanon held out the miserable candy she wanted.`
`{n}Maria took it, and spoke.`
`"...Thank you.`
` A {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} can't do anything except dust it off, but a witch can repair it to how it was.`
` It would be easy for {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` Kihihihihihi."`
`"............Maria‐sama,`
` ...do you...`
`know about {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama?"`
`There couldn't be anyone related to the Ushiromiya family who didn't know {f:5:Beatrice}'s name, with Battler as an exception.`
`...But just now, Maria had told Battler about her proudly.`
`{n}She had spoken almost as though she had been meeting with {f:5:Beatrice} regularly.`
`The inside of the fist Kanon made with his left hand hurt sharply.`
`{n}......In the past, a witch called {f:5:Beatrice} had appeared, and had tempted him and Shannon.`
`He had always tried to make himself think it had been a bad dream.`
` ......However, Shannon insisted that it had definitely been a real witch.`
`And then, this summer.`
`......The shrine to the local Shinto god had been hit by lightning and had disappeared without a trace in the span of a single night.`
`...He had known that Shannon had broken the mirror.`
`{n}......And he remembered too that upon the witch's departure, she had left him with the words that she would eventually be revived.`
`And now, .........this girl who had no end of faith in {f:5:Beatrice} spoke as though she had met her.`
`...Kanon couldn't suppress a sense of something ominous welling up in his heart.`
`For a while, Maria remained silent, as though she could see into Kanon's heart.`
`...As though she was waiting for his memory of {f:5:Beatrice} to come back to him.`
`Then, she spoke matter‐of‐factly.`
`"Kihihihihi...`
` You know, I am friends with {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` I'm meeting her today too, to play.`
` Kihihihihihihihihi..."`
`"Pla‐...play?"`
`"...Yep.`
` Play.`
` We're going to study magic together.`
` Kihihihihihihihi..."`
`......The face of the witch, who Kanon had tried to pretend was a bad dream,`
` ......began to slowly creep into the back of his mind......`
`"Father said he was extremely busy with his research.`
` He said that, unfortunately, he will be unable to make an appearance."`
`"......Come on.`
` We've put this conference in our schedules and come all the way out to Rokkenjima during the very busy fall season.`
` I wish Dad would act a little more sociable."`
`"So true.`
` ......Doctor Nanjo.`
` Is it really a problem with his research and his mood?`
` He isn't already bedridden, and unable to get up, right?"`
`"......Well, ......I wonder.`
` There is not much I can say..."`
`Nanjo glanced at Natsuhi.`
`{n}As though he wasn't qualified to disregard Natsuhi when he spoke on this topic.`
`"Father is healthier than ever.`
` Calling him bedridden is the height of rudeness...!"`
`"But he only has three months left to live, right?`
` Normally, wouldn't that mean that he'd be wasting away, unable to get out of his bed?`
` Right, Doctor Nanjo?"`
`".........For a normal patient, that would probably be the case.`
` But Kinzo‐san has extraordinary willpower.`
` ...The force of his will may have even the Grim Reaper too terrified to approach..."`
`"If he's that energetic, then we can be at least a little reassured, right?"`
`"...Although if he's that energetic, I wish he'd at least allow us to greet him.`
` ...Isn't the point of the family conference to come and see Dad's face?`
` Now I don't know why the hell we came."`
`"Don't say that.`
` If he were here, you would complain the whole time about how you couldn't relax.`
` I say we should celebrate that all of us siblings are here together as a family again this year, as we were the last, without even one of us missing."`
`"You realize we couldn't meet him at last year's family conference either?`
` I wonder why we can't get him to understand that his children by blood want to see him after two years."`
`"......If you have words of greeting for him, I will tell him for you.`
` Or, Eva‐san,`
` ......perhaps you had something other than a greeting you wanted to discuss with Father...?"`
`"..................nn.`
` ...Come on, what are you talking about, sheesh."`
`"Give it a rest, Eva.`
` Natsuhi‐san, forgive us.`
` Eva's just concerned about Father's condition, as his daughter.`
` Please understand her feelings a bit."`
`"That's right.`
` Eva, how suddenly you've become respectful to Father since he was told how long he has left.`
` ...Yes, I can just about understand why you might be desperate to see him.`
` ......Hmph."`
`".........What exactly are you implying?"`
`"Quit it, Aneki.`
` Why don't we pray that his mood will improve by dinner?`
` ...And we've just arrived.`
` And anyway, we only came to give a light greeting.`
` We can hold the family conference even without Dad."`
`"...No, there should even be a few things that we can't talk to him about until we form a unified opinion.`
` Right, Hideyoshi nii‐san?"`
`"Yep!`
` Just as Rudolf‐kun says.`
` ......We can only gather our faces here once a year.`
` We've gotta value this precious time we've got, and talk together frankly."`
`Even though the tea hadn't even come yet, ...they were very strong‐minded.`
`"But before that, I wonder if we have enough leeway to enjoy some black tea at our leisure,`
` surrounded by the wonderful furnishings of the mansion's parlor..."`
`Kyrie's words seemed to hold some slight admonishment towards all of the people gathered in that place.`
`They all understood, and as they cleared their throats and straightened their neckties, the atmosphere in the room returned to normal for a moment.`
`"......Excuse me.`
` I have brought some tea."`
`"Hey, Shannon‐chan.`
` You just keep gettin' prettier and prettier!"`
`Shannon entered the parlor, pushing the serving cart.`
`Everyone decided to slowly enjoy some black tea for the time being...`
`A wonderful aroma began to spread throughout the parlor.`
`Looking at that scene, it would have been impossible to guess the strained atmosphere which had been there until right before Shannon had entered.`
`...Of course, Shannon, who was setting out the tea, probably didn't even notice.`
`......Kyrie made a gesture that seemed to laugh at everyone's adult appearance.`
`Rudolf didn't like it when Kyrie took the initiative and spoke at the family conference.`
`...It was his worthless male pride.`
`He probably didn't want to look like a weak man taking his wife's advice.`
`She understood that, and was doing her best to refrain from saying anything unnecessary.`
`So she separated herself from the circle of siblings, which was good‐natured only in appearance, and slowly enjoyed her tea near the window.`
`"Oh, Rosa‐san.`
` I thought all you siblings were having a friendly discussion together...?"`
`"......You are joking."`
`"Sorry, don't take it the wrong way.`
` I'm just rolling my eyes at my husband."`
`It seemed that Rosa hadn't been able to keep up the charade of amicability.`
`...They had come here to fight bloodily and dirtily, each trying to steal the inheritance from the others.`
`She probably didn't want to pretend to be fellow conspirators at this stage.`
`......Or maybe she was still much too inexperienced for that.`
`"...It looks like the wind has started blowing hard out there.`
` ...The plants are all shaking so much."`
`"The typhoon has probably already come fairly close.`
` ......I wonder if it will rain a lot tonight."`
`"...............Maria‐chan really has grown a lot this past year."`
`".........Does it look that way...?`
` She still can't even fold her own clothing yet."`
`"Yes.`
` It's because she has such an affectionate mother.`
` She'll grow into a girl who's rich in heart."`
`Rosa was silent.`
`{n}.........Maybe she was unsure as to how Kyrie meant that...`
`"...Me...?`
` .........I'm not fit to be a mother.`
` ...............Children can't choose their parents.`
` That poor girl..."`
`"Doesn't that go both ways?`
` ......A parent can't choose what kind of child is born, either."`
`".............................."`
`Rosa bit her lower lip...`
`"It isn't a matter of who's at fault.`
` You just need to have the mindset of going through life together with her, and slowly watch over her as she grows up."`
`"Rosa‐san, you spend every day with Maria‐chan, so you probably don't notice the gradual changes.`
` But the rest of us, who have been reunited with her after a year, really understand that she's grown up a lot..."`
`"......If you mean that sincerely, then thank you very much."`
`"Then, if you will excuse me.`
` If there is anything you desire, please call for it at any time."`
`Shannon bowed politely and left the room.`
`After Hideyoshi and Rudolf watched her go with turned heads,`
` ...the atmosphere in the room began to revert back to what it had been right before Shannon had visited.`
`".........If Father is unable to be here, that in itself opens up the opportunity for some certain topics.`
` Right, Rudolf?"`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` ...We didn't come all the way out here just to drink some dusty tea, you know."`
`"......Very well.`
` Why don't we hear this topic that you're scrambling to get to?"`
`".........My, my.`
` Those people sure are strong‐minded.`
` They really started fast."`
`"I must join in as well.`
` ......If I don't assert myself, they'll quickly forget that there are four of us siblings."`
`"...It can't be easy for you, either.`
` ......Maybe I didn't choose my words well.`
` I'm sorry."`
`"No, I don't mind.`
` ...I'm the one who should be apologizing.`
` We're both mothers with daughters, so really, we should have more of these conversations.`
` But every time we meet, we talk about something strange..."`
`"......That's the fault of the atmosphere in this mansion.`
` Once we breathe in this air, everyone gets so strained.`
` ......Just once, I want to drink a nice, long cup of tea with you, Rosa‐san, when we aren't attending a family conference.`
` There's a wonderful coffee shop in Ginza which is a favorite of mine.`
` Please let me invite you sometime soon."`
`"Thank you, Kyrie‐san.`
` That sounds good..."`
`"How horrible.`
` The sky's suddenly gotten dark.`
` It's almost as though the people in this room have made the weather worse.`
` ......There's already thunder."`
`"Oh?`
` Do I see the first signs of rain...?"`
`"...Huh?"`
`There really were small splashes of rain on the glass of the parlor window.`
`{n}...It seemed that the weather had gotten worse faster than they had expected.`
`......Just then, a silent thunderbolt struck inside Rosa's head, and she remembered that her beloved child was in the rose garden.`
`A normal girl would think about going into the house if the weather got bad.`
`{n}......But Maria was different.`
` She would sometimes become stubborn, and wouldn't move no matter whether rain or even spears fell from the sky.`
`......That's right, I...`
`......told that kid "{i:just stay there doing that forever}", didn't I...?`
`"Oh, ......oh no...!`
` Maria...!!"`
`At this small exclamation, everyone turned to look at Rosa.`
`"...What, what happened?"`
`"I, I'm sorry, I'm going outside for a second.`
` I'll be right back!"`
`"......What what what? What's going on with her, seriously..."`
`"Does it matter? She'll be right back.`
` ......Why don't we just get started?`
` With our main topic."`
`"Good idea.`
` We can move that on even without Rosa.`
` Let's return to the matter at hand."`
`".................."`
`Rosa dashed from the entrance hall into the rose garden.`
`When she opened the door, the wind that hit her was too strong to be called a breeze, and told her that the typhoon was approaching faster than she had thought.`
`Just as Kyrie had said, small droplets of rain were mixed in with the wind.`
` There was also the low rumble of thunder.`
`......It could start raining anytime.`
`Rosa headed for the rose garden.`
`{n}She headed for the place where she had scolded Maria a short while ago.`
`...It was almost lunchtime.`
`The children had been told that they could just come to the mansion at lunchtime,`
` so they were probably in the guesthouse, waiting to be called.`
`...Even if Maria didn't come, they would surely think that I had taken her to the mansion with me, and wouldn't worry much.`
`......After all, she was with her mother, so there shouldn't have been anything to worry about.`
`Except I was here, and had thrown my daughter into the worsening weather outside, all alone...!`
`"Mariaaa!!`
` Are you here?!!`
` If you're here, answer me!!"`
`".........Uu."`
`It really was as I'd thought.`
`She was standing stock still, ...exactly the same way she had been, in the place where I had scolded her.`
`Held in her hand......was the candy that I had bought, given her, and then stepped on and crushed.`
`With that gripped in her hand, she had been standing there, as the strong wind whipped her hair about, tormenting her...`
`"I'm sorry, I'm sorry!!`
` Sorry, Maria...!!`
` Forgive Mama...!"`
`"...Uu.`
` Mama, welcome back...`
` ......I waited a long time for you to come back, Mama.`
` ...Got pinched by the scary witch, but held out and waited for Mama to come back, without crying..."`
`"......Maria...`
` ......Forgive Mama... Forgive Mama......"`
`"It's not your fault, Mama...`
` You were just possessed by a bad witch again......`
` So I'm fine.`
` Love you, Mama.`
` I love you......"`
`"UuuuuuUUuuuUUUuughhh!!`
` I'm sorry, I'm sorry...`
` ......Mama......lost to the bad witch...`
` .........Forgive me............"`
`Rosa buried her face in Maria's small chest, crying and begging forgiveness.`
`...And those tears dripped down again, as they had countless times before.`
`If only the brilliant sun had been shining on the two of them,`
` all of their cares would have evaporated, and they would have felt like they could begin anew.`
`...However, what surrounded the two of them was the worsening weather.`
`{n}The strong winds mixed in with the sound of thunder were saddening.`
`Rosa noticed the sound of Maria sniffling.`
`{n}...If she stood exposed to the wind for too long, she would probably catch a cold.`
`"......So, Maria.`
` It will be lunch very soon.`
` Come back to the mansion with Mama."`
`"Uu.`
` I'm not coming."`
`"Wh‐...why...?"`
`Rosa thought that Maria had already forgiven her, so she never imagined she would refuse.`
`But that expression on Maria's face didn't look like that of a child resisting her mother.`
` ...So Rosa wasn't able to understand why Maria wanted to stand still in the rose garden, pointlessly, as the weather grew even worse.`
`Maria answered that question...`
`"It's {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` She'll come really soon.`
` So I'm waiting."`
`".........Maria..."`
`Rosa started to say something, faltered, and then fell silent.`
`...They had just gone to great lengths to make up with each other.`
`{n}She chose her words carefully, trying to get Maria to come with her to the mansion without denying the witch outright.`
`"......{f:5:Beatrice} is...`
`coming?"`
`"Uu!"`
`"Really...`
` Then instead of waiting here, why don't we wait in the mansion?`
` If you stay in this wind too long, you'll catch a cold..."`
`"She'll come!`
` {f:5:Beatrice} will come!!!"`
`"And when she does, I'll give a candy to her.`
` I'll do trick‐or‐treat!`
` I'll give her a jack‐o'‐lantern marshmallow candy and say Happy Halloween!!!`
` Uu!!"`
`Maria pulled yet another sweet out of her handbag, moaning "uu‐uu".`
`Rosa was bewildered, not knowing what to do as Maria started being difficult again...`
`Just then, there was a sudden and massive roar of thunder.`
`It was probably...a sign.`
` ......A sign that indicated this island had become closed off by the storm, and detached from common sense and reality.`
`Therefore, as of this moment, all common sense would no doubt be useless.`
`The wind blew even stronger, and in the middle of a blizzard of scattered rose petals,`
` ......a figure appeared, leaving Rosa momentarily unable to imagine that this was a scene from reality.`
`...No, probably, it was―it had to be―fantastical.`
`Because that figure was shaped like...............`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}!!"`
`Maria dashed over to the figure.`
`......Normally, Rosa would scold her daughter if she dashed over to a complete stranger.`
`...But Rosa forgot about that, unable to do anything but stand there, shocked.`
`"......It's been a while.`
` Have you been in good health?"`
`"Uu!`
` I'm in good health!`
` Witches don't catch colds!`
` Uu!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` Witches make people catch colds with curses, but how foolish would it be if they caught one themselves.`
` You should focus your energies on ensuring that you do not catch a cold yourself."`
`She patted Maria's head as she said this, smiling roguishly...`
`Rosa couldn't have known the name of the woman who was happily spoiling Maria.`
` ...However, Maria had called to her in the beginning when she had appeared.`
`Therefore, even though Rosa had never met her, and even though she hadn't named herself, Rosa was able to learn her name.`
`......However, that name held a special meaning on Rokkenjima and in the Ushiromiya family.`
`......There's no way something so stupid could......!`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}!`
` Happy Halloween!`
` Look, bought these!`
` You can have one too.`
` Uu!"`
`"Mm, Happy Halloween.`
` Hoh, for me, you say?`
` Even the single and only light given to a man lost in the darkness of purgatory, unable to go to heaven or hell, looks truly charming when made into a candy like this."`
`"......Right now, on this island that has been cut off both from the world of humans and the world of nonhumans,`
` there may be no sweet more suitable.`
` *cackle*cackle*...!"`
`".........Hm?`
` Maria, what has happened here?"`
`The witch noticed the sweet that Maria was grasping.`
` ...It was Maria's candy, which had been stomped on by Rosa, and had taken on a pitiful shape.`
`"......Uu.`
` Stepped on and smashed.`
` ......Can you return it to normal, Beato...?"`
`Maria deliberately didn't say that it was her mother who had stepped on it.`
`{n}However, when the witch saw the candy, for some reason, she looked at Rosa and grinned.`
`...A chill went down Rosa's spine, as though she felt that this gaze could see through every part of her.`
`"It will be easy.`
` Give it to me."`
`"Uu!"`
`Maria held out the candy gleefully.`
`......Rosa could do nothing but watch this unfold, stunned.`
`{n}...How could this person gloss over the fact that the candy was pitifully trampled, in a way that could satisfy Maria...?`
`Maria looked as though she believed that it could be fixed as good as new.`
`...There was no way that could be done without real "magic"...!`
`"My, my, it is quite crushed, isn't it.`
` ......Come, Maria.`
` Close your eyes and try to remember."`
`"Because it really was that wonderful a candy.`
` The candies in our memories are always full and fluffy.`
` So you too must close your eyes and try to remember.`
` What kind of candy was it really{p:0:♪}"`
`...Along with those strange words, spoken as though singing an improvised folk song, the witch threw the sweet into the air.`
`Maria had her eyes closed, just as the witch had told her, and was focused on remembering.`
`{n}...The shape that the crushed candy had really been.`
`Therefore, only Rosa saw that scene.`
`The sweet which had been thrown into the air......burst into a gold color―no,`
` those were golden butterflies.`
`It scattered into several golden butterflies, ...and they began to assemble in the witch's hand, held up to the sky.`
`And when they had, .........unbelievably, .........the candy had returned to its beautiful original form, just like the time it had been bought...`
`Only Rosa and the witch had watched that scene.`
`Unable to understand the event that was occurring right in front of her eyes, Rosa stood with her mouth open, forgetting to shut it...`
`"You may now open your eyes.`
` ...Take it.`
` Now your sweet has returned to normal."`
`"Uu!!`
` {f:5:Beatrice}, you're always awesome awesome, *giggle*!!"`
`"................................."`
`There was a very bold contrast between Rosa's shocked appearance and Maria's innocently joyful one.`
`......Was that what the witch was laughing at?`
`{n}A smile floated to {f:5:Beatrice}'s face, different from the one that she had shown Maria.`
`"......Does my face look familiar?`
` If you stare so fixedly, you might burn a hole through it."`
`"Huh, ......ah, I, I'm sorry...!"`
`At those words, it hit Rosa strongly.`
`......Rosa knew her face.`
`{n}......She knew it from the portrait of the witch.`
`But, no, wait, ......was this mystery woman really......?!`
`"......Maria.`
` I will give this to you in exchange for that sweet."`
`"Uu...?`
` Letter?"`
`The witch pulled a Western envelope from her pocket and gave it to Maria.`
` However, when Maria made to open it, the witch stopped her.`
`"You must not.`
` The time will come soon to open it, but until then, you must not open it under any circumstances.`
` Take good care of it.`
` It will become an invitation calling you to the Golden Land."`
`"The Golden Land!!`
` You're finally going to take me there!!`
` *giggle*!`
` *giggle*!!"`
`"Take it and tuck it away safely.`
` You must not show it to anyone."`
`"Uu!`
` Promise!`
` I always keep my promises with witches!"`
`"......And this is for you."`
`"huh.........?`
` M‐......me......?!"`
`She probably hadn't imagined that the witch would speak to her, too.`
`Rosa was bewildered by this second Western envelope which had been thrust before her.`
`She remembered having seen that Western envelope before.`
`......There could be no mistake.`
` It was Kinzo's special envelope, used when he wrote with his own hand, and bearing the Ushiromiya crest.`
`Moreover, it was sealed with red sealing wax,`
` ...and further still, it had an imprint which seemed to have been made by the Head's Ring.`
`In other words, irrespective of what was written inside,`
` ...this woman, who Maria called {f:5:Beatrice},`
` was trusted enough that she was in charge of a personal letter from the current Ushiromiya head...!`
`"It could have been any of the four siblings.`
` However, the fact that I have met you here probably means that you were chosen by Kinzo's roulette."`
`"...So take it.`
` And read its contents aloud while seated at the dinner table, when all of the siblings are gathered."`
`".........What did you say......"`
`Rosa looked back and forth several times between the witch's face and the envelope she had been handed.`
`Today was the family conference, and the biggest object of discussion was the inheritance problem.`
` ......So, she had joined together with Eva and Rudolf,`
` and they had planned to force certain conditions upon Krauss to try to extort a prompt payment of several hundred million yen out of him.`
`It was as if the witch could see through all of that.`
`{n}......And when all of the siblings are gathered, ....what is she planning on announcing to us?`
`With a personal envelope that no one but the Ushiromiya head can use...!`
`"......Maria,`
` the weather is getting worse.`
` Return to the guesthouse and wait for lunchtime."`
`".........Well then, Rosa, let us meet later.`
` Allow me to name myself there.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*."`
`The witch turned her back to her, laughing.`
`{n}...And headed off towards the mansion with an air of composure.`
`Maria saw her off with an energetic reply, and then dashed off towards the guesthouse, leaving Rosa where she was.`
`......As though she didn't want to waste a second in informing the other cousins of her good fortune at meeting the witch.`
`Ultimately, Rosa was left alone in the rose garden as the winds grew stronger,`
` ......unable to do anything except pray that what had happened was just a daydream...`
`When the witch entered the entrance hall, ......Genji was there.`
`{n}With a respectful bow, Genji welcomed the "guest" who approached from the entrance hall...`
`"We have been awaiting you.`
` .........{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama."`
`"...It's been a while, Genji.`
` .........Hmph.`
` You've gotten old."`
`"......No matter how old it is, furniture will only carry out its work like furniture, until the end."`
`".........I remember how his wife used to be jealous of you.`
` ...Is Kinzo well?"`
`"He is full of life."`
`"......Hmph.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`The witch's laugh was probably because she knew that Kinzo's own doctor had told him that he would not live much longer.`
`...However, if anyone actually looked at Kinzo,`
` his energy and vigor, which made it extremely difficult to imagine that his remaining life really was slim, might make it natural to call him "full of life".`
`...Maybe the witch had laughed at that.`
`"Then let us greet him.`
` It will be good to hurl curses at each other after thirty years."`
`As the witch grinned, she started walking, leaving Genji behind.`
`{n}......Her gait was like that of a family member who knew the inside of the mansion well.`
`Genji followed her, as though he served her.`
`At that very moment, Kyrie came out of the parlor.`
`{n}...She had probably come out to fix her makeup or something.`
`And when she saw Genji following the witch, she was surprised, although her expression did not change.`
`There was a visitor for Kinzo, whose remaining life was not long, on the day of the family conference when the fate of the inheritance was to be decided,`
` ...and furthermore, this person was well enough acquainted with the Ushiromiya family that Genji was following behind her.`
`......Kyrie immediately realized that this person who she had never met before was someone deeply important.`
`Kyrie met eyes with the witch.`
`{n}......Realizing that it would be rude to pretend not to notice, she greeted the witch.`
`"............Pleased to meet you."`
`"Rudolf's second wife?"`
`"That is correct.`
` This is Kyrie‐sama, Rudolf‐sama's current wife."`
`From this exchange, Kyrie realized that this woman was a guest of considerably high rank within the Ushiromiya family.`
`.........And, the fact she was a guest of that level,`
` ......coupled with the face of the entrance hall portrait behind her, ......made Kyrie's eyes open wide in an instant...`
`"......Pleased to meet you.`
` My name is Kyrie.`
` I wonder if this is our first meeting.`
` If we did greet each other before, I apologize for forgetting your name."`
`"...You already have a vague idea, yet you expect me to waste my breath?"`
`"..........................."`
`Kyrie had thought she had given her a sociable and humble greeting.`
`{n}Her expression grew slightly cloudy at that openly oppressive response.`
`......It didn't seem like this was a person she could grow to like.`
`...But if Kyrie's imagination was correct, ......this "witch" likely held a huge key to what her own husband was most interested in,`
` and one that stood a great chance of influencing tonight's family conference...`
`So she did not shoot back a retort, and could only watch in silence as the woman went up the stairs to the second floor, with Genji following behind.`
`So when someone tapped her shoulder from behind, she was so surprised, she almost choked.`
`It was Natsuhi...`
`".........Kyrie‐san.`
` Standing still in a place like this,`
` is something the matter...?"`
`"I, I'm sorry.`
` ......I was just a little fascinated by the portrait of the witch."`
`"......The Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}, was it?`
` Something like—the revival of the Ushiromiya family to what it is today would never have been possible without the gold she gave...`
` ......A fantastical story, very much like Father."`
`Natsuhi spoke of her in her usual way.`
`{n}...She spoke from the position that the idea of a witch was just foolish, and that in the end, it was nothing more than Kinzo's ramblings.`
`...However, for some reason, that no longer felt right to Kyrie.`
`Just now, she herself had seen the Golden Witch come in from the entrance hall and climb up the stairs.`
`So Natsuhi's choice of words seemed almost like a refusal to accept her existence,`
` or as if she was leading her to think that she did not exist...`
`"...I'm sorry.`
` I think I'm feeling a bit of a headache.`
` ...I think I'll rest for a little while."`
`"Oh, is that so...?`
` Then I have some good headache medicine.`
` Allow me to prepare it for you..."`
`The hallway in front of Kinzo's study was filled with the scent of sweet poison particular to that green liquor...`
`Genji, who was completely used to it, did not grimace.`
`{n}...And the Golden Witch didn't grimace either.`
`"......When was the last time he left this room?"`
`"I believe it has already been several years."`
`"............He is that intent on making me a bird in a cage?`
` ...Alas.`
` ......Now you, who made that wish, are the bird in a cage.`
` ...The ghost of the study, are you not.`
` ......What a pitiful man to not recognize that."`
`"......He would probably continue his research until the day he could meet you again, even if he literally became a ghost."`
`"Is it love or madness or obsession?`
` ...I suppose they too will become magic if well enough developed.`
` ......You sad mage."`
`The witch grasped the doorknob to the study.`
`......When she did, there was a sound like that of flesh burning and splitting open.`
`...It was the sound of the doorknob literally burning the witch's hand.`
`"......{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama..."`
`"What is this?`
` .........A magic ward!`
` ...That fool, is he unable to get by without relying on something like this...?"`
`"...I have heard that this door is painful for you, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` Shall I open it...?"`
`"No, ...it is fine.`
` If he wins, I will be a bird in a cage for all eternity.`
` ...If he loses, only the life of a laughingstock will be left, the life of a pitiful mage who went mad with love and lost everything."`
`"......Already, Kinzo and even I are nothing more than pieces laid out on the game board.`
` ...All that is left is for the result of the roulette to decide who wins and who loses.`
` .........Until the roulette shows its result, there is no need for me to be reunited with Kinzo."`
`The witch looked at her hand, which, although horribly burned, was beginning to heal bit by bit.`
`"......And so the ward, perhaps.`
` .........Hmph.`
` ...I see, that is also honorable.`
` ......Now, everything is on top of Kinzo's game board."`
`"I like it, Kinzo.`
` Allow me to enjoy my game with you.`
` ......Allow me to enjoy the final gamble and fall of an aged mage, who fell in love with me and threw away all his life...!!"``".........Who is it?"`
`"Excuse me...`
` I have brought lunch."`
`"Enter."`
`"......Excuse me."`
`After receiving approval, Kanon entered the VIP room, pushing the lunch serving cart.`
`...The servants called this room the witch's VIP room.`
`That was because they had been strictly ordered by Kinzo to always keep it cleaned so that it could be used at any time.`
`...And yet, guests were never allowed into this room, no matter who they were.`
`...That's why, at some point, the servants had started calling it the witch's VIP room,`
` supposed to be set aside only to welcome the special person Kinzo was waiting for—the witch from that portrait.`
`And today, Kanon learned that this was entirely correct...`
`When he entered the room, .........the witch with golden hair was gazing out the window.`
`Outside, the rain had already started to gather strength.`
`...As she looked out at the beautiful rose garden, which had taken several days' work to make ready for today, and saw the winds and rain ravage it,`
` was she lost in some sentimental feelings?`
`Kanon was not able to infer anything more from her back that faced him.`
`"...I will prepare your meal.`
` ...{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama."`
`So Kanon went out of his way to call out the witch's name, ......because he wanted to make her turn around.`
`He wanted to know.`
` ......He wanted to know whether the witch who had tempted him and Shannon in the past......really had appeared again.`
`...When he did, ......the witch whose name had been called kept her back to him, ......and laughed.`
` Laughed, in a subdued voice.`
`Kanon was startled...`
`{n}It was almost as though she had read his mind, and knew that he had called to her out of a desire to make her turn around...`
`".........It smells good.`
` It appears that Krauss has employed a good cook."`
`"........................`
` ......Yes.`
` ...He is a cook called Gohda, who was employed in recent years."`
`"...There's nothing better than being skilled at cooking.`
` ...Gourmet food forms one of the three pillars of the pleasure of life in the human world.`
` The secret to not tiring of a thousand years is to have it in sufficience.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*."`
`Kanon and the witch's eyes met.`
`...And she grinned...`
`There could be no doubt.`
` Not even the slightest...`
`{n}This was without a doubt the witch from that day, {f:5:Beatrice}...`
`The witch that was once visible only to him and Shannon now finally held a form, and had arrived openly through the entrance hall as a guest...`
`".........{f:5:Bea}...{f:5:trice}......`
`......sama."`
`"It has been a long time.`
` .........Furniture called Kanon.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`"...............It has...`
`...been a long time..."`
`Kanon tried not to forget a modicum of courtesy towards the guest.`
`{n}...But dark clouds had begun to enshroud his heart because of the visit of this suspicious witch, and on the day of the family conference at that...`
`"It looks to me that you are dying to know my purpose in appearing here.`
` ......Isn't that so...?"`
`"................................."`
`Kanon didn't force himself to answer.`
` ...This witch probably reads minds.`
`{n}...So it would be pointless to go to all the trouble of saying it out loud.`
`.........Of course, even that rebellious spirit of his would be read.`
`So the witch snickered at Kanon's childish resistance.`
`"......I came to resolve my final promise with Kinzo."`
`"Your final promise with......the Master...?"`
`"......I lent Kinzo a mountain of gold.`
` ...When Kinzo gives that up, it will be returned to me with interest.`
` .........I came here tonight to receive that."`
`"...............I don't know what you are talking about."`
`However, anxiety began to gather in his heart.`
`{n}......This witch never had anything good to say.`
`"......*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` You are not wrong!`
` Witches have nothing good to say.`
` You are correct."`
`"Be that as it may, witches, like blunt scissors, can be put to use.`
` ...Sometimes, there are people like King Solomon who succeed in great exploits."`
`".........In most cases, one does not meet with a good fate such as those described in fairy tales, of course?`
` *cackle*cackle*...!`
` .........But Kinzo is crafty.`
` He has incorporated even my collection of interest into his own ritual."`
`"Is he a tremendous mage, surpassing even me?`
` ......Or else a fool possessed by madness?`
` ...Interesting.`
` Truly interesting...!"`
`Kanon couldn't guess what the witch was muttering and laughing about.`
`...All he knew was...`
`...that anything this witch deemed worthy of laughter...`
`must have the exact opposite meaning to the rest of them.`
`......And rising to the back of his mind were the horrifying words the witch had spat at him in the past.`
`Did you think I would lend them that power without any compensation?`
`{n}I'll lend a hand in love.`
` And my compensation shall be one ticket to watch the cruel fate that the two of them will eventually meet.`
`Even after one thousand years, no better show exists...!`
`".................................`
` ...Could it be... ...You......"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` Gehehehhahahahahahahahaha...!!"`
`".........Behold the sweetfish river, running through my beloved home of old.`
` You who seek the Golden Land, follow its path downstream in search of the key."`
`The witch suddenly began to recite a bizarre poem...`
`{n}It was something he remembered hearing.`
`"Could that be............the witch's epitaph..."`
`There was no doubt.`
`{n}...It was the epitaph accompanying the portrait of the witch that had been hung by Kinzo.`
`The relatives imagined that it almost certainly pointed to the location of the hidden gold,`
` but no one knew what it meant.`
`The witch had suddenly begun reciting that epitaph.`
`"...Kanon.`
` As furniture, you must have heard about this from Kinzo.`
` .........The day when everything will be returned to the Golden Land...has come."`
`"Rejoice.`
` ...The time has finally come for your shameful days as furniture to end."`
`"........................hh."`
`"I believe you have been wanting that for a long time.`
` ...To furniture, whose existence has no value, just existing day to day must be nothing but agony."`
`"......For those with souls, the world of the living is worth clinging onto, but those without find it to be nothing but suffering.`
` *cackle*cackle*...!"`
`Complicated expressions flitted across Kanon's face.`
`......It was the day of release that he had been looking forward to.`
`{n}...However, the coming of this day had been mercilessly sudden.`
`And the hateful tone of the witch, who had proclaimed this day of rest, made it somehow difficult to accept.`
`...Kanon wasn't even able to decide what emotion he should feel...`
`"......Why are you not happy?`
` Could you actually still have some attachments to this world?`
` ......As furniture?"`
`"............I have no...`
`...attachments.`
` Because I am...`
`.........furniture."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*.`
` ...You truly are a model piece of furniture.`
` ......Very good, very good.`
` ......However, to have no lingering regrets at all... How deeply uninteresting this is."`
`"......Are you saying that regrets are your pleasure?"`
`"Precisely!`
` Most witches who live for a thousand years get tired of life!`
` In order to escape boredom, I adorn people's fates with fruit and brandy and cook them like cakes.`
` I find humans dancing through oppressive fates inside an oven to be so very entertaining...!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` I've made somewhat of a name for myself in this field, you know?`
` ......So much so that unexpected guests occasionally come from afar to witness my culinary skills.`
` ...Heheheheh, mere furniture can't understand this—I am wasting my time."`
`Kanon wasn't able to understand what the witch was saying.`
`However, he realized well enough that this was a terrifying being who treated the fates of humans as a show,`
` and was getting enjoyment out of doing them some kind of harm.`
`......However, furniture had no soul or life, much less a fate.`
` Pitiful "furniture" did nothing but serve until the day they would be released from the world.`
`...To furniture like that, the witch, who had come to release them from everything, was also a being overflowing with mercy...`
`Even though the day that Kanon had been waiting impatiently for had come, he was unable to readily accept it, and this greatly bewildered him.`
`...Why was that...?`
`{n}.........The face of Shannon, the person he loved as a sister, rose to his mind.`
`{n}......And for some reason, Jessica's face did too.`
`".....................kh."`
`Kanon bit his lower lip painfully.`
`......Thinking of Jessica was not permitted for furniture.`
`{n}He had been aware of that, and had found fault with Shannon's relationship, ...so how could he remember Jessica at a time like this?`
`......He felt a little ashamed by how weak he was.`
`{n}And to forget about Jessica, he turned his thoughts to Shannon.`
`Shannon is also furniture.`
`{n}......On the day everything returns to nothing, there was no reason she shouldn't be happy.`
`......But Shannon,`
` .........through her relationship with George, had come to know an emotion that shouldn't be known by furniture.`
`Even though she wasn't qualified to be bound with him, she was still wallowing in a dream that she wasn't permitted to have.`
`Could Shannon...`
`......accept something like this, now, with open arms?`
`......Impossible.`
` ...Shannon would have lingering regrets.`
`{n}......That would probably become a great source of pain and torture for Shannon.`
`And those regrets.........had been planted by none other than this witch.`
`Why?`
` Just because that would be "more interesting"......!`
`"......Shannon......should have been waiting impatiently for this day, but now she will have emotions that she must not know,`
` ......and will probably have a very hard time forced upon her.`
` .........I...thank you for gifting us furniture the day of our release."`
`"......And...I hate you for making this day difficult for Shannon to accept...!"`
`"I wanted to make you feel pain from your regrets as well, just like Shannon.`
` ......However, with stubborn simplicity you continued to remain furniture, and never allowed me to lead you on."`
`"............However, it looks like you loved Shannon too dearly, didn't you?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` Shannon's regrets became your regrets.`
` ......Will that turn into hatred for me...?"`
`"................................."`
`"If you want to kill me, you can try.`
` ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` As Kinzo's furniture, you should have that much power, at least?`
` However, if you kill me, the day of rest for you furniture will not come for all eternity."`
`"......Could you withstand that......?`
` Can you really reject your release by me......?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!!`
` .........Kneel!!"`
`"Wh‐......what...?!"`
`"Kneel and kiss my shoes.`
` .........Otherwise, I will leave this place.`
` ...I will go back and never show myself again for all eternity."`
`"............So, Kanon?`
` Could you withstand that...?"`
`".....................khh......"`
`"If the door to the Golden Land is opened, your life as furniture, that has been full of hardship, will end.`
` ......If you desire, I will even give you life as a human.`
` After that, you will be on the same level as Jessica!`
` Surely you want to know of it, the taste of love...!"`
`".........I know even if you try to hide it, you see...?`
` You grew jealous seeing Shannon wallow in the swamp of sweet love.`
` ...You are sorely tempted to know the taste of love...`
` *cackle*cackle*!!"`
`"......Stop it...... Stop it...!`
` Are you trying to lead me on again......?!`
` I won't be reduced to a toy to please you...!"`
`"Hoh.`
` Then I will make do with Shannon.`
` You weren't the only seed I sowed.`
` There are sometimes those that don't bear fruit."`
`".........You who laid hand upon the key must journey as follows to the Golden Land.`
` On the first twilight, sacrifice the six chosen by the key.`
` On the second twilight, those who remain shall tear apart the two who are close..."`
`The witch recited the epitaph again.`
`{n}It was so sudden, and diverged so strongly from the current topic.`
`However, her challenging smile made it seem almost as though she were using that epitaph as a threat to Kanon.`
`".........Do you not understand?`
` ...For the ritual of the epitaph to succeed, on the "second twilight", two who are close must be sacrificed."`
`"............It could be any two who are close.`
` A husband and wife, ......or even a pair of lovers.`
` ......Who will be selected is up to me to decide on a whim, following the rules of the ritual."`
`"......Don't you think that there is no one more fitting to be a sacrifice for the second twilight than Shannon as she is now...?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`".........Wh‐......what a dirty........."`
`Kanon learned, then.`
` ...He had thought that he had given up everything, and lived until today as furniture, like furniture should.`
`...But in reality, that wasn't true.`
`He had loved Shannon too dearly.`
` ...And so, when Shannon was in pain, Kanon shared in that.`
`If only Shannon had continued to exist as furniture,`
` living indifferently like Kanon, without any attachments to this world, they wouldn't have had to be in so much pain...!`
`The witch planned to toy with Shannon, who had learned the taste of love—`
`no, who she had taught the taste of love—as she killed her.`
`She would not invite her to the Golden Land as a merciful release,`
` but would make her a sacrifice for that evil ritual, after dealing her the limits of torture and pain...!`
`And this witch would probably actually make Shannon meet this horrible fate, for no other reason than it would be interesting for her.`
`......Furthermore, she was threatening to do that so that she could make Kanon, who hadn't submitted to the witch even once until now, finally surrender......`
`It was that simple.`
` ...In the end, though he had tried resisting the witch to avoid pleasing her, he had only made things interesting for her.`
`......After all, he was furniture.`
` No, a toy.`
` ......They were nothing but toys meant only to distract her from her boredom...!`
`"...............Damn......it.................."`
`"What will you do, Kanon...?`
` If you kneel, I may even hold back from choosing Shannon as a sacrifice...`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` I always wanted the chance to break a toy like you.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*, kuhihihihihihihihi!!"`
`Without even a fragment of elegance, the witch sneered at Kanon with a vulgar laugh.`
`...Yes, even before Kanon had made up his mind, she had seen through to his surrender...`
`".................................kh..."`
`......Kanon...............got down on one knee, and chose to genuflect before the witch...`
`He didn't care what happened to himself.`
`...However, ......just the fact that Shannon,`
` who during his days as furniture had given him his only reason to live, was being toyed with,`
` ......that alone was something that he couldn't overlook...`
`Therefore,`
` ......something like kissing the shoes of the witch...was an easy oath for Kanon to make.`
`......At the time that his quivering lips actually touched the witch's shoe...`
`...{f:5:Beatrice}, after allowing a look of ecstasy to rise to her face, ...let out an ear‐splitting laugh.`
`In that moment, the witch who had tired of a thousand years of life was completely filled with the evil emotion that was her only raison d'être......`
`Lunch had ended, and the relatives had moved to the parlor.`
`Rosa had bought a high‐class brand of black tea from a famous store in Ginza.`
` That had been served, and the inside of the parlor was filled with a very nice aroma...`
`Since the children were together with the adults,`
` the adults were, at least on the surface, interacting like relatives, talking peacefully about recent events and how their children were growing up.`
`It had started raining outside, so the children were unable to go out,`
` and had no choice but to sit here like this, watching TV.`
`Like a true TV‐kid,`
` Maria was watching vapid daytime programs one after another without getting bored, and was giggling all to herself.`
`It seemed that Battler had joined in at first, deepening his relationship with Maria,`
` but he had gotten up early that morning, and so was gradually attacked by waves of drowsiness...`
`"......fuaaaaaah..."`
`"Oh, that's a big yawn.`
` Did you get up really early this morning?"`
`"...Well, something like that.`
` I started to relax and release all my tension, and then I got sleepy while I was listening to the sound of the rain."`
`"Tension?`
` Heheh, you go around making yourself the center of attention and now you're saying you were tense?"`
`"That's me, I guess.`
` ......fuaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah......"`
`Battler gave a great yawn once again, and slowly lay down on the sofa.`
`He really did look tired.`
`George and the others had started talking to him, taking his yawns as a sign of boredom, but when they realized he really was sleepy, they decided to let him be.`
`"My, my.`
` They say that if you lie down right after eating, you'll become a mackerel.`
` Hoh‐hoh‐ho...!"`
`"......Stop kidding around.`
` Gohda‐san said that tonight would be calf steak.`
` In a minute it's gonna end up as mackerel steak."`
`"Kumasawa‐san.`
` The guy really does look tired.`
` You think you could bring him a blanket?"`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho.`
` Here you go."`
`Kumasawa brought a blanket over from the shelf.`
`{n}...The spacious parlor wasn't cold, but the air had gotten a little chilly.`
`So when the blanket was placed over Battler, he immediately wrapped himself up in it, and curled up like a turtle retreating into its shell.`
`"...You really were sleepy.`
` When do you want to wake up?`
` I'll take care of it."`
`"......Nah, I don't care when.`
` ......You can wake me up if there's something you want,`
` ...and if there's nothing, you can let me sleep forever.`
` ......Good night..."`
`"Uu?`
` Battler sleeping?`
` Naptime?`
` Naptime?`
` Uu‐uu, me too!"`
`"H‐hey, Maria.`
` Battler's sleepy, so you gotta leave him alone.`
` Kumasawa‐san, could we get another blanket?"`
`It was doubtful that Maria really wanted to take a nap.`
`{n}She probably just saw Battler wrapped up in a blanket and wanted to do the same.`
`When she received the blanket from Kumasawa, she joyfully wrapped herself up in it and set up camp again in front of the TV.`
`"Sheesh.`
` ...Even though all us cousins are finally together after six years.`
` Dude doesn't have a clue that he's the main guest of this family conference, does he?"`
`"......I can hear youuu...`
` ...I've had a nice peaceful lunch, and there's even a typhoon and rain outside.`
` ......There's nothing to do, and what that means is: it's not my turn yet."`
`"I wonder about that.`
` If you have a passive attitude like that, and don't do anything unless something happens, your life will be pretty boring, you know?"`
`"......No, that's not what I mean.`
` ...How should I say it?`
` ...In times like this, I've decided to think this way.`
` ......It isn't my turn."`
`"If this were a play, it wouldn't be my turn to go on stage.`
` ......So the best thing to do is stay on the wings."`
`"You're always the main character of your own life, right?`
` Why are you acting like a supporting actor?`
` ...You have to get up on the stage yourself without being pushed."`
`".........That's not what I mean.`
` I'm just saying it's not my turn right now...`
` kuaaaaaaaaaaah......`
` Sorry, I'm sleepy and my mind's a mess.`
` Just let me be......`
` *mumble*......"`
`"So it seems.`
` You're so sleepy that you aren't making any sense.`
` ...Let's leave him alone now."`
`"I can't let that one slide.`
` ...You are always the main character in your own life.`
` I kinda want to have a serious argument with Battler about that!"`
`"He's just half‐asleep.`
` Don't take him too seriously."`
`".........I dunno why, but...`
` That kind of personality, saying you don't want to get up on the stage because you can't be the main character.`
` ......Something about that really pissed me off..."`
`With distant eyes, Jessica gazed out the window at the gray rose garden obscured by rain...`
`When she put her forehead up against the glass, it felt as though the pleasantly cool sensation would chase away memories that she didn't want to remember...`
`"............It wasn't your turn yet, was that it?`
` ...Then, ......when {i:will} you get up on the stage......"`
`In that case, who {i:is} the main character on this stage...?`
`".........You're just doing whatever you goddamn want!`
` ...What the shit is this?`
` ......This is just demented...!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!`
` Your argument regarding 18 or 19 people, which you use as a basis to deny me, was truly ludicrous, you see.`
` So I merely tried a different move."`
`"...The greatest basis upon which you deny me is simply that I was not laid out as a piece on the game board.`
` In that case, I can simply play the queen first like this, can I not?`
` ...Isn't opening the path for the queen in the first move one of the classic plays in chess?"`
`".........Real fucking funny...`
` How the hell...can I accept something like this?!`
` A witch just came walking in right through the entrance hall?!`
` What a royal load of bullshit!!"`
`"What's this...?`
` In the last game, I let you make moves as and when you pleased, you know...?`
` All I have done on this occasion is to move a piece to match your moves.`
` .........Are you resigning already on the very first turn...?"`
`"......U‐.........up yours...`
` Like hell I am!`
` Who's gonna resign?!`
` Great move, why don't you just keep on playing however you like."`
`"I get it, your turn is far from over.`
` ...Move however you like!`
` Form a huge battle formation while you can."`
`"I will definitely endure.`
` I will definitely corner you!!`
` Come at me as best you can—I don't want you to have any excuses."`
`"......This much isn't even close to enough to make me accept something like a witch."`
`"...That's right, just now, it looked like you fixed Maria's candy with magic,`
` but you might have actually had another one of the same candy hidden in your pocket, and switched them with some fancy showmanship, making it only look like you had fixed it with magic!`
` Yeah, that's right, that has to be it, and it's no good, it's no goddamn good...!"`
`"......Hohoh?`
` Rosa saw the moment when the candy split into butterflies, did she not?"`
`"Whatever, I don't care!!`
` That was a hallucination or a trick, or...otherwise, she just saw it wrong!!`
` That isn't a big problem!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` So you throw out the part you can't explain as trivial?`
` ......I see, is that your move in response to mine...?"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*... You've dug your own grave.`
` ...Ushiromiya Battler...`
` Fuhahahahahahahahahahaha...!!`
` It still isn't your turn yet.`
` Allow me to continue my move for a little longer.`
` It has barely begun, the Turn of the Witch!!"`
`When they started hearing Battler's snores, the relatives went their separate ways, leaving the parlor and letting Battler sleep in silence.`
`Even though it had been so lively in the parlor with so many people gathered there,`
` ......when all of them scattered at once and were sucked into the vast mansion, it created an eerie silence, with no sound except that of the rain...`
`"Nope.`
` I've never once met a person like that.`
` ...Aneki?"`
`"...I've never met her.`
` ......Kyrie‐san, is that true?"`
`"......Even I only greeted her quickly when she came into the entrance hall.`
` She looked like she was a little over twenty.`
` I told her my name, but she didn't tell me hers.`
` ...She was being guided by Genji‐san, and I saw her go up to the second floor."`
`"So it'd probably be faster to find Genji‐san and hear the story from him directly.`
` ......Still, what a strange turn of affairs..."`
`The mystery woman had spoken to Kyrie.`
`{n}Without naming herself, she had sneered that Kyrie already had a vague idea of who she was.`
`......And the person that brought to mind...`
`{n}...was her look‐alike, the witch of the portrait...`
`"Was she trying to say that she's...`
`...the witch of the portrait?"`
`"That's what I understood her to be laughing at.`
` ......Even though it was our first meeting, she spoke as though she knew I'm your second wife."`
`"......Aneki.`
` You really don't know someone like that?"`
`"Stop asking me that.`
` I have never seen a blonde woman like that go in or out of this mansion!"`
`"None of that matters.`
` ...The problem is what happens if that woman starts callin' herself {f:5:Beatrice}, if she starts callin' herself the manager of Father's assets."`
`"Or, ...maybe she plans to call herself his mistress's daughter, and demand a portion of the inheritance.`
` ......Either way, an outrageous joker has been slipped into the deck.`
` .........Did Nii‐san call her?`
` ...Or did Father...?"`
`"This is bad.`
` ...We've been thinking that if we did a good enough job cornering Aniki in our discussion, we might be able to work things out.`
` ......But this takes us back to square one."`
`"............`
` ...I don't know what kind of schemes you've been plotting when I'm not around, baby,`
` ......but it looks like we've been given a little time to form a counter‐strategy."`
`"...Yeah.`
` Thinking about what would have happened if Miss Blondie had suddenly appeared at the dinner table and scared the shit out of us,`
` we should be glad we've at least been given a little time to discuss a counter‐strategy."`
`"...There's only so many counter‐strategies we can use if we don't know what she came to do.`
` ......What could she be after...?"`
`"Isn't it obvious!`
` It's to claim that she's the rightful heir to Father's inheritance!`
` Father is still captivated by {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` If the two of them had a daughter, he'd be bound to say he wants to hand her all of his assets!`
` She might even thrust some strange will before us!"`
`"...Sure, if we took it to court, we might be able to claim a quarter of a half of it...`
` ......But we probably wouldn't be able to split the inheritance until that was resolved."`
`"...That's a problem.`
` For me and for Rudolf!`
` And of course, for Rosa too, right?"`
`"......For all of our various situations, we need a large sum of money urgently.`
` ...It's our biggest weak point.`
` Then, ......what are they after?`
` Kyrie, ...can you tell?"`
`".................................`
` ......It's the first I've heard of it, but one of the premises here is that we have an urgent need for a large sum of money, right?"`
`".....................nn......"`
`"......Kyrie‐san.`
` When you're on the offensive in a man's business, that's the time you need funding.`
` Please understand that."`
`".........What's thiiis, Rudolf?`
` You hadn't told Kyrie‐san about it?"`
`"...Sorry.`
` I wasn't really hiding it.`
` ......The truth is, we've been having a bit of a—"`
`"It's alright.`
` You decided it wasn't necessary to tell me about it,`
` so I won't press you about it here."`
`"......What's more important is finding out what the Golden Witch is after, right?"`
`"Yes...`
` .........Putting together everything we've said, can you see what move the enemy will make against us?"`
`Rudolf had a certain measure of trust in Kyrie's unique thinking technique, "chessboard thinking".`
`Of course, it didn't give him any more peace of mind than fortune telling,`
` but every time Rudolf was concocting some important strategy, he would give a great deal of thought to Kyrie's advice...`
`For a while, Kyrie pressed her finger against her forehead, considering...`
`".........Judging by the fact that her coming here was kept hidden until today,`
` one of her goals is some kind of surprise that she wants to give us."`
`".........We can't know whether that has something to do with assets or being recognized as a relative."`
`"However, because her visit was kept hidden until today,`
` maybe we can say that she didn't want to get hit with a countermeasure by notifying us in advance.`
` Which means that it seems her goal is one where it would be disadvantageous to her if we did take some countermeasure.`
` ...Understand?"`
`"I get it...`
` For example, if it was something like a will which Dad had written previously, or acknowledgement as a blood relative plus accompanying proof,`
` if we assume she's brought something like that..."`
`"......then if it was completely unshakeable—if it was rock‐solid proof—you'd think she'd actually have announced it beforehand."`
`"...That's right.`
` Since we are in a position to doubt her, she should have made us bring our lawyers and experts,`
` and thrust some completely undeniable proof before us.`
` If she could."`
`"Hmmmm.`
` ...So just given that the enemy's aimin' for a surprise attack, that alone tells us she couldn't beat us with an honest attack from the front.`
` Makes sense.`
` If you've got a trump card that'll win for sure, you gotta play it out boldly.`
` Play it in a roundabout way, and odds are you're goin' to tarnish its impact."`
`"......To skip to the conclusion,`
` ...we should probably expect that some huge surprise will be thrust in front of us,`
` something related either directly or indirectly to the inheritance problem that everyone is so infatuated with.`
` ...The other party is probably under the impression that they will be able to overpower us with the impact of this alone."`
`"......However, even if this carries with it a significant impact, it is not absolute."`
`"In other words, ......we have enough leeway to take advantage of this."`
`"You've really got brains!`
` Even understandin' just this much is really reassurin'!`
` So you're tellin' us not to get sucked into our opponent's pace."`
`"...In the end, it's an extremely simple conclusion.`
` No matter what the opponent brings up, interact calmly, without panicking.`
` ......That's Negotiation 101.`
` I really can't call that predicting our opponent's thoughts."`
`"Come on.`
` ...Just like usual, that was pretty good.`
` .........Now that we know that we have a little leeway to attack, it gives us a little more room to relax."`
`"What we don't know is how she is connected to Krauss nii‐san.`
` ......Is it a surprise for Krauss nii‐san too, or was the person who called her here none other than Krauss nii‐san himself?"`
`"......If it's the latter, it might make things very troublesome."`
`"............Yes.`
` ...Secretly calling a mystery woman on the day of the family conference.`
` ...That detestable style somehow feels like Nii‐san."`
`"Aneki, let's handle it like this.`
` ...As long as she can't clearly prove her identity, we won't acknowledge her as having any status whatsoever."`
`"That would be best.`
` ......In point of fact, she hasn't even named herself to Kyrie‐san.`
` ...We can't let our conference be disturbed by the statements of some unknown woman."`
`"......She might show us proof that she's a blood relative or something.`
` If she can show that Father's blood runs through her veins, like with a maternity record document, there's nothin' we can do."`
`"We can suspect any proof of being fake.`
` Even if it is the real thing, in order to prove that she is the person mentioned, we would need to involve a hospital.`
` ...At the very least, it will be impossible to prove that now, on Rokkenjima."`
`".........Yes, that's it exactly.`
` In other words, what it boils down to is this:`
` No matter what is shown to us now on Rokkenjima, it can't be accepted as truth."`
`"So we can't believe anything until the typhoon passes and they prove it to us at the proper place.`
` ...*giggle*."`
`"Constantly finding fault like that is your speciality, Aneki.`
` This is gonna be all down to you."`
`"Are you an idiot?`
` You'll be helping too.`
` ......We need money.`
` And quickly, and a large sum!`
` We're all in this together."`
`".........There's no way I'm having my prospects of an inheritance destroyed now by some mystery woman who popped out of nowhere...!"`
`It was only at a time like this that Rudolf and Eva united as siblings,`
` sickened by the idea that their own inheritance might be snatched away by an outsider.`
`Kyrie noticed how indomitable they looked, shook her head slightly, and gave a small sigh as she looked out the window.`
`Outside, there was still a strong rain falling, and everything was gray, having lost all vibrance.`
`It felt like the lush garden that the sun had shone on earlier had never existed.`
`For some reason, the words Eva had said just a short while ago kept repeating in Kyrie's head.`
`.........It boils down to this.`
` No matter what is shown to us now on Rokkenjima, it can't be accepted as truth.`
`There was an odd nuance to those words.`
`Right now, this island was closed off by the typhoon and isolated.`
`{n}There were no official institutions here, and no hospital.`
`So, no matter what institution had issued what kind of documentation, on this island, one could claim that it was all fiction.`
` It was impossible to prove that something was the truth.`
`They were cut off from the outside world, and all truths proven in the outside world would be called "fiction"...`
`So did that mean...`
`...that now, on this Rokkenjima, there was nothing that was truthful?`
`......That everything would be controlled by "fiction"?`
`It almost gave the illusion...`
`...that separate from the human world made from truth...`
`was another world called fiction, in which they had been shut away.`
`......Kyrie remembered what that woman had looked like one more time.`
`And she remembered the woman's figure, and the witch of the portrait.`
`On this island, which had been isolated from the world of humans, and shut away in the world of nonhumans, ......a nonhuman being had visited.`
`No matter what she did, Kyrie couldn't help think of the smile that had appeared on that woman's face as anything other than ominous......`
`In trying to understand that ominous smile,`
` ...it feels like my chessboard thinking mistook a vital premise.`
`...That's right,`
` that smile seemed like that of something nonhuman looking down on me.`
` I had reasoned based on the assumption that our opponent was a "human" like us.`
`......However,`
` just like this island now, she may be a being that is not human, and human values may not apply to her.`
`In that case...`
`......all reasoning is useless.`
`{n}For what reason was the witch invited here today?`
`.........Only one thing is certain.`
` ...Right this very moment, she is staying somewhere in this vast mansion...`
`"......Maria.`
` ......Around lunchtime today, we.........met someone outside, right?`
` A woman.`
` Who......was she?"`
`"...Uu.`
` Said it a lot.`
` ...{f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"Maria, have you ever met {f:5:Beatrice} before...?"`
`"Uu.`
` See her every year."`
`"Every year...?`
` In this mansion on Rokkenjima?"`
`"Uu."`
`"...I don't know what "uu" means!`
` Is that true?!"`
`"......Yeah."`
`"How long have you been seeing her?`
` How many years ago did it start?!"`
`"...Uu.`
` ......Dunno."`
`"You don't know?!`
` Why?!`
` Last year?`
` Two years ago?!"`
`"......Longer.`
` ......Uu."`
`Rosa was aghast.`
` ...Only the Ushiromiya mansion existed on this island.`
` So there was no way that there were any humans other than themselves on this island.`
`And yet, Maria said that she had been meeting with that suspicious woman every year during the family conference......`
`If what Maria said was the truth,`
` ......then that strange woman called {f:5:Beatrice} had been at the family conference every year.`
`......That's insane.`
`Is she saying that some eerie woman was at the family conference every year, and none of us ever noticed it...?!`
`Even though Rosa had just met her herself a couple of hours ago in the rose garden,`
` she was overcome with a strange emotion which told her not to accept her existence...`
`"What" in the world did I meet with earlier today in the rose garden, as the typhoon grew close and the winds blew strong......?`
`"......Maria.`
` So, you said that you see her every year.`
` ...What do you do together?"`
`"Uu.`
` Sing songs, learn magic.`
` Learn how to draw magic circles."`
`"Re‐...really?`
` That's incredible.`
` ......Maria, you often scribble—`
`sorry, draw magic circles, in your notebook, right?`
` Did she teach you that?"`
`"Uu!`
` {f:5:Beatrice} draws what they should look like!`
` Look! Look!"`
`Maria joyfully fished around in her handbag.`
`......Then, she took out a notebook and started opening its pages.`
`Most of the pages were covered with drawings that were literally scribbles.`
`All of them were occult‐like things,`
` and while it might sound rude to Maria who was joyfully flipping through the pages, they were all creepy.`
`"Look! Here!`
` {f:5:Beatrice} drew these for me!!`
` Uu!!"`
`On each page Maria opened to, there was another eerie magic circle that had been drawn.`
`......Furthermore, at a glance, Rosa realized that Maria hadn't drawn them.`
`The strength of the strokes, the thickness of the lines, how clean the shape was.`
`{n}......This by itself wasn't enough to guess the background of the person who had drawn it,`
` but it was enough for Rosa to understand that it was definitely someone older than Maria.`
`Rosa had to accept it now.`
`...There really was a person on this Rokkenjima who she hadn't even known existed,`
` and this person had been playing with Maria during the family conference every year.`
`".........Maria.`
` Umm, does this witch {f:5:Beatrice} live here...?`
` Or does she live outside the island like us...?"`
`"Uu.`
` ......{f:5:Beatrice} is the witch of Rokkenjima, so she lives on this island."`
`".........So, you're saying that she's on the island even when it isn't the family conference, ...right......?"`
`"Uu."`
`"I don't know what "uu" means!!`
` Well?!"`
`"...!`
` ............Yeah.`
` ...Uu."`
`Oh......oh my gosh, oh my gosh.........`
`{n}I can't believe it, I can't believe it...!`
`How long has this unknown witch been living on this island?!`
`I used to live on this island.`
`{n}I lived on this island, passing the time in the mansion, in the rose garden.`
`And even so, I never encountered a witch like that,`
` ......never,`
` ......I think.....................`
`"Mama......?`
` Mama......?`
` What's wrong......?`
` Mama...?!"`
`"......My head.........hurts..."`
`...I was probably getting a little mixed up with my memories from when I was a young girl.`
`When I was a young girl, unlike Maria, I was very frightened of witches.`
`{n}So for me, the name {f:5:Beatrice} was a synonym for something frightening.`
`......So it must be that my feeling of fear from my days as a young girl has been revived, because a woman calling herself that has appeared...`
`......She couldn't be a witch.`
` ......She's obviously a {i:human} calling herself {f:5:Beatrice}, right?`
`Oh, yes...`
` ......That witch entrusted me with an envelope...`
` What in the world could that be?`
`Rosa pulled that Western envelope out of her pocket.`
`...It was the Western envelope which bore the Ushiromiya crest which Kinzo used on his personal letters.`
` ......And it had even been sealed with the red sealing wax by the Head's Ring, which Kinzo held.`
`.........Which meant...this envelope belonged to the Ushiromiya head.`
`{n}...In other words, it was from Father.`
`Why was a woman calling herself {f:5:Beatrice} holding it, and why did she give it to me?`
`That's right,`
` I'm sure she said to read this aloud at dinner.`
`{n}.........What in the world could be written inside...?`
`Anxiety gripped Rosa,`
` as if opening this envelope might release some kind of monumental disaster...`
`......However, at the same time, a little curiosity sprouted up, causing her to want to find out what was written inside before the other siblings.`
`Using common sense, .........one could guess that a huge decision somehow related to Father's inheritance was probably written inside.`
`Actually, ...since he had given it to a woman calling herself {f:5:Beatrice}, there was no way that wasn't related.`
` ......Did this mean that he wanted the inheritance split not between four, but between five, including her?`
`..................I need a large sum of money, ...and I can't wait long.`
`I do feel like a sinful daughter for discussing the distribution of Father's inheritance while he's still alive.`
` ......However, I'm no longer at a stage where I can afford to keep everything pretty.`
`...And I'm even consulting with Rudolf nii‐san and Eva nee‐san in order to get some money out of Krauss nii‐san.`
` With myself in this situation, .........I can't help but sense something ominous in the appearance of the witch...`
`.........What could be written in here?`
`{n}......I'm sure there must be something frightening written.`
`.........Shall I first read it secretly myself?`
`The witch had requested it be done at the dinner table, when everyone was gathered.`
` ......However, in that case, couldn't she just read it aloud at the dinner table herself?`
`Why did she go to all the trouble of entrusting it to me?`
` .........Did that mean, basically, that it didn't matter whether I secretly read it beforehand...?`
`......It would be better to secretly read the contents first.`
`{n}...I understand that it would be breaking my promise.`
`......But this is no longer the time to keep things pretty...`
`It would probably be good to discuss it with Eva nee‐san and Rudolf nii‐san, depending on the contents...`
` ...Nee‐san and the rest are always really good thinkers when it comes to this kind of thing......`
`As I gulped, ......and put my hand to the red sealing wax...`
`...Something suddenly pulled on my sleeve, and I let out a small shriek.`
`".........Wha‐what?!`
` M‐.........Maria.`
` Don't scare me like that.`
` What?"`
`"...Uu.........`
` ............No."`
`"Huh......?"`
`Maria was making the same ominous expression Rosa had seen on the witch, sending a tingle up her spine...`
`"......{f:5:Beatrice} told you to read that letter during dinner, Mama.`
` ......You can't break a promise with a witch.`
` ............Kihihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi..."`
`"Tha‐...that's not it.`
` I just wanted to look at the envelope for a second.`
` ......I'll keep my promise.`
` ......After all, Mama always tells you to keep your promises.`
` ...Of course Mama will keep her promise..."`
`"Yep.`
` Mama's a good girl.`
` ...Kihihihihihihihihihi..."`
`"Th‐`
`......that laugh.`
` ......It isn't cute, so stop it."`
`".........Uu."`
`"Come to think of it, you received a letter too, Maria.`
` .........What was written inside?"`
`"Haven't opened it.`
` ...{f:5:Beatrice} said I mustn't open it until it's time to open it.`
` So taking good care of it.`
` ...Uu."`
`"I, ......I see.`
` ...You listen well to what {f:5:Beatrice} says, don't you, Maria."`
`"Uu.`
` I'm {f:5:Beatrice}'s disciple, so I listen well to what my master says."`
`"......I, .........I see."`
`"......?!"`
`Rosa realized something.`
` ......Mixed in with Maria's gaze...was the light of a person other than Maria.`
`...If she broke the rules, and opened the envelope here, {f:5:Beatrice} would definitely find out about it.`
`......Because Maria was the witch's disciple.`
`{n}.........Maria communicated with that witch......`
`"...Mama will keep her promise.`
` So tell {f:5:Beatrice} not to worry, okay?"`
`"Uu!`
` I'll tell her."`
`"...Hey, Maria.`
` ...I want to speak with {f:5:Beatrice}, so what could I do to meet her, I wonder...?"`
`"Don't know.`
` ......{f:5:Beatrice} is very fickle, so she always shows herself suddenly.`
` I don't know a way to get her to meet me."`
`"......But you know, she's always watching me.`
` So when I get in trouble, she'll definitely save me afterwards.`
` ...She's gone invisible, and is hiding close to me, I just know it.`
` ......Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi."`
`"D‐......don't I always tell you to stop that laughing!!"`
`Rosa reflexively hit Maria on the head.`
` ......That put a stop to Maria's laughing voice, ...but it wasn't able to erase the ominous color that had risen to her eyes.`
`Rosa made a pact with herself.`
` ...She swore that, at least until they left this island, she would not leave Maria alone.`
`.........She couldn't allow an unknown being to make direct contact with her daughter anymore......``"...Maria hasn't come back.`
` ......I wonder if she's being scolded by Auntie Rosa again."`
`Ever since they had met Maria in the airport, she had constantly been making a huge fuss about Halloween.`
`...But it seemed she had cut loose a little too much,`
` and acted a little too boisterous on the plane, on the boat, and during lunch, because Rosa had warned her several times.`
`In times like that, Auntie Rosa would rarely scold her in front of people.`
`{n}...More commonly, she would call Maria into the shadows, and scold her when they were alone.`
`So since Maria had been called off somewhere, they thought she must be getting scolded.`
`When they looked at the clock, they realized that it was almost six.`
`{n}They couldn't really imagine that Maria had been being scolded this whole time.`
`Perhaps it had come time for some anime she watched every week to start, or something.`
` She had probably just decided to stay in the mansion's parlor.`
`"It could be that Battler‐sama has woken up and they are playing together."`
`"Well, Maria‐chan must have thought of Battler‐kun as sort of a new friend.`
` ...I'm sure she had tons of fun when she played Halloween with Battler‐kun at the airport."`
`"Battler was messing around a lot himself.`
` That dude's gotten big, but he hasn't changed a bit on the inside from how he used to be."`
`"That's true.`
` ...I get the feeling that Battler‐sama was gracious enough to remain as he was six years ago."`
`"Shannon, you remember how Battler‐kun was six years ago?"`
`"Yes.`
` Because he was, well, very energetic.`
` *giggle*."`
`"I also remember how the four of us used to play six years ago.`
` Shannon acted a lot like a big sister."`
`"Yeah.`
` I get the feeling she was more level‐headed back then.`
` Ahahahaha!"`
`"Ba‐...back then I, umm, ......didn't know my place, so...`
` Umm, I must apologize for all my poor conduct..."`
`"......There's no need for all those professional manners.`
` Your work aside, when you're taking your break like you are now, I'd like it if we could all be friendly together like we were back then."`
`"Yeah, totally.`
` ...There's no reason why you can't separate the servant Shannon from the off‐duty Sayo.`
` ......You aren't a slave, you're just working a job as a servant, right?"`
`".........I think of you, Shannon,`
` ...no, Sayo, as my oldest friend."`
`"............Thank you very much, Milady."`
`It seemed that Shannon understood what lurked under Jessica's words.`
`{n}......Because she had heard a little bit from Jessica and Kanon about what had happened between them.`
`".................."`
`Apparently, George had also been informed about that, more or less.`
`George approached the window, and looked up at the darkening rainy sky...`
`"...Kanon‐kun is still young, and I think in some ways he tries a little too hard to be mature in his way of thinking."`
`"Uhh, hahahaha...`
` C'mon, quit it already."`
`"Well, umm, it's my fault too, I think part of it was I got sucked in by the atmosphere...`
` And, umm, ...maybe after looking at you two, umm, I got a little jealous, and started feeling a little rushed, there might have been a bit of that, too..."`
`"......Who, who cares about me, anyway?`
` More importantly, how's it going between you two?`
` Looks like it's going pretty good, eh?`
` Eheheh!"`
`"Err, ......I, ...I wonder..."`
`"Yes.`
` It's going very well."`
`Shannon was lost for words, her face red, while George answered brightly and immediately.`
`{n}That carefree attitude made it obvious that their relationship was proceeding so perfectly it would make anyone envious.`
`"Tch, I'm jealous.`
` ......Does that mean Shannon's gonna be resigning and cutting up a cake pretty soon?"`
`"I, I wonder...`
` I don't, umm......"`
`"I wonder, right?`
` How could I know?"`
`George laughed like he was being mean and drew closer to Shannon.`
`{n}...It was probably the way they usually flirted when they were alone.`
`{n}Jessica could only smile awkwardly and say "yes, yes, thank you, that's enough".`
`"I have a dream.`
` It isn't only my ambition to become the leader of my own domain in business.`
` I also have a dream to build a family together with a partner I can spend my life with."`
`"...I want two kids at the very least.`
` And I'd like to do some sports that the whole family could do together.`
` And many more things besides that.`
` I often talk with Shannon about that kind of thing.`
` .........Although every time I talk about that sort of thing, Shannon always laughs and says I'm getting ahead of myself."`
`"...For some reason, even at the age I am now, I already find myself thinking about my retirement and settling down.`
` ......With my healthy grown kids, and grandchildren running around.`
` About how nice it will be to spend my final years at a slow pace, surrounded by that, and together with Shannon forever."`
`"You're definitely getting ahead of yourself.`
` ......But, how should I say it, it sounds like you, George nii‐san."`
`"Being surrounded by a family like that would probably be so wonderful.`
` ......The ideal family that I painted in my mind when I was younger was something like that."`
`...To Shannon, who had been raised in a welfare institute, that harmonious image of a family was probably something she yearned after.`
`......And George, who promised that he would definitely grant that wish for her, was surely a fitting person for her to spend her life with...`
`Shannon was an important friend to Jessica.`
` ......George was surely the one most fit to entrust that friend's future to.`
`"Well, I don't want to throw cold water on you guys,`
` ......but Uncle Hideyoshi aside, what's gonna happen with Auntie Eva?`
` Won't it be tough to convince her?"`
`"........................"`
`"Ahahahaha.`
` There's no reason for anyone to worry about something like that.`
` ......No one can influence my choice of partner.`
` I will make Shannon happy.`
` Whose permission do I need?"`
`"......Whooooa.`
` George nii‐san, that was cool...`
` I can't believe you can say something so embarrassing out loud.`
` I thought you didn't use to be that kind of character."`
`"Leave a boy for three days and you'll hardly recognize him, after all.`
` ......Even I grow up.`
` ...I plan to study more and more, to grow to be a suitable man who can make Shannon happy."`
`It seemed that perhaps George had some kind of awareness of how embarrassing the words coming out of his mouth were.`
` His face turned very slightly red, and he scratched his head.`
`"............George‐san."`
`"It's alright.`
` I'm sure Mother will be difficult, but you can leave that to me.`
` I'll show you that I can make the whole family accept you as my partner."`
`"Awesome...`
` I'm jealous of you Shannon, seriously!"`
`"......I‐if you will go so far,`
` .........then I'm, I'm very grateful..."`
`"Wait a sec, ...I'm starting to feel like a third wheel here.`
` Maybe it's better I leeeeave?"`
`Smiling awkwardly, Jessica stood up from the bed she had been sitting on,`
` and at that very moment, the phone rang.`
`Before Jessica picked up the receiver, wondering what they wanted, Shannon looked at the clock and was taken aback.`
` ......It seemed that she had taken too long on her break.`
`"I, I am sorry...!`
` I forgot it was time for work...!`
` I‐if you will excuse me...!"`
`At the same time that Jessica picked up the phone, Shannon began dashing out of the room.`
`"Ah, Shannon!`
` .........Again, same time, same place."`
`"Ye‐.........yes.`
` ...Ex‐excuse me!"`
`"Hello, it's Jessica.`
` .........Ah, Genji‐san.`
` Yes, Shannon is heading your way as we speak.`
` We held her up, I'm afraid.`
` Please don't scold her.`
` Yes, okay."`
`"I see.`
` So it will be time for dinner to be prepared soon."`
`Many plates were lined up on the counter in the kitchen, and preparations for dinner were proceeding steadily.`
`......The number of plates that were lined up there...`
`......was 19.`
`{n}That number was one more than were lined up during the family conference every year.`
`"I can't accept it...!`
` Why can't I deliver it directly?!"`
`Gohda‐san was flaring up at Genji, paying no heed to the pot that was boiling over.`
`The Master enjoys having his food alone in his study, so the food must be set out in the study.`
` Of course, this is nothing new, you understand.`
`Gohda‐san would really like to set the table for the Master with his own hands, as he puts his heart and soul into his cooking.`
`......But the Master had imposed a strict rule that none but the servants bearing the crest of the Golden Eagle could enter his study.`
`.........So while Gohda‐san could greet the Master from outside the study,`
` not once had he been granted the honor of carrying his cooking into the study.`
`Gohda‐san was always unsatisfied with this.`
`{n}...Of course he knows he is a newcomer in terms of years of service.`
`However, he has accumulated plenty of experience from his previous jobs, and he is strongly confident that he would be able to conduct himself properly, even in front of Kinzo, in a way that would not insult him.`
`And yet, just because he is not permitted the Golden Eagle, he still hasn't been blessed with this honor.`
`......You can probably imagine what damage that has done to his pride.`
` You might think that tonight is a mere resurgence of that old argument, but it isn't.`
`Because tonight, there is a person other than the Master who wants their food carried to their room.`
`Apparently, this person is a very rare and honored guest, and there has been a strict order to treat this person in the same manner as the Master, the family head.`
`Gohda‐san must have wanted to earn some points by serving this honored guest with his own hands.`
`Because he is a person of strong vanity.`
` If he isn't qualified to serve the Master, then at least a guest of the same rank...`
`He simply couldn't make time during lunch, so Kanon‐san had gone for him.`
` ...Therefore, he truly desired to serve tonight's food personally—the best dinner of the year.`
`But Genji‐san had had a problem with that.`
`......Something about how Gohda‐san didn't have the One‐winged Eagle.`
`.........After being once again scolded that he wasn't qualified, Gohda‐san had lost his patience.`
`Ahh, how heartrending, Gohda‐san...`
`I cannot do anything more than watch like this from the shadows...`
`"Kumasawa‐san, if you have enough free time to dawdle around, please prepare the dining hall.`
` Is the tablecloth ready?!"`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho... Oh my, my apologies..."`
`When it became her turn to bear the brunt, Kumasawa softly disappeared into the hall.`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama is of exactly the same rank as the Master.`
` ......We must respect the same rules that we respect for the Master."`
`"......Gohda, you will devote your attention entirely towards the task you have been given, and attend to the family..."`
`"I don't mind if it's you, Genji‐san, but is it really alright to let a child like this go to such a guest?!`
` If she made some blunder, it would be quite rude."`
`"I know that they have served here for a long time, but it's not as though they have undergone a proper apprenticeship.`
` If you will allow me to speak freely, they do not have the proper grounding to entertain guests!"`
`"........................"`
`Gohda spoke bluntly, even though Shannon was waiting right there in the kitchen.`
`Shannon was the one who Genji had ordered to carry the food to {f:5:Beatrice}'s room.`
` ......By the ranking system among the servants permitted the Golden Eagle, Shannon was indeed the second highest ranked.`
`...If the highest ranked, Genji, went to set the table in Kinzo's room, then it fell to Shannon to set the table in {f:5:Beatrice}'s room.`
`Gohda's pride was always horribly injured when he was confronted with this ranking system.`
` ...In times like that, he would speak out bluntly and rudely about Shannon and Kanon.`
`Gohda kept raising example after example of Shannon's past failures, making a ruckus about how this was wrong and that was wrong.`
`As Shannon listened to this with her head hung in shame, she heard Kanon's voice from behind her.`
`...Kanon had been listening from a blind spot, leaning against the hallway side of the wall near the entrance to the kitchen.`
` ...He probably knew that if he entered the kitchen, sparks would start to fly his way.`
`"............Let him rant.`
` He's a horrible man."`
`"......B‐but, this helps me to build up a grounding on how to entertain someone.`
` ......Gohda‐san has learned a lot, so what he has to say is very..."`
`"Hmph.`
` ......Nee‐san, you sure are nice."`
`"......More importantly,`
` ............is the guest in the VIP room...`
`really {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, as they say?"`
`"...Yes.`
` .........I met her when I was sent to set the table for her during lunch.`
` ...There's no mistake—it's her."`
`"Re‐really?`
` Was she doing well?"`
`"........................"`
`Kanon remembered that he and Shannon had different impressions of {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` To Shannon, {f:5:Beatrice} was a cupid of love, who had granted her magic to create her relationship with George.`
`Judging by her happy expression,`
` ...it looked like she couldn't wait to inform {f:5:Beatrice} of how her relationship with George had progressed.`
`......However, Kanon already knew.`
`{n}That witch had come here with a terrifying goal in mind.`
`......That vague witch, in the past only visible to them, had now walked in openly through the front door,`
` and had revived enough that they could now carry food to her.`
`...In the past, when she had disappeared from in front of Kanon...`
`{n}...the witch had said something about how her own power was still weak.`
`.........Now that the witch could appear openly like this, did that mean that she had finally returned to her former power?`
`And she had said.`
` .........She had said clearly that she had sown the seeds of love with the knowledge that it would fail.`
`She had said also.`
` .........She had said clearly that the day had finally come when the door to the Golden Land would be opened.`
`".........Shannon.`
` ...She will perform some bizarre ritual with the Master, ...and will surely do something unimaginably horrible.`
` ......And no one can resist that."`
`"What are you talking about......?"`
`"She came here...`
`as the Master requested, so that the door to the Golden Land would open, and so that everything would be returned to the Golden Land.`
` She said that to me clearly!"`
`"................................."`
`In the past,`
` ......the two of them, as furniture working for Kinzo, had been told what the opening of the door to the Golden Land meant.`
`Therefore, even without asking a single question in response, Shannon understood everything.`
`{n}.........So, ...she grew deeply hopeless.`
`...Something tore at Kanon's heart as he saw her expression twist with grief...`
`"............How could...`
` .........Why, ...why now............"`
`"......Didn't I tell you?`
` We are furniture!`
` ......Because you acted like a human, because you loved, .........you can't obediently accept the day when our service is over...!"`
`"..................At one time, I used to wish that this day would come.`
` ......But it never came after so much time...`
` ......I didn't know how long we would have to be tormented as furniture...`
` .........So I thought.`
` ...I thought that day of rest wouldn't come for all eternity."`
`".........I thought that too!`
` But I believed that it would definitely come someday!`
` So I never forgot that I am furniture!`
` But Nee‐san, you forgot that!"`
`"..................It's......my fault, isn't it......`
` .........Mine......"`
`"Yeah, it's your fault, Nee‐san.`
` ......If only you hadn't known love...`
` ......We would both be happy that this day has finally come!`
` You built up meaningless attachments!`
` Even though it was a world that you would definitely have to leave!!"`
`"...............Will the ritual...begin tonight...?"`
`"...Yes.`
` ...............Also, she said this to me.`
` ...Tonight, George‐sama will probably give you an engagement ring, Nee‐san."`
`"........................"`
`That was a fact.`
` ......George should have snuck in an engagement ring in his pocket today.`
` ......And surely, he would hand it over tonight.`
`"......She joined you together, planning to use you and George‐sama as the sacrifices for the second twilight.`
` ...Understand?`
` Nee‐san, she took advantage of you by tempting you!"`
`"............So that was it.`
` ......I never thought of that."`
`"But she told me.`
` ...She promised that if you don't accept the engagement ring tonight, she won't choose you as a sacrifice.`
` ............I think that our chances of being able to go to the Golden Land together are very slim."`
`"There will be thirteen people sacrificed.`
` Only five will be left alive.`
` ...The chances of us both being a part of that group are really slim.`
` ......However, if you at least can take advantage of that promise, those chances rise higher!`
` I want to take that bet!"`
`"Our salvation is in the Golden Land.`
` If we can make it that far, we can become human.`
` And I want to walk through life as a human, together with you, Nee‐san...!`
` If we do that, we might even be able to achieve...`
`...true love!"`
`"..............................`
` ...We used to dream about being able to go to the Golden Land, didn't we?`
` .........If we go there, any wish will be granted.`
` .........We will be saved from this pain.`
` ............We believed that."`
`However, in this ritual, only a few people, chosen by fate and chance, would be invited to the Golden Land.`
` ......Everyone else would lose their life as a sacrifice midway through the ceremony.`
`But in the past, Shannon and Kanon had thought...`
`that whether they reached the Golden Land or were made sacrifices, it would be all the same, because they would be released from their duties as furniture either way.`
`......So, in short, the ritual had been something that would definitely grant release to furniture like them.`
`"I don't like it.`
` ......Together with you, I want to take back all the hard times we had.`
` I won't become a sacrifice.`
` You and I will remain alive.`
` And we'll reach the Golden Land together."`
`"............So I won't let you become the sacrifice for the second twilight!`
` Please, Nee‐san!`
` Don't accept that man's ring!`
` If you don't accept it, she promised not to select you as a sacrifice!!"`
`".....................That's......something I can't do.`
` ......Tonight's ring is very special.`
` ......My heart...won't permit me to not accept it."`
`"Nee‐san...!`
` The witch decides the ritual sacrifices arbitrarily!`
` That witch has promised to overlook you at least, Nee‐san!!`
` You at least will definitely be able to go to the Golden Land!"`
`"......Me at least?`
` What about you, Kanon‐kun?"`
`"The witch's game......is enough for me.`
` ...I'll slip through her evil hand.`
` .........I am not powerless.`
` I'll grab that small chance and I won't let go..."`
`"............................................."`
`"After all, our lives are temporary, aren't they?`
` ...In order to begin our real lives,`
` ......let's make it to the Golden Land.`
` And...`
`let's gain our humanity."`
`"...............And then...`
`...maybe, like you, Nee‐san,`
` ......I'll be able to know love.`
` Maybe I won't have to call myself furniture,`
` .........and make people cry anymore......"`
`".........Kanon‐kun............"`
`"I...`
`...don't want to be furniture anymore......!`
` ......I'm gonna...`
`...become human......`
` ...No more pain,`
` ......I'm gonna end it all.........!"`
`"............................................."`
`There were tears in Kanon's eyes...`
`It had taken Kanon until now to notice.`
`{n}......Shannon hadn't been the only one to know and suffer the taste of love.`
`He had too.`
`The tears Jessica had shown him that day,`
` ......and her painful smiles on all the days since as she tried to smooth things over and brighten her mood...`
`had slowly wrought some kind of change on Kanon's heart without him knowing it...`
`".........Shannon!`
` I have been calling you for ages."`
`Shannon snapped to reality at the sudden sound of Genji's voice.`
`{n}Apparently, she had been called for repeatedly.`
`{n}She hurriedly answered.`
`......When she turned around, Kanon had disappeared.`
`{n}......It seemed he didn't feel like showing his tears to anybody...`
`"Ye‐yes.`
` I'm sorry for being distracted..."`
`"I had Kanon handle lunch, but properly speaking, as the next in rank after me, you should have been the one to take it to her.`
` .........{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama is the most honored guest of this house.`
` There is no more honored guest than her.`
` ......Please think of her as another master of the mansion and be polite."`
`"...I must impress upon you once again—please be very careful not to make any blunders.`
` It is quite painful for me to entrust this to someone inexperienced as yourself, but there's nothing we can do about the house's rules.`
` ......I am sincerely counting on you."`
`Gohda had officially agreed, but he threatened Shannon with an expression that told her that he definitely wouldn't forgive any mistakes.`
`Shannon, too, thought that Gohda should do it if he wanted to that much,`
` ......but considering it as her responsibility as one who had been granted the Golden Eagle, she had to give up.`
`......Besides.`
` ...I wanted to meet {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`{n}What will I talk about?`
` What will I ask?`
` ...I don't know.`
`Will I show gratitude?`
` Or else, grief?`
`{n}Or else, ...what?`
` ...I don't know.`
`Shannon loaded the witch's food onto the serving cart, and left the kitchen with a slow gait...`
`The person knocking was Krauss.`
`"Father.`
` Today is our annual family conference.`
` Haven't the siblings gathered here to get a glance of you, Father?"`
`"Aaah, be silent!!`
` I have told you I won't leave!`
` I imagine that you are there, Genji!!`
` Why haven't you had my food brought here as I ordered you to?!!"`
`Kinzo screamed through the door.`
`{n}...Genji was waiting behind Krauss.`
`"......Your meal has been prepared so that it may be carried to the study.`
` ...However, Krauss‐sama wishes for you to go downstairs tonight..."`
`"Father.`
` I don't mean every day.`
` Even if it's just for tonight, won't you gather together with your family?"`
`"Who are you calling family!!`
` When did you start calling those vultures who wait for me to collapse and die family?!`
` When did you start calling rotting, gushing maggots FAMILY?!!"`
`"...........................`
` ...My, my."`
`Krauss shrugged at this answer which he had half‐expected.`
`"Genji, carry the meal here as you were told!!`
` Why don't you listen to what I say?!!`
` Why?!`
` WHY?!!"`
`"......Genji‐san.`
` I will leave the rest to you.`
` ...My voice will no longer reach him."`
`Krauss gave his head a small shake, and quickly turned his back on the door to the study.`
`......He had only called out for his siblings' sake, knowing it was useless.`
`After Genji watched Krauss go down the stairs, he called again through the door.`
`"...My lord.`
` We have finished preparations for the meal to be carried here.`
` .........What about the serving for Doctor Nanjo?"`
`Nanjo was also in the study.`
` Because Kinzo had strongly pestered him about resolving their long‐lasting chess game, Nanjo had been Kinzo's opponent since before evening.`
`Nanjo had announced as a doctor that Kinzo's days were numbered.`
`{n}...In that situation, if Kinzo pestered him about finishing a chess game while he was still alive, Nanjo couldn't refuse.`
`Kinzo was thinking deeply about his move, concentrating more than usual.`
` ......It had been Kinzo's turn for quite some time, and Nanjo, who was tired of waiting, had started randomly pulling out grimoires that he couldn't understand and skimming through them.`
`".........Kinzo‐san.`
` You won't think of a good move just by folding your arms and sitting in front of the board.`
` I wonder if it wouldn't be good to take a break and refresh our minds...?"`
`"Be silent.`
` ......Hmmm.`
` ......That should be good enough for defense.`
` Will that hole be penetrated by the bishop or the knight...?`
` ............nnnnnnnn..."`
`Today, Kinzo was insistent on a strong defense.`
`......Normally, Kinzo's motto was that offense was the best defense.`
` However, today was completely the opposite.`
`"............I am also hungry.`
` Shall we suspend the game here?`
` And I've used my head so much without a break that I'm already feeling dizzy.`
` ......Any more of this might limit my ability to make my best moves."`
`"...That is a problem.`
` ............In chess, both players must always make their best moves.`
` ...Other moves are painful to understand, and ruin a game that is about reading thoughts.`
` ...That considerably reduces our enjoyment."`
`Kinzo sighed deeply, and finally shifted his gaze away from the board.`
`Chess needs an opponent.`
` ...That opponent was tired and suggesting to suspend the game, so what else could be done...`
`"It is true that the goal of chess is for both players to aim for victory and make the best moves possible in order to achieve that.`
` ...It is an intellectual game of being able to read each other."`
`"......But Kinzo‐san, are you forgetting that there is another goal separate from victory?"`
`"............What?`
` What goal could there be other than victory?"`
`"Hahahaha......`
` It surprises me you would forget even that.`
` ...Through chess, you get to spend some fun time with your friend,`
` you see."`
`"Ah,`
` ......you got me.`
` I believe those are words I said to you a long time ago.`
` ............I shall have to concede that."`
`Kinzo, who normally wore a frown, surprisingly relaxed his face and laughed.`
` ...Nanjo felt like he had been reunited with a close friend he hadn't seen in a long time.`
`"That's how it is.`
` Now that I've taken a shot back at you, what do you think?`
` Will you go down to eat with me?`
` What do you say about discussing Kasparov's middlegame over some coffee?"`
`".................................`
` ...A good plan, but I will refrain.`
` ......I can no longer leave this room.`
` ...Because the ritual has begun."`
`"............Is that so?`
` Well, my stomach is growling.`
` ...I will go downstairs.`
` Any time you feel like it—"`
`"Nanjo.`
` ............Thank you."`
`"......Oh, what could you be thanking me for?"`
`"...We didn't resolve our chess match.`
` ......However, it seems that I have succeeded in that goal of chess which I forgot.`
` It seems that was just as important as checkmate."`
`"This isn't like you.`
` Why so sentimental?"`
`".........You said it, didn't you?`
` My days are numbered.`
` ......Now, go.`
` And don't come to this room again.`
` ......We shall continue in the Golden Land."`
`"..............................`
` ...That is fine, but it shall be a rematch.`
` Losing that rook was a serious blow."`
`"......Well then, I will see you later."`
`"Yes, later.`
` ............Maybe in the Golden Land, or in Purgatory.`
` Or in the next world."`
`"..........................."`
`Nanjo didn't say anything beyond that.`
` And with a practiced hand, he pushed the button on the table that would release the auto‐lock.`
`Then, after looking at Kinzo's back one last time, he left the study.`
`As he did, Genji's voice came from the hall.`
`"......Well then, my lord.`
` I will now carry in your dinner."`
`"It may be my last supper.`
` I must savor it.`
` ......Please, get it ready."`
`"Certainly.`
` ............Are your own preparations in order, my lord?"`
`"...Indeed.`
` I have spent my time until today wrapping this room in a multitude of rigorous barriers.`
` .........Even if that roulette chooses me, I will definitely repel it.`
` ...I will remain alive, and I will definitely become one of those who reach the Golden Land...!`
` ......I will reject the visitations of the gods of death who try to drag me off to Hades..."`
`".........Excuse me.`
` ...I have come to prepare your meal."`
`Shannon entered the VIP room, bowing her head and pushing the serving cart.`
`The young woman by the window, apparently gazing out into the impenetrable darkness outside, was unmistakably that witch.`
`"So it is Shannon this time.`
` How nostalgic.`
` .........Hoh.`
` Your countenance has improved quite considerably, has it not?`
` Unlike Kanon.`
` Almost beyond recognition."`
`".........Thank you very much."`
`Shannon solemnly prepared dinner.`
`...There were actually several things that she wanted to ask and talk with the witch about.`
` ...But those things were all jumbled up, and she didn't know where to start.`
`Her heart was also jumbled up with various things, and she didn't even understand her own emotions.`
` ...Therefore, still remaining vague, all she could do was to carry out her work indifferently.`
`However, the witch guessed what was in her heart.`
`{n}You can't hide things from a witch...`
`"...............I won't apologize.`
` Because I am a witch."`
`"......For what?"`
`"Come.`
` ...Kanon must have told you about it.`
` Helping out your love life was simply my mischievous spirit.`
` ......It was nothing more than a seed I sowed in order to enjoy witnessing in what manner things would get complicated, become twisted, and fail."`
`".........There are some who think it is more fun to hear about love than to have it."`
`"Surely, .........you aren't trying to thank me?"`
`"...Yes, I am.`
` ......No matter what kind of ulterior motive you had when you gave me the magic of love,`
` ......it doesn't change the fact that you gave it to me."`
`".........So even if you sowed that seed knowing that the two of us wouldn't be able to stay together for life,`
` ...I won't hold a grudge against you."`
`"............Hmmmm.`
` ......Furniture truly is uninteresting.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*.`
` Cooking it into something interesting is where my skill shines."`
`"......I don't understand how you think, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` ......You are a Great Witch, and people like us don't even reach your feet,`
` ...nor can we even imagine your grand thoughts.`
` But there is at least one thing I can say."`
`"......What is it?"`
`"Thank you for teaching me to be human.`
` .........You said it yourself.`
` ...I am no longer furniture."`
`"...............Silence, furniture.`
` ...If you were a true human, hearing the announcement of your death on the day that you were to receive an engagement ring should have you dancing around mad with grief."`
`"But what of you?`
` Your face looks enlightened, as though you have accepted everything!`
` ......Truly an anticlimax. Furniture...!"`
`"No.`
` I am not furniture."`
`"Silence, furniture."`
`"I won't be silent.`
` Because I am not furniture."`
`"Are you saying you won't listen to my orders?"`
`"Furniture obeys orders.`
` ...But a human decides for herself whether to obey orders or not.`
` {i:So I won't obey your orders.}"`
`"Hmph.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle* hahahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!`
` ......I'll take back what I said.`
` You really are interesting."`
`"......If I hadn't sowed those seeds, you probably would have allowed the ritual to control your fate without any emotion at all.`
` ......But now you have grown to be truly interesting, and you entertain me from the bottom of my heart.`
` That is fine.`
` Because I have no love for boredom.`
` ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`".........I have finished preparations for dinner.`
` ...Here you go."`
`"Hmm.`
` ...Doesn't this look delicious.`
` .........If Gohda makes it to the Golden Land, it may be desirable to commission him as my chief cook."`
`"......I heard from Kanon‐kun.`
` .........Something about, if I rejected George‐san's proposal, you promised not to make me a sacrifice."`
`"Mm.`
` I did.`
` ......Although you were an ideal sacrifice for the second twilight.`
` ...Kanon cried and screamed that I should pardon you of that, so I graciously listened to his words.`
` With the condition that you give up your engagement.`
` ......*cackle*cackle*, how gracious I am."`
`"............What a foolish condition.`
` And what a foolish threat.`
` ......You bullied Kanon‐kun thoroughly using that, I suppose?"`
`"Hoh.`
` So you can tell.`
` ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`Apparently, Shannon had seen through it.`
` ......Apparently, she could imagine how much Kanon had been bullied and humiliated by the witch, with that horrible promise as bait.`
`"I made him crawl on the carpet and kiss my shoes.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` And that's not all.`
` ......Do you want to hear the other ways in which I humiliated him...?"`
`Shannon silently shook her head.`
`"I have finally come to understand you.`
` You like to bully, confuse, and trouble people, and you do it to entertain yourself.`
` .........So I'm now sure that this is the only way to resist you."`
`"What is?"`
`"I will have nothing to do with you.`
` ...I will carry out the fate that has been given to me.`
` So I won't entertain you."`
`"......{i:Nothing to do with youuu}...?"`
`The witch's features twisted in hatred for just an instant.`
`...It disappeared immediately,`
` but that expression that rose to her face for only a brief time was unusual for the witch, who had never broken her malicious smile.`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!`
` ...I suppose that's one way to resist?`
` Interesting.`
` I like it.`
` I'll kill you.`
` Together with your lover...!"`
`"...If that is the fate that you have decided, that is up to you.`
` ......I won't be afraid of that or go against that.`
` Because I don't believe that the grim fate that will start occurring now is something controlled by your will."`
`"We humans don't know anything about our possible future fates.`
` That is how we live to the fullest, following our own beliefs and destinies until the last.`
` Fate is just a roll of the dice.`
` You can't feel malice in it.`
` Try as you might to inject some, I won't believe you."`
`"......Hoh.`
` Even though you have stopped being furniture, you have no fear of death.`
` ......It seems you think that will bore me, but that's a huge misunderstanding.`
` ...I am now all the more interested to see whether you really can stick to that until your last moments.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"It's so frustrating.`
` ......Why did you take the form of a human, appear in front of us, speak with human words, and ridicule us?`
` ...If you hadn't appeared in front of us, if you hadn't predicted the future,`
` ......we would have been able to live life to the fullest until the last moment."`
`"That's what witches do.`
` We live off your fates, reigning as a high‐order being does over low‐order beings.`
` After all, your fates are merely fragments.`
` If we cup our hands together, we can scoop out as many as we want."`
`"......In the same way that the beef cattle I raise can babble what they will, and it won't change the fact that they will add splendor to my dinner table.`
` *cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"......We are powerless, so we can't go against your ritual or our fates.`
` ...But I can do something that will make you unhappy right now."`
`"Hoh.`
` What would that be?"`
`".........I will walk away from this place right now.`
` Answering your words only entertains you.`
` Not answering your questions is the only way I can resist you."`
`"I see, I see.`
` You may be able to take a shot at me.`
` ...But you cannot defeat me, you know?`
` ......I have the power to kill anyone for eternity."`
`".........I can't wait to see how long you can keep up that resistance in an endlessly repeating cycle of death and rebirth.`
` ......{i:Don't forget it, now}.`
` You spoke those words yourself.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*."`
`"Well then, if you will excuse me.`
` If you have any business, please call me."`
`Shannon gave a reserved bow as she would to a stranger, and faced away.`
`{n}...With that gesture, maybe she really had taken a shot back at the witch, just as {f:5:Beatrice} had mentioned.`
`...Because when the witch called out again, she sounded a little more quick‐tempered than she had before.`
`"Kanon thanked me.`
` ...Aren't you going to?`
` Not going to thank me for giving you your day of rest?"`
`"Furniture will be happy about their day of rest.`
` But I am a human, you see.`
` So I have nothing to thank you for.`
` ......Will that be all?"`
`".........You plan to receive the ring from George?`
` Don't forget that if you do, I will abandon the promise I made with Kanon, the promise that you would not be selected as a sacrifice."`
`"If there is anything further, I'll have someone else come for you.`
` If you will excuse me."`
`A flat‐out interruption.`
`{n}Shannon gave no more answers.`
`And the sound of the door closing came instead of an answer.`
`It seemed that Shannon's resistance had probably struck far more deeply into the witch than Shannon herself had thought.`
`...Because an expression of hatred had once again risen to {f:5:Beatrice}'s face.`
`She had made Kanon submit, even though he hadn't been taken in until the end.`
` ...Yet after that, now it was Shannon who refused to submit, when until now she had been easily taken in.`
`"...............Oh?`
` ...This is interesting after all!`
` ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*.`
` ...I suppose I'm not so old yet.`
` This is why I'm still not tired of living after one thousand years..."`
`The most fabulous time in the family conference.`
`{n}That was the dinner.`
`Back when Kinzo had been serious about the family conference, he had placed extreme importance upon this dinner, for which everyone would gather just once a year.`
`Should the dinner not meet standards, he would take it as the deepest shame for himself as the host,`
` and he had strongly ordered Natsuhi to make absolutely sure that it was one to be proud of.`
`Because of that, she and Krauss had employed Gohda, who had confidence in his cooking abilities.`
`......As a result, they could unveil a wonderful dinner they had confidence in,`
` yet by that time, Kinzo had started closing himself up in his study and no longer appeared for dinner—maybe you could call that ironic...`
`When the main dish for tonight, calf steak, was set out, Gohda began to brag about it, further exciting everyone's appetite.`
`"The sauce here is Bordelaise."`
`"Of course, the red wine base I used was excellent even among those made in Bordeaux, but in addition, I prepared an original blend of this house,`
` a blend of choice alcohols from around the world to further deepen the taste."`
`"This sauce will be exclusive to this year.`
` It would greatly please me if you were to enjoy yourselves."`
`"...Isn't that wonderful?`
` However, isn't Bordelaise sauce common to French cooking?`
` It almost seems like using alcohol from outside France with that is heresy."`
`"Krauss‐sama.`
` Today is the annual family conference."`
`"As a dinner for those who normally live far away, and have traveled far from across the world to gather together,`
` I realized that a sauce made from a blend of fine alcohols from across the world that would normally never meet would be most fitting,`
` so I had it specially prepared."`
`"Wonderful!`
` A truly wonderful cook, that's what you are!`
` Food and medicine work twice as well if you advertise it right!`
` It's twice as delicious as normal food, and the advertisin' makes that twice as good again.`
` The taste keeps doublin' and doublin'!`
` Wahahahahaha!"`
`"*giggle*.`
` Come on, Nii‐san.`
` Didn't he see that question coming?"`
`"No doubt.`
` You let Gohda‐san run right off with your moment."`
`"Is that so?`
` I just thought there might be some people here who didn't notice that today's food was in the French style."`
`"......Just now, Eva said that not using butter was a virtue, but that's the Spanish style.`
` ...Well, I guess they do share a border, right?"`
`"...That's not what I meant.`
` Will you please not take a part of the conversation out of context and misquote me?"`
`"...It's a very delicious sauce.`
` Gohda‐san, you certainly are wonderful."`
`"It is a great honor to receive your praise.`
` And this is all thanks to Madam's habitual guidance."`
`"......No, it was all Gohda's idea.`
` I only listened to the recipe and approved of it."`
`It looked like the siblings quickly got into a loud argument about something as trivial as the sauce,`
` ...but for the most part, dinner proceeded peacefully.`
`......However, the thing that they all really wanted to ask about smoldered inside each of their hearts.`
`......And that was the visitor, the 19th person.`
`{n}............The Golden Witch.`
`In actuality, Eva, Rudolf, and Kyrie were on alert during dinner.`
`If the mystery guest was to be introduced, this dinner table was the most appropriate place to do it.`
` ...However, no plates had been prepared at the table for the witch.`
`The family conference would begin in earnest after the meal, and previous experiences told them that it could last until deep into the night.`
`......But they couldn't understand what meaning there could be in keeping this person, who should be introduced, hidden until late at night.`
`So Eva, Rudolf, and Kyrie had started to suspect something.`
`......That the guest might actually be unknown to Krauss as well.`
`If she wasn't a saboteur called by Krauss to give him an advantage in the inheritance problem,`
` ...they should probably speak frankly to Krauss beforehand, and create a common front to resist anything disadvantageous to the four siblings.`
`......If she was Kinzo's saboteur,`
` whose purpose was to keep the inheritance from being handed over to the four siblings,`
` the enmity between Krauss and the other siblings could become nothing more than a weak point that benefitted the enemy...`
`"Well then, please enjoy at your leisure..."`
`With the table set and the cuisine explained, Gohda tried to leave the room, but Kyrie called him to a stop with a small voice.`
`"......Yes, Kyrie‐sama.`
` What is it?"`
`"Umm, I'm sorry.`
` ......I thought there was a guest here today—will we not be seeing her at dinner...?"`
`She had thought she'd said it nonchalantly, but unfortunately, it reached the ears of Natsuhi, who was sitting in the next seat.`
`It seemed that Natsuhi had heard it to mean "even though there are guests here today, won't the host be coming to dinner?"`
` ......In other words, that Kyrie had asked whether Kinzo was going to come to dinner.`
`"The head's condition is not good, so he said that he will take his dinner in his study.`
` ......My husband explained that in the beginning; is something...?"`
`"..................I'm sorry.`
` That's not what I meant."`
`...In an instant, Kyrie realized from Natsuhi's reaction that this unknown visitor was also unknown to Krauss and his wife.`
`.........And what that meant...`
` ......On the chessboard placed inside Kyrie's mind, she could feel the arrangement of the pieces changing, making loud clattering sounds...`
`"A guessst?"`
`It seemed that Battler, who was sitting next to Natsuhi, had heard Kyrie's words without misunderstanding them,`
` and he let out a wild voice, questioning who else could have been invited to today's family conference.`
`Thanks to that voice, the uncomfortable feeling in the siblings' chests suddenly exploded...`
`Everyone looked at Gohda at the same time.`
`......Judging by their appearances, it was obvious that at least no one here had invited that mystery woman.`
`For an instant, Gohda was startled to find everyone's gaze gathered on him, but because of his naturally vain personality, this actually gave him a feeling of superiority.`
`Therefore, he answered in an extremely calm and graceful manner.`
`"......Yes.`
` She wanted to eat alone in the VIP room, so her food was carried over there."`
`Therefore, Gohda's extremely graceful and reasonable response made it obvious to everyone that a 19th person, a visitor, existed...`
`"The VIP room? A guest?`
` ......What and who are you talking about?"`
`Natsuhi's words echoed the question that everyone who didn't know about the visit of the Golden Witch was thinking.`
`Gohda was slightly disoriented, as though he hadn't remotely expected to be questioned by Natsuhi.`
`......That honored guest had been spoken of so stringently.`
`{n}He hadn't imagined that Krauss and his wife might not have known.`
`"Umm, ......it is {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama."`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}!!`
` See, see!`
` {f:5:Beatrice} came, uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`Maria had been telling the other cousins over and over again that she had met {f:5:Beatrice} today.`
`......The cousins had answered, saying "Isn't that nice", but they hadn't believed.`
` So, ...their eyes grew wide.`
`"S‐sorry.`
` I was sure you were just joking, Maria...`
` S‐so, she really does exist..."`
`".........By {f:5:Beatrice}, ......you mean that {f:5:Beatrice} of the gold...?!"`
`"Uu!!`
` I've been saying she "exists" the whole time!`
` No one believed!!"`
`"Sorry, Maria‐chan...`
` We didn't mean to..."`
`After learning that everyone had doubted {f:5:Beatrice}'s existence, Maria, who had been in a good mood all day, completely lost her temper.`
`...George, who was sitting next to her, tried frantically to calm her.`
`"...Gohda.`
` Is that another bit of dinner entertainment?`
` *cackle*, quite a good performance."`
`".........Aniki.`
` Drop the act.`
` ...You called her, right?"`
`"Called?`
` Called who?`
` ...From where?!"`
`"Nii‐san.`
` Let's have a clear answer.`
` ......Who is that?`
` Surely you aren't going to tell us that it really is the {f:5:Beatrice} from that portrait, right?"`
`"I don't have a clue what you people are talking about!`
` Gohda, is this seriously not a joke?!"`
`"I, I, umm......`
` I was just ordered by Genji‐san, umm...!"`
`"Call Genji.`
` Now!!"`
`When Natsuhi yelled, Gohda shot out into the hallway.`
`The sound of the door being thrown open at that time triggered a sudden uproar around the dinner table.`
`"So you say you don't know either, Aniki?`
` Who called her?`
` Was it Dad?!"`
`"......I don't know anything about this.`
` It seems that you people believe that I have been pulling the strings behind the scenes, but that is a huge misunderstanding."`
`"Calm down, Krauss nii‐san.`
` We aren't at the stage where we can sound each other out anymore.`
` If you're sayin' that you don't know this mystery person either, this situation becomes ridiculous...!"`
`"Hideyoshi‐san, won't you be a little more discreet with your words?`
` My husband would not invite unnecessary people to the family conference."`
`"Honestly.`
` What are you people talking about?`
` Are you saying that the witch of the portrait has broken out of her frame and appeared?!`
` ......There's no way anyone has actually met this witch."`
`"I...met her...!"`
`Eva and Rudolf nodded at Rosa's proclamation.`
`"Uu!`
` I met her too!!`
` Uncle Krauss, belieeeve!`
` Believe Mama!`
` Uu‐uu!"`
`The brief tension was broken, and Maria also started to make a ruckus.`
`{n}...The room was by now chaotic.`
`"I don't have a clue what's going on...`
` So what's going on?`
` The witch who gave Grandfather the gold is appearing as a special guest in this year's family conference...?!"`
`"But... Really...?`
` Auntie Rosa didn't see it wrong, did she...?"`
`"I met her toooooo!!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!!"`
`"Auntie Rosa, ......are you...sure?"`
`"............Yes.`
` .........Maria and I met her, ......and even talked to her."`
`"......I met her!!`
` That was definitely a witch...!`
` Believe me!!`
` I definitely didn't see it wrong or hallucinate or anything!`
` What.........{i:was} that?!"`
`...In the instant before the typhoon visited...`
`{n}......Rosa had definitely met with the witch in the rose garden.`
`But that scene had been so hard to accept as reality......`
`and the more she spoke of it like this, the less she understood what it was she had met.`
`Ironically, because she had lost her composure when she said that she had definitely met the witch,`
` the more desperate she became, the more vague the witch's existence seemed.`
`So, it was a single composed sentence that affirmed her existence for certain.`
`".........I met her as well.`
` We exchanged greetings—well, they could hardly be called that—a few words, at least.`
` .........It's definitely not something that Rosa‐san saw wrong."`
`"Kyrie‐san, are you serious...?"`
`"Yes.`
` .........But she didn't tell me her name.`
` So I can't conclude that she was {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"......However, sorry if this is subjective,`
` ......but since I met her in the entrance hall, I was able to compare her face with the portrait.`
` ...My first impression was that she was undoubtedly the portrait's subject.`
` .........This is all just subjective, remember."`
`"That isn't possible!`
` In the first place, where did that woman come from?`
` The only boat today was the round‐trip journey of the one that escorted you all here.`
` Was she riding on that boat?!"`
`".....................`
` I admit, that's a bit of a weak spot.`
` Of course, I have no memory of such a woman getting off the boat with us."`
`"Ooh, is it really?`
` How can you prove that there wasn't a boat other than the one we rode on?`
` You can't!`
` You can't prove one "{i:didn't come}"!"`
`"That's right.`
` ......You could prove that it "came".`
` Someone who saw it just has to say so.`
` But you can't prove that it "didn't come"."`
`"Even if everyone says that it didn't come—that they didn't see it—you can't deny that it could have "come secretly".`
` It's that thing they call the "Devil's Proof"."`
`It's easy to prove that a devil "exists".`
`{n}All you have to do is meet a devil.`
`{n}But it is impossible to prove that devils "don't exist".`
`Just because no one has ever met a devil doesn't mean that you can deny the possibility that they're hiding away somewhere that humans cannot go.`
`......You can't deny the existence of aliens for exactly the same reasons.`
`Until humanity searches the whole of space and can show perfectly that aliens don't exist, you can't be sure that they don't.`
`And it's definitely impossible for us to ever check the entirety of space for the existence of aliens.`
`...Therefore, while there may be a number of ways to prove that aliens do exist, it is impossible to show proof that denies their existence.`
`"......In that case, we would just be wasting our time discussing whether or not a boat separate from the one we rode on came to the island.`
` ......She wasn't on the boat with us.`
` That much is a fact, and she must have visited this island through some other means."`
`"That's right.`
` There may be no need to discuss how she came here.`
` The essential point is the fact that she actually is in this mansion now, and doesn't feel like having dinner with us."`
`"Let's review.`
` ...Right now, there is another guest on this island other than the 18 of the Ushiromiya family.`
` And that is a guest that even Aniki and Natsuhi nee‐san don't know about, right?"`
`"I don't know...!`
` I don't know what you're talking about...!"`
`"Be silent for a while.`
` Your headache will get worse.`
` ......It is as my wife says.`
` I have no idea what you people have been talking about up until now."`
`"Then there can be only one answer.`
` ......Father called her.`
` For today's family conference!"`
`"For the family conference?!`
` Then for what reason?!"`
`"I don't know that!`
` I thought you knew, Nii‐san, that's why I thought I'd question you!"`
`"Eva, could you give it a rest?!`
` Krauss nii‐san said that he doesn't know!`
` ......So this is what we've got.`
` Father stealthily invited the witch of the portrait as a secret guest.`
` And Rosa‐san met her, Maria‐chan met her, and Kyrie‐san met her too."`
`".........That's all we know for now!`
` If she has something to say to us, she could just quickly show herself!`
` So what I want to know is why in blazes she's shut herself up without greetin' us."`
`"You think maybe Dad never had any interest in the family conference from the beginning, and just secretly called a new mistress here?`
` And had her dress up as his ideal witch?`
` ............Nah, this day holds too much significance to come to that conclusion."`
`"There can be only one reason.`
` To join in on the family conference.`
` ...She wants to claim some right to Father's inheritance!"`
`"Preposterous!!`
` The head would never have something as filthy as a mistress!"`
`"I told you to be silent!`
` I've been in this mansion with Father for considerable time, and I haven't heard about this once."`
`".........Let me humor you as best as I can...`
` ......You say Father had a hidden child with a mistress of several decades past,`
` ......and Father searched her out and called her here today.`
` ...Is that what you want to say?"`
`"Dear!`
` Father would never have something like that!`
` To waste the noble blood of the Ushiromiya family on a mistress...!`
` This is nothing more than a few people saying that they saw something!`
` It's obviously a fantasy, a delusion, a daydream!`
` Or are you all taking part in some kind of act to entrap my husband?!"`
`"What act?!!`
` If anyone is acting, it's you!!"`
`"Quit it, Aneki.`
` ......She said it in a slightly reckless way, but Natsuhi‐san is correct.`
` Kyrie saw her, but I did not.`
` Neither did you, Aneki.`
` But Rosa did."`
`"......However, that means that she "exists".`
` Because there is someone who can prove that she "exists", we directly conclude that she exists.`
` It's the opposite pattern of the Devil's Proof."`
`".........And I want to meet her too.`
` And I want to ask her directly what kind of business she has with the Ushiromiya family."`
`"I agree with you on that.`
` I truly wish to enquire as to what business she has on Rokkenjima."`
`"Don't act like you don't know!`
` She is after one thing.`
` It's Father's inheritance!`
` We should form a forward‐looking strategy with a lawyer knowledgeable about inheritance issues.`
` If the mistress claims the same rights as Mother, then our shares will be cut right in half!"`
`".........Wai‐wait a second, everybody!`
` Genji‐san will come very soon.`
` He knows everything.`
` I'm sure he will answer our questions!`
` Until then, let's stop talking about this!!"`
`"Come on now, kids!`
` Sorry, but we adults have to start talking about something a little complicated!`
` Go back to the guesthouse!!"`
`Rosa yelled at the children, slightly emotionally.`
`The children didn't understand why they were suddenly being yelled at now, but Eva and the rest came to the same realization as Rosa after a delay.`
`They were talking so grandly about the filthy topic of the inheritance in front of the children.`
`...There was no way that they'd want their children to remain here.`
`{n}So they all immediately agreed with Rosa's plan.`
`"Tha‐that's right, just as Rosa‐san says!`
` George!`
` Take all the cousins and go back to the guesthouse!`
` You all play nice together, you hear?!"`
`"George, do as you're told.`
` Take all of the cousins, and leave right now!"`
`"Wa‐...wait a second, Mother...!`
` We haven't even finished eating yet...!"`
`"Uu!`
` And we still haven't had desserrrrt!!`
` Uuu!!"`
`"We will have Gohda‐san carry dessert to the guesthouse!`
` So leave!!"`
`"Jessica.`
` From here on, the adults will be talking together.`
` Go."`
`".........Fi‐...fine.`
` .........Even though it's only half‐eaten..."`
`"...So I guess I'm not going to be the only exception."`
`"Thank you for understanding, Battler‐kun.`
` ...But you're lucky, you know."`
`"Huh?`
` Why?"`
`"I'd want to leave if I could."`
`"...Ihihihi!`
` I bet you would.`
` I'll let you adults enjoy your happy family chat about the inheritance."`
`"............I will also leave my seat.`
` It appears that I have no place here tonight."`
`Nanjo softly rose from his seat.`
`...He had been calmly watching the whole discussion from his seat at the farthest corner of the table, without pointlessly interrupting.`
` ......His reaction was very adult, like a calm old gentleman.`
`When Nanjo rose from his seat, it urged on the other people who were supposed to leave.`
`As the children noisily rose from their seats, a commotion was heard in the hallway as the servants returned.`
`"I apologize for taking so long...`
` I have called Genji..."`
`"......I was checking to see that all of the doors and windows were shut, so it took me some time.`
` My apologies."`
`"Come on! Children, to the guesthouse!`
` Gohda‐san, I'm very sorry, but could you carry the desserts for the children to the guesthouse?"`
`"I see...`
` ...Is that what you wish...?"`
`It seemed that Gohda did not appreciate that the dinner he had worked so hard on was going to be interrupted like this.`
`...He sent Natsuhi a look as though asking her whether that was really alright.`
`"Do as Rosa‐san says.`
` Also, it will not be necessary to set out dessert for us.`
` Be sure not to approach the dining hall until we call you.`
` Tell that to the rest of the servants too.`
` Understood?"`
`"Ye‐...yes.`
` Certainly..."`
`"Come, everyone.`
` Shall we go?`
` Maria‐san, you too, you must not trouble your mother any further."`
`"Uu‐uu‐uu!!`
` I wanna talk about Beato!!`
` No no no, uu‐uu‐uu!!!"`
`"Maria‐chan,`
` will you tell us about {f:5:Beatrice} in the guesthouse?`
` ...I really want to hear about the witch.`
` Okay?"`
`"Uu?`
` Uu!"`
`"......You're really good, George nii‐san.`
` I'm impressed."`
`"Are you sure you don't have kids?`
` You're too used to this, ihihi!"`
`Maria's mood was completely back to normal at George's words, and she even took the initiative in hurrying everyone to go to the guesthouse.`
`It looked like Gohda didn't like being kicked out himself, but he was unable to disobey Natsuhi, and left the room with Battler and the rest, closing the door...`
`"......Do you all have some business with me?"`
`"Yes, we do.`
` A bunch of it.`
` And that goes for all of us.`
` So much that we almost want to draw lots to see who asks the first question."`
`"Though I believe that no matter who draws the winning lot, the first question would be the same."`
`"No doubt.`
` .........Genji‐san.`
` Answer us honestly.`
` ...This woman called {f:5:Beatrice} in the VIP room right now... Who is she?"``...Hideyoshi's claim that advertising doubled the taste was apparently right.`
`The kids and Nanjo, who had been chased out to the guesthouse, had gathered in the cousins' room,`
` and were eating the cake that Kumasawa had brought there for dessert.`
`It was both wonderful and high‐class, with lavish amounts of cream and decorated deliciously with fruits,`
` but even though it was delicious, for some reason it didn't taste quite as good...`
`"Haha, without Gohda‐san's advertising, it doesn't taste nearly as good."`
`"And good frickin' luck asking Kumasawa baa‐chan for advertising, she'll just say it's made out of mackerel."`
`"Uu?!`
` Really?!`
` You can make cake from mackerel?!"`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho.`
` Oh, goodness, yes, this cake too, if you mix the squeezed juice of a mackerel in with the flour and eggs and bake it up, it comes out all fluffy.`
` Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho."`
`"That would be incredible if true.`
` Maybe mackerel cake will show up on the new menu at Father's stores."`
`"Wahahaha!`
` Because mackerel is full of nutrients and has a healthy image.`
` It could be really popular with women and old people!`
` But I'm not gonna get anywhere near it!"`
`"Girls won't eat something that weird."`
`"Even old people would wish to decline."`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho!`
` But it's delicious!"`
`Kumasawa was really raising the mood with the mackerel jokes that were her specialty.`
` ...But the sound of the downpouring rain invariably focused their concern on the mystery guest.`
`In the end, they ended up showering Maria with questions again, since she was the only person here to have met {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`".........I never believed...that story was true."`
`"From the way you say that, it sounds like this wasn't the first time you heard that Maria was meeting a witch, even if you didn't believe it."`
`"...Yeah.`
` I thought it was a pretty typical fairy tale for people of that imaginative age."`
`"Exiiists!!`
` {f:5:Beatrice} "exiiists"!`
` Every year when we come to the family conference, I see her and we play together!"`
`"That's right.`
` Although {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama doesn't usually show herself,`
` I hear that she sometimes unexpectedly appears before honest people with clean hearts, to play pranks.`
` Hoh‐hoh‐ho."`
`{f:5:Beatrice} was a name which referred to the being in that fairy tale about the Rokkenjima witch.`
`Because the family and the servants publicly accepted the image of the witch of Kinzo's delusions to keep him in a good mood,`
` it became established as Rokkenjima's fairy tale, or maybe ghost story...`
`To the family members who knew that history, the fairy tale of the Golden Witch didn't have much substance.`
` ...However, they hadn't been able to say that in front of Kinzo.`
`So to those who didn't know the history,`
` ...like young Maria, for example, it definitely wasn't unsubstantial, ...but a real legend of a witch.`
`So Maria believed in the legend of the witch.`
` She swallowed it whole.`
`...That was natural for an imaginative girl who believed in witches.`
`So no one said anything to betray her dream.`
`{n}...On the contrary, they arranged things together to get her excited about her dreams.`
`"...So even on those times when Maria‐chan showed off candy and said that {f:5:Beatrice} had given it to her,`
` ...I thought that somebody had probably slipped a candy into Maria‐chan's handbag or something to create that impression."`
`"............I have also put on such performances on a few occasions in the past,`
` secretly placing sweets somewhere for her.`
` ...Probably, Kumasawa‐san too—no—I expect all of the servants and all of the Ushiromiya family have done it once or twice."`
`"......So, if it will make a small, innocent kid happy, you sometimes plan it together and place some sweets somewhere.`
` ......In that case, I'll bet you do that kind of thing all the time, right, George‐aniki?"`
`"............Who knows."`
`Admitting that would probably be unrefined.`
`George admitted it while being extremely wary that Maria didn't find out.`
`"In other words, ......it's kinda like Santa Claus.`
` To protect a kid's dreams, the parents plot together and lie, setting presents at the bedside of a child fast asleep."`
`"......I mean, you do want to protect kids' dreams.`
` ...As for me, I obviously found out that Santa didn't exist a long time ago.`
` ......But if it was okay not to wake from that dream, I'd have liked to have believed it my whole life."`
`"...Because they know that the world is tough,`
` ...adults want to at least protect a child's untainted dreams."`
`"Uu!!`
` {f:5:Beatrice} exists!`
` "Exiiiists"!!!"`
`"Oh, goodness, certainly.`
` {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama does exist, you know?`
` Some time ago, when I was drying mackerel to make some black tea, all of a sudden—"`
`"......Well, that's basically how it went.`
` ...Or at least, how we thought it went."`
`"To sum up,`
` ......she's a witch that supposedly no one believed in, except for Maria."`
`"Those words don't quite explain it.`
` ......It's not that we didn't believe.`
` ...We were trying to let {i:her} believe."`
`So this was about not betraying a child's innocence.`
`But Santa doesn't exist in reality.`
` If you don't want them to be all disappointed when they learn that, you should just not give them that dream in the first place.`
`...Did I think like that because I was still a long way from becoming a full adult?`
`Battler had finally attained a level of understanding about the true form of the Rokkenjima witch.`
`.........But the current situation lay on an even higher level of understanding than that,`
` and overturned all its premises...`
`"......That's all we believed the witch {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama to be, but then she actually appeared.`
` Right."`
`"Furthermore, judging from our parents' uproar, it looks like she wasn't an invited guest.`
` ......That sounds kinda interesting."`
`"There actually is no basis to say that a woman called {f:5:Beatrice} doesn't exist.`
` ......It's what Uncle Rudolf called a Devil's Proof.`
` ......None of us knew that a woman calling herself {f:5:Beatrice} existed."`
`"...But that doesn't mean we can deny the possibility that {f:5:Beatrice} exists."`
`"......Doctor Nanjo, you've been friends with Grandfather for a long time, right?"`
`".....................`
` ...There was a period when I was questioned quite a lot on this topic at the family conferences, by Krauss‐san and the others.`
` ......The topic of whether Kinzo‐san may have had a mistress long ago, and even a hidden child with her."`
`"I see.`
` Our parents' heads are full with the distribution of the inheritance.`
` So it's blindingly obvious that if the daughter of a mistress showed up, it'd mean trouble for them."`
`"Krauss‐san and the rest probably asked Genji‐san about it first.`
` However, Genji‐san has sworn loyalty to Kinzo‐san as his right‐hand man, ...and is probably a more trusted friend to Kinzo‐san than myself."`
`" ......I imagine Genji‐san didn't tell them anything.`
` ......And so they turned to me as his next‐oldest friend, I suppose..."`
`"And?`
` ......When all is said and done, Doctor Nanjo,`
` ......{i:did} Grandfather have a mistress called {f:5:Beatrice}?"`
`"...............He did.`
` ...No, I have never met her.`
` ...However, I have heard from Kinzo‐san that he did have a relationship with a woman like that.`
` .........He said that she passed away a very long time ago."`
`"......She's dead.`
` ......And did he have a child with her?"`
`"That, I do not know.`
` ......But Kinzo‐san always says that he is researching how to revive {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"...Usually, if one loses a lover and has a child left from them, they would pour all of that love on that child.`
` ......Therefore, we naturally thought that there probably wasn't a child between Kinzo‐san and {f:5:Beatrice}..."`
`"............Hm?`
` ....That makes that a Devil's Proof as well."`
`"......It does.`
` ......It's impossible to prove that he "didn't" have a child with his mistress.`
` ......So now that she's actually appeared, we have to assume that he "did"."`
`"That's a bit of a rushed argument.`
` ......It's more realistic that someone caught wind of the trouble over the Ushiromiya inheritance issue,`
` found out about Grandfather's relationship with a mistress long ago,`
` and impersonated her, trying to work their way into the inheritance issue."`
`"......It is more realistic.`
` ...However, we can't deny the possibility that she really is a hidden child,`
` who lived in isolation, forgotten by Grandfather, and who's returned for revenge, right...?"`
`"Revennnge?!`
` The hell did that come from?!"`
`"Aaah, sorry, sorry...`
` I'm a guy, we just like to embellish things to make them more interesting.`
` I've seen too many weird dramas.`
` Ihihihi!"`
`Normally, that would have been a light joke.`
`......But it had come when a mystery guest calling herself {f:5:Beatrice}, who no one had invited,`
` had marched in on the day of the family conference, the day of the inheritance distribution discussion, which even without the witch was threatening to become a bloodbath.`
`.........There was no way that Battler's joke would be welcomed with laughter.`
`So it was a really big help when Nanjo laughed energetically to calm everyone down.`
`"Hahahahaha...`
` I see, I see, that does sound quite interesting.`
` I should love to read a novel with a plot like that."`
`"Well, I don't think that could happen in reality.`
` ......After all, right now, on this island, there's one, two, three... 18 people, right?"`
`"If she did something weird, we could immediately restrain her.`
` And thanks to the typhoon, she can't even leave the island.`
` Basically, there's just no way she could even begin to pull off a crazy crime like that."`
`"......I agree.`
` In a dead‐end without any way to escape, and in a situation where everyone is suspicious of her,`
` I really don't think she could pull off a terrifying revenge tragedy like that."`
`"I imagine not.`
` ...If revenge was her aim, it would have been more realistic for her to come in secret, without showing herself.`
` You don't often hear about people appearing openly for revenge except in historical plays."`
`"I wouldn't be so sure about that?`
` Revenge is based on emotion, not frickin' logic.`
` And if she wants revenge so badly she's ready to give her life for it, she might not be much afraid of the police or the number of people or that there's no way out."`
`"It's alright, Jessica‐chan.`
` Nothing as horrible as we imagine will happen."`
`"Ihihi!`
` Like the battle royal between our parents over the inheritance isn't horrible."`
`"......You're right.`
` ...Dad and Uncle Rudolf are pretty tough, and Auntie Eva's even trained in the martial arts.`
` ......We'll be OK.`
` Yeah..."`
`Jessica didn't say it, but she had vaguely noticed that her own father opposed all of the other siblings regarding the inheritance.`
`They acted like everything was good in front of the children, but when that pretense was lifted away, like it had been at dinner, it would become a tumultuous uproar.`
`It was only natural that Jessica, realizing that,`
` would be frightened that her father and mother had gotten into some kind of trouble,`
` ...and were about to be sacrificed for something terrifying...`
`"Seriously.`
` George‐aniki's right.`
` ...Nothing's gonna happen.`
` Even if she pretends she's a witch,`
` what can a single {i:human woman} who can't even use magic do?"`
`"Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi..."`
`The sudden, creepy laugh made all of us jump.`
`......And when we realized that this strange laugh was coming from Maria, we were shocked again.`
`".........So that's how it is.`
` ...That's your perception, isn't it, Battler?"`
`"Wha‐.........what is?`
` Don't laugh all creepy like that."`
`"You accept {f:5:Beatrice}'s existence for now.`
` At least you accept her as the 19th person and a guest.`
` ............But that's all, right?`
` ...You don't accept that the 19th person, {f:5:Beatrice}, is a witch, right...?"`
`"You surprised us all for that?`
` ......Of course I don't.`
` {i:There's obviously no such thing as witches}.`
` It's impossible for it to be anything other than a human woman pretending to be one."`
`"......Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi.`
` Hmmm...?`
` That makes no sense, Battler.`
` ......That's a Devil's Proof, you know?`
` ......There's obviously no such thing as witches?`
` But that just means you've never met a witch,`
` and doesn't mean you can deny that witches exist, right...?"`
`"...............`
` .........That's right.`
` ...That really is right.`
` I can't prove that witches don't exist.`
` ......However, even if I can't prove it, I can claim it.`
` I claim that witches don't exist."`
`"How...?`
` How can you claim that witches don't exist even though you can't prove it...?"`
`"'Cause stuff like that doesn't exist."`
`"Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi!`
` And that's QED?`
` Proof concluded without any evidence or basis?`
` A classic example of how ignorance shelves its problems.`
` A reckless suspension of thought.`
` Kihihihihihihihi...!"`
`"In that case, I have one answer, Maria.`
` ......The witch side has to show some proof themselves.`
` This is also part of the Devil's Proof.`
` ......If you bring one, it'll be over quickly."`
`"...In our case, this lady calling herself {f:5:Beatrice}...`
`just has to perform some magnificent magic, like sending out some sparkling stars with her wand or something,`
` {i:and show us something that's impossible for {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s},`
` right?"`
`"......Come now, you two.`
` Please settle down..."`
`Kumasawa noticed that the atmosphere between them was getting worse, and tried to calm them.`
`...It seemed as though Battler quickly realized that he was acting immaturely.`
`But Maria's expression didn't loosen.`
` ......She kept staring at Battler as she laughed creepily...`
`"You quit it too, Maria.`
` ...Let's get back in a good mood, alright?"`
`"Kihihihihihihihihihihi, kihihihihihihihihihihihihi."`
`"....................."`
`"......If that's what you want, {f:5:Beatrice} will show you, I'm sure.`
` {i:Something impossible for {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s}.`
` And then you too will believe, right?`
` About {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"............Sure.`
` ......If she lets me have a look‐see, I'll believe."`
`"It's a chess argument between the witch and you, Battler.`
` .........If you get checkmated, you will believe in the witch."`
`"Oh, that's a stylish analogy.`
` ......The witch shows her magic.`
` My king is put into check."`
`"I quibble, saying that it would be possible to reproduce that by measures even a human could take, and create an escape for my king.`
` ...If I can't do that, it's checkmate—that's a pretty good analogy."`
`"Battler.`
` ......In chess, you and your opponent have pieces which move in the same way.`
` That's why you can read your opponent's moves."`
`"............But you know what?`
` You haven't supposed that your opponent's pieces might be able to move in much more strange ways than yours.`
` You've simply assumed that, since witches shouldn't exist, the movements of {f:5:Beatrice}'s pieces will obviously be the same as your own."`
`"..........................."`
`"......But the thing is,`
` .........sorry, Battler, but your chess partner isn't {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.`
` She's a witch.`
` ......She can move her pieces in ways that {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s can't.`
` .........Right now, your perception of that is wrong.`
` ...Battler, you like Auntie Kyrie's chessboard thinking, right?"`
`".........Yeah.`
` I like that style of thinking where you stand in your opponent's position."`
`"And that's no good.`
` Even though your opponent is a witch, you won't accept that.`
` .........So you can't understand the moves a witch can make, and your chessboard thinking won't work.`
` Your perception of your opponent is wrong.`
` The very first premise of chessboard thinking is broken down."`
`"........................Hoh,`
` ...is that what you say?"`
`"{i:{ruby:sonata:You} cannot win in chess against a witch}...!`
` Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi!"`
`"...I do not know what happened after that.`
` We servants were ordered not to approach the dining room..."`
`".........I see.`
` So, Shannon, have you, uh, ever met this person called {f:5:Beatrice} before?"`
`"...........................`
` ......I have no idea."`
`That was a slightly odd way to say it.`
`{n}I thought it didn't sound like she meant her memory was vague.`
`"......For us servants, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama is another master of this mansion.`
` ......Some speak as if we spread that rumor due to having been influenced by the Master, but..."`
`"......Since the time I started working here, the story of {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama was already whispered about."`
`"I heard about it before.`
` ...How you'll get cursed if you don't respect her, and how there was a servant who actually had an accident this way."`
`"Yes...`
` ......But it's true that some people believed more or less than others.`
` ...I, umm, ...believe that respect for that sort of thing shouldn't be forgotten, so I have never doubted that she exists."`
`"......I dimly believed that a...`
`...umm......uncertain being called the Golden Witch surely existed."`
`"...And then that witch whose existence was uncertain actually showed herself and came in openly through the entrance hall... Is that what happened?"`
`".........I don't know.`
` ...............I don't know...anything."`
`"............`
` ...When you brought her dinner, did you talk about anything?"`
`".................................`
` ......No, nothing."`
`"I see.`
` ...Still, a witch that eats food...somehow doesn't sound so realistic.`
` Maybe it's just someone who knows about the witch legend on this island taking on {f:5:Beatrice}'s name after all."`
`".........I think you've probably come to respect {f:5:Beatrice} and think of her as something like a guardian goddess of the mansion.`
` So when a person appeared actually calling themselves that, maybe you were a little disturbed."`
`".........`
` .........Yes.`
` I think that definitely could be it."`
`George was slightly at a loss at what to do about Shannon's downcast appearance.`
`......Possibly,`
` not just Genji, but also the young servants, including Shannon,`
` had been strictly questioned about whether they had a clue as to who this person called {f:5:Beatrice} was...`
`Thinking that, he had tried to cheer her up somehow.`
`Like Maria and Jessica, Shannon too must be unable to completely hide her agitation over the sudden visit of a person calling herself the Golden Witch.`
`He thought that must be the case.`
`{n}...But George had no way of knowing what was in Shannon's heart.`
`Shannon was bitter and sad.`
`......The door to the Golden Land...would be opened.`
`{n}......The witch had definitely told her that.`
`That meant...the demise of everything.`
`.........Even if she accepted the ring from George,`
` ............now, they could never be married.`
`No, .........in the first place...`
`{n}...Did furniture like her......have the right to be married?`
`Even if the witch hadn't come to tell of their demise, ......wasn't it fated to fail sometime or another?`
`Hadn't she turned her gaze towards the fun days with George, ...and purposefully closed her eyes to the sad reality?`
`"............What's wrong?`
` ...You've really been seeming down for a while now."`
`"George‐san.`
` ......What does it mean...to be engaged?"`
`"Huh?!`
` Ah, ......err!`
` It means making a promise to marry.`
` ...But the way I think of it, it means the same thing as marriage."`
`"......Honestly, I want to take you as my wife right now, and take you back home.`
` ......But right now, I am in the middle of training, and I'm still a long way from gaining the ability needed to create my own castle.`
` That's why I want to become an independent man first, and only then, proudly take you home with me."`
`"I'm not talking about the distant future.`
` I just want you to wait a short three years.`
` ......But even so, I don't want to lie about my feelings for the next three years."`
`"So, ......I decided to give you an engagement ring.`
` ......That might be a shameful reason as a man.`
` An engagement because I want you to wait, because I can't balance a wife and a job, might be shameful.`
` ......But I will never—"`
`".........Thank you very much.`
` ...I now understand that to you, an engagement ring isn't just another present you would give to a lover."`
`"O‐of course not.`
` An engagement ring isn't a simple accessory.`
` It's an oath between lovers, a precious promise left in the form of a ring."`
`".........*giggle*.`
` ...In that case, if we got married quickly, it would become unnecessary, right?"`
`"The‐then it wouldn't be an engagement ring I'd give you.`
` I'd give it to you as a wedding ring.`
` ......Either way, it won't change the fact that I'll give you a ring."`
`"So it's like a sales contract, saying "This woman is mine, nobody touch her"."`
`"Nn......no, umm, ......that's not what I......`
` ...............*cough*."`
`George knew about his shameful character.`
` When he had fallen for Shannon, and sworn to become an excellent man, he had sworn to part ways with that shameful part of himself.`
`......So, he chose to answer a little roughly on purpose.`
`{n}...Believing that Shannon would find it reassuring.`
`".........No, ...that may be exactly it.`
` .........Sayo.`
` I'll make you my wife.`
` ...I won't give you to anyone else.`
` I'll make you all mine.`
` ...So no one better lay a hand on you.`
` ......That's what this ring is.`
` ...Without a doubt."`
`"Thank you very much, George‐san.`
` ............I'm truly...happy."`
`Then, George‐san.`
`......If it was decided by fate that this engagement ring, ......that this promise would not be fulfilled, ......would you still give it to me...?`
`...Shannon was about to ask that, ...but she swallowed her words.`
`Because George had already spoken the answer.`
`......George had said it.`
` He had said that to him, an engagement ring was infinitely similar to a wedding ring.`
`Therefore, accepting George's ring had a far more sacred significance than a promise to marry.`
`"Which is why...`
`...I will stop calling this an engagement ring.`
` From now on, this isn't an engagement.`
` It's a wedding ring."`
`"Is, ...is that alright...?`
` Is it alright to, umm, just proclaim that we're married without God's blessing......?"`
`"Yeah.`
` It's enough to tell God, Father, and Mother about it afterwards.`
` We'll declare that the two of us have been joined in marriage.`
` ..........No one can overturn it."`
`".........George‐san......"`
`"I'm not saying this because of a momentary emotion.`
` I'm not just looking at how you are now.`
` .........I'm looking at how you will be tomorrow, and the next day.`
` ...I'm even gazing at you as you'll be in old age, in the future, as I say this."`
`"......You are always telling me about that, George‐san.`
` ...About how you want to spend your old age slowly, surrounded by sprightly children and grandchildren."`
`"Yeah.`
` At that time, an older you will be beside me.`
` That is what I predict—no—what I foresee.`
` ...Yes.`
` Because that day will surely come."`
`".....................Will it...`
`surely come?`
` {e:070:......Is it OK......for me to believe?}{e:100:"}`
`"Yes.`
` Surely.`
` Definitely.`
` ......And this ring proves it without words."`
`"............Show it to me...`
`...please."`
`"Huh?`
` Ah,`
` ah,`
` ah,`
` .........h‐he‐here it is...!"`
`George, thinking he was being told to show her the ring, hurriedly took out the ring box.`
`...Even though he had practiced so much, he hadn't been able to look cool.`
`But Shannon wasn't looking at that.`
`......With a straight and direct gaze, with faint tears and a smile...`
`.........She was staring right at George's eyes—no, into something she could see beyond his eyes...`
`"......Show me...`
`......that future,`
` .........please."`
`"Ah............yeah.`
` ......I'll show it to you.`
` For sure.`
` ......I promise.`
` .........And not just until old age.`
` ...After we die too.`
` ...Even if we become spirits, we'll always, always be together."`
`Shannon wiped away her tears and took the ring box.`
` Inside was a diamond ring more than worthy of blessing the two of them.`
`George said the line that he had practiced over and over again inside his head.`
`"I, ......I want you to put that ring on whatever finger you like, and have that be your answer.`
` Umm, so, by tomorrow morning......"`
`"......*giggle*."`
`Shannon smiled, took the ring,`
` ......and with a completely natural movement, put it on the ring finger of her left hand.`
`It really had looked, ......like a very, very natural movement,`
` and for a while, George was stunned...`
`"This...is my answer.`
` ...George‐san."`
`"Shannon......`
` No,`
` .........Sayo..............."`
`"......Even if we become spirits,`
` .........we'll always,`
` ............always......`
`be together.`
` .........George‐san."`
`There was no blessing from God, no pastor to witness, nothing.`
`{n}But the two to be married had proclaimed it.`
`{n}...Two souls were joined here today.........`
`".....................Nee‐san, ............you're an idiot."`
`"......Am I really?"`
`"Even though you're furniture......`
` ......Even though...you're furniture......!"`
`"I'm not furniture.`
` Not anymore."`
`"......Liar!!`
` Why are you fooling yourself?!`
` You know that you can never become human!`
` You know that you can't become human unless you go to the Golden Land!!"`
`"......So why did you throw away the promise that enabled you to go to the Golden Land...?!!"`
`"Oh yeah.`
` By accepting the ring, ......that promise with {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama comes to nothing, doesn't it?`
` ......*giggle*, sorry."`
`"............Now, me, you, George‐sama, the Master, each and every one of us has the same conditions.`
` Thirteen people will be made sacrifices.`
` Only five will be invited to the Golden Land.`
` ......And you......rejected one of those places,`
` ......yourself......"`
`"That's odd.`
` ......It looks like you're the one with lingering regrets, Kanon‐kun."`
`"You're the one with regrets, aren't you, Nee‐san!`
` You got engaged, right?!`
` Even though you knew it was a fate that would never be fulfilled!!"`
`"Yep.`
` ...I promised that we would always, always be together, for eternity."`
`"......So you know what?`
` ......In that instant, our eternity was completed.`
` Even if we become sacrifices, it's already completed.`
` So, it's alright."`
`".........Kanon‐kun, you're the one who actually has regrets.`
` ...We're furniture, right?`
` No matter what the result, we will be freed.`
` ...In that case, it doesn't matter whether we go to the Golden Land or not."`
`"......And yet you're set on going to the Golden Land.`
` .........You want to become human no matter what, right?`
` ...Why?"`
`"Because I want to become human!!`
` I've had enough of being furniture!!"`
`"Why?"`
`"I...wanted to fall in love as well...!!!"`
`Tears spilled from both of Kanon's eyes.`
` ...And he howled.`
`"......I...liked Milady...!!`
` And after seeing Milady on that day, I started liking her even more...!`
` And when I heard that Milady also liked me, I was really happy...!!`
` But I'm furniture, ......and I can't accept Milady's feelings!!"`
`"...That's where you're wrong.`
` .........We may be furniture.`
` We may be less than human.`
` ...But I learned that doesn't mean we aren't qualified to love."`
`"I believed that if we couldn't make those feelings eternal, we were better without them!!`
` I just decided that someday, a day would come when I would disappear, and that would definitely hurt her, .........no, that's wrong!!"`
`"I was just frightened!!`
` I......was just afraid, and thought that if love could not be eternal, I was better off not knowing it!!"`
`"......Cicadas fall in love during a span of only a few weeks out of their whole lives, and then they disappear.`
` .........I don't think there are any cicadas that don't fall in love because it will be over in a few weeks."`
`"Uuuuuuuuuuughhh!!`
` Uuuuu{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}uughhh!!"`
`It seemed that Kanon was still speaking of his regrets, but by now it was all jumbled up in his crying voice...`
`"......I hate that witch...!!`
` ...Why did she plant these feelings in me...?!`
` If only, if only she hadn't pulled that weird prank, I wouldn't have payed Milady any notice...!!!"`
`"............{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama is so cruel, isn't she.`
` ...To make you cry bitter tears, she played games with your fate.`
` .........But, the witch probably isn't achieving what she plotted.`
` ...After all—"`
`Knowing love isn't a lingering attachment that ties you to life.`
` It is the place we should reach on our journey through life...`
`So there you have it, Kanon.`
`That promise you worked so hard for has now come to nothing.`
`*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
`Well now.`
` With this, the conditions for all of the pieces are the same.`
`There are eighteen pieces! Thirteen will be sacrificed!`
`Who will the five survivors be?`
`............Or.`
`Will someone destroy this ritual?`
`Who?!! How?!`
`Fuhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!`
`This isn't a chess problem.`
` It's a game on equal footing.`
`I won't be closing in one‐sidedly.`
`You can frantically run from my advances, and make it a tie, a result of no contest.`
`Well, the best you can do is have that repeat over and over.`
`And it probably won't be that difficult for you.`
`However, these no contest results will continue forever, soon wearing down your mind, and eventually killing it.`
`At that time, you will accept your defeat and surrender to me!!`
`The reason I said it was a fair game.`
`......That is because the rules for my loss have also been established.`
`There's nothing so boring as a game you can't lose, you see.`
`The way to defeat me.`
`That is...the epitaph offered to my portrait.`
`That is both the way to open the door to the Golden Land and the key to destroying my ritual.`
`I complete the ritual according to the epitaph.`
`You solve the epitaph's riddle, destroy the ritual and overthrow me...!`
`Solve the riddle hidden in the epitaph, and expose the location of the vast gold I gave to Kinzo!!`
`What result will this game show us?!`
`I'm expecting a good fight from you.`
`Entertain me, Ushiromiya Battleeeeeeeeeeeeeer!!`
`"................................."`
`"...............I have no objections.`
` ...Natsuhi and I accept it."`
`".........Ggh......`
` ...I can't believe it, ...and I don't want to, but...`
`......that is......reality, isn't it..."`
`"...Natsuhi.`
` Choose your words more carefully.`
` .........She is this family's most honored guest."`
`"............W‐we accept it too.`
` ...There's nothin' more to say."`
`"Yes.`
` ...I accept it.`
` .........I have absolutely no complaints.`
` I can't believe that you really......`
` .........I have to honestly respect you."`
`"Me too...`
` ............Incredible.`
` I genuinely respect you.`
` ......So I have to accept it."`
`"I accept it too...`
` .........Still can't believe it.`
` ...But, .........what can you do?`
` {i:You've proven devils!}`
` You win...!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!`
` The Devil's Proof was a convenient excuse that you liked using to show that something was impossible to prove, ......but now it's become your mortal enemy, has it not?"`
`"......Don't torture me, great witch.`
` .........I've already accepted you.`
` I resign."`
`"................................."`
`".........Kyrie.`
` Do you still have any objections...?`
` I must have everyone in agreement.`
` If you alone will not accept my existence..."`
`As the witch laughed boldly, the siblings started to panic.`
`{n}...They were afraid of displeasing the witch.`
`Kyrie lightly closed her eyes, ...and after keeping silent for a while, opened her mouth.`
`"...My apologies.`
` ......I resign."`
`Only Kyrie had faced the witch with stern eyes until the end.`
`......However, she had only been able to resist acknowledging the truth for a short time.`
`The reality—the being—that was before her eyes...couldn't be denied.`
`{n}{i:Devils had already been proven}...!`
`".........I also...accept it.`
` ......You are {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` The Ushiromiya family alchemist.`
` ...And a user of great magic.`
` ..................I must accept the fact that you are a witch...!"``......What was the sound that always filled the ears?`
`{n}The sound of the rain, the sound of a waterfall, or was it radio static?`
`In that case, I want it to be the sound of blood flowing through the body.`
` ......I want it to be the sound of the blood circulating throughout my body, telling me that I am still alive...`
`".....................Hmm...`
` ......Is it...morning...?"`
`The light entering through a crack in the curtain was faint, but it at least told him that dawn had broken.`
`Kinzo, still in the same pose he had when he awoke, ...still sitting in his chair and looking up at the ceiling, ...felt the blood slowly travel throughout his body...`
`...Judging by the clock, it was early morning, six on the dot.`
` ......No matter how tired he was, no matter how deeply he slept, he woke up at exactly this time, as though he had measured it with an hourglass.`
`He didn't think that something like this was worthy of boasting of, but he told himself that while he could still do something like this, he was still in robust health.`
`".........Morning has come, which means...`
` ...............Hmmm.`
` ......It seems that I've escaped being one of the first sacrifices.`
` ......Was the result of the roulette fortunate, ...or is this the fruit of my efforts?`
` It is irritating that I cannot tell the difference, but I will not say that."`
`Kinzo was very slightly driven by a temptation to look at the other side of the study door.`
`Because he thought that maybe he might find the traces of a vain struggle to break the door,`
` made by something trying to select him as one of the first six sacrifices.`
`"...Hmph.`
` .........Humans are cheap creatures.`
` ......They claim to do their best and leave the rest to Providence, yet when they are given good fortune, they desire to flatter themselves that it arose not from simple luck, but from their own ability."`
`So he wanted to check whether there was a wretched mark on the door.`
`{n}...That is only human.`
`Therefore, Kinzo did not check.`
` He repressed the things that he wanted to do because he was human.`
` By that, Kinzo could immerse himself in a feeling of sufficiency, as though he had become a being that surpassed humans...`
`He became aware of human desire, and forbade it.`
`{n}Things that a human wanted to do, he resisted.`
`......This eccentric and rebellious sense had surely given him a rare genius,`
` which must have allowed him to succeed in his exploits as he revived the Ushiromiya family in one generation...`
`"Well then, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` What were the six pieces you took?`
` ......And what will your next move be?`
` ...Entertain me.`
` .........My defense is perfect.`
` I will not shame myself like last time.`
` ......Heh, ......heheheh."`
`The servants woke early.`
` They had to open the curtains, prepare breakfast, and complete various other tasks to welcome the guests to a new day.`
`Gohda was the most enthusiastic.`
`He had been told to concentrate his efforts in particular on his work as a chef for the duration of the family conference,`
` and he had been specially exempted from several tasks that servants normally must do.`
`...It seemed that Gohda, who was a show off, had a particular feeling of supremacy about that.`
` He left the preparations of the inside of the mansion to Genji and the rest, and worked on preparing breakfast in the kitchen.`
`Genji split the work with Shannon and Kanon, and they carried out various tasks.`
`Shannon headed to the dining hall and knocked.`
`...Last year, the family conference had continued into the small hours of the night.`
` It wouldn't have been odd for this year's conference to continue all the way into the next morning.`
`So she had knocked out of consideration for the possibility that they were still having a discussion inside.`
`But there was no response, so she opened the door and said good morning.`
`"...Good morning.`
` ...............Is anyone there?"`
`The room was cold, and it seemed that the conference had ended a long time before.`
`On top of the table, there was a tea set, from which they had probably been drinking, arranged in a way that would make it easy to clean them up.`
`Cleaning away the tea was a servant's job.`
` So if the family was too caring and cleaned it up themselves, the servants would lose face.`
`Therefore, just doing this much for the servants truly was a pleasing act of kindness.`
`As she approached the table to clean it away, she noticed that something like a memo had been left along with the cups.`
`It had been placed together with the tea set, so, naturally thinking it was a memo for the servant cleaning up, Shannon took it.`
`Written on it was not a request, nor thanks for preparing the tea, but just a single word.`
`Shannon looked at it blankly, and read it out loud...`
`"............Chapel.`
` ...............?"`
`A small sound kept repeating over and over.`
`{n}It was a sound that would ordinarily have been trivial and insignificant.`
`I hope I stop hearing it soon, then I could return to my doze, someone thought vaguely.`
`...But no matter how much time passed, the sound did not end.`
`{n}It repeated over and over.`
`Aaah, shut up.`
`{n}Who is that?`
` Banging on the door constantly.`
`As soon as she realized this, she woke up.`
`{n}......Someone was knocking.`
`Then she noticed that there wasn't just a knock, but a voice too.`
`".........Rosa‐sama, ...Rosa‐sama.`
` ......Good morning."`
`"Wa‐......wait.`
` I'm coming now."`
`It had been Genji's voice.`
`{n}Looking at the clock, it was still before seven.`
`......It was clearly too early to wake the guests.`
`{n}...Did something happen that was bad enough to cause this?`
`She felt her sleepiness increasingly fade thanks to this ominous premonition.`
`Because Genji had been a familiar servant to Rosa since her childhood days, she opened the door a crack and answered, even though she was slightly defenseless in her pajamas.`
`"Good morning.`
` I apologize for waking you this early."`
`"......Did something happen?"`
`"Yes...`
` .........Actually, at the chapel, {nobreak:{m:-5:——}—}"`
`Genji spoke into Rosa's ear, and told her something in a small voice.`
`It seemed that Rosa couldn't understand what she was being told after only hearing it once,`
` and after repeating the words back to him several times, she finally realized that apparently, something strange had happened.`
`Rosa closed her door for a second, and after changing her clothes, she immediately accompanied Genji and they headed to the mansion...`
`The chapel requires some explanation.`
` It wasn't in the mansion, but in a grove behind the mansion, which could be reached after a short walk.`
`It had been built at the same time that the mansion had been constructed on Rokkenjima,`
` so while its outside walls had been repaired many times, making it look new from the outside, it was a very old building.`
`Rosa and Genji dashed through the rain together.`
`{n}Just like the previous night, the rain was falling in earnest.`
`Eventually, they began to see the chapel beyond a sparse grove...`
`If all she knew of it was its appearance from the outside, it might have felt like a place of dazzling beauty, where a pair of young lovers might want to hold a ceremony.`
`However, it seemed that in Kinzo's eyes, this was a very sacred place,`
` and Rosa and her siblings had been harshly told not to approach it unnecessarily.`
`So even at this age, and no matter what the reason for it, she felt some guilt in approaching the chapel,`
` and was gripped by the fear that this would surely make her father so angry he would slap her across the face...`
`The servants' silhouettes could be seen in front of the entrance to the chapel.`
`{n}Gohda, Shannon and Kanon.`
`......Which meant that all of the servants on the morning shift had gathered.`
`A short while ago, Rosa had been told the nature of the situation verbally by Genji.`
` However, ...without laying eyes on it directly, she really hadn't been able to understand...`
`Probably, all of the servants gathered there were the same.`
`......{i:Without seeing it with their own eyes}, they couldn't understand what was going on.`
`Because, on the door that was the entrance to the chapel,`
` ......drawn very large, ......with a creepy, sticky paint‐like substance that made one think of blood, ...was something like a creepy magic circle.`
`"Wh‐`
`.........what is...`
`...this............?`
` When was it drawn here?!"`
`The servants looked at each other.`
`{n}Gohda was the first to open his mouth.`
`"...My, ...my apologies.`
` We do not usually trespass here, so we do not know when it was drawn."`
`"Then, who was the first person to find it?!"`
`"Tha‐...that was me.`
` ......When I went to the dining hall to clean away the tea set, ......there was a memo with "chapel" written on it..."`
`Shannon held out the memo with a shaking hand.`
`"......Whose handwriting?`
` It isn't Nii‐san's or Nee‐san's handwriting.`
` ...And then you came here and found this, right?"`
`"Yes......"`
`"...Rosa‐sama, .........look at this."`
`"What?`
` ...............<Happy Halloween>...<for>...`
`......wha—?!"`
`Kanon was pointing at a single line of English written below the creepy magic circle.`
`Until it had been pointed out to her, she had thought it was just another part of the magic circle, and hadn't noticed it.`
`Written there in English were the words "Happy HALLOWEEN for MARIA.".`
`Happy Halloween...for Maria.`
`{n}A wish for an enjoyable Halloween.`
` For Maria.`
`{n}A creepy magic circle.`
` For Maria.`
`{n}Happy Halloween.`
`The only person who said the words Happy Halloween to Maria yesterday......`
`The symbols matched.`
` ......The Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}...!`
`"Wh‐what about Maria?!`
` That kid should be sleeping with her cousins, right?`
` Did you check?!"`
`"......My apologies.`
` We just now realized that Maria‐sama's name was written here.`
` ...We still have not checked.`
` I shall―"`
`"What are you doing?!!`
` I'll go check on Maria and come back!`
` Also, inform Krauss nii‐san and the rest.`
` Receive their instructions on how to proceed!"`
`...After saying that much, Rosa finally noticed that something was out of place.`
`Her own rank within this family conference was the lowest of the four siblings.`
`......In an abnormal situation like this, why had she been the only one called, when the other siblings hadn't?`
`...Even if Maria's name had popped up.`
`"Don't tell me......huh?`
` ......What...?!"`
`"......Ye‐yes.`
` We tried to contact Krauss‐sama,`
` ...but could not find him..."`
`"And Madam was not in her room.`
` ...Judging by the condition of the sheets, she may not have returned to her bed at all last night."`
`Rosa felt something creepy crawling slowly up her back...`
`".........Di‐...did you check inside the chapel?"`
`"No, not yet.`
` We did try to check inside, but..."`
`"......Actually, the lock to the chapel is special, so the master key does not work.`
` There is a single key which can open it, ......but that key is missing from the key box."`
`She didn't want to get any closer to the door with the creepy magic circle if she could help it.`
`Rosa readied herself and approached, and tried pushing and pulling the knob.`
` ...All she felt was the resistance of the sturdy lock.`
`"We searched to see whether there was a window through which we could enter, but...`
`I think that, in order to check inside, we would have to break one of the windows...`
` What do you think?"`
`"...There's no way I can give you approval to do that.`
` It's Father's precious chapel, I can't do something like that.`
` ....................."`
`Then the events of the previous day swirled around in the back of Rosa's mind...`
`......That's right,`
` ......when I met that witch in the rose garden,`
` ...didn't she hand Maria an envelope?`
` Yes, I'm positive, she did.`
`When Maria had tried to open it, that witch had told her not to do that yet, and then she had definitely said,`
` "{i:The time will come soon to open it}"...`
`Rosa became convinced.`
`{n}......There could be no doubt.`
`{n}......That letter which had been handed to Maria............`
`After dashing back to the guesthouse, Rosa approached the cousins' room while hiding her footsteps,`
` softly opened the door, and peered inside...`
`From the inside, she could hear the healthy snores of young people.`
`The four children were all there.`
` Maria was there.`
` ...Sleeping soundly.`
`After heaving a sigh of relief, she entered the room with quiet footsteps.`
`{n}......She was after Maria's handbag, which was resting on the sofa.`
`Maria always liked walking around with her treasures.`
`{n}...She was probably imitating how her mother always carried her makeup with her.`
`Of course, she was just copying her, so on the inside, it was full of junk.`
`In Maria's case, it was full of small, creepy, occult‐like items, and a notebook with things like that written in it.`
`......Rosa hadn't once been happy to see her daughter walking around with those kinds of ungirlish things.`
`However, after she had tried to force Maria to stop, they had gotten into a big fight, and she had decided to let it be.`
`"........................... ...Here it is.`
` .........This is it........."`
`A Western envelope with the crest of the gold eagle...`
`When she took it out, she could tell that there was a heavy, cylindrical object inside.`
`...She could tell by its feel and its weight.`
`{n}......There was no doubt.`
`{n}This was......a key.`
`After turning around and checking that Maria was still sound asleep,`
` Rosa tore open the envelope, and tipped out the contents into her palm.`
`......It was a key with an old and intricate design...`
`{n}Rosa grasped that key, and dashed out.`
`...It seemed that Battler noticed those sounds, but after grumbling and turning over in his sleep, he started snoring again...`
`"......Genji‐san.`
` ......Could this key......be the key to the chapel?"`
`"Where did you......`
` ...Yes, this is the key to the chapel."`
`Rosa approached the creepy magic circle once again, ......and put the key in the keyhole.`
`......There was a strong resistance.`
` After it resisted for a short while, ...it stopped that resistance with a clunk.`
`Then, squeaking with a noise that hurt one's ears, it slowly, slowly began to open.........`
`"...............Is anyone......there............?!"`
`Her voice reverberated throughout the massive room.`
`{n}...Of course, there was no answer.`
`The chapel had a high ceiling, and the air was cold.`
`...And even on this rainy, unsettling day, for some reason, it felt sacred...`
`The servants timidly followed after Rosa.`
`"......Rosa‐sama, look at that."`
`Kanon noticed it immediately, and pointed.`
`......Over there...was the altar.`
`In the place where normally a pastor would preach of God's love, there was a table that shouldn't have been there.`
`At first, it looked like a dining table.`
` ...And there actually were gorgeous plates and utensils set on the table, enough to make you think it was a child's birthday party or something.`
`Upon closer inspection, the surrounding area had been decorated with pumpkins and black and orange ribbons.`
` They were probably......Halloween decorations.`
`And there were people seated at the table.`
`{n}Three people on each side facing each other, seated in chairs.`
`They could be recognized at a glance.`
`{n}Krauss and his wife, Eva and her husband, and Rudolf and his wife.`
`But if you were asked if these were definitely them, you'd still have to go even closer to check.`
`......Because they seemed almost like dolls.`
`Rosa and the rest had opened the door, entered all at once with the sound of many footsteps, and called out, asking if anyone was there.`
`...And yet, there had been no reaction.`
` ...Even assuming they had chosen to ignore them, normally you'd expect there to be some kind of reaction.`
`......And there hadn't even been that.`
`So at first, it felt like someone had set down some dolls that looked a lot like them...`
`......By now, it wasn't just Rosa.`
`{n}......Shannon and Kanon, and even Gohda.`
`...They were all fighting frantically against the rising creepy emotion tightly grasping their hearts.`
`"......Nii‐san...?`
` .........Nee‐san.........?"`
`As she climbed up to the altar, she called out again, but still, the others gave no reaction.`
`......Yes, ...by now, Rosa had accepted it.`
`......They were not dolls—`
`{n}{i:she had accepted that they were those very people}......!`
`"............This is........."`
`".................."`
`They approached close enough to be able to see clearly what was on the table.`
`Just like their first impression, it looked like a lovely banquet, reminiscent of a child's birthday party.`
`Plates piled up with sweets, glasses with lovely drinks.`
`{n}Several ornaments in the shape of pumpkins...`
`...They were all decorated in a Halloween style, ...and while it might have been an irrelevant thought at a time like this, ...she thought that this would surely make Maria happy if she could see it.`
`They were seated in front of that table, and it looked like they were sleeping......`
`It was an eerie scene, ...as though a small, fun‐looking Halloween party had been stopped in time...`
`"......They're all......`
`......sleeping...?`
` ............?"`
`When she approached even closer to them, ......she realized that candies were scattered all over the floor.`
`There were candies in very fancy wrapping, cookies, fizzy lemon sweets, chocolates...`
`And they were all distributed across the carpet, which was covered with blackberry and cranberry jam...`
`"......Wa...uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa?!"`
`Rosa and the rest.........finally realized what the situation was......`
`It was...a Halloween party.`
`{n}A banquet for those not of this world...!`
`Krauss, Natsuhi, Eva, Hideyoshi, Rudolf, and Kyrie, six people in all, were seated in the chairs, ......dead as though they were sleeping.`
`How could you tell that they were dead and not simply sleeping?`
`That was because...`
`......they were,`
` ......from their chests to their stomachs,`
` .........v‐`
`...vertically...`
`......sliced open.........!`
`"K‐......Krauss‐sama............!!`
` HiiiIIIiiiiiiiii......!"`
`".....................How......cruel..."`
`The six of them were seated at a Halloween party, all of them...killed, with their stomachs sliced open.`
`Was the jam that covered the floor something that they couldn't finish eating...which had overflowed out of their stomachs...?`
`......No!!`
`The contents of their stomachs had been splattered all across the floor!!`
`{n}And that wasn't all.`
`From their stomachs, ......almost as though, ......almost as though!`
`{n}As though they had spilled out!!`
` Swee‐...sweets!`
`Candies and cookies, fizzy lemon sweets and chocolates...`
`......had spilled out, stained with blood, and had scattered across the floor!!`
`What could have happened to cause this?!`
`It was almost as though the insides of their stomachs had been stuffed full with sweets,`
` ......and when their stomachs had been cut, it had all flowed out!!`
`Rosa remembered a gross‐out meal, a turkey that had been served at her own birthday when she was a young girl.`
`When she had put the knife in, ......from the inside, her very favorite—but because no one had told her about it at all—`
`bright‐red—bright‐red—ketchup omelet‐rice had...poured out like blood‐stained maggots,`
` buwaa,`
` dripping,`
` slimy,`
` pulpy,`
` sticky!!`
`"Uerreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeechgh!!`
` Eeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"`
`The trauma of her youth was revived.`
` Rosa felt a monster raging inside her stomach, as the acid started to rise up.`
`...Unable to hold back, she threw up on the floor.`
`Her empty stomach couldn't throw up anything but stomach acid.`
`This scene in front of her was no longer a fun Halloween party by any means...!`
`The three couples had been placed there, with their stomachs vertically wrenched open,`
` wrenched open with a gyuiiiiiiigupaaa.`
`Lots and lots of sweets had been stuffed in there, pulpy,`
` pugyurubugyu.`
`Blood and guts and sweets were overflowing onto the floor,`
` ......blood‐stained,`
` sticky,`
` sticky,`
` sloppy,`
` pulpy,`
` sweet candy stuck to each finger,`
` gummy,`
` gummy,`
` aaah, but it's stained with their entrails,`
` sloppy,`
` pulpy!`
` What was that I stepped on just now, that didn't feel like a candy or a cookie or a fizzy lemon sweet or a chocolate!`
`Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah, I'm so scared I can't even look at the bottom of my foot to see what I stepped on!!`
`Aaaaaawaaaakiiiyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!`
`...What a, what a gruesome Halloween party...!!!`
`From far away, it looked really beautiful, fantastical, and fun.`
`{n}And when you see it up close, it's really terrible, disgusting, and yet still somehow beautiful...!!`
`"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!"`
`Rosa's wild thoughts tried as best they could to escape her throat with a loud voice that was neither a scream nor a roar...`
`"...............Krauss‐sama............"`
`"......This is...horrible...... Just horrible........."`
`"......A‐ambulance...`
` ......Police.........!"`
`"Tha‐......that's right, the police...`
` Police, police police police police!!"`
`If a word tied to reality like "police" hadn't come out of Gohda's mouth, Rosa and the rest would probably still have been unable to escape this nightmarish party.`
`...But that wasn't because they thought that the police might be able to do something.`
`If they didn't say police, police out loud, ......it felt like another seat would be set up at this demon's party and given to them...!!`
`It felt like their own stomachs were getting uncomfortably filled from the inside!!`
` Rumbling,`
` churning...`
` It was surely because candy was starting to overflow from their stomachs!!`
`Rosa was again tortured by a desire to vomit, and threw up her stomach acid on the floor.`
` And then she searched.`
` To see whether there was any candy mixed in!!`
`"......Haah, .........haah, ......haah......!!`
` *wheeze*, ......haah...`
` ......A‐......anyway!!`
` *cough*, *cough*!!"`
`Rosa coughed violently again, and violently spat up the stomach acid that burned her throat onto the floor.`
`She realized that by now, her whole body had become covered in filthy sweat...`
`"Ge‐...Genji‐san, Shannon‐chan, please ask Father for instructions.`
` Gohda‐san, go together with Kanon‐kun and call the police.`
` ...Then, have Doctor Nanjo come here and..."`
`Have Nanjo come here and {i:what}?`
`{n}It's way too late for medical care......!`
`The servants accepted their orders and dashed outside.`
`After watching them leave, ...............Rosa once again fixedly cast her eyes upon her siblings, who had been through life's joys and sorrows with her, and their partners.`
` ......Even though there could be nothing more tragic, ...for some reason, their fantastical deaths tempted her...`
`to describe them as beautiful.........`
`"...They're not here.`
` Where'd they go?"`
`"The servant room and the kitchen are both empty, too.`
` ...What the hell happened?"`
`"Uu‐uu‐uu!!`
` Mamaaa!!`
` Mamaaa, where are youuu?!!`
` My letter!`
` My letter I got from Beato!`
` Give it back!`
` Give it baaaack!!`
` Wau‐aau‐auu!!"`
`"Perplexing.`
` ...Battler‐kun, are you sure it was Auntie Rosa?"`
`"......Well, I was half‐asleep so I'm not too confident.`
` But I get the feeling that, at dawn, Auntie Rosa came in and fished around in Maria's handbag."`
`"...I was just half‐asleep, and assumed that there was a tube of toothpaste or something in Maria's handbag."`
`"Why would there be a tube of toothpaste in Maria's handbag?`
` I'd bet my ass you dreamed the whole thing."`
`Battler vaguely remembered Rosa entering the cousins' room.`
` And Maria, who had woken up first, had started rampaging around, saying that someone had opened the envelope that she had been keeping safe.`
`...And so they had started wondering whether Rosa might have come and opened it.`
`"......A letter from the Golden Witch...`
` I wonder what was inside."`
`"Who knows.`
` ...But that envelope was one with the Ushiromiya family crest on it, for Grandfather's personal use.`
` ............It's hard to believe that what was in there doesn't have anything to do with the family conference."`
`She hadn't let anyone touch it, but yesterday, Maria had bragged a lot about the envelope to Battler and the rest.`
` ...So they remembered it well.`
`"Uu‐uu‐uu!!`
` Mama, give it back!`
` Mama, give it back!!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!`
` Waauuuuuuuuuuuuu!!"`
`"......If you're right, George‐aniki, it sounds pretty important.`
` ...But if it was so important, why did the witch give it to Maria?`
` ...I don't have a clue."`
`The refreshing morning atmosphere had been completely wiped out by the occasional sounds of thunder.`
`...It was only natural.`
` Since the time they had woken up, they hadn't met anyone other than themselves.`
`It felt like the mansion had become an empty husk, leaving only them behind.`
`"......Heeeeey!`
` Anyone theeeere?!`
` Answer mee!"`
`After Jessica called out into the hallway, an answer finally came back.`
` It was from the entrance hall.`
`"I can hear youu.`
` ...Has something happened?"`
`"It's Doctor Nanjo.`
` ...Great.`
` It looks like everyone hasn't disappeared from this island but us."`
`"Doctor Nanjo, good morning.`
` ...Umm, sorry, but do you know where our parents went...?"`
`"Dear me.`
` ...I have only just come here after waking up, you see.`
` I have no idea, I'm afraid."`
`It was only natural.`
` Nanjo was a guest like the rest of them.`
` He had just now come to pass the time in the parlor until breakfast.`
`"Uu‐uu‐uu!!`
` Doctor Nanjo, Mama took it, Mama took my letter!!`
` Give it back, give it back, uu‐uu‐uu!!!"`
`Maria buried her face in Nanjo's well‐built stomach, sobbing and crying.`
`...Nanjo could do nothing but be bewildered at what was going on so early in the morning.`
`".........nn.`
` Someone's running this way.`
` Jessica!`
` Someone's coming!"`
`From down the hall, they could sense people running hurriedly.`
`When they looked, they saw that it was Gohda and Kanon.`
`......Running inside the mansion should have been immodest for a servant.`
`{n}And yet, Battler and the rest didn't even think to question that now.`
`Maria's sobbing had become so unmanageable, they wanted to ask someone, anyone, where Rosa was.`
`But the two servants ignored Jessica as she waved her hand.`
`Gohda flew into the servant room, and Kanon, noticing that Nanjo was here, bowed and approached him at a quick pace, and whispered something into his ear.`
`"...............What did you say?`
` Rosa‐san is?"`
`"Yes.`
` I will guide you, so please accompany me."`
`"Alright..."`
`"This way."`
`Without saying anything more than that, Kanon finally noticed Jessica and bowed to her.`
`...But he wasn't calm.`
`He dashed back down the corridor by which he had come, followed by Nanjo.`
`By looking at how hurried they were, Battler and the rest realized that something bad really had happened.`
`They saw Gohda through the door to the servant room, which had been flung open.`
`...He had the telephone receiver in hand and was violently pressing the hook.`
`From that, they realized that he was trying to call a hospital, or the police, or in any event he was trying to call someone because a serious emergency had occurred.`
`"Let's go see what's going on...!"`
`"Yeah...!"`
`"Mamaaa, give it baaack!!`
` Give back my letterrr!!`
` It's {i:an invitation to the Golden Land}!!"`
`They didn't know what, ...but something was happening.`
`{n}Battler and the rest chased after Kanon and Nanjo...`
`Aaah......and then we realized.`
` Kanon‐kun had called Doctor Nanjo, but he hadn't called us.`
`...So we should never have followed.`
`I wonder if Alice didn't regret her excess curiosity when she chased after the rabbit holding a clock......`
`"No, you mustn't come in!!`
` You mustn't look!!`
` Jessica‐chan!`
` No!!"`
`"Hii...`
`......n...`
`noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!"`
`"Mom, Dad!!`
` What, ......what happened!!`
` Uuuuuuuuuuuughhh!!"`
`"......What the hell is this...`
` ......There's a limit to how degenerate you can be...`
` Isn't taking someone's life enough...`
` ......What the hell is this!!"`
`"After you'd killed them you actually bothered to sit them on chairs, slice their stomachs!!`
` And stuff a ton of sweets inside?!!`
` Why, ......why the fuck would you do something so sick?!!`
` Fuck this, fuck this!`
` Great work, shithead, looks awesome, looks fucking awesome!!`
` Uwoooooooooooooohhh!!"`
`".........It would be better if you all went outside...!`
` There is no way they would want you all to see them this way..."`
`Nanjo told the children to go outside, but no one lent him an ear.`
`"Rosa‐san, please tell them.`
` If they keep looking at something like this...it will do nothing but harm...!"`
`".................."`
`Rosa regretted her own carelessness.`
` ......She should have been able to anticipate that the children would eventually come here.`
`...She should have quickly locked it instead of standing around.`
`So now the children had come.`
`{n}They had seen it...!`
`Surely, in this very moment, they were having a sight burned into their eyes...`
`which was far more grotesque than the gross‐out food Rosa had seen in her youth...`
`While she hugged Maria, who seemed to have forgotten her emotions as she stared dumbfounded at the horrible scene,`
` Rosa shed copious tears for them and their parents.`
`The four groaning and crying voices, their sadness, ...continued to echo in a place which should have known God's love......`
`"You piece of shit!!`
` Again, another one of these murders!!`
` And yet again, you made it all elaborate, killing them like it's a perfect joke!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*.`
` I was hoping I'd hear words of gratitude rather than grief from you."`
`"Gratitude?!!`
` Did you say gratitude, you old bitch?!`
` Damn it, if there's something wrong with your ears, I'll cut them both off so you can hear better!!"`
`"Why should I have to say oh, thank you very much {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama~, about this supremely fucked‐up way of killing?! I'll beat you to death!!!"`
`"In the last game,`
` you were grieving that you couldn't see your parents' faces when they died, I believe?`
` So I left them.`
` Didn't touch them!!"`
`"{i:Take a good long look and see, that without a doubt, your father and the others have been killed}!!"`
`"R......eally, wow, you deserve full marks for top service, I'm so happy!!`
` I swore that if I choked the life out of you, I'd plow your face, but I'll take that back, I'll drag out your guts!!!"`
`"Don't give in to emotion and stop thinking.`
` My game has already begun, you know?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*.`
` I decided to leave the corpses clean this time."`
`"Do you know why?`
` When you denied my existence in the last game, you denied me by thinking in the following way."`
`"That is:`
` "{i:Their faces are crushed, so the identities of the corpses cannot be confirmed}";`
` "{i:therefore, the possibility that fake corpses had been prepared to create an alibi cannot be eliminated}";`
` "{i:as long as that possibility cannot be excluded, the human culprit theory can be maintained}"!!"`
`"What did you saaaaaay......?!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*kikiki{0}ki{0}ki{0}ki{0}ki{0}ki{0}ki{0}ki{0}ki{0}ki{0}ki{0}ki{0}ki{0}ki{0}ki{0}kikiki!!`
` Come, Battler, are you sure you wish to leave the examination of the corpses to Nanjo?`
` Isn't it traditional in mystery novels for the doctor who performs such examinations to be an accomplice?"`
`"Then don't leave the examination to Nanjo; do it yourself.`
` Make completely sure that without a doubt, the six corpses are the people claimed, that they aren't pretending to be dead, that they really, really are dead!!"`
`"To make sure that your father and mother really have been killed by having their stomachs cut open and their entrails pulled out,`
` I suggest you stick your hand inside their stomachs and feel around inside!!!`
` Kuhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha, kiiihaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"`
`"I WON'T cry!!!`
` Damn it, damn it, ...I won't cry...!!"`
`Battler suddenly yelled.`
`His tears were still dripping down, but as though scolding himself for being girly, he slapped his face hard several times with both hands.`
`Even so, the tears still wouldn't stop.`
`{n}......However, he felt a hot blaze ignite in both his eyes.`
`"Whoever the bastard is who pulled this detestable bullshit, I'll make him pay back his debt completely!!`
` So this isn't the time to cry, think about what you're gonna do!!"`
`"Aaaah, this is no good, it's no goddamn good at all!!`
` If you have enough spare time to cry, then think!`
` This is not the time to be working your lacrimal glands!!"`
`Rather than pure hatred, maybe it was more of an evasive hatred to blot out his sadness.`
`......However, it gave a little courage to George and Jessica, who were being crushed by sadness.`
`"......That's right.`
` ...Even if we cry,`
` ......the reality of what's happened here...`
`won't change."`
`"Damn it... Damn it damn it damn it, ......damn it damn it damn it!!`
` What am I supposed to do then?!`
` What am I supposed to do...for Mom and Dad?!!"`
`"......Rosa‐sama...`
` I have returned..."`
`"Gohda‐san, what happened with the police?`
` What did they say to do?`
` Did they say when they think they'll be able to get here?"`
`"...Regarding that, ......it seems the telephones are out of order...`
` I also tried the emergency wireless, but...umm, perhaps it's the weather, but that isn't working either..."`
`"What did you say...?!`
` So, you're saying we can't contact the police?!"`
`"It's her!`
` She did something to the phone line, and made it so we can't contact the police!!"`
`When she heard that the telephones were out of order, Jessica immediately decided that it was the work of that mysterious guest.`
`Her eyes were bright‐red after so much crying, and they began to grow even more red with rage.`
`"...Yeah, there's not even any room for debate anymore!`
` I understand everything, I know the truth!`
` Who killed Mom and Dad?!"`
`"It's obvious, it's her!!`
` It has to be that witch or whatever who came yesterday!!!`
` I'll grab her by the collar!!`
` Damn it damn it damn iiiiiiiiiiiit!!"`
`"Jessica‐chan...!`
` Wait!`
` Gohda‐san, Kanon‐kun, go!"`
`"Ye‐yes...!"`
`"Milady, wait...!!"`
`Covering her unfocused sadness with anger, Jessica ran outside, torn apart by emotion.`
`...Thinking about it hastily, maybe the mystery guest, {f:5:Beatrice}, who had arrived yesterday, was suspicious.`
` However, at the current time, there was absolutely no proof that she was the culprit.`
`...At this moment, she was nothing more than a simple guest, and only one of many.`
`So Rosa had to make an adult decision, and stop Jessica in her hasty rampage.`
` Gohda and Kanon realized that immediately, and chased after her.`
`"......Could {f:5:Beatrice}, the guest that no one invited, be the culprit...?"`
`"I understand how Jessica feels.`
` ...I also want to make myself think that.`
` It doesn't matter who, I want to make someone the culprit and bash them right in the face!!"`
`"......But before that, we have to understand things clearly.`
` ...Who is this {f:5:Beatrice}?`
` I haven't even seen her face!!"`
`"......Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi.`
` If you're looking for her face, it decorates the big portrait in the mansion.`
` You still don't remember after looking at it for so long?`
` Kihihihihihi."`
`"...Come on, Maria.`
` ...What's so funny in a situation like this?!"`
`"{f:5:Beatrice} is a witch.`
` And the ritual to open the door to the Golden Land has finally begun.`
` These six people are sacrifices.`
` ......Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi!"`
`"Now, the witch's banquet shall begin.`
` Tonight is Halloween; the witches gather now in celebration.`
` Kiiihi‐hi‐hi‐hi‐hihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi!!"`
`"Maria, how many times have I told you to stop laughing in that creepy voice!"`
`The crisp sound of Rosa slapping Maria's cheek echoed through the high‐ceilinged chapel...`
`It kinda feels like, ever since the rain started yesterday—`
`no, ...ever since the island had become wrapped up in the typhoon, something has gone crazy.`
`I had arrived in Rokkenjima while it was clear, and taken a nap because I had gotten up early.`
`......When I woke up, it had already started raining.`
`And after I got up, that's when it all started.`
`Suddenly a mysterious visitor had arrived, calling herself the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}, and it feels like the world had started skewing bit by bit into something insane.`
`What happened while I was taking that nap?`
` During that time, had this island been cut off, trapped in a different world where common sense doesn't apply...?!`
`Who is this person called {f:5:Beatrice}?`
`{n}Is she some unknown person trying to involve themselves with the inheritance problem, like our parents were freaking out about at dinner last night?`
`......Or is the culprit the witch from the Legend of the Gold, like Maria says?!`
`Even if Jessica hadn't let her short temper get the better of her, in this situation, the visitor was probably the most suspicious.`
`But we mustn't jump to conclusions just like that.`
`{n}Yeah, that's no good, no good, no goddamn good at all...!!`
`I smacked my face with both hands again, cooling off my brain before it overheated.`
` Even though it might have been a waste of effort.`
`"......This is.........one of Grandfather's envelopes."`
`On a tray piled up with sweets that decorated the table, George‐aniki found a Western envelope which had the Ushiromiya family crest done on it in gold leaf.`
`And it was unopened.`
`"So, ......doesn't this mean it was sent to us?`
` If it was something Dad and the rest read, it should be open."`
`"......It seems your reasoning is correct.`
` ......Look what's written here.`
` It says "to those who remain"."`
`"Is that...a letter the culprit left...?!`
` Wha‐what's inside...?"`
`"Aniki, let's open it...!"`
`After nodding silently, George‐aniki opened it.`
`{n}......A folded letter came out.`
`".........I'll read it.`
` .........Welcome to Rokkenjima, ladies and gentlemen of the Ushiromiya family.`
` I am {f:5:Beatrice}, the alchemist for this family, under the employ of Kinzo‐sama..."`
`That letter really was a joke.`
`This {f:5:Beatrice}, who called herself the family alchemist, had announced that she was collecting the gold she had lent Grandfather, along with the interest.`
`And that interest was everything that Grandfather had created.`
`Since this tragedy was right before our eyes as this paragraph was read aloud, it clearly wasn't referring just to the wealth that Grandfather had built up.`
`......It was literal.`
` Everything that Grandfather had given birth to—`
`in other words, ...all of Grandfather's descendants, were included in the interest!`
`"Batshit insanity!!`
` What a screwed up contract!`
` So lives are the interest for gold, are they?!`
` That's like a deal with the devil!`
` Is that how you pretend to be a witch?!`
` Ha, real goddamn funny!!"`
`"......Special clause.`
` .........However, if someone is able to discover the hidden gold of this contract, {f:5:Beatrice} must abandon these rights for all time."`
`".........Mmhm......`
` ......Kinzo‐sama has already publicly displayed the location of the hidden gold within the epitaph under my portrait..."`
`"......So it's something like this.`
` If the motive for these murders was collection of the interest,`
` the condition for stopping them is to find the hidden gold she gave to Grandfather, ...is what it's saying.`
` And it also says that the secret to this is hidden in the epitaph from that portrait."`
`"So......this is a letter of challenge from the witch?`
` Break the ciphertext describing the location of the hidden gold, if you can?!`
` And it's saying that if we can't, the collection of the interest will continue as planned?"`
`"I'll beat you to death, no problem!!!"`
`"...Ba‐Battler‐kun!`
` Look...... Look here!!!"`
`The table had been full of sweets,`
` ...so even though they had been right in the open, we had assumed they were just sweets.`
`......I mean, come on, you find stuff like this a lot, right?`
`......You know, boxes of chocolate, shaped like golden ingots...!`
`"The‐......these are...not boxes of candy...`
` They're the real thing...!`
` ......These are real goddamned gold bars...!!"`
`"...It's inscribed with the crest of the One‐winged Eagle...`
` ...I've heard Mother talking about this before.`
` ......This is a gold bar from the legend of Grandfather's gold...!!"`
`Gold ingots, ...three of them, weighing a full ten kilograms each, were piled up in the very center of the table!`
` It was where the cake would be placed if it was a birthday party.`
`...In other words, this was without a doubt the birthday cake of the party known as the family conference!`
`"If these are really four‐nines‐purity ingots...`
` ...nn, *gulp*.`
` They, they're worth about 60 million yen!"`
`"You stupid biiiiiitch!!`
` That's way too cheap!!!`
` Six of our parents have been killed, and the gold you throw our way for it is a measly 60 million yen?!`
` Don't take us for fools, damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit!!!"`
`"......Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi.`
` ...So, it has begun, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` ......It's not like anyone can solve this riddle anyway.`
` So, Beato, you will definitely win."`
`"......Hurry up and open the door to the Golden Land.`
` And take me away.`
` ...Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi!"``"Milady, please, calm yourself...!"`
`"We still don't know who the culprit is!`
` And {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama is an important honored guest to the Master...!"`
`"So what?!!`
` If we grab her by the collar, she'll definitely confess!!`
` If we can look her in the eye, we'll know!!`
` I'll see through her!!`
` A witch?! {f:5:Beatrice}?!!`
` I'll expose her for who she is!!"`
`Jessica never stopped moving.`
`{n}Gohda and Kanon chased after her, doing their best to convince her, but Jessica never lent them an ear.`
`Eventually, the "Witch's VIP Room" came into view.`
`{n}This VIP room was always sealed and never used.`
`...No matter what kind of guest came, Kinzo wouldn't let them in this room.`
`......And yet, the servants were always made to clean this room, so that it could be used at any time.`
`So the servants had started calling this room the "Witch's VIP Room", after their other shapeless master.`
`Jessica also knew this.`
` And she couldn't stand that woman's arrogance in calling herself a witch, by staying in that room.`
`......The Golden Witch was just a fairy tale.`
` Come on, a witch?!`
` To Jessica, she was nothing more or less than the murderer who had brutally killed her parents!`
`Question her, make her give painful excuses, make her spit at the ground painfully, make her breathe painfully.`
`...No matter how hard she pretends to be a witch, I'll teach her that she's just a stinking, sweaty {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}!!`
`Jessica hit the door to the VIP room while yelling with all of her strength.`
`It definitely wasn't a knock.`
` ...That sound was the beating of her anger's hammer, whose message was clear: if the woman didn't open the door, she'd break it down.`
`"Open it, {f:5:Beatrice}!!`
` Come out!!`
` You hear me, right?!`
` Open up!!!"`
`There was no answer.`
` ...Jessica twisted the doorknob without any reservation, but she felt the resistance of the lock.`
`Jessica turned to the two servants, and spat out at them demandingly.`
`"The master key opens this, right?!`
` Open it!!"`
`"Milady...!`
` That would be horribly rude...!!"`
`Although Gohda was flustered, he still tried to somehow calm Jessica's anger.`
`......After hanging his head silently for a while, Kanon pulled a master key from his jacket pocket.`
`"Kanon‐san...!`
` Is that alright?!"`
`"......I am aware that this will be rude if she is there.`
` .........And in any case,`
` ...if {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama has nothing to do with this, she just has to explain herself so that we can believe her."`
`"Tha‐......that's right, exactly!!`
` Give it here!"`
`Jessica snatched the master key from Kanon's hand, and violently shoved it into the keyhole.`
`...Immediately, there was a light sound and she felt it unlock.`
`And without excusing herself, she flung open the door.`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}!!`
` Where are you?!`
` Show yourself!!"`
`Jessica rudely barged into the room.`
`{n}...The witch wasn't anywhere to be seen.`
`"...Bitch!!`
` She's not here!!`
` Where the hell did she go?!"`
`".........She, she doesn't appear to be here, does she..."`
`Jessica, thinking that she might be hiding somewhere inside the room, peeked behind the curtains and under the bed, but she couldn't find anyone.`
`However, there definitely were signs that the bed had been used,`
` ......and although it's an odd way to say it, the atmosphere in the room had grown a little softer.`
`It wasn't the hard atmosphere of a place normally devoid of people, like the chapel.`
`{n}You could definitely tell that someone had spent the night in this room.`
`But she could not be seen.`
`In reality, neither Jessica nor Gohda had met {f:5:Beatrice} yet.`
`...They had only been told by those who had met her that she was the spitting image of the person in the portrait.`
`...So they were doubtful about what her face really looked like.`
`...However, Kanon alone had met her.`
` And he understood what kind of being that witch was, ......and what kind of character she had.`
`So he knew that if they were to force their way in here searching for her, she wouldn't let things go as they planned.`
`......She must be watching us bitterly flail about in vain from somewhere, sneering at us.`
` ......She's that kind of person.`
`Because he was looking at things that way, Kanon was the first to find it.`
` ...The other two were concentrating on finding the shape of a person, so they hadn't noticed.`
`Near a water jug on the side table, there was a single sheet of writing paper.`
` It was accompanied by a short message and a fountain pen which had probably been used to write it...`
`Kanon understood the witch.`
` The witch would definitely ridicule them, as they found the six corpses, forced their way in here in rage, and were unable to find her.`
`......Ridicule has no meaning unless it is communicated.`
`{n}So in other words, ...this was definitely...that...!`
`"......Milady.`
` .........There's something written here."`
`"Written, what?!"`
`Jessica quickly dashed over and violently stole the piece of paper.`
`......She probably wasn't trying to be violent.`
`{n}...She just couldn't control her strength now.`
`".........What...?!`
` She's, she's {i:mocking} me?!!"`
`As soon as she read the message, Jessica went into a wild rage, crumpled the paper up, and threw it.`
`Then, she grabbed a table lamp that was by the side of the bed and violently swung it around, mercilessly hitting the walls and furniture with it.`
`...The lightbulb shattered at once, and scattered its shards across the room.`
`"Milady, please calm yourself...!`
` You'll hurt yourself!!"`
`"Let go!!`
` Damn it, damn it!`
` Show yourself, {f:5:Beatrice}!!`
` How could you do that to Mom and Dad!!`
` Are you that damn scared of me?!`
` I'll kill you, I'll kill you!!`
` Come out so I can beat you to death!!!`
` I told you to let go of me, damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit!!"`
`This was written on the paper...`
`{e:070:―Did you think I'd waste my time waiting comfortably in this place for you to barge in here?`
` You're too wild to be suitable for this intellectual night.`
` What kind of faces must your parents have had after raising you to be such a hapless fool?`
` Yeah, I saw them, they had perfectly stupid faces just like you.`
` Now they are in Candyland with their bellies all full!}`
`......It sounded like something that witch would write...`
` ......It meant that she had predicted that one of the children who had lost their parents would come running in here.`
`...If she was hiding somewhere in this room, she would surely be rolling around with laughter...`
`The witch was that kind of person.`
`{n}...She sneered at people's misfortune, using it to stave off the boredom of a thousand years...!`
`"Hand it over...!`
` I am telling you that you will hurt yourself...!`
` .........nnnnn, ......nnnn!!"`
`"I said let go!!`
` Damn iiiiiit, damn iiiiiiit!!`
` ......au!"`
`Gohda grabbed the table lamp Jessica had been swinging around and took it from her.`
`...Because if she kept swinging it around, she might hit something and get injured.`
`...To Gohda's eyes, Jessica probably looked mad with rage, burning with the flames of anger.`
`......But Kanon's eyes saw it differently.`
`Those were probably...tears of sadness...hidden by rage...`
`Therefore.`
`When, at the moment the table lamp was taken from her,`
` Jessica dropped to the floor almost as if groveling, and started crying and scratching at the carpet...`
`......Gohda was surprised, but Kanon was not.`
`......Her way of crying by brandishing her anger had been stolen from her, ...so this was inevitable.`
`"Uuuuuuuuuuughhh, waaaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaaa!!`
` Mom......Dad......uwaaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}auuu{0}u{0}u{0}uuuu!!"`
`...Considering that she was a daughter of the Ushiromiya main family, ...she was in a very shabby state.`
`......She scratched at the carpet with her fingernails, and even her feet writhed and scratched at it.`
`Jessica cried very, very hard.`
` ...Because if she didn't, her rage would start building up again, and swallow her up.`
`But over and over again, she remembered that letter's humiliating message...`
` ......What kind of faces must your parents have had after raising you to be such a hapless fool?`
`"They aren't stupid!!`
` Both Mom and Dad were smart!!`
` They weren't like me, they were really smart!!`
` They aren't stupid!`
` Take it back,`
` take it back!!"`
`Yeah, I saw them, they had perfectly stupid faces just like you.`
`{n}Now they are in Candyland with their bellies all full!!`
`"Ooooooooooooooohhh, damn iiiiiit!!`
` I'll kill her I'll kill her, I'll slice her stomach and make her meet the same end!!`
` Uuuuaaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaaa, waaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaaa......!!!`
` Hic, *cough*cough*, *cough*cough*cough*!!!"`
`As Jessica cried and screamed, she triggered an asthma attack...`
` The servants watching over her ran up to her hurriedly and rubbed her back, but that only provoked Jessica's wrath...`
`"*cough*cough*!!`
` 'the hell!!`
` If you have the time to do that, search for that bitch!!`
` Find her and bring her to me!!"`
`"If you won't go, then I will!!`
` And I'll kill her with my own hands, I'll slice her stomach!!"`
`"*cough*cough*cough*cough*!!`
` *cough*, *cough*!!`
` Don't touch me!!!`
` Fucker...fucker, *cough*cough*!!`
` *cough*cough*!!"`
`Jessica got up unsteadily, and as her asthma continued, she went out into the hallway...`
`"Milady, your medicine, quickly...!`
` I will call Doctor Nanjo!"`
`"...............Gohda‐san.`
` .........Would you...leave this to me?"`
`Kanon had noticed.`
` .........Gohda, who was much older, ...probably couldn't feel the tears in Jessica's heart.`
`......Kanon, who had noticed that himself, had to support her.`
`"K‐Kanon‐san.`
` ............Is that alright...?"`
`".........I believe that Milady needs some time to cry for now.`
` ............After seeing her parents, when they were killed like that..."`
`".................................`
` ...You're right."`
`Gohda also understood.`
` ......And he also knew of the modest relationship that Jessica and Kanon shared.`
`So he understood everything, and left it to Kanon.`
`".........I understand.`
` ......I will go back to Rosa‐sama.`
` ...Please, take care of Milady."`
`"Yes.`
` ......Leave it to me."`
`Kanon's voice was frail, ......but he nodded forcefully.`
`{n}After looking at his eyes, Gohda also nodded forcefully.`
`...Gohda was a veteran with many years behind him.`
` He had seen a great number of people in his life.`
` ...So he knew of the vigorous sparkle that could be found in the eyes of those who had self‐control.`
`He had seen that clearly in Kanon's eyes.`
`{n}......Therefore, he would leave this to Kanon.`
`...Thinking about it, this may have been the first moment that Gohda had trusted Kanon and relied on him for a job...`
`It seemed Jessica was heading towards her room, ...leaning against the wall as she suffered from her asthma.`
`......Kanon followed after her wordlessly.`
`If she had asked for a hand, he would have jumped over and supported her.`
` ...But as long as Jessica didn't ask for that, he hid himself, watching over her from a distance where he could come to her rescue at any time.`
`......As Kanon remained in that spot where ten billion people would hope for someone else to be when their hearts felt like they would explode from sadness,`
` he silently watched Jessica's back...`
`Then, finally, she was crouching in front of the door to her own room.`
`......The asthma attack had stolen all of her strength.`
` And her thoughts had gotten hazy from the lack of oxygen, so that she could no longer stand up.`
`......But right now, Jessica wasn't thinking that she wanted someone to lend a hand.`
` Because she still hadn't been able to overcome the flames of anger.`
`...Because even if someone had offered her a hand with good intentions, right now, Jessica would start wanting to grab it and lacerate it.`
`...And she understood how unreasonable that would be.`
` ...Until she could overcome the flames of her anger, she definitely wouldn't ask for help.`
`Probably, Jessica no longer even had the willpower to call for help.`
`......But Kanon heard it.`
` ...He definitely heard it.`
`......Kanon definitely heard that voiceless call for help, which is shared by those from across the world who are grieving, and which, though they scream and scream, cannot be heard by anyone.`
`Kanon softly knelt by Jessica's side, and wordlessly offered her a shoulder.`
`......Even as Jessica kept coughing painfully, she accepted it,`
` .........unlocked her room, and entered...`
`"............This way.`
` ...............I'll prepare your medicine right away."`
`"..................*cough*cough*cough*...!`
` .........*co.........*cough*cough*cough*...!!"`
`Jessica had often said that when she let her asthma run its course, it hurt so badly that it felt like she would vomit her whole stomach.`
`Her face was pale, and her gaze wavered.`
`{n}And yet, the coughing continued...`
`......Even so, ...her sadness was probably even stronger...`
`After having her sit on the bed, Kanon took an inhaler from a cute basket on a side table by the bed, and handed it to her.`
`......Jessica sometimes forgot to walk around with her medicine.`
`When it seemed that this was the case, Kanon would take notice and secretly carry around the inhaler from the first‐aid kit in the servant room, but he hadn't done so today.`
`......He scolded himself, as though wondering how, after failing to bring it with him on a day like this, he could call himself furniture.`
`.........Then he remembered the day when he had spoken that word, and somehow betrayed Jessica's feelings, ...which jarred Kanon's heart,`
` ......but compared to Jessica's current sadness, he thought of that as a far more shameless emotion, and he suppressed it to the depths of his heart...`
`".........haah.........haah...`
` .....................haah..."`
`When she inhaled her medicine, Jessica's wild breathing calmed down bit by bit, ...and she was finally able to regain her composure.`
`.........But the strength and willpower she had lost wouldn't allow her to rise up from the bed.`
`".....................Are you alright?`
` ......Milady."`
`"............I'm...`
`......alright...`
` .........I'm all messed up over Mom and Dad,`
` .........but,`
` ......after I cry a little longer,`
` .........I'll be alright............"`
`"........................"`
`Kanon regretted misspeaking.`
`......He had said "Are you alright", to her?`
`{n}...Was he really unable to notice the pain in her heart?`
`............This was why he was, ultimately, mere furniture.`
`{n}This was why he couldn't become human...`
`"..................I will be in the corridor.`
` ...If you need anything, please call me immediately."`
`Kanon understood that she still needed some time to cry alone.`
`He told her to call him at any time, bowed, and made to leave the room.`
`"......ah, ..............."`
`"......Is there something?"`
`Jessica had spoken as though she wanted him to stop, so Kanon had stopped.`
`.........If she asks it, I'll do anything to help her.`
`...If it could heal the pain in her heart, right now, I would even become a cane or a chair.`
`.........If by doing that, ......I can repair the pain in her heart I gave her that day...`
`".........................................."`
`...For a while, Jessica stared into Kanon's eyes.`
`{n}......As though, despite stopping him, she had nothing to say.`
`"................................."`
`"..........................."`
`For a while, neither spoke.`
` ............Jessica broke that silence.`
` ...With a small voice.`
`".........Sorry.`
` .........It's nothing.`
` ...............Could you tell Auntie Rosa that I want to be alone for a while...?"`
`"I won't...let you be alone."`
`"........................huh..."`
`"I won't let you...be alone.`
` ..................So, I will be in the corridor.`
` ...At any time,`
` ......call me."`
`For just an instant, it looked like some kind of hope flew to Jessica's eyes.`
`...But it was very faint, ...and disappeared like the first snow does on the surface of a river.`
`"......Thanks.`
` ..................For just a while, let me cry alone..."`
`"............Yes.`
` ...............Excuse me."`
`Kanon bowed once again, and closed the door...`
`.........He thought he had said something to give her some courage.`
`{n}............But for some reason, it felt like that had actually hurt her.`
`...Why?`
` .........He didn't know.`
`{n}......Surely, that was because...`
`...............he was furniture.`
`So even now, ...he couldn't grasp human sadness.`
`As Kanon repeatedly questioned himself, he walked down the corridor.`
` .........He felt like the window at the end was coolly calling to him.`
`"..............................`
` ......In the end, .........am I nothing more than furniture after all......?"`
`It was still pouring outside—a dark, gray world.`
`...Even on days like this, Shannon would surely look at the ocean and know it was blue.`
`......But to my eyes, even if it cleared up, I would only see gray...`
`As long as I cannot tell the blueness of the ocean,`
` ......I am nothing but furniture imitating a person.........`
`".....................You really don't understand a woman's heart.`
` ...In times like that, you should silently remain by her side.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*, that's why you're furniture."`
`"Y‐............you―"`
`There shouldn't have been a trace of anyone in this corridor.`
`{n}It had been empty and cold.`
`{n}.........But those scoffing words approached Kanon from behind.`
`When he turned around, ......he saw that witch.`
`{n}That witch, who hadn't shown herself when Jessica had searched for her with a rage bordering on madness—who had left that sneering letter to toy with her...!`
`"There are three ways to hurt a woman.`
` ...Let me teach them, just for you.`
` One is to hurt them with a knife.`
` Another is to hurt them in their heart."`
`"...And the last one is the most difficult, and the most effective way of hurting them.`
` And yet it can hurt them without you even realizing it.`
` Do you know what it is...?"`
`"How, ......how could I know, I don't even want to know!!"`
`"It is to betray their hopes.`
` ......No living being is more of a dreamer than a woman!`
` They dream by themselves, and hurt by themselves.`
` ......A distant man like you hurts women the most!`
` You couldn't understand.`
` You don't have a clue how much you have injured Jessica."`
`"......Because you're furniture!`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`"I, I have no intention of going along with your nonsense!`
` ......Did you appear only to sneer at me?!!"`
`"Don't be so full of yourself, furniture.`
` You aren't worth sneering at!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` Still, even though you may not be worth it alone, if the two of you are gathered, that's more than enough.`
` ......I never get tired of the pleasure that comes from laughing at the fate of a young couple."`
`"What did you say...`
` .........Y‐`
`...you aren't thinking...`
` ......Not Milady......"`
`"I need "two who are close" as sacrifices for the second twilight.`
` ...The two of you truly are convenient...!!"`
`"W‐......wait...!`
` Don't misunderstand......!`
` Milady and I...`
`...don't have that kind of relationship...!`
` We can't become the sacrifices for the second twilight!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!`
` That's why you hurt Jessica.`
` That's why you cannot become human...!!"`
`"Very well, then, if you won't admit that you have feelings for Jessica, I can accept that.`
` ......But I'll kill Jessica!!"`
`"Why?!"`
`"You idiot!!`
` Isn't it obvious?!!"`
`"{i:It'll be fun to kill her and see the pained look on your face, why else}?!!"`
`"Following the rules of the ritual, I will arbitrarily select thirteen people as sacrifices.`
` However, there's no rule saying that I can't kill any more."`
`"...If I think it's fun, I can kill any number of people!!`
` So I will kill!!`
` {i:Make me laugh as hard as I can}, alright furrrrnituuuure, Kanonnnnnnnn?!?!"`
`At that time, Kanon definitely heard Jessica's scream.`
`The instant he blinked and looked down the corridor, the witch, who had been there making a perfectly ordinary face until a second ago, had disappeared.`
`...Right now, it was just him, standing alone in the corridor.`
`......And the person he wanted to protect was asking for help, and was right over there.`
`It was obvious what he should do.`
`{n}It wasn't logical.`
` It was an electric reaction.`
`{n}Without a trace of hesitation or idle thoughts.`
`...The person he wanted to protect was there, and asking for help.`
` .........So, in that moment, he genuinely felt that he wanted to be the person who was there with her.`
`When he flew into Jessica's room, his eyes latched on to a bizarre scene.`
`The room was a fantastical world, where a blizzard of golden powder danced, almost as though gold leaf had been scattered inside a snow globe.`
`.........No, that's not it.`
`{n}I've seen this spectacle before.`
`{n}This isn't gold leaf.`
`......It's countless gold butterflies—{f:5:Beatrice}'s minions!!`
`Jessica was surrounded by countless butterflies, and was waving her hands around, trying frantically to bat them away.`
`"Milady!!!"`
`"Ka‐Kanon‐kun......`
` H‐help...............`
` ...*cough*cough*cough*cough*!!"`
`Kanon rushed towards Jessica, and violently brushed the group of butterflies away.`
`...The butterflies, beautiful yet filthy, surrounded Jessica's face, trying to crawl in through her mouth and nose.`
`Jessica gagged violently.`
`...Almost as though the butterflies were triggering her asthma attack, sneering at her.`
`Indeed, when Kanon ran towards Jessica as she choked, the butterflies stopped attacking her, and this time, they began to elegantly dance a rondo around the two.`
`".........Kanon‐kun...... Kanon‐kun........."`
`"...It's alright.`
` ............While there's still life in my eyes,`
` ......I won't let anyone lay a finger on you."`
`".........Show yourself, {f:5:Beatrice}!!`
` Are you satisfied now?!!"`
`As he guarded Jessica, in pain and using her inhaler, Kanon yelled into the empty air.`
`......When he did, the empty air definitely laughed back, satisfied.`
`...Then, she showed herself.`
`{n}It wasn't in response to Kanon's demand.`
`It was obviously because appearing and sneering humiliated them even more, and was more fun!`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*hahahahaha!!`
` Now everything follows the plot.`
` Now you are carp on the chopping board."`
`"No, since the two of you are together, should I call it {c:86EF9C:duck with green onions}?`
` Hahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"`
`"Y‐......you,`
` ......B‐{f:5:Beatrice}...!!"`
`"Please, stand back.`
` ......I'll protect you, Milady...!"`
`"It's essential that the witch appears when the princess and the knight are together.`
` ......Come now, won't you show me how much power Kinzo's furniture holds?"`
`She snapped her fingers and there was a piercing sound.`
`When she did, a blizzard of gold butterflies started up, and they began to form a small mountain as they whirled around in a circle.`
`...Just like how a cold, wintry wind swirls and creates a mountain of leaves.`
`From that mound of gold, a hand sprouted, ...and it appeared, ......as though a resident of the world below was crawling out.`
`"Wh‐.........what is this......?`
` What's going on......?!"`
`Jessica couldn't comprehend what she was seeing right now, and her mouth kept flapping open and closed...`
`It was a literal attempt to take in and digest knowledge—to understand the incomprehensible.`
`That which was crawling up......was probably an attendant serving the witch.`
`It appeared to be wearing a uniform following the pattern of those who serve.`
`......But its face was different.`
` It was...strange‐looking...`
`......It was covered with pitch‐black hair, ...it breathed rotten breath, and its eyes were filled with the same strange subterranean glow as lava.`
`...And.........the symbol of those who are not human—a pair of horns...`
` It was the figure of a goat‐faced attendant who served the witch......`
`"...........................!!!!!"`
`Jessica could no longer decide what to say.`
`...All this happening in front of her couldn't be explained with this world's common sense, and she couldn't do anything except open and close her mouth.`
`......Jessica hadn't noticed.`
` ...That this island had already been cut off from the rules of this world.`
`But even so, she could understand.`
` ......That this goat attendant was the witch's familiar, ......and it was after her life.`
`And it seemed that the witch had already ordered that.`
`{n}And she faced Kanon with an expectant gaze.`
`......She faced him with a provocative gaze filled with expectation, as though asking him how he planned to protect this maiden!`
`The attendant had looked especially like a beast when it had been crawling up, but in its composure,`
` you could see that it had more than enough dignity to be worthy of serving the Golden Witch.`
`......And you could tell that it was overflowing with the joy of furniture wanting to meet its master's expectations.`
`".........Why don't you show me?`
` The power of Kinzo's furniture!"`
`"Don't get it wrong again... Understand?`
` ......Don't forget that you're furniture...`
` If you continue acting like a human even now, this won't be settled by your death alone.`
` Kukikiki{0}ki{0}ki{0}ki{0}ki{0}ki{0}ki{0}ki{0}kikiki!"`
`The goat attendant made a gesture that seemed to be a silent bow.`
`{n}Was that in response to its master, ...or was it offered to the opposing Kanon?`
`Then, on the attendant's hand, ......a blade of wicked malice appeared......`
`".........Wh‐`
`............what is...`
`......that............"`
`Jessica had been unable to understand what was happening in front of her for a while now.`
`......All she understood......was that this thing was gleaming for the purpose of threatening her own life.`
`And right now, that was enough.`
`Kanon spoke quietly to Jessica, who was hiding behind his back.`
`".........Milady.`
` ...Please stay back, against the wall.`
` ...Never let your back leave the wall."`
`"Wha......?!"`
`"......*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` The maiden should obediently hide behind the great knight's back.`
` Relish to the full the pleasure of having a man protect your own life.`
` ......Come!`
` Kanon, show me your blade!!"`
`"................................."`
`"......Beautiful.`
` ...At least when it comes to giving birth to furniture, Kinzo might reach up to my feet."`
`"...Something like this......can't even be used to trim the roses."`
`"...............K‐.........Kanon‐kun...`
` ...............What is........."`
`".........I didn't want...to show you."`
`"So you had the courage to draw your blade.`
` .........How does it feel to have exposed the fact that you are a subhuman being in front of the girl you have feelings for?"`
`"........................Shut up."`
`"......Hmph.`
` ......So you feign composure even though you're really burning with wrath?`
` ...I see, they say that truly hot flames burn a cool blue.`
` Is that how you are now?"`
`"There's no way I can kill you with my powers.`
` ......You are the moon.`
` There's no way I can smash the moon by throwing a rock.`
` ......However, in order to manifest yourself, you had to reflect your image on the surface of the water."`
`"If you throw a rock at the surface of the water, you might be able to disturb the moon for some time.`
` ...But that doesn't mean the moon has been smashed.`
` So."`
`"......Until this life of mine is over,`
` ......I'll keep on striking your reflection......!"`
`"I like it, Kanon!!`
` Begin, furniture!!"`
`"............Hoh.`
` ...............A beautiful trail."`
`The witch's words of admiration broke the silence, and for just an instant, broke Jessica's paralysis.`
`"..............................`
` Am,`
` ......am I...`
`...dreaming.........?"`
`"............Come,`
` furniture of the witch.`
` .........I'll beat you down to the hell you came from."`
`"................................."`
`A strand of red remained on Kanon's cheek.`
`{n}...The witch saw this and grinned broadly...`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*.`
` ......You may mutter excuses about not being on your game if you wish?"`
`"........................"`
`"K‐......Kanon‐kun, ............stay strong...!"`
`".........It's alright.`
` .........I...won't die yet."`
`The trail drawn by the goat attendant's blade......drew a large arc in empty space.`
`...Kanon...wasn't there.`
`{n}......He was behind it.`
`".........Back whither you came, and await your master.`
` ......Die."`
`If this battle of drawing sparkling trails was chess...`
`{n}...then Kanon coming from behind was check.`
`And press, and press, and press, and press.`
`{n}And mate in seven...!`
`......Had the goat attendant not even been given the right to go into death throes?`
`......As its knees buckled and it fell over, it crumbled softly into a bunch of gold butterflies...`
`So there was no sound of it hitting the ground.`
` Even those who couldn't understand this battle...could definitely at least realize that Kanon had been magnificent.`
`"......Hmph.`
` So it couldn't win against one handmade.`
` ...It seems that you aren't so pathetic."`
`"You're next, .........{f:5:Beatriceeeeeeeee}!!"`
`Kanon's blade sliced diagonally through the witch's form like a hot knife through butter, and in that instant, she burst into gold and scattered.`
`......She scattered into several thousand gold butterflies, and for just an instant, the room was filled with the color of twilight.`
`...It was just as Kanon himself had said.`
` Attempting to slice {f:5:Beatrice} was just the same as slicing the surface of the water where the moon was reflected.`
`...The witch's form was there, with an ordinary expression on her face, as though she had been there the whole time, ...behind Kanon.`
`"Hahahahahahaha...!!`
` It was quite an interesting show.`
` In deference to that, I was going to let you get away, but now your rudeness has caused me to change my mind..."`
`"Don't lie!`
` I won't let you kill Milady!!`
` ......Even if that's impossible, ......I won't let you kill her before me!"`
`"You can't even do that much.`
` Speak not, furniture.`
` Be silent, furniture.`
` Know your place, furniture!!"`
`"K‐.........Kanon‐kun isn't furniture...!"`
`"......Hoh.`
` ...And why do you say that?"`
`"I don't need a reason.`
` ......Kanon‐kun is Kanon‐kun."`
`"No, his real name is different, ......but a name doesn't make him furniture!`
` Kanon‐kun has his own way of living.`
` That's a very noble thing, and it's up to him to decide."`
`"......Saying he can't have an opinion because he's furniture, or can't have his own life because he's furniture......that's all just crap!!"`
`"Milady... You mustn't provoke her."`
`"No, I'm gonna say this clearly.`
` .........Kanon‐kun isn't furniture.`
` He's human.`
` ......Why?"`
`"Kanon‐kun rushed to save me of his own will.`
` And he stood in the path of you, a fearsome witch.`
` Even though he had many chances to just abandon me, he didn't."`
`".........Self‐sacrifice is part of the noble spirit that only humans have!!`
` So Kanon‐kun is human!!`
` So take it back!`
` Don't ever call Kanon‐kun furniture again!!"`
`".........Mila...dy........."`
`"Hmph.`
` ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*.`
` ...Kuhahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha.`
` Wahahahahahahahaha!!"`
`"Don't speak, human!!`
` Let us end this quickly; after all, this is only the second twilight.`
` Now, I will sacrifice "the two who are close", who accept each other's dignity."`
`"Come, arise, forgive the sin, one of the seven stakes of Purgatory, lust!!!"`
`The witch summoned her own furniture with a mixture of laughter and anger on her face.`
`"......Asmodeus the Lustful.`
` Right here."`
`"I've had enough of this farce.`
` Quickly, execute the second twilight.`
` ......Do not permit me to blink thrice."`
`"......As you command."`
`"A‐......another weirdo's shown up......"`
`"...........................kh..."`
`It took Kanon less than an instant to understand.`
` ......That goat‐face from a second ago had been nothing more than a pawn to the witch.`
`However, there was a marked difference in the value of this piece, of this furniture that had been newly summoned.`
`"......How lucky am I, to be granted such gorgeous prey.`
` .........*giggle*giggle*giggle*, you scared?`
` How cuuute.`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!"`
`"............Come,`
` furniture of the witch...`
` I won't be killed by you...!"`
`"*giggle*giggle*!`
` You're acting pretty smart for a slowpoke who can't even follow my moves."`
`"......Here I come...`
` ......Hey hey, where do you want it?`
` Where do you want me to pierce you?`
` Answer me, cutie boy.`
` Wherever you want it, I'll run you through hard...!!`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*, come on, answer me, cutie...!"`
`"D‐...don't call me cute!!!"`
`"Kyahahahahaha!!`
` Here I come, slowpoke!!`
` Come on, try to follow me, you blind idiot!!`
` Kyaahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"`
`"Ugnhh......!!"`
`"............Mi‐......Milady........."`
`"Heh, .........I couldn't follow it with my eyes...`
` But my guess...was spot on.........`
` Serves you...right............"`
`Kanon's back had been the target.`
`{n}...But Jessica had predicted it.`
`She had predicted that the sneering witch's target would be the complete opposite of fair and honest—his back.`
`But she had no way to block it.`
`{n}...She had no aspirations to martyrdom.`
`{n}She simply thought that there was no way other than this to protect Kanon's back.`
`............So, she could do nothing but block it with her own back.`
`The furniture of the witch, which had changed its form into a demon's stake, was stuck deep into Jessica's back.`
` ...It was an obviously fatal wound that reached as far as her lungs.`
`When she saw this, the witch let out a loud, evil laugh.`
`Because it had hit {i:where the witch had predicted}.`
`{n}...Everything, everything was as the witch had predicted!`
`"What's wrong Kanonnn...?`
` I thought "Milady Jessica" wasn't going to be killed before you??"`
`"Kukikikikiki, yes, yes, that's it, that's it, that face, that look on your face is what I wanted to see!!`
` Kikiki{0}ki{0}ki{0}ki{0}ki{0}ki{0}ki{0}ki{0}ki{0}ki{0}kikiki!!`
` This has been fun, more than enough of it!!`
` Enough now, die, die, make me laugh!!"`
`"Come, arise, forgive the sin,`
` one of the seven stakes of Purgatory,`
` wrath!!"`
`"......Satan the Wrathful.`
` Right here."`
`"The prey is yours.`
` Eat him right now, and close the curtain on his stage."`
`"......If you were a human, I'd say it's time for you to step down, but since you're furniture, maybe I should say it's time for the stage manager to carry you behind the stage!"`
`"..................I am not......furniture anymore.`
` I won't......doubt that again!"`
`"......*giggle*giggle*, ohh?`
` You're gonna be killed by me again?"`
`"Your chest, ......it's so warm, and it feels so good to stick myself in there, you know...?`
` Come on, let me have another taste...`
` Make me feel real good with that hot, hot, fresh blood in that warm chest of yours..."`
`"...Kyahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!"`
`"Ghh......!!"`
`There was no way to block it.`
`The sound of a woodpecker filled the entire room,`
` ...and before he could blink,`
` ......it was already right in the center of his chest...`
`When you take a piece in chess, it's impossible by the rules for your opponent's piece to defend.`
`So this was an obvious result, and one even specified by the rules.`
`Kanon landed on his knees...`
` And he apologized.`
`......Not to the witch.`
` ...And not to "Milady".`
`.........He apologized...to Jessica.`
`"...Sorry............`
` ......I couldn't......protect you............"`
`".........Don't worry about it......`
` ......You were really...cool......"`
`Kanon finally fell over.`
` ......He landed next to Jessica, and the two lay there like Gemini.`
`"......You know, Kanon‐kun,`
` .........you aren't...furniture anymore..."`
`"...Yes......`
` .........I was...`
`...too late...`
`...in realizing that......"`
`"I wanted to ask you...`
`.........what your real name was..."`
`"...My...`
`......real name is...`
`............`
`......ah...`
`.........aaaaaaaaah...ah..."`
`In his last moments, Kanon wanted to tell her his real name.`
` ...But...Jessica had already fallen into a sleep from which she would never wake......`
`So, Kanon's real name, which he had protected until today,`
` .........in the end,`
` ...he couldn't......tell it to Jessica...`
`".........I...`
`............became...`
`.........hu...ma........."`
`Those were...the last words Kanon left behind.`
`"Wahahahahahahahahaha, kukikaka{0}ka{0}ka{0}ka{0}ka{0}ka{0}ka{0}ka{0}ka{0}ka{0}ka{0}ka{0}kakaka!!`
` Don't make me laugh, furniture!!"`
`"Even after a hundred years, furniture is furniture!`
` Have you ever heard of an idiot who'll dig a grave for furniture when they throw it away?`
` You smash furniture to pieces and make firewood, so all that's left is ashes!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle, that's how it is, no tombstone can be carved for furniture!`
` ......It seems you believe that when you die, you cannot receive any more humiliation, but that's naive, you see...?`
` I'll teach you......what it really means to disgrace the dead.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!!!"`
`After taking a puff from her pipe, the witch breathed the smoke at Kanon's corpse...`
`......When she did, Kanon's corpse softly floated up into the air, ...and disappeared as though it had been eaten by a mouth in empty space.`
`The witch played dirty until the very end.`
` ......The two who had understood one another in their last moments—she would not even permit their corpses to be close...`
`If someone had been watching, they would probably mourn that this was indeed a disgrace to the dead.`
`...However, {f:5:Beatrice} was far, far crueler...`
`{n}......That would become immediately apparent...``"............I see.`
` So it has begun."`
`"...Yes."`
`"................................."`
`Even though Kinzo had heard of the six deaths, his emotions did not waver.`
`The expression on his face as he gazed out the window......was a smile, as though his opponent in a chess game had just made a spectacular move.`
`...It was unimaginable that this expression could appear on a father who had lost many children at once.`
`"......Under Rosa‐sama's orders, Gohda and Kanon are calling the police.`
` Also, she has ordered us to follow your orders, my lord...`
` ......What shall we do?"`
`"...............This island has already been cut off from the real world.`
` Phones and the like will be useless."`
`"Should I have them stop?"`
`"......Until the roulette is finished, what they do to pass the time is up to them.`
` Let them do as they like."`
`"............Yes."`
`"...Umm......`
`...what should I tell Rosa‐sama?"`
`"I say again, what they do to pass the time is up to them!!`
` They can sing if they want, dance if they want!`
` They're even free to hang themselves by the neck or jump into a boiling cauldron!!`
` Until thirteen people die, they can spend their time as they like.`
` If they are that bored, then they can spend their time wondering why six times nine is forty‐two!!`
` That's the answer to the mystery of man and the universe!!"`
`"Y‐yes...!`
` My, my apologies......!"`
`Shannon cowered in fright at this sudden rage.`
` ...Genji made a gesture as though telling her not to say too much.`
`Shannon couldn't help but regret speaking out of turn...`
`"However.`
` ...You are also free to do as you wish.`
` ......Genji.`
` And Shannon.`
` You have done well serving me until today."`
`"Y‐...your words are too good for me......`
` ...But, umm........."`
`"...............We are furniture who have sworn to serve you, my lord.`
` ......At any and all times, we will be waiting by your side.`
` ......Until the very end."`
`"..................`
` ............I want to tell the two of you...`
`......about everything.`
` ......Shannon.`
` I shall be writing a will.`
` Please copy what I say.`
` ...Genji, please, my usual drink."`
`"huh...`
` ...............Ye‐............yes......!"`
`Nanjo had often recommended that Kinzo write a will because of his health, but each time, Kinzo had gone mad with rage.`
`......Since that time, "will" had been the word Kinzo took most exception at.`
`Because that word had come out of his own mouth, Shannon couldn't help doubting her ears for an instant.`
`Shannon hurriedly prepared the side table and some writing paper.`
` Genji also began preparing his usual green devil, just as he was ordered...`
`"I am ready."`
`".........Hmm.`
` .........Where should I start from?`
` ...I suppose I could also speak of my life.`
` ......It would be fun to leave a record of my memorable games."`
`".........It truly is fun to read the records of old games from over a century ago, ...a journey searching for those players' thoughts.`
` .........Then will the score sheet of my life also beckon those in the future to go on a journey searching for my thoughts?`
` ......Hmph."`
`For a while, Kinzo considered where he should start speaking from, striding all around the room with his hands behind his back...`
`"My lord.`
` .........Here."`
`"Good.`
` Thank you, my friend.`
` ............Well then.`
` If I am to speak of my life, I must begin writing from when I met that witch."`
`"...Shannon, copy this.`
` ......My meeting with {f:5:Beatrice} took place a long way back.`
` What year of the Showa era was it...?`
` ...I think it was toward the end of the war—"`
`We took enough time to regain our calm,`
` .........and we each swore to our parents that we'd definitely catch the killer.`
`It would be a lie to say we weren't still bitter.`
`...Even now, if we gave in just a little, we'd feel like going on a rampage like Jessica, and resorting to some kind of violence.`
`According to what Gohda‐san said after he got back, right now, Kanon‐kun was looking after Jessica.`
`...Apparently, she was still very emotionally high‐strung.`
`"......I see.`
` Thank you.`
` ...Maybe a young kid would be better at understanding a young kid's feelings.`
` ......It would probably be better if we left them alone for now."`
`"Rosa‐san...`
` ......There is nothing more we can accomplish by remaining here.`
` ......The telephones may not be working, but tomorrow the boat will come, and we should be able to reach the police.`
` We should leave this place as it is for the police's investigation."`
`"...I agree with Doctor Nanjo.`
` ......It is bad for your health to stay in a place like this for too long.`
` ......Let us return and make some black tea..."`
`".........Yes.`
` ...I'm all for that too.`
` ......Battler‐kun, George‐kun, are you ready...?`
` Let's close this place up.`
` We should leave this place as it is, for when the police come if nothing else."`
`"You're right.`
` .........Battler‐kun, ...are you alright...?"`
`"......Yeah.`
` ...I've cried all I can.`
` .........I'm fine now."`
`The police would surely find some evidence from a thorough investigation.`
` ...But we hadn't been adult enough to wait for that.`
`...I had investigated the chapel in my own way, trying to catch the culprit before the police got here.`
`......And what I figured out was—frustratingly—nothing.`
`{n}......I hadn't been able to find a single hint.`
`"Come on, ......let's go out.`
` ...Maria, we're going.`
` ......Don't keep staring at it...!"`
`"......Uu."`
`"Come, come, Maria‐sama.`
` Let us return...`
` It is cold here."`
`"............Mother, Father.`
` ......Thank you for everything.`
` ...I will definitely become a man who doesn't betray your expectations..."`
`George spoke his last words of farewell to his parents.`
`......After seeing that, Battler followed suit.`
`"...Dad, Kyrie‐san."`
`Taken on their own, their faces...made it look like they were sleeping, ......which made it all the more bitter......`
`".........Forgive me for leaving you in such a chilly place.`
` .........I'll definitely get whoever did this...`
` Definitely..."`
`"......What is......this?`
` What disgusting graffiti...`
` Did the killer draw it?"`
`"It is worse than vulgar......`
` ......This is horrible..."`
`When the door to the chapel was closed, we learned about that creepy graffiti for the first time.`
`"It was like this when we first found it.`
` ...No doubt it was drawn by the culprit..."`
`"...The culprit was a witch, so is this a magic circle to summon a demon or something......?"`
`"Kihihihihihihihihihihi...`
` This is the seventh magic circle of the sun.`
` You don't even know that, huh...`
` Kihihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi.`
` Ouch."`
`"Hey!!`
` Don't I always tell you not to make that creepy laugh!!"`
`"Maria, go on.`
` ......What does it mean?"`
`"It's a magic circle to escape from physical or mental bonds.`
` ......And the Hebrew written around the circumference says, "The Lord has freed me from my chains.`
` I will offer to you the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call on the name of the Lord"."`
`"......Sacrifice of thanksgiving...?`
` Are you telling me that killing Father and the rest was so that they could be sacrifices for this magic circle...?!"`
`"Calm yourself, George‐kun...!`
` This is the killer trying to provoke us.`
` ...It doesn't mean anything.`
` Just thinking about it poisons the heart."`
`"......And there's some English written.`
` ...<Happy Halloween for>...<Maria>.`
` ......I see.`
` And the key to open this door was handed over to Maria, ...is that what this is?"`
`"...But this is the chapel.`
` ...Maybe "Maria" doesn't mean Maria‐chan, but the Virgin Mary.`
` ......In that case, you could read this as a blasphemy against God, in the name of Halloween."`
`"They say that witches who make contracts with demons swear to always defile God's name.`
` ......In that sense, this really is a witch‐like crime."`
`"...You sure know a lot.`
` ......Did you hear that from Maria?"`
`"......Yeah, something like that."`
`"So, the chapel.`
` ......They went to all the trouble of calling them out to the chapel before killing them...`
` ............Auntie Rosa,`
` does this chapel have some special meaning...?"`
`"What do you mean, ......special meaning?"`
`"Well, umm,`
` ............they carried six human corpses all the way over here, and made these elaborate decorations."`
`"...We can't tell whether she called the six of them over here before killing them, or whether she killed them and then carried them over here,`
` ...but either way, it would take a lot of effort.`
` .........What reason did the culprit have...`
` {i:for wanting six people to die here}......?"`
`"......Yes, that is something.`
` In doing something that elaborate, there would be an extremely high chance that when the police came, some disadvantageous evidence would be found."`
`"......There is no way the culprit failed to notice that.`
` ...Then, why did the culprit go to all the effort of doing this,`
` is the question we face..."`
`"In that case, there's one question that comes out at this point.`
` ......What meaning does this place, where we found the six corpses, have?"`
`"......This chapel......was important to Father.`
` ......I've been strictly told not to enter it since I was a kid."`
`"Uu.`
` ...I came here once too, got yelled at a lot...`
` Uu..."`
`"An important chapel...?`
` ......Does it have some connection to the Ushiromiya main family...?"`
`"I don't know.`
` ......Father viewed this chapel as very sacred, and he treasured it so much that he had it redecorated several times."`
`"...But as you all know,`
` Father simply has a love of black magic—it's not that he was a devout believer.`
` ......I've never heard of him coming here to offer his prayers to God."`
`"......Even to the best of my knowledge, the Master has never come here.`
` We even called this the "forbidden chapel", ...umm,`
` and thought of it as quite eerie, like a haunted house."`
`"Even though Father never approached it himself, for some reason, he made the servants clean it several times a year.`
` ......It felt like he kept it clean all the time so that it could be used at any time."`
`"And even so, it's called the "forbidden chapel"...`
` ......Ihihi!`
` This may be indiscreet, but doesn't that have an interesting ring to it?`
` Doctor Nanjo, you're an old friend of Grandfather's, right?`
` Ever asked him anything about that?"`
`"............I asked about it long ago, but I forget what he said to evade the issue.`
` ......That's right, didn't he say something like this?"`
`"......Someday, he too might be able to receive a blessing there.`
` But unless a miracle occurred, that day would never come."`
`"What does that mean?`
` .........What goes on in a chapel?`
` He couldn't mean his own funeral, right?"`
`"I wouldn't believe that of Kinzo‐san.`
` ...He was a man much more focused on the now, while he still lives, rather than things after death.`
` .........However, it does seem that this was the root of all the complexity in the inheritance problem."`
`"What else is there you do in a chapel?`
` .........Pray?`
` Aren't confessions done in chapels as well?`
` ..................Anyway, it sounds suspicious."`
`"......I don't know the reason,`
` ......but just as Doctor Nanjo said, it seems that in Grandfather's eyes,`
` ......the fact that he wouldn't receive a blessing unless a miracle occurred was a fate set in stone from the time this chapel was constructed."`
`"How can you tell that...?"`
`"See, ...it's clearly written up there.`
` ......Look, up there."`
`George‐aniki pointed to a relief with rusted gold letters on the arch above the door.`
`It looked like some message was written there in English.`
` ...The rust showed that the message had been there since construction.`
`".........I'm bad at English.`
` ......What's it say...?`
` ......<This door is>...{0}<opened>...{0}<only at>...{0}<probability of>??`
` Sorry, my English sucks."`
`I gave up after I was unable to finish reading the first of the two lines.`
`{n}...It looked like the others could read it properly.`
`"...Umm, I think it went "m", "b", "t", "q", so,`
` ...umm, umm... How big was that again... I think...umm...umm,`
` ..............."`
`"......In any case, this is incredible.`
` You couldn't even count close to that with all the fingers on both hands.`
` It really would be impossible unless a miracle occurred."`
`"......Certainly.`
` It is very much like how Kinzo‐san used to talk, when he would tend to relate everything in terms of gambling."`
`"What, what, you could all read it?`
` Someone tell me what it means too."`
`"Kihihihihihihi.`
` ...At least learn English.`
` How did you get into high school without even being able to read this much?`
` Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi,`
` ouch.`
` Ouch`
`ouch`
`ouch."`
`"Mind your own damn business.`
` So what's written there?"`
`"...Roughly it says:`
` "This door is opened only when a miracle occurs.`
` You will be blessed only when a miracle occurs"."`
`"......Grandfather's sorcery is based on astronomically low probabilities.`
` ...In other words, the miracle that would open this door......would probably require an incredibly vast magical power.`
` ......Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi.`
` Ouch."`
`"Niiiice, you can shut up now.`
` Auntie Rosa, you were sending Maria to English classes?`
` I guess it's true, you have to start learning English when you're young."`
`".........The forbidden chapel.`
` ......Whether or not the witch {f:5:Beatrice} really was a witch, she's whispered to have actually existed several decades ago,`
` ......and been Grandfather's mistress."`
`"This is, umm, just my imagination, but...`
`......I imagine the Master really did truly love {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` However, he was already married, so they couldn't be united."`
`"...I see.`
` .........If the dead {f:5:Beatrice} could be revived with the magic of a miracle, then now that Grandmother is dead, he could marry her with his head held high.`
` And he'd marry her in this chapel......... Could it be a fairy‐tale story like that?"`
`"......I don't think that sounds so preposterous.`
` ...It is a well known fact that Father still loves {f:5:Beatrice} deeply."`
`"......Also, even though I said it was creepy,`
` I get the feeling that the interior of the chapel was quite magnificent.`
` .........The thought that Father built this chapel in the hopes of having a wedding with his dead mistress actually might not be that unlikely."`
`"...By the time he built this chapel, Grandfather probably knew that he would never use it as a church as long as he lived."`
`" ......But he prayed for the witch to be revived by some miracle.`
` And he thought that if that miracle occurred, they could be married here..."`
`"......I see.`
` ...If you think of it that way, this would be a place of utmost significance to {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama as well...`
` All the while knowing it was a chapel that would never be opened.`
` ......A story of sad love."`
`Even though Gohda‐san's body was even bigger than mine, his words were touching.`
`...Everyone was silent, but it seemed that they agreed with that view.`
`"Even though he knew it was a chapel never to be opened,`
` ......he still probably dreamed of the day that a miracle would occur.`
` .........Kinzo‐san was a great romantic in his younger days.`
` ...I feel as though I understand him."`
`"Ihihi.`
` I wonder.`
` ......But you all came in four times a year to clean it, right?"`
`"What do you mean, never opened?`
` Didn't we just go in ourselves?`
` That wasn't a miracle or anything.`
` We brought the key, clunk, and we're in.`
` That's all that happened, this is ridiculous."`
`"..................Huh?`
` ............Wha?!`
` ...............Wait, .........what on Earth?"`
`"Wh‐what do you mean "what on Earth"..."`
`I thought all I'd done was mess around because I didn't like the way the atmosphere had turned all sappy.`
` ......But Auntie Rosa had suddenly jumped on me, with a really serious face.`
`Auntie Rosa's face grew increasingly pale.`
` ...She looked at the magic circle on the door, then at her hand, back and forth, back and forth.`
`"Wh‐......what seems to be the matter, Rosa‐sama...?"`
`"Hey, Gohda‐san!`
` The key to this chapel!`
` Didn't Genji‐san say it?`
` {i:He said there was only one}!"`
`".....................Huh?`
` ............"`
`"...Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi.`
` ...It took you all far too long to notice.`
` Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi..."`
`...When a kid pulls a prank, it sometimes goes unnoticed by the adults, and the kid who did it loses heart.`
`......If one of those pranks catches someone later on, it makes that kid really happy.`
`......Maria's celebration just now looked a lot like that...`
`"...Y‐......yes, that's right.`
` There is only one of those keys.`
` It is the key to the Master's treasured chapel, so there is only one, with no duplicates.`
` ...It is normally kept safe in the key box in the servant room, but..."`
`"That's right.`
` And Genji‐san said that it had gone missing.`
` ......Someone stole it, ......put it in that envelope, and handed it to Maria!`
` And that was yesterday!"`
`"............What...?`
` Wait, but then,`
` .........that makes no sense, doesn't it?"`
`"...That's absurd.`
` .........This is getting strange."`
`"Wh‐what do you all mean...?`
` I don't have a clue what you're talking about..."`
`"Me neither.`
` ......Would someone be so kind as to explain it for us...?"`
`...Gohda and Nanjo's failure to understand definitely wasn't because they were stupid.`
`......They didn't know.`
` ...They didn't know how long the only key to the chapel had been in Maria's hand.`
`"I'm positive!`
` It was locked!!`
` I unlocked it!!`
` Definitely!!"`
`Auntie Rosa kept closing the chapel door, locking it, pulling on it to check the lock, and opening it again.`
`Her face was becoming pale again...`
`"Until I took the key out of Maria's envelope and opened this door,`
` it was definitely locked!!`
` But this key was in the envelope and in Maria's care!`
` And that happened yesterday before noon!!!"`
`".........What did you say........."`
`"But then that's......strange......!"`
`"Yes, it is.`
` .........Maria received the only key from a woman calling herself a witch midday yesterday.`
` In other words, from midday yesterday until this morning, when Auntie Rosa unlocked the door, this chapel was a locked room."`
`".........How did they get those six in here, and then how did they kill them?!"`
`We had been confused by the six deaths.`
` We'd thought that we had figured something out after hearing about that weird magic circle and the history of the chapel.`
`......That had all been a worthless problem!`
`From midday yesterday until this morning, this chapel had been a locked room.`
`{n}But our parents had been with us until last night.`
`How had the culprit opened this door?!`
`{n}And how had they locked it?!`
`"......What are you trying to pull.`
` ...Again?`
` A locked room again?!`
` Are you trying to say that you unlocked it with the power of magic?!!`
` I'm not that stupid!!"`
`"If you tell me to show you how I open locks with my power, then I can show you.`
` ......But that will not make you surrender."`
`"These "explanations with humans" you talk about!`
` The time I fully exhaust those theories of yours will be the time of my victory!!`
` Come now, how will you destroy it?`
` If it was a human, what trick could they have used to defeat it, hmm~?"`
`"It's just like the locked rooms last time.`
` ...Not enough information!!`
` It's impossible to reason like this!`
` Any excuse could be made, any trick could work!!`
` Guessing is useless!"`
`"Ha!`
` That again?`
` There's not enough information so you'll wait and see?`
` The information is uncertain so it's impossible to reason...?`
` Ha, those are always the excuses you humans use to stop thinking.`
` What is this pretense, you lowly human?!"`
`"Are you saying that unless you're like Laplace's demon, you can't even think, you incompetent fool?!!`
` ......And you speak as though a lack of information is disadvantageous to you, when it's actually the complete opposite, you see?"`
`"The more information you're given, the more it will pain you!`
` It will only cause the strength of the compressor squeezing you to increase!`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`"Hoh, well, in that case, let me say this.`
` It's impossible to verify that this is even a "locked room" in the first place!!`
` If we're talking about demons, I've got one for you as well."`
`"......It's possible to prove that this isn't a locked room.`
` You just have to show how someone could go in or out!"`
`"But it's impossible to prove that it {i:is} a locked room!!`
` You can't deny the endless set of methods of getting in.`
` In other words, this is one of those Devil's Proofs!!`
` The definition of a locked room is in fact impossible to prove!!"`
`"So, after you stop thinking with a lack of information as an excuse, this is what comes next.`
` ......Oh well.`
` If that is your move, then I will accept it.`
` Continue."`
`"First off, it looks like you're trying to say that the chapel is a locked room.`
` ...Just a short while ago, I spent some time looking around in there, and yeah, I really couldn't find any way in or out except for the door."`
`"......But that {i:just means I couldn't find one}—it doesn't prove that it was a locked room!!"`
`"If there was a "hidden door" or something that I wasn't able to find, all your premises are completely blown away!!`
` In other words, whether I'm able to find a hidden door or not, you can never deny a method X by which the locked room could be entered!"`
`"And this method X could be carried out without magic.`
` After all, it's a "hidden door"!`
` I'm sure that in this chapel, there's some hidden door that's impossible to find.`
` So I don't even need to start guessing, and I can say that magic is impossible!!"`
`".........Hohoh, so you use that reasoning.`
` *cackle*cackle*, how naive."`
`"An expected move.`
` Let me make my move in response.`
` ......I have always thought the "locked rooms" that feature in worthless human detective novels to be ridiculous."`
`"Why?`
` Because they're used the wrong way.`
` ......When a "locked room" appears in a detective novel, do you really think that is a locked room?`
` You don't, do you?!"`
`"{i:What trick did they use to make this look like a locked room}!`
` That's what you think."`
`"In other words, out of all the locked‐room murders humanity has built up over a hundred years, not a single one has ever been made complete!!"`
`"Oooh!!`
` That's some talk—mystery fans are pretty scary, you know?!`
` Christie is probably grinding her teeth in her grave!"`
`"Hmph!!`
` But I am different.`
` I have given birth to a true locked room!`
` And I can demonstrate that.`
` Why?`
` Because I am a witch!!"`
`"For the Devil's Proof, all you have to do is bring along a devil to prove it, yes?`
` Well that's convenient—as a witch, devils and demons are my good friends, I'll bring as many as you like!!"`
`"Sounds great!!`
` "Dad and the rest entered the chapel using a hidden door, or were carried in through one"!`
` How do you plan to beat this move?!"`
`"With this.`
` Regardless of whether they were alive or dead,`
` the six definitely entered through the door!!"`
`"Huh?!?!`
` Dumbass!!`
` The door was locked, how'd they do it?!!"`
`"I opened it with magic, and invited them inside!!"`
`"Like hell you did!!`
` I can't accept magic, so there's no way in hell I'll accept that!!`
` You're lying!!`
` That door can open with some trick.`
` Or maybe there's a hidden door—I won't accept any other way!!"`
`"......<Perpetual>!!`
` That's what we call an endless repetition of moves in chess.`
` In our game, both sides denying the basis of each other's claims and failing to advance the discussion is the same as an endless repetition of moves."`
`"......In most games, this would be decided as a draw, but that would terribly dampen the interest of this game!!`
` We will have no draws.`
` In short, you will either accept me and submit to me, or not!!"`
`"At least I agree with you there!!`
` We'll settle this without fail, just as you wish!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` That disposition is good!`
` .........So I had a thought.`
` I think I'll add a new rule to this game between you and me."`
`"A new rule?!`
` ...I'll bet it's a rule that'll give you an advantage, right?!"`
`"Would I do that?`
` I'll give you the thing that people like you never cease to demand.`
` The reason you incompetent fools always stop thinking and then moan about it is "lack of information"!`
` If you are then given information, you start doubting whether the information is true or not by "denying the basis"!"`
`"Aren't those convenient?`
` What clever little words to hide your own incompetence.`
` I shall eliminate those convenient excuses.`
` You should thank me, *cackle*!"`
`"You said they entered through the door, and I denied it, saying that couldn't happen.`
` ......Are you saying that's an evasive answer?"`
`"That's right.`
` So from now on,`
` {p:1:when I speak the truth, I will use red}."`
`"Wh‐what is this......?!`
` Keep explaining!"`
`"No matter what magic move I use,`
` you can always keep running away by repeating "lack of information" and "denying the basis"."`
`"...Even though I would still win in the end that way, it would be extremely boring.`
` ......Because of that, I think I'll give you that "information" and "basis" that you desire."`
`"However, you would probably doubt each word I say.`
` That isn't bad in itself.`
` I also will use every possible move to make you submit.`
` I don't dislike our posture of searching out the best moves against each other."`
`"......But that won't make a game.`
` So I set up this rule."`
`"`
`{p:1:Everything I speak in red is the truth}!`
` There's absolutely no need to doubt it!"`
`"Are you telling me to believe that...?!"`
`"This is a game between you and me.`
` In a game, the rules are sacred!!`
` Those who take them lightly are not qualified to play!!"`
`"Alright, I got it, I'll accept that rule!!`
` Even an elementary school kid can get into an endless argument and find fault with everything."`
`"Then let's restart right now, and continue where we left off.`
` I'll repeat it again.`
` "Dad and the rest entered the chapel using a hidden door, or were carried in through one"!"`
`"Then I shall repeat what I said.`
` "{p:1:Regardless of whether they were alive or dead,`
` the six definitely entered through the door}"!"`
`".........I‐is there any proof?!"`
`"<Stop>!!`
` I will supplement the rule."`
`"......When I speak the truth, I will use red,`
` and {i:when I do, I do not bear the responsibility of establishing that by showing proof}!`
` It is simply a fact and the truth!!"`
`"The reason is simple.`
` I carry out all of the crimes with magic.`
` So for any impossible crime, all I have to do is wave my magic staff before your eyes."`
`"But that wouldn't make a game!`
` It would be like the barbarism of ignoring victory and defeat in a chess game and punching your opponent!"`
`"W‐......well, that is true.`
` ...If you were a witch,`
` {i:there'd be no need for you to show proof}.`
` ......Because you could do anything with magic... That's nasty...`
` What an unfair game...!"`
`"So shall we resume once more?`
` The six people definitely entered through the door.`
` I unlocked it with magic.`
` ......How will you defeat this magic, this locked room?!"`
`"......The, the key!`
` Genji‐san and the others said there was only one key, but that's impossible to prove!`
` The culprit secretly made a duplicate key...!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` {p:1:Only one key to the chapel exists}!"`
`"Arg......`
` Th‐then what about this.`
` The culprit used something other than a legitimate key to open it!`
` I don't know what, but maybe a wire!`
` A tool for picking locks!!"`
`"What is this naive move?`
` {p:1:It is impossible to unlock the lock to the chapel with anything but the chapel's key}!!`
` Although it can be opened with the power of magic, of course...?"`
`"Then what about this!!`
` There's something wrong with the door itself!`
` Even while it was locked, there was some way to pass through it...!`
` As to what that is, I can think of a few ways!"`
`"Maybe like on the big doors to a castle which have a smaller door on them, there was another door here!`
` It's also possible that they removed the hinges, and then removed the whole door before entering!!"`
`"Wahahahahahahahahahaha!`
` Is this the intelligence of a hundred years of humanity, Battleeeeeeer?!`
` {p:1:When the door to the chapel is locked, it prevents any and all methods of entry or exit}!!"`
`"As long as you can't use magic, of course...?`
` *cackle*!`
` Is it about time for checkmate?!"`
`"Not even close!!`
` You said that the six people entered through "the door", but you didn't say it was this front door!`
` They might have entered through another secret door!!"`
`"You talk too much, you incompetent fool.`
` Then let me advance more on my earlier move.`
` {p:1:The six definitely entered through {i:this front door}}!!"`
`"That's screwed up!!`
` The door was locked, it was impossible to unlock without using that single key, and yet six people entered through this door?!?!`
` How did they do it?!!`
` Magic, you say?!`
` Damn it, damn it damn it damn it damn it damn it!!!"`
`"Wahahahahahahaaah!!`
` Have we already exposed a human's limits?"`
`"Then shout <resign>!!`
` It is customary for the surrendering player to shout that and topple their king.`
` Come on, do you give up?!`
` Then proclaim your submission, and kneel, as if toppling your king!!"`
`"And then you shall kiss my shoes!`
` There's no greater joy than forcing a man like you to lick my shoes, *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*kakaka{0}ka{0}ka{0}ka{0}ka{0}ka{0}kakaka!!"`
`.........Damn iiiiiiiiit...`
` It's no good, no good, no good...`
`{n}So I can't win against the witch...?!`
`This isn't chess at all—I've just been made to take the losing side in a chess problem...!`
` Is quibbling about details and getting a draw the best I can do...?`
`"That definitely will not happen...!`
` Either I will surrender, or you will surrender!!`
` There will be no resolution other than those!!`
` What happened to that bravery when you said this would be torture for us both?!"`
`"Wait wait wait wait, what a let down, this is quite disappointiiiiiiing!`
` Ushiromiya Battleeeeeeeeeeer...????"`
`Damn iiiiiiiiiiiit, what should I do, what?!!`
` I can see it, I can see myself facing checkmate...!!`
`Aaaaaaaaah, it's no good, it's no good, all of my hard‐fought moves are nothing more than desperately moving my king, running away from check.`
` ......No matter how many times I move, I can't escape from being checked.`
` So even without waiting for the next several moves, I can see mate in my future!!`
` Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh, damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit.........!!`
`.........After a few more moves, ......I see myself being......checkmated......?`
`.................................`
`......Don't give up, Ushiromiya Battler.`
`{n}If I can see myself getting closed in upon...`
`......Then if I flip over the chessboard......I can anticipate the next move, right...?`
`Kyrie‐san told me...`
` When considering something, the closer you get to the very, very end, ......the easier it becomes to anticipate.`
`Flip it over.`
`{n}......Flip over...the chessboard...!!`
`"......................................................"`
`"......What's wrong?`
` You've gone silent all of a sudden.`
` Don't worry.`
` Surrender is but a momentary shame.`
` After that, there is only the pleasure of letting it all go..."`
`"......*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!`
` Come, cry out your resignation.`
` .........I can't hear you...`
` Speak clearly in a loud voice."`
`".............You oughta wake up, then.`
` You just aren't listening.`
` ...So I'll say it once more.`
` ......I won't resign.`
` ......We're continuing.`
` I'm resuming the game."`
`"...............Hoh.`
` Very well.`
` It is your turn.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*."`
`"I was making the mistake of thinking that this rule you made was your own weapon.`
` ......However, I've realized that it can also become a weapon for me.`
` ............It all comes down to this."`
`"Try it."`
`"I've spent the whole time focused on how they entered the locked room of the chapel...`
` .........That way of thinking was no good."`
`"......Yeah, it's no good, it's no goddamn good at all.`
` ......Flip over the chessboard."`
`".........That's right.`
` The direction of my thinking was backwards.`
` ......This is how I should think.`
` ............How was the chapel, which wasn't a locked room in the first place, made to look like a locked room?"`
`"Here it is.`
` ......The thinking technique that humans gave birth to a century ago.`
` Give it a try, *cackle*cackle*!!"`
`"...Say this in red for me.`
` If it's impossible, then decline.`
` ...Here I go."`
`......This man, ......he thinks he has turned away from his defensive posture?`
`{n}Impudent...`
`"I understand that the only way to enter the chapel is through the door, and that there was only one key.`
` .........But hold it right there.`
` ...Was that key really handed over to Maria yesterday before noon?"`
`".........Long‐winded.`
` Summarize it."`
`"It's something like this.`
` ...We've been under the impression that since midday yesterday, the key was unusable.`
` Therefore, we've been under the impression that this was a locked room from midday yesterday until this morning!"`
`"I want you to clearly state that this isn't just an impression, but a fact."`
`"Interesting.`
` ......So you reason not about the door, but the key."`
`"Yesterday, Maria received an envelope from you.`
` Maria didn't open it, but she might have felt it and learned there was a key inside.`
` ......But it's not as if she could have checked it was definitely the key to the chapel."`
`".........So this is what I'm getting at.`
` ......The envelope that was handed to Maria contained a fake."`
`"...I waited all that time for that nonsense?`
` {p:1:This morning, Rosa definitely took an envelope out of Maria's handbag,}`
` {p:1:and from that obtained the genuine key to the chapel}.`
` ...It wasn't a fake, as you say."`
`"Heheh...`
` I know that much.`
` I'll continue."`
`"......So, when Maria received the envelope, inside it, was there definitely that same key to the chapel?"`
`".................................`
` .........Hoh."`
`"What I mean is basically this.`
` ......Midday yesterday, you gave Maria an envelope with a key inside.`
` And you told her that she mustn't open it.`
` .........Maria probably realized that there was a key inside."`
`"And because later on, Auntie Rosa used what was inside the envelope to open the door to the chapel,`
` {i:we thought that was the key to the chapel}.`
` This is the suspicious part!"`
`"........................So is this what you are trying to say?`
` That when I entrusted Maria with a key, that key was a fake?`
` And then, by the time Rosa obtained it, it had been switched with the real thing...?"`
`"Yeah, that's it.`
` ......What's wrong, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama?`
` Looks like you haven't been feeling good for a while...?"`
`"......Those close to me sometimes call me Beato.`
` Beato is fine."`
`"It's your turn, Beato."`
`"<Turn of the golden witch!>`
` ......Show me how you defeat that."`
`"............Very well.`
` ...{p:1:The key to the chapel truly was the object inside the envelope I gave Maria}."`
`"I'll chase you.`
` ......Can you repeat it in red?`
` ......‘That envelope was completely under Maria's supervision until Auntie Rosa opened it’."`
`".........................................."`
`"...If it's impossible, then state that you decline.`
` Check."`
`"............kh, ...............I decline."`
`"Now the one‐turn advantage has flipped over.`
` ...Now it's time for your king to run, Beato."`
`"......Ehh, I have a reason for declining.`
` That is regarding the definition of the phrase "under her supervision".`
` ...In its purest meaning, Maria would need to have her eyes on it around the clock."`
`"...But Maria didn't go that far.`
` It was probably completely under her supervision during the time she had it outside of her handbag, but after she put it into her handbag, it disappeared from her field of vision.`
` ......It's just that the phrase "under her supervision" is inappropriate in that sense, so I couldn't use red.`
` ...........................kh..."`
`"......That was probably a painful move.`
` Your face tells me that you've guessed the next one."`
`"...............Sorry.`
` I'm gentle with women.`
` I don't hurt women.`
` {i:I don't betray a woman's expectations}!"`
`".........Repeat it for me in red—say it if you can.`
` "No one was able to touch Maria's handbag until Auntie Rosa took out the envelope"."`
`"........................I will also......decline this.`
` ...I won't explain the reason."`
`"That's wrong.`
` ......It's not that you won't explain.`
` You can't explain.`
` .........With that move, it's checkmate, isn't it...?"`
`".................................kh..."`
`"If you can't do it, then I'll explain for you.`
` .........The key to the chapel really was in the envelope that you handed to Maria.`
` ...Then Maria put it in her handbag, and the next morning, Auntie Rosa took it out and opened the lock."`
`"............However!`
` Maria didn't have the handbag under her complete supervision!`
` There's no need for magic.`
` It's a locked room trick that's possible for a human!"`
`"The {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} culprit handed Maria the key,`
` and by making Auntie Rosa use it the next morning, they created the illusion that there was a locked room during that time."`
`"You can't deny the possibility that during that time, the culprit took the key from Maria's handbag, used it,`
` and returned it to the handbag by morning!!"`
`"Can you say it in red?!"`
`"Repetition requested—say it if you can!!`
` It's check again!!!"`
`"H‐......hold on.`
` I'll remove the check...`
` ...The envelope with the key in it should have been sealed with wax...!`
` Rosa took it from an unopened envelope—"`
`"Really! Let's hear it, then!!"`
`"Repetition requested!!`
` "The envelope handed over midday yesterday and the envelope that Auntie Rosa opened are the same thing"."`
`"Th‐that I can repeat.`
` {p:1:The envelope I handed over to Maria and the one Rosa opened are the same thing}!!"`
`"......Haah...!`
` ...Aaaaah, that's no good, that's no goddamn good at all.`
` Who even cares about that anymore?"`
`"...I had expectations for you.`
` ......If you had resigned here, I would have thought of you as someone pretty good at reading between the lines.`
` ......So I'm disappointed.`
` ............{i:You've betrayed my expectations}."`
`"Wh‐............wha......aat.........!!"`
`"It isn't important whether the envelopes are the same thing.`
` ......Because envelopes can be sealed with wax over and over!`
` The key inside should be the important thing."`
`"...kh.....................kuuuuuuu........."`
`"This time, it's all over, Golden Witch.`
` It's a real checkmate.`
` ......I'll ask one more time, repetition requested!!`
` Say it if you can!"`
`"‘The key to the chapel inside the envelope Maria received wasn't used even once until Auntie Rosa opened the envelope’!!"`
`"..................h...`
`............kh...`
`...............how...`
`............!`
` How.........`
`c‐`
`......could I.........`
`to a lowly human.........!!"`
`"I'll keep on saying it, {f:5:Beatrice}!!!"`
`"Repetition requested!!`
` "The key to the chapel inside the envelope Maria received wasn't used even once until Auntie Rosa opened the envelope"!!"`
`"......u...ku......ooooooooooooooooooooooooooohhh!!!"`
`"If you're gonna yell, then make it words—<resign>, right?!`
` It's settled!!`
` This is the truth."`
`"Before Auntie Rosa obtained Maria's key this morning, at one point, it passed into someone else's hands."`
`"Then they used it, resealed it, and returned it to Maria's handbag, making it look like it hadn't been used!"`
`"This is a trick with a cheap loophole: the assumption that the key wasn't used because the sealing wax wasn't broken!!"`
`"Checkmate!!`
` There's no magic, it's nothing more than a trick that's possible for humans!!"`
`"In, in that case... Who do you say stole the key?!`
` Try answering!`
` This time, you try repeating it...!!"`
`"That's right, I'm making you repeat things all the time.`
` I probably have to answer myself every once in a while......"`
`"{i:But I refuse}!!`
` My condition for victory is denying the existence of witches.`
` Once I've proven that your impossible crimes by magic are possible by human hands, I'm done!!"`
`"I've smashed your locked room with something possible even for humans.`
` However, I won't specifically investigate who the culprit is."`
`"And that is because I believe in humans!!`
` Because I definitely won't accept that there's a person among us who would steal the key from Maria, use it, and do something so horrible!!"`
`"Heh, hehehehehhahahahahahahaha!!!`
` I give up, I resign!`
` With regard to this one board in particular, I'll give up for now.`
` ...But, you really are naive, Battler."`
`"Parting remarks are the loser's privilege.`
` Enjoy them as much as you want."`
`"......kh...!`
` As long as you continue to deny my existence, you will eventually be cornered..."`
`"After all, as long as you deny me, you will have to suspect those relatives that you have no end of love for...!`
` In the last moment, when you have to suspect one who is beloved to you, then you will definitely accept my existence...!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*, certainly, you have taken this board.`
` ......However, that naive logic will definitely destroy you...`
` ......You can't win against me after all!!`
` Ushiromiya Battleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeer!!"``...Rosa and the rest returned from the chapel to the parlor in the mansion.`
`{n}Such a horrific thing had happened so early in the morning.`
`{n}Of course they were high‐strung...`
`Battler and George—who had cried, raged, and let their emotions explode after seeing their parents' tragic bodies—`
`returned to the parlor, sat on the sofas, and let their minds go blank, as though everything up until then had been a lie...`
`Only Maria was completely unchanged, and looked just like normal.`
`......When she wasn't being mischievous, she was basically a kid who played wordlessly by herself,`
` so even if her mind was blank, she would probably look as she did.`
`...But as she turned on the TV and flipped through the channels, it looked as though nothing about her had changed from normal.`
`Perhaps Rosa had some opinions about this attitude, which was clearly different from normal people.`
`......She stared at Maria's back with a gaze that wasn't quite pleasant.`
`Eventually, Kumasawa came to say good morning.`
` ...Her cheerful manner was clearly out of place, and she couldn't help but be bewildered at the strange atmosphere in the room.`
`......Then, she heard the details from Gohda, and expressed her shock in a truly noisy manner.`
`"O‐o‐o‐of course you've contacted the police, right...?!`
` What should we do in a time like this, oooh, what should we do...?!"`
`".........Please listen calmly.`
` ...It seems that some kind of apparatus was done in by lightning last night.`
` Because of that, we have become unable to use the telephones..."`
`"Huuuh?!!`
` Th‐then, until the typhoon passes, we can't even contact the police?!"`
`Maybe Kumasawa's exaggerated surprise was a little comical.`
`Rosa giggled, in spite of the situation.`
`......Because of that, the fog of confusion that had covered her head cleared up a little.`
`".........I've got to stay strong.`
` ......It's not just Maria.`
` ......I'm acting as a parent for George‐kun and Battler‐kun too now, so I have to stay strong......"`
`Rosa had been the youngest sibling, with a large difference in age between her and the others.`
`{n}So she was always treated as a child.`
`Every time she learned something new, it was something obvious to her brothers and sister,`
` and she had grown a complex, thinking that she must be incompetent.`
`So she had formed a passive attitude, asking her brothers and sister for advice every time something happened...`
`.........But she no longer had any brothers or sisters.`
`{n}Now, Rosa was the only one of the four Ushiromiya siblings left.`
`...Furthermore, if Kinzo continued to shut himself away even in this extraordinary situation,`
` ......Rosa would have to surpass this crisis as the representative of the head.`
`"...............I'm not a child anymore, not a child.`
` ................................."`
`...Rosa slapped her knees lightly and stood up.`
`She must not wait for orders now.`
`{n}...She had to start moving herself.`
`She picked up the receiver to the extension phone on the side table.`
`{n}......Then she immediately remembered that the telephones were out of order.`
`Genji and Shannon, who she had sent to see Kinzo, hadn't returned yet.`
`...She had a general guess.`
` He was probably yelling about something nonsensical again, and they were unable to calm him.`
`...His important chapel had been defiled with blood.`
`{n}That was easy to imagine.`
`She had planned on using the extension phone to call the study, but with the telephone line dead, there was nothing else for it.`
`Rosa decided to go to the study directly, with her own two feet.`
`Her old self would have been so frightened that she wouldn't have been able to go see Kinzo.`
`...And in fact, if she did meet him, she would probably be blamed for something and abused.`
`But now wasn't the time to be frightened.`
` .........As his true daughter, she had to make him aware of the current situation.`
`"......Kumasawa‐san,`
` I'm going to see Father.`
` ...Take special care of George‐kun and Battler‐kun.`
` ......I'm sure they are on edge right now."`
`"Yes, yes...`
` I am quite sure they must be...`
` ...It is truly pitiable...`
` I shall make them something warm to drink."`
`"Thank you."`
`Rosa went out into the hallway, and headed towards Kinzo's study.`
`The atmosphere in this mansion, which she had spent her younger days in and should have been full of memories, seemed somehow different...`
`And she began to climb the stairs in the entrance hall...`
`......Just then.`
` In the gloom down the stairs behind Rosa, ...something glowed.`
`It was a single fluttering gold butterfly.`
`{n}...It fluttered around and sparkled.`
`{n}That butterfly quietly danced without a sound.`
`......Obviously.`
` No one can hear the sound of a butterfly's wings beating.`
`.........And then, ......it stopped on Rosa's back as she slowly climbed the stairs.`
`Rosa didn't notice.`
` And to an ignorant observer, it would probably have looked just as though a single sheet of gold leaf in the shape of a butterfly had gotten stuck there.`
`Without noticing, Rosa continued heading to Kinzo's study......`
`".........Wellll then, in what way should I entertain myself next?`
` ...There are still many, many pieces left.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!"`
`In the parlor, which had returned to silence, the only sound was that of the TV, which Maria was watching alone.`
`If there was anything audible other than that, it was the sound of the rain which had continued on and on since last night.`
`Every one of those people who had viewed that unearthly and horrible scene stayed silent, as though praying that the events of this morning were all a dream.`
`Only Kumasawa hadn't seen it, and so acted slightly differently.`
`...She instead found this silence difficult to bear, and was fidgety with the desire to cheer everyone up.`
`...However, unable to say more than she should, it seemed that she was racking her brains as to how she could be of some use...`
`Normally it would be time for breakfast.`
` ......However, maybe because something like that had happened, Gohda seemed to have forgotten about preparing a meal.`
`...No, maybe everyone was so beaten up that they had forgotten their hunger.`
`Kumasawa wanted to bring up the subject of what they would do for breakfast, but it didn't seem like the right atmosphere, so she really couldn't.`
`But it was difficult being hungry.`
`{n}...So, she casually made a proposal.`
`"...I imagine you all must be tired after all that has happened.`
` ......In times like this, I think the best thing is to heat yourself with some warm black tea."`
`"......Mm, that is a good plan.`
` I agree as well."`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho.`
` How about some delicious black tea with biscuits and jam?`
` Oh yes, yes, it seems that it's near Halloween—there were some delicious‐looking pumpkin‐shaped cookies on the shelf..."`
`"......Ah, Kumasawa‐san, that's........."`
`Of course, she had said the wrong thing.`
` ...Because she had reminded Battler and the rest about that horrible and tragic Halloween party in the chapel...`
`Nanjo hurriedly whispered into Kumasawa's ear.`
`".........................................."`
`"......Battler‐san, I am truly sorry!`
` ...I didn't mean anything bad, gracious, no..."`
`"No, don't worry about it.`
` .........I'll definitely turn this boiling anger back on the culprit."`
`".........I wonder if that culprit is still on the island."`
`"Probably.`
` After all, there's not gonna be a boat coming until the typhoon passes."`
`"Ye‐...yes, my goodness!`
` Because the boats don't come even if there is a little wind.`
` They certainly wouldn't be able to ride one during a typhoon, good gracious no!"`
`"......It creeps me out."`
`"You think so too, Aniki?`
` Me too.`
` .........Regardless of whether the culprit was that mystery guest or not."`
`"That's right.`
` ......We are naturally suspecting the mysterious guest who calls herself {f:5:Beatrice},`
` but we still cannot be sure that she is the culprit.`
` ...There is still the possibility she's a {i:victim whose corpse still hasn't been found}."`
`"......When I think of it that way, there's something I just can't understand."`
`"What do you......mean by that......?"`
`"It's simple.`
` It's just like Kumasawa baa‐chan said a short while ago.`
` Right now, this island is right in the midst of the typhoon, and escape is impossible.`
` The same thing goes for the culprit.`
` .........In that case, having the crime come to light should have been the thing that the culprit most wanted to avoid."`
`"......That's right.`
` ...There was no need to draw that creepy magic circle on the entrance to the chapel, and show off the fact that the corpses were there."`
`"Right, exactly that.`
` Furthermore, if they were able to take the time and effort to do something so horrible to those six,`
` ......it should have been equally possible for them to hide the six corpses where they would be impossible to find."`
`"I agree. That brutal Halloween party probably wasn't directed at those who died.`
` ......It was directed at the people who would eventually discover it: us.`
` You could probably claim that the magic circle was there to show it to us."`
`"...The culprit knew that they wouldn't be able to get away from this island for a while.`
` ......And yet, they acted as though they wanted to make us find the corpses in the middle of this typhoon."`
`"......What...does this mean?`
` ...If I was the culprit, I definitely wouldn't play around and make us find the corpses."`
`"............{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama was not in her room.`
` ...The room did not seem particularly disturbed.`
` ......Ah, no, Milady did disturb it quite a lot though..."`
`"...Come to think of it, what happened to Jessica?"`
`"Kanon‐san is looking after her.`
` ...They are probably in Milady's room."`
`"............That isn't good.`
` ...The culprit is definitely still on the island.`
` ......In this situation, I don't believe it's a very good idea to isolate ourselves in small numbers."`
`"Wh‐what do you mean by that...?`
` Y‐y‐you don't mean to say that the culprit plans to kill all of us...?!`
` Awawa{0}wa{0}wa{0}wa{0}wawawa..."`
`"Let us remain calm...`
` That is not yet certain..."`
`"But we can't deny the possibility, much to my chagrin. Ihihi."`
`"......This letter was in the chapel.`
` According to this, the culprit is the witch,`
` and if we don't solve the riddle of Grandfather's epitaph and find the gold, she'll massacre the whole family...or something like that."`
`"Is that true...!`
` Umm, would you allow me to read it as well...?"`
`"Hii...{0}hi...{0}hi...{0}hieee{0}e{0}e{0}e{0}e{0}e{0}e{0}e{0}e{0}e{0}e{0}e{0}e{0}e{0}eeee...{0}eeee{0}e{0}e{0}eeee...{0}hh..."`
`"......mmmmmmmgh......"`
`As they read the witch's letter, Gohda, Kumasawa, and Nanjo's faces grew even paler than they had been...`
`Kumasawa could no longer hide her shaking.`
`".........If you don't want to die, try finding Grandfather's hidden gold, huh.`
` ...Screwing around with us.`
` I'll bet you can't solve the riddle, so you're trying to make us solve it...!"`
`"However, ...I wonder what the truth is.`
` Madam always insisted that the Legend of the Gold was nothing more than a fantasy created by the Master.`
` ......It is doubtful whether that actually existed..."`
`"True...`
` Supposedly, they thought it would be nice if it existed, but only somewhat believed it.`
` ......The relatives only all started believing in the Legend of the Gold after Kinzo's health worsened and the inheritance problem came up.`
` I would think that there were very few people who believed it before then."`
`"...Really? I wonder if that's why.`
` Do you remember?`
` On the table in the chapel.`
` ...There were three gold ingots.`
` That alone is worth quite a lot.`
` Couldn't that truly prove that the Legend of the Gold was real?"`
`"E‐...excuse me, ...please wait.`
` Just now, did you say three gold bars......?"`
`"......Yeah, there were definitely three of them piled up.`
` So what?"`
`"Well, umm, I, .........happened to hear Krauss‐sama talking about it once.`
` ......Yes, I just heard it, you understand?!`
` It's not like I was trying to listen to his discussions in secret, gracious no!"`
`"Don't worry about that now.`
` So then what?`
` Is there something wrong with there being three of those gold bars?"`
`"...Y‐yes.`
` According to Krauss‐sama, ...there was only one bar ever found to support the Legend of the Gold."`
`"......That is correct.`
` I do believe the story goes that Kinzo‐san showed the president of Marusoo a mountain of gold, and let him take one bar back with him."`
`"And that one came to be in Krauss‐sama's possession.`
` And he said this as well.`
` That there was no gold which supported the Master's legend besides that one..."`
`"You're talking about my uncle here, right?`
` So what have we got here?`
` ......No wait, ......three?!`
` Wait, wait, where did they come from, that's too many of them!"`
`"Might we not think of it this way?`
` Maybe the other people in the family each found one, and they each brought one of them there..."`
`"No, I cannot believe that.`
` When all of the relatives came to the mansion, I was entrusted with their luggage.`
` I did not feel any suspicious weight back then."`
`"......I think they weighed about ten kilograms.`
` If that much weight was in their bags, even I would notice.`
` But it didn't seem that way."`
`"Same here.`
` At the most, there were some changes of clothes, medicine, Kyrie‐san's makeup.`
` That's about it, I think.`
` Auntie Rosa's luggage also looked pretty light."`
`"......In that case, those three piled up gold bars were being shown to them, ...or maybe us.`
` ......Telling us that the Legend of the Gold is definitely real.`
` That it isn't a fantasy.`
` And challenging us to uncover it."`
`"Could there be a scheme...to have us solve the epitaph which points to the hidden location, and then try to snatch it away?"`
`"............That does fit best.`
` ...But there are a few parts that don't make sense.`
` First, our parents, who should have been the most likely to be able to solve the epitaph, were killed first.`
` I think that creates an immediate contradiction."`
`".........And something else makes even less sense.`
` ......They're trying to say that the Legend of the Gold is actually true,`
` {i:but how could they prepare that gold}?`
` ......It's almost like the culprit has already found the gold,`
` and is telling us to try and find it too."`
`"Maybe the culprit obtained those three like Uncle Krauss and thereby became certain about the Legend of the Gold,`
` and is trying to make us search for the rest... I think that way is the most convincing."`
`"...........................`
` ......The pieces on the chessboard aren't lining up at all.`
` ............We don't have a clue what the culprit is planning, what they want, what they want to make us do.`
` ............Is it pointless?`
` Thinking about anything, at this point in time.`
` ..........................."`
`"......Kihihi.`
` It was written down.`
` What she wants you to do.`
` Can't any of you read? Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi."`
`Maria suddenly laughed in a creepy voice.`
`...I'd thought she'd been concentrating on the TV, but she'd been listening in too, apparently.`
`As she remained facing the TV, ...she very simply told us what we were forgetting.`
`"{f:5:Beatrice} hasn't said one word about wanting the gold.`
` ......She's not asked anything except whether you can solve the epitaph's riddle or not."`
`"...Although I bet she thinks it'll be impossible for you anyway.`
` ......Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi."`
`"......So you're saying you can solve it, Maria?"`
`"...Don't caaare.`
` She's going to take me to the Golden Land, so.`
` Won't get in {f:5:Beatrice}'s way.`
` Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi,`
` ouch."`
`"Looks like if we wanna understand further, we're gonna have to ask Maria.`
` ...Maria, tell us.`
` ...............Who is this {f:5:Beatrice}?`
` What is she planning?"`
`"Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi!`
` Well, you see, {f:5:Beatrice} is a witch!`
` She can do anything with her wondrous powers."`
`"Anything can be done with the power of magic.`
` You can create gold, you can create bread.`
` And of course, you can even create sweets!`
` You saw it, didn't you?`
` Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi!"`
`"......hn?"`
`At that time, everyone jumped at the sound of a door being closed forcefully.`
`We turned around to find that at some point Rosa had returned, bringing Genji and Shannon.`
`......Then she rapidly approached Maria, her heels clacking, and hit her sharply on the cheek.`
`"......Stop talking about that.`
` Battler‐kun and the rest will take it badly."`
`"..................Uu..."`
`Without waiting for a response, she slapped Maria's cheek once more.`
`{n}Everyone could only stand there, shocked.`
`"I don't know what "uu" means.`
` What about yes?"`
`"...............Uu."`
`She mercilessly slapped Maria's cheek again.`
`......Maybe she didn't feel like resisting after being hit twice.`
`Maria weakly said yes.`
`"Ro‐......Rosa‐san, there was no reason to do something so harsh..."`
`"...This is my daughter's education.`
` I would greatly appreciate it if you didn't interject."`
`The atmosphere around Rosa, with Genji and Shannon in tow, was somehow cold, and yet dignified,`
` ...completely different from how she seemed before she left.`
`We saw that Auntie Rosa was holding something that looked like a gun.`
`{n}......I couldn't imagine that she would have brought back a toy in this situation.`
`"Auntie Rosa, what is...?"`
`"......This is Father's.`
` Because of the current situation, I borrowed it specially.`
` .........I'm sure you all realize as well as I do.`
` The culprit is still nearby.`
` We don't know what could happen."`
`"...............I agree.`
` ......Rather than trying to figure out what the culprit is planning, it might be better to first think about our own safety."`
`"..........................."`
`"Father was alright, but he was slightly agitated by these sudden events.`
` ...Fortunately, he said that he won't leave his room, so he's probably safe.`
` Now, we should do all we can to gather in the same place."`
`"...I agree.`
` We don't even know where the culprit is hiding, ......and anyway, there's no proof that there's only one of them.`
` ..............."`
`I shivered at the words that had come out of my own mouth.`
`That's right.`
` Could a single person kill six people and create such a horrible scene all alone?`
`......Isn't it natural to assume that this crime was carried out by multiple culprits?`
`"......I agree with Rosa‐san.`
` It is probably good for us to gather in one place."`
`"My goodness, yes, I also think that is good, yes, yes!"`
`".........Maybe it would be good to call Milady and Kanon‐san here already."`
`"Good idea.`
` ......Let's have them come down."`
`George‐aniki made to grab the extension phone, but Gohda‐san shook his head.`
`......Oh, right, we can't use the phones right now.`
`"......I'll go with a couple people.`
` If George‐aniki and Gohda‐san come as well, that should be enough."`
`"............No.`
` Let's all go together.`
` ...It's a "Wolves and Sheep Puzzle".`
` {i:If we're all gathered together here in equilibrium}, that situation is the most safe."`
`"...‘Wolves and Sheep Puzzle’?"`
`"......Uu.`
` I have it.`
` Show you."`
`"Maria, turn off the television.`
` ......Genji‐san.`
` Please tell me where Jessica‐chan's room is.`
` Let's all go together."`
`"......Yes.`
` I will guide you."`
`"Come on, everyone.`
` We'll move together.`
` Follow my instructions."`
`We stood up.`
` Maria alone looked like she had some lingering attachment to the TV, but she went along with everyone for now, and got up.`
`"...Shannon, thank goodness.`
` I was a little worried when you took so long to get back."`
`"I am sorry to have worried you.`
` The Master ordered me to copy down something..."`
`"Copy down?"`
`"............Shannon."`
`"I, .........I am sorry, excuse me..."`
`We headed for Jessica's room, led by Genji‐san, and Auntie Rosa, holding the gun.`
`Jessica and Kanon‐kun are a girl and boy of about the same age.`
` That'd sure be a shame if we walked in on them at a bad tiiime, is what I'd have joked about normally, I'm sure.`
`However, Auntie Rosa was on edge, constantly exuding tension.`
` ...So it really wasn't the kind of atmosphere where I could joke like that.`
`"Hey, don't fall behind!!`
` Everyone move together!`
` We don't know when or where the culprit might leap out at us, you know?!"`
`...No, maybe Auntie Rosa's attitude was more appropriate.`
`{n}......Since Grandfather hadn't come down, Auntie Rosa was the leader.`
`This wasn't a situation where she could smile like she always did.`
`......And Auntie Rosa was herself a mother.`
` She probably also thought that, if she didn't get ahold of herself, some harm might befall her beloved daughter.`
`The culprit had killed six of our parents at once.`
`{n}......The method they had used was unknown, but there was a good chance that this opponent could take down a large number of people in an instant.`
`Was that with weapons, or with numbers?`
`{n}......Or was it the magic of a witch?`
`In any case, it definitely didn't look like there were any factors indicating we could get careless...`
`The rest of us should also take much, much greater care, like Auntie Rosa...`
`"............Everyone, stop!"`
`Auntie Rosa spoke in a sharp voice.`
`When we peered forwards, wondering what was up...`
`{n}......we immediately noticed the reason...`
`".........Wh‐......what is this......"`
`"Hii...............!"`
`"Everyone, get back...!"`
`Gohda‐san and Genji‐san approached the door...`
`{n}Jessica's room was probably on the other side of that door.`
`"This......seems to be the same paint that was scribbled on the door to the chapel."`
`"......It appears so.`
` It appears that not much time has passed since it was drawn."`
`"What is that......`
` ......Another...magic circle?!"`
`"......It's the first magic circle of the moon.`
` ...It has the power to open unopenable doors."`
`The door to Jessica's room......had that creepy graffiti on it which had been drawn on the door to the chapel.`
`......That strange shape definitely had some meaning related to the occult.`
`But it didn't matter what that meaning was.`
`{n}We were more worried about whether those two were alright.`
`"Tha‐that doesn't matter!`
` Are Jessica‐chan and Kanon‐kun alright?!"`
`"...I have a bad premonition...`
` We should quickly take those two downstairs."`
`"Milady!`
` Milady!!`
` Are you there?`
` Please answer!!"`
`Gohda‐san knocked violently and yelled, ...but there was no answer.`
`He twisted the doorknob with a clatter, but the lock just resisted him.`
`"......Rosa‐sama, it seems to be locked."`
`"There are no other options.`
` Please open it."`
`Genji nodded, and Gohda quickly unlocked the door with the master key.`
`...In the back of my mind, horrible images floated up and disappeared, one after another.`
`{n}......A magic circle had been drawn on the door to the chapel.`
`{n}And six corpses had been behind that.`
`......So, if there was a magic circle drawn on the door to Jessica's room, ......then beyond it............`
`"Je‐............Jessica‐sama!!"`
`"Wh‐what happened?`
` Is she there?!"`
`"Jessica!!`
` What happened?!!"`
`......It was truly heartless.`
`...The expression on Gohda‐san's face and what he said when he opened the door...`
`prepared us for the brutal fate that Jessica might have met, even without seeing her...`
`Everyone tumbled into Jessica's room at once.`
`{n}...That scene told everyone that their worst fears were right on the mark...`
`"...Jessicaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!"`
`".........Oh......my......`
` ...Doc‐...Doctor Nanjo!!"`
`The room seemed elegant for Jessica's age, and there she was inside it, lying on the ground.`
`There was a large pool of blood on the floor.`
`......And there was a knife or something sticking deep into her back......`
`...Was it a knife?`
` There was a design in the handle that had to have been done in a devil motif.`
`There was no doubt that this weapon(?) carried some kind of occult meaning.`
`"...This is.........horrible.`
` ...She has passed away.`
` ......This...probably...reaches her lungs...`
` ......Not much time has passed since she died."`
`"Jessicaaaaaaaaaaaa!!`
` Damn it, damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit!!"`
`"......B‐Battler‐sama......"`
`"I was naive!!`
` I knew it!!`
` Since they couldn't escape the island, the culprit was definitely close by!`
` Then why wasn't I on my guard straight away!!`
` ......I was naive!!`
` I just assumed that culprits sneak away after they commit a crime!"`
`"......We were stunned then.`
` We thought we just had to accept it when Jessica‐chan gave in to rage and ran off.`
` ......But we were naive.`
` We should have stopped her...!"`
`"...Gohda‐san, why did you leave those two alone?!`
` If only you had been with them, something like this would never...!!"`
`"N‐no, you, you see, I...!!`
` I said it was dangerous so we should return!`
` It's just that...Milady said that she wanted to be alone!`
` Kanon‐san told me to leave it to him, and...!"`
`"......Speaking of which, where is Kanon‐san...?!"`
`"That's right!`
` What in the world happened to Kanon‐kun?!"`
`"K‐......Kanon‐kun...`
` Where........."`
`"Kanon‐san should have been with Milady...`
` Where in the world...!"`
`"You don't think...they got him...?!"`
`".......................................`
` Quiet.`
` .........Someone might be hiding in this room.`
` Search under the bed and in the closet!"`
`There was also a chance that Kanon‐kun's corpse had been pushed away somewhere.`
`At Rosa‐san's order, everyone searched the room together.`
`......But there wasn't a single human hiding anywhere.`
`"......He's nowhere!!`
` Could the culprit have taken him out of the room?!`
` Then we have to search for him quickly and save him!`
` ......If we're slow, something awful might happen!!"`
`"Auntie Rosa, let's search all over the mansion!`
` Let's search for the culprit!`
` Let's save Kanon‐kun!!"`
`"........................`
` ............Quiet!!!"`
`Auntie Rosa yelled at us loudly, and we fell instantly silent.`
`She was probably contemplating something.`
`{n}...But what in the world could that be......?`
`...Auntie Rosa walked around the room as though looking for something, ...or as though she was collecting her thoughts.`
`............Then, she found something on the side table by the bed, and picked it up.`
`"...............If anyone knows, tell me.`
` ......What key is this?"`
`Auntie Rosa showed everyone a key with a cute mascot attached to it.`
`...Judging from its cute appearance, I didn't doubt that it was Jessica's key, but I had no way of knowing what key it was.`
`"......It is probably the key to this—to Milady's room."`
`After hearing that, Auntie Rosa made a point of going outside the door and checking.`
`.........Without a doubt, it was the key to this room.`
`"............I wonder why it was set in a place like this.`
` Normally, don't you keep important keys in your pocket?"`
`"...Umm, ............Milady wasn't in the habit of locking her room.`
` Except for when she went to school—`
`it seems she would do it then, because she didn't want Krauss‐sama to look inside her room..."`
`".........I see.`
` She wasn't at school, so it's natural that Jessica‐chan would set the key down here.`
` How many keys can open this door?"`
`"Ju‐...just the one Milady had..."`
`"Can't it be opened with your master keys?"`
`"......They can open it."`
`"How many master keys are there?`
` Do all of the servants have one?`
` Are there extras?"`
`"Yes.`
` We all have one.`
` .........As for extras, ...I wonder."`
`"There used to be several, ...but Madam strongly scolded us that this was careless, so I believe they have been dealt with."`
`"......That is correct.`
` There is only one held by each servant.`
` There are no more."`
`"...nn?`
` Wait a second.`
` ...In the last game, I thought we said there were extra master keys?"`
`"Yes.`
` Regarding that.`
` I have noticed that having several master keys whose locations are unknown is quite disadvantageous for me."`
`"......Well, yeah.`
` Since you want to make me believe in magic by using locked rooms, it must be really disadvantageous for you to have master keys unaccounted for."`
`"...In fact, every time a trick related to locks showed up,`
` I was planning to resist by arguing that the culprit possessed a master key that someone had lost in the past, or a duplicate."`
`"Yes, exactly.`
` So I've decided to make a move to defeat that.`
` ......I'll alter the setup."`
`"`
`{p:1:The only master keys are the ones held by the servants, one key each}.`
` *cackle*cackle*."`
`"...Messing with me.`
` ......More importantly.`
` What is this move?`
` ......What's Auntie Rosa saying?"`
`"*cackle*cackle*.`
` Who knows?`
` You should try listening in."`
`"...............Thank you.`
` I have the situation sorted out."`
`"......And I've managed to identify the culprit who assaulted Jessica‐chan, or maybe one of their accomplices."`
`"Wha‐what did you say...?!`
` Who is that?!"`
`"...Auntie Rosa, you can't be talking about Kanon‐kun...?"`
`"......Huh, ......huuuh?!`
` Wh‐why Kanon‐kun?!"`
`"This room was locked.`
` And the only keys that can unlock this room are the master keys that each servant is holding, as well as the key Jessica had."`
`"......But Jessica‐chan's key was closed up in here.`
` ...Which means the only keys that could have locked it are the master keys."`
`"............It is as you say."`
`"In that case, someone killed Jessica‐chan, then locked the door!`
` That person was holding a master key.`
` And there are only five people who were holding master keys!"`
`"Oh, oh my!!`
` It wasn't me, not me!`
` Gracious, no, I couldn't do something like that!"`
`"......Kumasawa‐san, you got up late.`
` After we returned from the chapel to the parlor, we did meet you there,`
` but it's impossible to prove where you were and what you were doing until that time."`
`"You watched us from the shadows, chased after Jessica‐chan and Kanon‐kun when they were isolated, and stealthily attacked them."`
`"A‐are you saying that I visited Milady's room,`
` and did something so horrible?!`
` I, I, I did no such thing!`
` Gracious no, no such thing!!"`
`"What about you, Gohda‐san?`
` You said that you left Jessica‐chan in Kanon‐kun's care and returned."`
`"...But I wonder if that's true?`
` ......I wonder if you didn't really kill the two of them, hide Kanon‐kun's corpse,`
` and then come back with an innocent look on your face?!"`
`"Nothing of the sort happened!`
` I swear on my name that I did not do anything like that!!"`
`"......It, it wasn't us, either...!!`
` We were following the Master's orders and—"`
`"Yes.`
` At least you and Genji‐san are alright.`
` That is backed up by what I heard from Father.`
` The two of you were in Father's room the whole time, one copying and one standing witness.`
` Father and I can guarantee that."`
`".........Thank you very much."`
`"In that case, I think the argument becomes who is more suspicious, Gohda‐san or Kumasawa‐san.`
` ......That's how I thought, too, at least in the first moments after entering this room."`
`".........But then, I thought it was strange.`
` Look at the state of Jessica‐chan's body.`
` Don't you all think it's strange?"`
`"......Strange, ...you say...?"`
`"Jessica‐chan was stabbed in the back.`
` .........Come on, it's often generally said, right?`
` That in crimes where the victim is stabbed in the back, there's a high likelihood that the culprit was someone whose face was known to the victim.`
` She definitely wouldn't invite a person that she doesn't trust into her room, and defenselessly expose her back."`
`"Ro‐......Rosa‐sama, you couldn't mean...`
`.........to say that was Kanon‐kun...?"`
`"Yes.`
` We know well what state Jessica‐chan was in right before she was killed."`
`"......Jessica‐chan was very panicked after seeing her parents' tragic bodies.`
` And it's easy to imagine that after she regained her composure, she'd have been in a horrible slump."`
`"......I can really understand it if Jessica‐chan's frame of mind led her to shut herself up alone in her room.`
` And those particulars would also fit with Gohda‐san's story."`
`"......Jessica‐chan said to leave her alone.`
` ...Then Kanon‐kun, who is of a similar age, and may have had some adolescent relationship with her, said to leave it to him.`
` I can really understand why he'd feel that way."`
`".........And I think that is the very reason why Jessica‐chan welcomed Kanon‐kun into her room."`
`"But what if it had been Gohda‐san or Kumasawa‐san?`
` Would she have let them into her room?"`
`"......I, I believe that I have gained Milady's trust.`
` But even so, err..."`
`"Then you are another suspect after all, right, Gohda‐san?`
` I thought that you probably weren't liked by Jessica‐chan, so I believed she wouldn't have let you into her room."`
`"So I thought it was impossible that you were the culprit, but...?"`
`"No, umm...!`
` .........I am afraid to say that I may not have been accepted by Milady.`
` ...K‐Kumasawa‐san, what about you?"`
`"Ho, hohohohohoho!`
` A senior like me is far too separated by age to understand the feelings of a young person like Milady very well...`
` And perhaps Milady did not open her heart up to me.`
` Right, Gohda‐san?!"`
`"Yes, that's right!`
` She probably did not open her heart to us to a great degree!`
` It would be inconceivable that Milady would let us into her room when she was heartbroken!"`
`Gohda‐san and Kumasawa baa‐chan each clasped their hands together, affirming each other with forced smiles on their faces.`
`It was a really unpleasant routine.`
`"Someone who would be permitted to enter Jessica‐chan's room when she was heartbroken.`
` Who would have been given access to her defenseless back.`
` And that person had a master key.`
` That only points to one person.`
` ......It was impossible for anyone except Kanon‐kun."`
`"Ple‐......please, wait...!`
` Kanon‐kun definitely wouldn't do something like...!"`
`"Oh, then, is there someone else?`
` Is Gohda‐san or Kumasawa‐san suspicious after all?`
` Which of the two do you think is more suspicious, Shannon‐chan...? Come on."`
`"I, ......I, ...don't............"`
`"It wasn't me, Shannon‐san!`
` Gracious, no, it was not me!"`
`"Of course, it wasn't me either!`
` It was Kanon‐san who had a close relationship with Milady, and you, Shannon‐san, if anyone!"`
`".........Oh yes, I almost forgot.`
` ......Jessica‐chan might also have let Shannon‐chan into her room."`
`"But you should have been with Father.`
` .........But in reality,`
` ......are you the culprit...............?"`
`"Sha‐......Shannon can't be the culprit!`
` You only just said that she was doing some important work with Grandfather!"`
`"Yes, I know that.`
` Neither Shannon‐chan nor Genji‐san is the culprit.`
` Even Father acknowledges that they were together the whole time.`
` .........Well then, what do you think, everyone...?"`
`Asked that, no one could respond...`
`{n}Because even if someone did argue back, they would then have to offer the name of a different suspicious person.`
`......And no matter whose name that was, that person was here.`
`{n}...No one could do something like that.`
`Auntie Rosa glanced at everyone in turn, fingering the gun like it was a toy...`
`.........She seemed so different from the normal, kind Auntie Rosa.`
`...No, it's probably because I still don't feel how much danger we're in.`
`{n}...Maybe until Auntie Rosa's attitude seemed natural to me, I wasn't fully appreciating the danger...`
`"Looks like no one has an opinion.`
` Then I will say mine."`
`"Of course, I can't deny the possibility that Kanon‐kun is a victim without a corpse.`
` But until we find his corpse, I also definitely can't deny the possibility that Kanon‐kun is a suspect."`
`"......There's a chance that Kanon‐kun may claim to have been attacked by the culprit and confined somewhere...`
` He may appear unexpectedly with that excuse."`
`"But take care.`
` Maybe, probably—no, definitely.`
` .........{i:Kanon‐kun killed Jessica‐chan}."`
`"............No, ..................no way........."`
`"I, ...I can't believe it...`
` For Kanon‐kun to do that...`
`......to Milady,`
` ......that's too much to accept!!"`
`"I feel the same as Shannon.`
` I oppose labeling Kanon‐kun as the culprit."`
`"Then is the culprit Gohda‐san or is it Kumasawa‐san?`
` Tell me who's more suspicious."`
`""I‐i‐i‐it wasn't us!!""`
`"If it wasn't Kanon‐kun, then who could have locked this door?`
` Shannon‐chan.`
` George‐kun.`
` ......Well?`
` Well, well, well...?"`
`Auntie Rosa closed in on Shannon‐chan and George‐aniki, laughing unpleasantly.`
`...Of course, they couldn't say anything back.`
`They wanted to believe in Kanon‐kun.`
` ...But if they did, they would have to suspect the other servants.`
`The simplest culprit was the mystery guest {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`{n}......But she was nothing more than a guest, and didn't have a master key.`
`.........Then if {f:5:Beatrice} was the culprit without a master key...`
`...Do we have to accept the argument that she really is a witch, and locked the door with the power of magic......?`
`"............That's a filthy argument...`
` ......Filthy...... Filthy......"`
`"What's so difficult?`
` Make it my fault.`
` You can just make it the fault of the 19th person, the mystery guest, can you not?`
` If you do, you won't have to watch this ugly battle of humans pressing each other...`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`"So then what.`
` The culprit is the 19th person, the guest {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` ...She's a witch, so she could lock the door without a key using magic."`
`"Are you telling me to accept that?`
` No goddamn way...!`
` ...No way, no goddamn way...!!"`
`"......*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*.`
` In the last game, I learned all of your weak points.`
` So, what now, what now...?`
` You said you're never going to accept me, did you not?`
` In that case, .........you can use Kanon as a perfect sacrifice."`
`"Kanon killed Jessica!`
` If you support Rosa's theory, everything is settled here, you know?`
` Kanon is already dead.`
` There should be no need to show concern for the dead.`
` And you won't have to doubt anyone here!`
` *cackle*hahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!"`
`"Damn it!!`
` I won't accept you!!!`
` But......Kanon‐kun being the culprit, ......that's impossible!!"`
`"..........I don't want to suspect anyone.`
` ...However, it is sometimes the case that the suspicious are the guilty.`
` ......In any case, there is probably nothing better than caution..."`
`"Doc‐...Doctor Nanjo...`
` What do you mean by that...?"`
`"...Umm, please do not misunderstand.`
` ...I do not wish to label Kanon‐san as the culprit.`
` ......However, until we understand the situation, there is the possibility that Kanon‐san is the culprit,`
` and I believe keeping that in mind is safer."`
`"Ho, ......hoh‐hoh‐ho...`
` Yes, that's right... You cannot be too cautious."`
`It didn't seem as though anyone blamed Nanjo.`
`{n}In reality, no one thought that Kanon was the culprit.`
`...But if they didn't suspect him, they would have to suspect one of the servants here.`
`......We didn't want to do that.`
`{n}We didn't want to suspect.`
`{n}We didn't want to be suspected.`
`"That is the correct way to think.`
` ......We cannot be too vigilant.`
` Is there anyone who objects to that?"`
`"Listen.`
` ...There is a very high likelihood that this murder case is related to the legend of Father's gold.`
` In that case, it's certainly the crime of someone plotting to keep a vast amount of gold worth tens of billions of yen all for themselves."`
`"......With that amount of money, you could play around for the rest of your life in any country.`
` ...It may be possible that they would massacre us for this reason."`
`".............................."`
`"For the simple reason that our guest wasn't holding a master key, for the murder of Jessica‐chan, and this murder alone,`
` we removed our 19th person—{f:5:Beatrice}—from suspicion.`
` But we can't say that she is unrelated to the crime."`
`"......After all, it's a vast amount of gold we're talking about.`
` We can't deny the possibility that there are multiple culprits.`
` ......Right now, one of the people here among us might have been bought by the culprit!!"`
`As Auntie Rosa yelled, she looked all around, her gun still raised.`
`......Don't believe anyone, suspect the person next to you—that's what she was saying.`
`But no one wanted to suspect.`
`{n}...They didn't want to suspect anyone here.`
`That weakness in their hearts demanded an answer from those not here...`
`"There are only two groups of people you can be sure aren't suspects.`
` .........Yourself, and those who are already corpses.`
` .........The same goes for Kanon‐kun."`
`"Until we catch sight of his corpse, he is the most likely suspect in Jessica‐chan's murder!!`
` So take care.`
` Even if he's still alive, even if he smooths things over with some explanation, you absolutely must not trust him!`
` Alright?!"`
`No one gave a answer of their own initiative.`
` ......However, those who met Auntie Rosa's eyes had to nod their heads...`
`Humans are social beings.`
`{n}......In other words, from the time they are born, trusting each other is imprinted in their genes.`
`...It is unpleasant to go against that.`
`They definitely don't want to suspect anyone.`
`...But if they had to suspect someone,`
` ...they thought that choosing one of the people not here right now would be the most acceptable.`
`For just the reason of acceptability, they had passively chosen to sacrifice Kanon.`
`This is ridiculous.........`
`{n}I definitely don't want to believe that Kanon‐kun is the culprit!`
`I'd only just heard it from George‐aniki, but not only were those two close in age,`
` they also had that adolescent relationship Auntie Rosa had mentioned.`
`......It may be a little late now, but yes, they really did have that kind of air about them.`
`After seeing her parents' tragic bodies, Jessica, bearing deep wounds in her heart, would only have trusted Kanon‐kun.`
`...That's a very conceivable story.`
`{n}So I don't like it...!!`
`Kanon‐kun was the only one she trusted.`
`{n}So she wouldn't have let anyone but Kanon‐kun in.`
`So he was the only one who could have killed Jessica. ......I just can't accept that line of argument......!!!`
`"...Understand?!`
` Even if Kanon‐kun appears, don't get careless!`
` As long as we cannot prove Kanon‐kun's innocence, we will suppose that Kanon‐kun is the culprit who killed Jessica‐chan!!"`
`Auntie Rosa made that claim.`
` By using the ever‐so‐slightly vague word "suppose", ...ultimately, she gave everyone that last little push they needed.`
`Everyone nodded weakly,`
` ...............and, under the excuse that they were just temporarily supposing it,`
` .........they {i:concluded} that Kanon was the culprit who had killed Jessica...`
`.........I wonder what the dead Jessica and Kanon would think if they could hear this exchange.`
`Jessica...was crying.`
`{n}......She was crying in the chest of the person who had put his life on the line to fight for her: Kanon.`
`It was frustrating.`
`{n}So frustrating that it felt like her chest would explode...`
`She grieved and resented how far the dignity of the dead had been trampled...`
`"...Those guys, ...why are they treating you like the culprit?!!"`
`"........................Because there's...no corpse."`
`"Why are they treating you like the culprit because there's no corpse?!`
` You risked your life to fight for me...!"`
`"Then, ......that witch erased your corpse for fun......!`
` To call you the culprit because of that, it's horrible, it's too horrible!!"`
`".........It's alright.`
` ......In the end, I couldn't completely protect you, but...`
` .........I was able to be of use to you, Milady..."`
`"So......why doesn't everyone understand that?!`
` Stop it, Auntie Rosa!!`
` Don't call Kanon‐kun the culprit with that messed up reasoning!!"`
`".........She isn't saying that I'm the culprit.`
` ...She's just saying I'm suspicious,`
` ......no,`
` ......she's saying to be careful."`
`"She is saying it!!`
` These people are saying you're the culprit, Kanon‐kun, so they can stop thinking!`
` They aren't gonna think about who the culprit who killed me is anymore!!`
` They aren't gonna think of the possibility that you aren't the culprit!!"`
`"And after this, every time something happens, they'll repeat the excuse that it was the work of Kanon‐kun who's gone missing!!`
` ......I can't stand that!!"`
`"...............It's alright.`
` ...At least you know the truth, Milady."`
`"If only I know the truth, that's pointless!!`
` I found out by dying.`
` Truth belongs to living humans!!`
` If the truth doesn't remain, the dead won't be rewarded!!`
` They won't know why you risked your life!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*, hahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!`
` Truly a splendid sight.`
` It is a rare honey that is sweeter than the laments of the dead."`
`"Lament, lament.`
` No matter how much you lament, the voices of the dead never reach the living."`
`"Damn it, damn iiiiiiit!!"`
`"It doesn't matter who!!`
` Hear my voice!!`
` Kanon‐kun isn't the culprit!!`
` Kanon‐kun's corpse was just erased!`
` Why, why don't you understand that?!!"`
`".........Milady."`
`"......I can't take this!!`
` It's so sad!`
` It's so frustrating!!"`
`"If it's like this, ......you died for nothing!!`
` The dead have no honor unless the living acknowledge it!`
` It doesn't matter who!`
` Realize!!`
` Realize!! Please!!`
` Kanon‐kun isn't the culprit!!"`
`"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaahh, don't go, don't go, guys!!`
` Please, don't end it like this......!`
` Don't go, ......don't goooooooooooooo!!!"`
`Rosa proclaimed that this room should be sealed until the police came.`
`...The rest didn't want to suspect each other, so they happily accepted that.`
`......They accepted Kanon as the tentative culprit.`
`...Without even imagining how much disgrace that gave to the dead, they accepted it.`
`"......Milady... It's alright now...`
` ......Thank you......"`
`"Don't go!!`
` Don't go, guys!!"`
`"I beg you, come back!!`
` Don't leave us like this!!"`
`"Don't leave......Kanon‐kun......treated as the culprit!!!!!!!`
` Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh...!!"`
`"It won't reach!!`
` The laments of the dead never reach!"`
`"You make me laugh, yes, that face of yours makes me laugh!!`
` You're thinking it will reach, aren't youuu?`
` It won't reach, Jessicaaaaaaa!!!`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*, wahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"`
`"That's no goddamn good."`
`"Huh?`
` .........Battler‐kun, did you say something?"`
`"Yeah, this is no good.`
` ...{i:It's no goddamn good at all}."`
`At the time everyone made to leave the room,`
` ...only Battler had his back to them, and he was still looking down at Jessica's body.`
`"What do you mean, ...it's no good at all?`
` Do you have some objection...?"`
`"I'll at least agree that we have to be vigilant.`
` ......But this talk about having Kanon‐kun be the culprit, sorry, but allow me to refuse."`
`"......Hoh.`
` So you're biting into this part.`
` If Kanon wasn't the culprit, and it wasn't my doing either, then how do you explain this locked room that Jessica's room has become...?"`
`".........Honestly, I've gotta throw my hands up there.`
` ...Seriously, why'd I say it's no goddamn good?"`
`"...I've gotta take responsibility for my own actions.`
` Ihihihihi...!`
` ...............I'm empty‐handed with zero weapons to argue with.`
` ...But you know, I won't stand here twiddling my thumbs anymore!! {f:5:Beatrice}!!"`
`"B‐......Battler‐sama......"`
`"......I‐is there some proof that Kanon‐kun isn't the culprit......?"`
`The expression that rose to those two faces was definitely expectant.`
`{n}......They didn't want to believe that Kanon was the culprit.`
`{n}In truth, they believed in Kanon.`
`So this expectation was because they wanted to be made to believe in him even more strongly!`
`"Then, Battler‐kun, which of the other servants do you suspect?`
` Gohda‐san?`
` Or is it Kumasawa‐san?"`
`"Quit it, Auntie Rosa.`
` ...I know the person called Kumasawa baa‐chan well.`
` ......She'll sometimes slack off on work, but she'll always try to make things fun for people.`
` ......She is not a person who would kill, not even if her eyes were dazzled by money."`
`"B‐......Battler‐sama........."`
`"And I've just met Gohda‐san yesterday.`
` ......Honestly, I still don't really understand him.`
` ......But there is one thing I understand."`
`"........................I, I........."`
`"......I've never seen someone look so happy to be making food.`
` ...You're the same.`
` The same as Kumasawa baa‐chan.`
` ......Gohda‐san likes to make people happy."`
`"As if a person like that could kill those who praised his own food as delicious, ...even if money was piled up in front of him!!"`
`"...Then, who do you think killed Jessica‐chan, Battler‐kun?`
` Who do you think shut Jessica‐chan up in a room that could only be locked by a master key?"`
`"Wait.`
` ......Before I argue about that, there's something I want to make clear.`
` I don't want to talk about, if so‐and‐so is not the culprit, then so‐and‐so is the culprit.`
` ...I just want to talk about how it's completely impossible for Kanon‐kun to be the culprit."`
`"You say that you can establish that Kanon isn't the culprit?`
` *cackle*, how?!"`
`"It's really simple.`
` ...It's something I came dangerously close to overlooking.`
` ......Beato!"`
`"Repetition requested!!`
` Say it if you can: "Kanon‐kun was holding a master key"!!"`
`"...........................Hoh...!"`
`"......Kanon‐kun wasn't holding a master key?!`
` How can you tell that?!"`
`"I heard what Gohda‐san said before.`
` Just before he split up with Kanon‐kun.`
` ...The part about when Jessica went to raid the VIP room."`
`".........Gohda‐san, you did a good job remembering it.`
` You protected Kanon‐kun's honor."`
`"......I,`
` ......I...`
`did...?!"`
`"I heard him talk about the same thing.`
` But I don't really understand!`
` Could you explain it, Battler‐kun?!"`
`"......That's right.`
` When Jessica unlocked the VIP room,`
` she borrowed the key from Kanon‐kun, {i:but didn't give it back}!`
` So Kanon‐kun wasn't holding a master key!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` Or was he?"`
`"Certainly, Gohda has no recollection of the master key being returned to Kanon.`
` However, she might have returned it when Gohda wasn't looking!`
` How can you prove that it definitely didn't happen?!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*, if you could just search the pocket of Kanon's corpse, you could probably establish that, but you can't!!`
` It is impossible to prove!!"`
`"You're no goddamn good at all.`
` It's truly simple to prove, isn't it?"`
`"......No way...!`
` So, you're saying that Kanon‐kun wasn't holding a key?!"`
`"Yeah.`
` And to prove it, all you have to do is search Jessica.`
` ......Kanon‐kun's master key should be in Jessica's pocket.`
` Doctor Nanjo, would you check for us?"`
`"Ye‐......yes."`
`Nanjo dashed up to Jessica, and searched in her jacket pocket......`
`{n}Everyone...hoped for it.........!`
`"......mgh..."`
`...Please.`
` Be there............!!`
`"......Here it is!`
` Is this it?"`
`"...............Yes.`
` That is a master key.`
` Without a doubt."`
`At Genji's statement, there was a small "oooh" of joyful voices.`
`"That is Kanon‐kun's master key.`
` .........I'll say it again."`
`"‘Kanon‐kun isn't holding a master key’.`
` Therefore, there's no way he could have locked the door!!"`
`"......It certainly does...appear that way.`
` ......But Kanon‐kun was the last person to meet Jessica‐chan.`
` The fact that he's suspicious hasn't changed."`
`"Let's......give that a rest."`
`"......Huh?"`
`"Humans were originally supposed to be creatures that trust each other.`
` ...But in order to live in a tough world, we learn to be wary.`
` ...So we'll doubt anything.`
` We are sad creatures.`
` ...I won't deny that's our nature."`
`"...............But I won't permit you to come to a conclusion without proof!!`
` The suspicious are not the guilty, they are the innocent!!`
` Of course, the world is full of wolves.`
` I won't tell you to carelessly believe everyone!"`
`"But if you're going to say someone's guilty, prepare some perfect evidence!`
` Unless you can do that, never say someone is guilty because of speculation!!!"`
`"...............u......`
` That's........."`
`"......I was the one who said the suspicious were the guilty.`
` .........That was thoughtless.`
` I apologize."`
`"............Battler‐sama........."`
`"...W‐wonderful reasoning, Battler‐kun!`
` Thank you too, Gohda‐san.`
` Because of what you remembered, Kanon‐kun is cleared from suspicion!"`
`"N‐no, I... Hahahaha..."`
`Clap clap clap...`
` ...It was the dry sound of the witch's applause.`
`"Well done, well done.`
` ......Not a bad job."`
`".........Shit.`
` Did I just fall for a blatant bait piece...?"`
`"You wonderfully proved that at least Kanon couldn't lock the door to this room.`
` The servants should all have been holding master keys.`
` With that as a basis, Kanon was treated as the culprit, so you did a wonderful job of at least clearing away that suspicion.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*."`
`"......In that case.`
` ...How did the culprit who killed Jessica lock the door?`
` So that's the problem I have now."`
`"Tch.`
` ......I've been drawn into a development that went exactly like you wanted..."`
`"Right into my trap, yes...?`
` Furthermore, you said something outrageous about not doubting any of the other servants.`
` Wellll then, it'll be worth seeing how you gloss this over..."`
`"Shut your face.`
` ...Let's get this started.`
` I'm sure I'll be denied from all angles, ...but first I'll verify the definition of what it means for this room to be a locked room."`
`"Very well.`
` First,`
` {p:1:there are absolutely no types of hidden doors}.`
` {p:1:This door is the only way in or out}.`
` {p:1:The only way to lock this door is with Jessica's single key or the master keys, only one of which is held by each servant}."`
`"It is on the second floor, but it is probably possible to enter or leave through the window.`
` However,`
` {p:1:the window is locked from the inside}."`
`"......Let me flip over the chessboard right away.`
` ...If I start by arguing about the door and the lock, I probably won't leave the palm of your hand."`
`"Do as you like.`
` Well then, well then, what should I repeat?"`
`".........Repetition requested.`
` "Kanon‐kun was killed in this room"."`
`"Mmhm.`
` "{p:1:Kanon was killed in this room}".`
` Although I erased his corpse with magic, of course?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`"And again, repetition requested.`
` "Kanon‐kun's corpse is in this room"."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` I decline.`
` I cannot repeat it.`
` ...Because I erased the corpse with magic.`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*!"`
`"Of course you wouldn't.`
` ......There's got to be a secret hidden in there somewhere."`
`" ......Damn, where's the point of contention to this riddle?`
` .........Is it that they locked it without a master key?`
` Or is it how they managed to kill two people who were inside a room with the door locked?`
` Or is it how they managed to escape after killing them both?"`
`"......I hate to say it, but I'll have to tackle this one step at a time.`
` ...Repetition requested.`
` ......‘The last time it was locked was by a master key’."`
`"I also decline that.`
` *cackle*cackle*."`
`"......This declining thing is really vague.`
` I don't know if you decline because it's impossible to repeat, or whether you can repeat it and you're declining on purpose..."`
`"Back when discussing the lock to the chapel, you completely turned the tables on me.`
` When I have an advantage, there's no need to go out of my way to speak using the red, which carries risk.`
` That's all it is."`
`".........Yeah, I guess so.`
` ...At its heart, the red is something you use when you want to stop my strange theories."`
`"It is natural that I would use it to my advantage.`
` Because of the risk of it being quibbled with, I won't use it uselessly."`
`"...*cackle*cackle*.`
` Well then, what move will you come at me with next?`
` A move that puts Gohda or Kumasawa under suspicion would probably be the easiest to use, right...?"`
`"......Damn.`
` It's like you're leading me down a path, goddamn annoying...`
` Stay quiet a while, I'm thinking...!"`
`"Of course, this door is the same as the chapel.`
` {p:1:When locked, it does not permit any form of entry or exit}."`
`"I'll say more. {p:1:No trick could have the effect of locking the door from the outside without using a key}.`
` *cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"Tch.`
` Damn you for always using red when I don't ask for it..."`
`............Let's back up.`
` ...Let me just think.`
`{n}I'll lay out everything I know.`
`First, there are two victims.`
`Jessica and Kanon‐kun.`
`...Kanon‐kun's corpse isn't here, but {f:5:Beatrice} admitted in red that Kanon‐kun was killed.`
`So even without a corpse, he's included as a victim.`
`There are a few questionable points.`
` And depending on which I focus on, my line of thought changes a lot.`
`First, after the culprit committed murder in this room, how did they lock it?`
`If we assume that the culprit was one of those holding a master key, it's extremely simple.`
`......But I want to avoid that if I can.`
`Because I would have to suspect Gohda‐san or Kumasawa‐san—no, in the worst case, even Shannon‐chan and Genji‐san.`
`At this point, I noticed something.`
`......I'm contradicting myself.`
`{n}I'm cutting my own throat.`
`I want to deny {f:5:Beatrice} no matter what.`
`{n}I want to erase the existence of that brutal, fickle, ridiculous witch!`
`In order to do that, I have to explain everything with humans, not magic.`
`......But that also means suspecting some human.`
`I don't want to suspect someone.`
`......Of course, if there was some clear proof, I would have to believe that person was the culprit,`
` ...but as long as that didn't happen, I didn't want to cast any suspicions.`
`Am I just green...?`
`{n}Am I just a kid who doesn't want to have my feelings, which tell me that at least this person or that person couldn't be a murderer, betrayed...?`
`I want to deny that it was a witch; I also want to deny that it was a human.`
`{n}.........Now I don't know what is what anymore...`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` In the first place, the only victory condition in our game regarded whether or not you could deny my existence.`
` ...Even though that alone was a game that put you at a disadvantage, you've increased the number of victory conditions all by yourself, and made your own victory difficult...!"`
`......It's just as she says.`
` ...If I started arguing that someone holding a master key was the culprit, this locked room could be easily broken.`
`......However, since the number of keys that could open this door are limited,`
` and furthermore it's clearly known who holds them,`
` saying that would mean that I was suspecting someone I knew well...`
`...No, ......have I just been averting my eyes?`
`In that locked room trick with the chapel, which had been exhilarating to destroy,`
` I had proposed that "someone stole the key from Maria's handbag, and returned it".`
` If that theory was right, then the question becomes who could have stolen the key from her handbag.`
`...Maria's handbag had probably been at its most unguarded when she was sleeping.`
`......In that case,`
` .........in addition to me,`
` ...George‐aniki and Jessica are also suspects.`
`George‐aniki or Jessica was the culprit?`
`{n}Or maybe an accomplice?!`
`......All of our parents had been killed, right?!`
`{n}And yet, ......and yet, one of us consented to that and assisted with the crime?!`
`We had lamented, mourned, and shed tears in the chapel.`
`{n}...And yet, one among us......had been lying?!`
`"......*cackle*cackle*.`
` That theory of yours about taking the key out of the handbag and putting it back cast a pronounced suspicion on the cousins, did it not...?"`
`"Quite impressive—in spite of that, you managed to act like you didn't notice,`
` and spoke your theory with such gusto...!`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*."`
`"D‐............damn it...`
` That doesn't guarantee that one of the family or the servants is the culprit!`
` If you snuck up on us hiding in a cardboard box, for example,`
` there's a good chance you could have slunk into our room when we were fast asleep and stolen the key, right?!"`
`"Mmm.`
` That would also be acceptable in that instance.`
` By suspecting me as the guest, the 19th person, you won't have to suspect them."`
`".........But then, what will you do about the lock to Jessica's room?`
` It's no trouble at all for me to open the lock with magic, but of course, I don't have a master key.`
` If you deny my magic, you also have to deny that I'm a suspect, you realize...?"`
`"And what that entails is suspecting one of you 18...!!"`
`"Tha‐......thanks for the lovely explanation.`
` ...I've been able to sort things out a bit."`
`"......My goal is to pursue how the 19th person, the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} guest {f:5:Beatrice}, committed the crimes.`
` If I do that, I won't have to suspect anyone!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` If you can do that, yes...!`
` Foolish man.`
` ......A room like this never needed to be a locked room at all.`
` After all, there are a total of six keys that can open it."`
`"And there were several who possessed those keys!`
` You can suspect any of them!`
` Suspect as much as you like!!`
` But you went to all the trouble of denying all of those, and made it a locked room yourself."`
`".........Understand?`
` This is a locked room born from your mental contradiction.`
` *cackle*cackle*!`
` There's no one else, you closed that door yourself."`
`"......So accept that a witch opened it with magic,`
` ...or accept that someone I know is the culprit—those are my only two options, you're saying.`
` Damn, are you trying to fork the rook?!"`
`"I merely wanted to show you that this move also exists."`
`"......*cackle*.`
` So, what will you do, Ushiromiya Battleeeeeeer?`
` Isn't it a truly simple problemmm...?`
` You just have to make sacrifices of that overly self‐confident cook and that hag who should have died yeeears ago.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`"...............Damn it!!`
` So if I suspect Gohda‐san and Kumasawa‐san, everything's fine?!`
` That's no good!"`
`".........I can't think of Gohda‐san as the culprit!`
` I can't think of Kumasawa‐san as the culprit!!`
` But I won't accept you!!`
` Ever!!"`
`"In that case, they would have to enter the room without using magic or a master key,`
` kill Jessica and Kanon, and even erase Kanon's corpse without using magic."`
`"......How could it be done?!`
` How could it be done so that you can deny me and not suspect anyone at the same time?!!`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`"............Resign."`
`"Huh?`
` Battler‐kun, what did you say?"`
`"......I give up.`
` I was able to prove that Kanon‐kun couldn't have locked this door.`
` ......But that doesn't mean I was able to figure out who killed Jessica."`
`"N‐......no, ...that's more than enough...`
` Umm, ......for doing all that for Kanon‐kun,`
` ...thank you very much...!"`
`"......I don't want thanks.`
` After all, ......that means that you're under suspicion too."`
`"....................."`
`"...And sorry, Auntie Rosa.`
` ......It's not like I wanted to be defiant towards you.`
` I don't want to die either, and I want to find Dad and the rest's true killer.`
` ......Sorry for saying something that wasn't cooperative."`
`"......No, it's alright.`
` I was also a little rash.`
` Let's make up.`
` As auntie and nephew, we have to be friendly with each other.`
` ............Right?"`
`Auntie Rosa shifted the gun to one hand, and held out her other hand.`
`...I reached out, and for the time being, we shook hands.`
`Auntie's gaze was sharp.`
`{n}......In order to deny the witch, she would make anyone a sacrifice.`
`{n}...That's what her eyes told me.`
`And me...?`
`{n}I denied the witch.`
`{n}......But I wasn't prepared to lose anything.`
`I was probably the one who thought himself most ready to fight, ......and the one standing furthest from the truth.``With Jessica's death, it became certain that the culprit was hiding somewhere nearby, and that they would come after our lives if they had a chance.`
`According to Genji‐san, when tomorrow morning comes, the boat should arrive.`
`The boat has a radio, too.`
`{n}We'll probably be able to contact the police immediately with that.`
`We all gathered in the parlor, and decided to wait quietly until tomorrow.`
`I proposed that we should search throughout the mansion for clues about the culprit,`
` but Auntie Rosa rejected that, saying that if we put pressure on the culprit, or provoked them,`
` it might lead to a third murder.`
`...That was probably the right thing to do.`
`{n}Even if a bunch of amateurs like us investigated, there's no way we'd find anything.`
`It would be wisest to focus on protecting ourselves without doing anything unnecessary, and leave it to the police after tomorrow.`
`We had been tense in the beginning, but other than Auntie Rosa,`
` most of us had spent all morning watching TV and were getting bored, so our sense of danger had grown much less intense.`
`When we thought about it, even though there certainly had been six adults killed at once in the first murder,`
` that made us imagine that some back‐handed method like poison had been used.`
`And in the second murder, it was thought that those two had become sacrifices because they were unfortunately isolated from the rest of us.`
`From this, we imagined that there weren't a great number of culprits,`
` and they didn't have the ability to kill this large group gathered in the parlor all at once.`
`Right now, in this parlor, there was George‐aniki and me,`
` Maria,`
` Auntie Rosa,`
` Genji‐san, Gohda‐san, Shannon‐san, Kumasawa‐san, ......and finally Doctor Nanjo—a total of nine people were here.`
`Furthermore, Auntie Rosa was even armed with a gun.`
`Surely, with this many people staying in this room, they wouldn't be able to touch us easily.`
`That feeling of security, along with the passage of time, allowed us to recover from the shock of that morning bit by bit...`
`Incidentally, lunchtime had just ended for us.`
`{n}However, it had been a canned‐food lunch, a far cry from last night's dinner which Gohda‐san had skillfully made for us.`
`...Auntie Rosa too had suspected that poison had been used in the murder of those six people.`
`...So, we probably couldn't deny the possibility that the culprit had snuck into the kitchen during all that confusion in the morning, and mixed poison in with the ingredients there.`
`......Auntie Rosa had ordered all of us not to put anything into our mouths except safe foods like canned food, until the police came.`
`As a cook, Gohda‐san must have felt very let down.`
`As though he wanted to display his skill anyway, he said that he at least wanted to bring the plates and pile them up with canned food.`
`At first, Auntie Rosa had been reluctant, examining each one of the plates that were brought, but she hadn't been able to find anything to complain about,`
` and Gohda‐san's "Chef's Pick Canned Food Combo Lunch" had become a reality.`
`Gohda‐san had said something about taste being savored not just with the tongue, but with the eyes too.`
`...I found myself agreeing—it had been the same canned food we ate for breakfast, but it felt like something completely different...`
`"Uu, Battler.`
` Look, look.`
` Here, "Wolves and Sheep Puzzle".`
` Uu."`
`As I was sitting lazily on a sofa, with no desire to watch TV,`
` Maria came over, pulled a picture book out of her handbag, and held it out to me as she said that.`
`"......What is that book?`
` "Wolves and Sheep Puzzle"?`
` ..................Let's have a look‐see."`
`"Wolves and Sheep Puzzle".`
`{n}It was a phrase that Auntie Rosa had said this morning when we had gone to call on Jessica.`
`...At the time, I hadn't known what it meant, and then after that, there was the uproar when Jessica's body was found, so I'd forgotten about it completely.`
`The book that Maria held out to me looked like a foreign picture book or something that had been translated.`
`Opening it, I could tell that the book contained an assortment of puzzles.`
`"Uu.`
` So there's several wolves and sheep, okay?`
` And the puzzle is to take them to the other side using one boat."`
`"......Hmmmm?`
` I've heard of a game with rules like this.`
` So this is that, but with wolves and sheep?"`
`It was a very simple puzzle, passed on from long ago.`
`{n}Let's try one of the problems.`
`On the right bank, there are two wolves and two sheep.`
`{n}There is a boat that as many as two animals can ride on, and using it, you have to move all four of them to the opposite left bank.`
`There are two rules.`
`The first is regarding the boat.`
`{n}It can be paddled by wolves or sheep, and even just by one animal on its own.`
`{n}But it can only hold up to two.`
`The second is regarding the wolves.`
`{n}When they are greater in number than the sheep in that location, they attack the sheep and it's game over.`
`For example, at the start of the game:`
`{n}Both sheep ride the boat, and go to the other side.`
`{n}Then one sheep gets off, and the other goes back to the first bank.`
`......When it does, there are two wolves on the first bank.`
`{n}And a single sheep returns there.`
`When that happens, there are more wolves, so the sheep is attacked and it's game over.`
`On either bank or even the boat, there must not be more wolves than sheep.`
`It's a puzzle about how to shuttle them across in the boat under these conditions.`
`By the way, the right answer is: On the first turn, move both wolves to the opposite bank.`
`{n}Then one wolf comes back.`
`On the second turn, move two sheep to the opposite bank.`
`{n}Then one wolf comes back.`
`Then on the third turn, put that last wolf that was on the right bank on the boat and cross to the opposite bank, and congratulations, transport successful.`
`Partway, there may be the same number of wolves and sheep in the boat or on either side, but that isn't a problem.`
`You only lose when the number of wolves is greater.`
`This book symbolizes it using wolves and sheep, but there are probably lots of people who know this same game with a different symbolism...`
`It looked like Maria wanted to test whether I too could solve the puzzles she knew how to solve,`
` and she kept showing me different pages, saying "solve this one" and "this one's hard".`
`What had been happening when Auntie Rosa had said the name of this puzzle...`
`That's right.`
`...When we'd decided to go call Jessica, we had been talking about how many men should go,`
` and Auntie Rosa mentioned the "Wolves and Sheep Puzzle", and said that we should all go together......`
`".................................Wait a sec..."`
`That could only mean one thing.`
` ...Auntie Rosa was saying that there are "wolves" among us.`
`And when the number of wolves and sheep is balanced, we're safe, but when a situation comes up where that isn't the case, the wolves will bear their fangs—is that what she's thinking......?`
`At the time we had found our parents' corpses, Auntie Rosa was already suspecting that the servants might be "wolves".`
`While she didn't know whether it was all of them or just some, she had sniffed out the possibility that "wolves" were hiding among them.`
`......Well, yeah.`
`That murder scene was pretty damn elaborate.`
`{n}It's easy to imagine that there were multiple culprits.`
`And considering that she had that idea already in mind when we went to Jessica's room,`
` where Jessica had been alone with a servant, Kanon, and had been killed,`
` .........it isn't hard to imagine why Auntie Rosa had suspected the servants so persistently...`
`"All you servants.`
` Gohda‐san is going to the kitchen to wash the dishes.`
` Just in case, would you please all go with him?"`
`"My apologies, everyone.`
` Let us go as a group."`
`"......Shannon, Kumasawa.`
` Let's go."`
`"Yes, yes, coming.`
` Hoh‐hoh‐ho."`
`"Well then, George‐san, excuse me for now."`
`"Okay.`
` .........Take care.`
` Ah, Auntie Rosa, could I go as well?"`
`"I'm sorry, would you remain here, George‐kun?`
` There's something I want to talk to you about."`
`"......Is that so?`
` Sorry, Shannon.`
` Anyway, take care.`
` ...Don't be alone."`
`"...Yes..."`
`"Excuse me, Doctor Nanjo.`
` ......I wanted to consult with you about something."`
`"Yes, ......what might that be?`
` ........................"`
`The servants put the dishes and empty cans on the serving cart and started to head out into the corridor.`
`Behind them, Auntie Rosa was talking to Doctor Nanjo about something in a small voice.`
`"...Alright.`
` I will go."`
`"Yes, if you wouldn't mind."`
`Doctor Nanjo closed the book he had been reading, stood from the sofa, and followed after the servants...`
`Auntie Rosa stuck her head out into the hallway, and after watching them leave completely, she closed the door, and spoke.`
`"Listen, everyone.`
` Now everyone here is an Ushiromiya."`
`"......Hmm?`
` Yes, that is true..."`
`"So you're saying that you've chased out all of the "wolves"?`
` ......Auntie Rosa."`
`With that one sentence, Auntie Rosa's gaze grew sharp.`
`{n}...Apparently she had picked up on my sardonic tone.`
`......Auntie Rosa laughed lightly.`
`"...Your mind sure works fast, Battler‐kun.`
` I like clever kids.`
` It means there's less to explain."`
`"Uu.`
` Battler, smart...?`
` Can you solve this?`
` Hard one on page 64.`
` Uu!"`
`"Maria, sit there watching TV for a while.`
` Mama wants to talk with Battler‐kun and George‐kun."`
`"..................Uu."`
`"Auntie Rosa.`
` ...I heard about the puzzle from Battler‐kun.`
` ...I don't think it's bad to be very careful, but I think being too suspicious isn't good either."`
`"Whether the real culprit is {f:5:Beatrice} or not,`
` I think there is reason for us to suspect that the servants are in league with her."`
`"......In the first murder, where Nii‐san and the others were killed,`
` they'd been given a very brutal treatment, right?`
` Did that look like something that could be done alone?"`
`"............Maybe our mystery guest {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama worked all night and did it all."`
`"And the incident with the master keys involving the door to Jessica's room?`
` Isn't that proof that one of the servants was involved?"`
`"......nn.................."`
`Only a master key could have locked the door to Jessica's room.`
`{n}...In that case, we can only suppose that one of the servants locked it......`
`.........No,`
` ......wait.`
`"Flip over the chessboard.`
` ......That's strange, Auntie Rosa."`
`"After killing Jessica, why did the culprit go to all the trouble of locking the door?`
` It was inevitable that the owners of the master keys were gonna be suspected if they did that.`
` ......There was no need to deliberately lock the door."`
`"...Tha‐that's right.`
` It's just as Battler‐kun says!`
` They have no reason to deliberately go and do something that makes themselves suspicious."`
`"Yes.`
` That's an interesting thought.`
` Of course, I also thought that."`
`"......If that's so, then the person who locked it wanted to cast suspicion on the servants, and locked that door without a master key.`
` But that's impossible.`
` Right?"`
`......That's right.`
` If there was a trick that could lock the door without a master key, this would be a good disguise aimed at casting doubt on the servants.`
`...If the culprit wanted to isolate us and attack us one by one, this trick was a very effective one that could even give rise to paranoia.`
`However, there was no way to lock that door without using a master key...`
`"How can you make the claim that there's no way to lock the door without using a master key?`
` Isn't that a Devil's Proof, like Rudolf nii‐san was talking about?`
` {i:Maybe it was locked by a method we can't think of}."`
`"Even if we can't think of it, that doesn't disprove that there was some unknown trick."`
`"............Well, sure, but...`
` So is that it?`
` The suspicious ones are guilty...?"`
`"I don't know the practical details of the trick, but I have a general idea.`
` My apologies, but if we suppose that Kanon‐kun was the culprit, it can be explained extremely easily.`
` Even as to why there was no corpse."`
`"Huh......`
` But Kanon‐kun wasn't holding a master key, right?!`
` Putting aside the other servants, at least Kanon‐kun shouldn't have been able to lock the door!"`
`"......I see.`
` ...So that's why you told us to search in the closet and everywhere else right after we entered Jessica's room.`
` ......Auntie Rosa, ...your mind works faster than I could imagine judging by your normal appearance."`
`"The brain speed of a little sister is always the big sister's minus 1.`
` ...I feel glad that there's no one I need to worry about now."`
`George‐aniki realized that she was referring to Auntie Eva,`
` and seemed a little disturbed about how he should take that nasty remark...`
`"......I, I'm sorry.`
` Could you explain it so that even I can understand?"`
`"Kanon‐kun's master key was in Jessica‐chan's pocket, closed up inside a locked room.`
` After the door was locked, it should have been impossible for him to pull a stunt like putting it in her pocket from outside the room...!"`
`"That's not it, Aniki.`
` ......If it was done in the way Auntie Rosa imagines, ......this trick could only be used by Kanon‐kun."`
`"...And, the door could be locked without a key, while the master key was still in Jessica's pocket.`
` ......And, as a result, his corpse would also disappear."`
`"H‐......how?!`
` How would he lock the door without a key?!"`
`"It's simple.`
` George‐kun, when you return home, you lock the door, right?`
` You twist the knob, click, right?"`
`"Huh...?!`
` .........C‐`
`...could it be...`
` ......No, but...`
`...Kanon‐kun wasn't anywhere......"`
`"...It looks like you've got it, Aniki.`
` .........That's what Auntie Rosa was searching inside the room for."`
`"......She was searching for Kanon‐kun, who had locked the door from the inside, stuck the key in Jessica's pocket,`
` and was hiding somewhere, waiting for us to go away."`
`The simplest locked‐room trick.`
` ...In other words, to hide inside the locked room after committing the murder.`
`...And if he could get out after those who discovered the body left, it would create a perfect locked‐room murder......`
`"We searched that room, but we couldn't find anything.`
` ...But, that doesn't mean we can rule out something like a secret hidden passage in that room that only the servants know about."`
`"I don't know where that might be hidden,`
` but if we assume that there was a hidden passage, we can say for certain that it was impossible for anyone except him."`
`"..................You know, that line of reasoning,`
` ...it was the first thing I thought of, too.`
` ......It's the reasoning I hate the most, so I wanted to destroy it in the very beginning..."`
`"*cackle*cackle*...`
` "{p:1:Kanon was killed in this room}", yes?"`
`"Because you seemed to suspect Kanon as the culprit, you made me repeat this to destroy that possibility right away.`
` I understand, I understand.`
` *cackle*......"`
`"...So this is what I thought of next.`
` A theory that there were actually three people in that room.`
` Jessica and Kanon‐kun were victims.`
` And the culprit, the guest {f:5:Beatrice}, was also there with them."`
`"You wanted to make it "the human me" who committed the crime without using magic.`
` I see, a strange theory that fits you perfectly.`
` *giggle*giggle*."`
`"......I guessed that you killed those two, then locked the door from the inside.`
` And you carried Kanon‐kun's corpse using some secret method that normal people wouldn't notice.`
` ......In other words, you used a secret door to escape."`
`"But you told me it in red.`
` ...You said that there are no types of hidden doors in that room."`
`"Indeed.`
` No secret passage exists unknown to you all.`
` Was it Knox, or was it Van Dine?`
` It seems that in mystery novels, there must never be hidden passages, no matter what.`
` I also follow that etiquette."`
`"In other words, even without having to thoroughly search a room, great detectives can state with confidence that there are no secret passages.`
` .........*cackle*cackle*, humans have it so easy with their little detective games."`
`"Damn you, talking so big...`
` Thanks.`
` Thanks to the witch's arrangement, I can say for sure that the room doesn't have a hidden door without searching the whole thing."`
`"Indeed.`
` {p:1:There are no hidden doors in this room}.`
` {p:1:There is no way to get in or out other than the door and the windows}."`
`"......Which means...`
`...that theory Auntie Rosa's so confident in...`
`...is wrong."`
`"...Plus, frustratingly, it's impossible to disprove that theory.`
` ......If you, the witch, say in red`
` "`
`{p:1:there are no hidden doors}", then it's settled."`
`"......However, no matter how much a human like me tries to argue against her, Auntie Rosa probably won't accept it.`
` {i:Humans can't prove there's no hidden door}."`
`"It's a Devil's Proof.`
` ...............Damn.`
` Sure is convenient being a witch..."`
`"......No way!`
` You're calling Kanon‐kun the culprit because of a hidden door that we don't even know exists...`
` I...can't accept that."`
`"If you can't accept that, tell me some reasoning that's easier to accept, then?`
` .........There is none.`
` I've been thinking the whole time.`
` There's nothing but this!"`
`".............................."`
`"George‐kun, you had a good relationship with Shannon‐chan, right?`
` So I think it would be hard for you to accept that all of the servants are the culprits."`
`"I also don't want to believe that Shannon‐chan is one of the culprits.`
` .........But whether it's all of them or not, the culprit, or maybe an accomplice, is definitely in that group.`
` You must not fail to see that!"`
`"......If you thought that there were more wolves in addition to Kanon‐kun,`
` ...then causing that uproar by saying that Kanon‐kun was the culprit in Jessica's room was to see the servants' reactions...?"`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` And as a result, I began to suspect them even more.`
` ......I'm certain there are wolves among the servants.`
` Certain.`
` And, just like the "Wolves and Sheep Puzzle", while they are normally docile, they will surely attack if they get the chance."`
`"......Jessica‐chan was a lone sheep on the boat.`
` ......In that puzzle, they may not attack when there is a balance between wolves and sheep, but our puzzle is different.`
` Depending on the opportunity and the number of people, they'll attack even if there is a balance.`
` Just like when Jessica‐chan was killed!"`
`".........Th‐there's something I don't like!`
` In that case, Shannon, who you sent to the kitchen, is in a dangerous situation, isn't she?!!`
` We should also go to the kitchen right now!`
` No matter who might or might not be a wolf!`
` If we can form a balance by gathering together, I think we should maintain that!!"`
`"......Shannon‐chan went to see Father along with Genji‐san.`
` She was isolated then, but she wasn't killed."`
`"Because Genji‐san wasn't a wolf either?"`
`"......No!`
` Because they were both wolves!!"`
`"Shannon isn't the kind of person who would take part in a crime!!`
` Even if it's you, Auntie Rosa, I cannot ignore that.`
` I demand that you take back what you just said...!"`
`"...I hate to say this in front of Aniki, but that argument...`
`...feels just like something Auntie Eva would say.`
` If we can't argue back, then you automatically assume that you're right.`
` ......Looks like you can't fight your blood after all, Auntie."`
`".........Even I don't think of myself as very praiseworthy right now."`
`"But you know what? I'm a mother!`
` I would even become a demon to protect Maria's safety.`
` Honestly speaking, I wish I could just shut myself away somewhere alone with Maria."`
`"......But I also plan to act as a mother to you two.`
` Right now, you are as good as my children.`
` ......You may not be my own children, ...but I won't forsake you.`
` .........Ever."`
`"......Sure, thanks."`
`"I just wanted to warn you not to be careless, as your mother.`
` {i:Always remain where I can see you}.`
` I will protect you."`
`"And at the same time, you'll be observing us to make sure we aren't "wolves".`
` ...Yeah, thanks a lot for that.`
` Can you prove that you aren't a "wolf" yourself?"`
`"Yes, I can."`
`"That's a quick answer.`
` How?"`
`"With this.`
` ...This is my proof."`
`Auntie Rosa held up the gun, and pointed the barrel at me.`
`But that was only for an instant.`
`She immediately lowered the gun, laughing impishly.`
`{n}......But to me, the time I spent staring down the barrel of the gun had felt like an eternity.`
`"...How does that gun prove that you aren't the culprit, Auntie Rosa?"`
`"Think about it.`
` What if I were the culprit?`
` Do you think I would let by this once‐in‐a‐lifetime chance I got when the servants left?"`
`"I could just shoot you both, bang, and all that's left is to come out with a fitting excuse.`
` Something like, {f:5:Beatrice} appeared outside the window and shot at us with a gun.`
` I would claim that I fired two shots back at her, and throw the two shots' worth of empty cartridges onto the floor."`
`"That's a crazy wild argument, but it does make sense. Ihihihi!"`
`"There's something Krauss nii‐san often used to say.`
` Might makes right.`
` .........I wonder if this proves that?"`
`".........I'm sorry, you two.`
` I've lost a lot of my composure after all these crimes since morning.`
` You know how I normally am, so right now I must seem on‐edge and a little short‐tempered."`
`"...But understand.`
` I want to protect you from the malicious culprit.`
` I will become a demon to do that.`
` That's all there is to it.`
` ......I'm sorry for saying something that's angered you.`
` Battler‐kun, George‐kun.`
` ...Let's make up."`
`George‐aniki was wearing an unsatisfied expression.`
`{n}...He probably couldn't forgive the damage done to Shannon's honor.`
`...What about me...?`
` Several bits of circumstantial evidence hint strongly at the servants' participation.`
`......I don't want to believe that one of them is the culprit, or possibly colluding with the culprit,`
` ...but in the current situation, that's nothing but wishful thinking.`
`Who should I believe?`
`In the first place, who is the culprit?`
`{n}Are there accomplices?`
`{n}If so, how many?!`
`......I feel like I'm constantly only suspecting the people connected to all this.`
`...I find myself quickly forgetting about that 19th person,`
` the guest, {f:5:Beatrice}, who came yesterday and boldly called herself the Golden Witch.`
`I haven't actually seen her face.`
`I've heard that she's like a double of the witch in that portrait,`
` but because I haven't seen her directly, no matter how hard I try, I can't really feel like there are 19 people on this island.`
`...So I easily slip into the illusion that the culprit is one of the 18...`
`Damn it......`
` Come out, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`If you're the bad guy, then act like the bad guy, and show yourself, laughing in a high‐pitched voice and looking down on us.`
`Just like a bad guy in one of those dramas who, even once they're exposed as the culprit,`
` aggressively says "is there any proof?"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*.`
` Is there any proof?"`
`"Shut up, you keep your trap shut for a minute..."`
`There were five humans in the kitchen, but it was very quiet, filled only with the sound of the rain.`
`It was only accented by the sound of Shannon and Kumasawa washing the dishes.`
`Gohda was using the leftovers from breakfast and lunch as ingredients for a servants' soup.`
`......Rosa had suspected that poison might have been added to the food, so they had decided to eat canned food, but it hadn't really been filling.`
`But Gohda thought that she was being too careful.`
`{n}So he was spontaneously creating a soup to be served only to those that wanted to eat it.`
`Shannon and Kumasawa were washing the dishes that the food had been arranged on.`
`On the inside, they thought maybe Gohda should be the one to wash them since he had been the one who wanted the food on plates in the first place,`
` but they left their complaints unsaid for the time being.`
`Genji and Nanjo were facing each other across a crude chess set which had seen many years.`
`...It had still only just begun.`
`And because the opening game of the experienced players had been endlessly refined,`
` it looked like a ritual where they just moved specified pieces in a specified order.`
`"That's a nice aroma...`
` You wouldn't get this from canned food."`
`"It was made only from sealed ingredients, so there won't be any poison mixed in."`
`"I have made enough for everybody, so please, eat.`
` Of course, I will also taste for poison.`
` Please feel secure and eat."`
`"That really is a nice aroma.`
` Gohda‐san, your makeshift servant meals really are delicious."`
`"It's natural that you can create delicious food if you buy delicious ingredients.`
` ......My teacher taught me that perfecting your ability to make delicious food from whatever is at hand is what makes you a true cook."`
`"That was a good teacher.`
` Thanks to him, it looks like I shall be able to enjoy some truly delicious soup."`
`"......Although it is a shame that it was made from ingredients intended for all of the family members to eat."`
`"I'm sure that Rosa‐san is also tired after everything that happened this morning.`
` It is only natural."`
`"But thanks to that, we get to eat some soup made from delicious ingredients, hoh‐hoh‐ho."`
`Rosa had fervently told everyone that they didn't realize the danger they were in, and that they must suspect that poison was mixed in with the food.`
`The atmosphere in that place had led to their agreement,`
` but their hunger wouldn't be overcome by that momentary emotion.`
`"Ironically, it has become a soup that we normally wouldn't be able to savor.`
` If possible, I would like to also serve it to everyone in the parlor, but..."`
`"......Seeing as that goes against Rosa‐sama's instructions, you'd better not.`
` ......Those who want to eat it can do so."`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho.`
` Skillfully taking a breather when no one is looking is one of the things you learn as a servant, after all."`
`Kumasawa laughed loudly, and Shannon and Gohda laughed with her.`
`It seemed that, in an area where only their fellow servants were gathered, they could be very relaxed.`
`Shannon didn't like Gohda's occasional dishonesty,`
` but she knew that there was no falsehood in his childish smile when he cooked,`
` nor in his desire that people enjoy his food.`
`So even though it was a little aggravating to be made to wash the dishes,`
` she couldn't really hate him.`
`However, they couldn't have dreamed that Rosa was calling them wolves in the parlor at exactly the same moment that they were spending their time peacefully like this......`
`At that time, several of the servants heard a sound like something was being dragged, and then a thump.`
`When a servant was out carrying a mountain of trash bags on a rainy day,`
` or doing some work in a raincoat, they would create exactly this kind of noise and presence as they returned and hovered around the back door.`
`So after hearing that sound, at first, none of them noticed anything out of the ordinary...`
`But they quickly realized.`
` ............In a situation where everyone was either in the kitchen or the parlor, who in the world was at the back door...?!`
`As the servants all looked at each other, they checked to make sure that each one of them knew what that sound meant.`
`"Who, ..........who could it be......?"`
`The servants knew the mansion's layout well.`
`So they understood how unimaginable it would be for someone from the parlor to actually go outside in this typhoon,`
` go all the way around, and come up to this back door.`
`Then was it Kinzo?`
` ...They found it even more difficult to imagine that Kinzo, who never left his study even under normal conditions,`
` would dash out into the middle of this typhoon for no apparent reason, and come to the back of the house, where only low‐class people came in or out.`
`"......Tha‐`
`......that wasn't...`
`our imagination, was it......?"`
`".............Awawawawawawawawa..."`
`Shannon and Kumasawa drew close together, fearfully looking at the back door...`
`"...Who, ...who is it......?"`
`As Gohda fearfully approached the back door, he called out.`
`{n}......And he checked with his eyes the location of a butcher's knife set on a nearby sink.`
`......He didn't pick it up yet.`
`{n}Because there was still a possibility that this was a member of the family.`
`{n}However, that possibility wasn't possible...`
`There was no response from across the door to Gohda's initial question.`
`{n}...Maybe his voice had been so quiet that it hadn't reached through all the wind and rain outside.`
`".........Genji‐san."`
`"......Yes.`
` .........Stand back, Doctor Nanjo and the women."`
`"...Who, ......who in the world could it be......"`
`Genji took a knife with a classical design from a stationery box placed near the chess set.`
`...It was something to be used instead of a paper knife to open envelopes for invoices and bills.`
`But it was fundamentally a knife.`
`{n}So the blade on it could injure someone...`
`Genji hid it in his sleeve with a well‐practiced manner.`
`{n}Then he too approached the back door, and signaled to Gohda with a silent nod.`
`Gohda cautiously approached the back door, .........and slowly started to open it......`
`"Wa...wahyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...!!!"`
`The figure of a person suddenly shuffled into sight, landed on its knees, and fell over.`
`{n}Gohda fell backwards onto his backside in shock.`
`That figure was soaked with rain, smeared with mud, and drenched with blood...`
`"K‐............Kanon‐kun?!`
` Kanon‐kun!!"`
`".........Kanon.`
` Are you alright...?`
` Doctor Nanjo...!"`
`It was Kanon.`
`......His breath was feeble, ......and the puddles of mud he left quickly became drenched bright‐red.`
`When Nanjo held him and turned him face up, there was a deep, gruesome scar right in the center of his chest, as though he had been run through with a spear or something.`
`Even now, deep‐red blood poured out from there...!`
`"Th‐th‐th‐...this is horrible...`
` Wh‐what shall we do—first aid kit? First aid kit?!"`
`"Kanon‐san, put your hand against the wound!`
` Please, push firmly!`
` Let's carry him to the bed in the servant room!!`
` Everyone, please, lend a hand."`
`"C‐come now, Kanon‐san!`
` Please, hang in there a little longer...!"`
`"Hang in there!!`
` It's alright now!!`
` So don't take your hand from the wound...!!"`
`"Anyway, let's carry him to the servant room.`
` ......Kumasawa, inform Rosa‐sama that we have found Kanon."`
`"Wai‐.........wait.........`
` ......Not...`
`......Rosa‐sama........."`
`"...Please wait!`
` Kanon‐san said not Rosa‐sama..."`
`"......Wh‐what do you mean, Kanon‐kun...!"`
`"............Not now.`
` Let's carry him to the servant room quickly.`
` Kumasawa, don't tell Rosa‐sama yet.`
` ...We'll do it after we hear the situation from Kanon."`
`"Y‐......yes......`
` ......hiiiiii..."`
`After appearing in this horrible state, he had said not to tell Rosa.`
`......That could only mean something very disquieting.`
`{n}......An eerie sense of panic rose to their faces...`
`"C‐come now, everyone!`
` Let's hurry and carry him...!`
` Quickly, quickly...!"`
`Kanon's wound was unbelievably deep,`
` ...and judging from Nanjo's pale face, it was almost a miracle that he was still conscious...`
`"......This is......horrible...`
` It appears that he has been stabbed with something like a spear.`
` I‐if it hasn't reached the lungs, I might be able to do something......`
` Anyway, stop the bleeding......!"`
`"u...guo......aaaaga!!!"`
`No matter how much Nanjo tried to wipe off that gushing deep‐red blood, ...he couldn't wipe it he couldn't wipe it he couldn't wipe it all away...!`
` And each time, the wound was aggravated, causing Kanon to cry in anguish...`
`"Kanon‐kun, Kanon‐kun Kanon‐kun!`
` Hang in there... Hang in there...!!"`
`"Doctor Nanjo!`
` A new towel...!`
` ...How...horrible...!!"`
`"What is his condition...?"`
`".........In all honesty, ...it is so severe that I cannot believe he is alive...`
` Maybe the location of the stab was fortunate...`
` But the blood loss is too horrible...!`
` A blood transfusion is necessary, but that's impossible until tomorrow...!"`
`"......u...`
`...*cough*cough*!!`
` Ro‐`
`......Rosa‐sama...`
`......she......`
`ugaaaaaa!!"`
`"D‐don't talk, Kanon‐kun!`
` Your wound will open...!"`
`"......Rosa‐sama...came...`
`......t‐`
`......to Milady and...`
`...me, and........."`
`"Wh‐......what did you say......"`
`"Rosa‐sama......did...?`
` Oooooh... Could that mean, could that mean..."`
`"......Are you certain?"`
`"Yes.........`
` ......I'm certain......it was Rosa‐sama........."`
`"Come now, don't speak any more...!`
` Kumasawa‐san, please grab another first aid kit!"`
`".........Genji‐san.`
` ......Is it possible Rosa‐sama......did such a thing?"`
`"............I don't know."`
`Disregarding Nanjo and Kumasawa, who were struggling hard and stained with blood as they tried to stop the bleeding, Genji and Gohda faced each other...`
`......Because if what Kanon had said was the truth,`
` ......Rosa was the culprit who killed Jessica.`
`"Curse you, Rosa......`
` How could you do that...to Milady......`
` ...I'm gonna kill you......ugnnnggg...!"`
`Kanon screamed even more hatefully...`
`{n}...His hate‐filled voice made it seem like he had seen Jessica being harmed right before his eyes.`
`"......Cer‐certainly, Rosa‐sama may have had a reason to kill Milady.`
` If the Ushiromiya family was wiped out, the inheritance would all go to Rosa‐sama..."`
`"If so, Battler‐sama and George‐sama are in danger...!`
` Not only is Rosa‐sama holding a gun, but right now, they are the only ones in the parlor...!`
` Genji‐san, isn't this quite perilous......?!"`
`"................................."`
`".............................."`
`Shannon suddenly ran out into the corridor.`
`...Her expression was complex and tragic, as though she didn't know what to believe...`
`Shannon ran.`
` To where?`
`......The inside of the mansion had been scrupulously cleaned, so they probably wouldn't be easy to find.`
`She might find some if she searched the rose garden, but they would probably have all been lost in this wind and rain...`
`That's right, ......the boiler room isn't cleaned very often.`
`{n}...If she went there, ......she might be able to find some...`
`Shannon ran down the stairs to search for {i:those} in the underground boiler room...`
`Had some medicine taken effect at the brink of death,`
` or had Kanon finally stopped even feeling pain?`
`...For the time being, Kanon had at least gotten over his painful gasping.`
`Nanjo apparently didn't think of this as that great of a trend, and didn't let his eyes off Kanon for a second.`
`Kumasawa firmly gripped Kanon's hand, and kept encouraging him, so that his will to stay alive didn't fall asleep.`
`Genji and Gohda seemed bewildered at how to deal with the truth that Kanon had risked his life to deliver...`
`".........I believe Rosa‐sama's gun had four or five shots loaded."`
`"That is no small number.`
` ...But loading cartridges into that gun should require quite a lot of practice.`
` We might unfortunately allow her to get one shot off, but if everyone attacks her at once, we should be able to take the gun from her before she shoots again..."`
`".........On this island, we may have a doctor, but there's no medicine, and no hospital.`
` ......If you're shot in the wrong place, ...you're dead."`
`"I understand that, but...`
` More importantly, if we don't move quickly, there is also the possibility that another crime will occur...!`
` I get the feeling that Rosa‐sama skillfully chased us out.`
` There is a possibility that George‐sama and Battler‐sama are being killed right about now...!"`
`"..........................."`
`"......Ho...hohohohoho.`
` If the opponent is so dangerous, wouldn't it be better if we didn't provoke them too much...?"`
`"But there is still much time before tomorrow comes...!`
` We can't even imagine what strategy she will use!`
` Genji‐san, we should be the ones to make the first move.`
` If we can at least take the gun from her under some pretext, things might work out...!"`
`"There are four or five cartridges, are there not?`
` That means there aren't enough to kill all of us...`
` If we don't carelessly provoke her, surely even Rosa‐sama wouldn't recklessly—"`
`"............No, she said it.`
` She said she'll massacre all of us."`
`Kanon, who they thought had been sleeping quietly, suddenly started talking brightly.`
`Almost like he had been awake the whole time and had suddenly opened his mouth.`
`He looked firm and steady, and Nanjo was slightly relieved, but thinking of the deepness of that wound, he just couldn't wipe away a certain creepy feeling.`
`......He knew because he was a doctor.`
`Kanon should have been expected to fall unconscious after losing so much blood.`
`{n}And yet somehow, he had preserved his awareness so clearly.`
`......Youth?`
` Or tenacity?`
`{n}...Sometimes the power of human life did surpass common knowledge......`
`When they had stopped the bleeding, to make sure there were no foreign objects inside the affected area,`
` Nanjo had groped around a bit inside the bleeding hole with tweezers, and the great depth of the wound had surprised him.`
`...The wound had certainly reached as far as his lungs.`
`......And yet, ...and yet...`
`{n}......No, on the other hand, the fact that he is alive is fortunate...`
`......But Kanon had spoken clearly.`
`{n}...He had hatefully said that the one named Rosa had created this wound, and was repeating curses and enraged words.`
`"...She wants to kill everyone by any means necessary before the typhoon passes, so that she can have the Master's wealth all to herself.`
` She told me that clearly."`
`".........Damn...!`
` What a person...`
` Genji‐san, what should we do?!`
` Do we also not need some kind of weapons...?"`
`"......I can't believe it so suddenly.`
` ......That Rosa‐sama would do something like......"`
`"Genji‐sama, it isn't a question of whether you believe or not.`
` She told me.`
` I heard it.`
` {f:5:Why} won't you believe me?"`
`"D‐don't get up...`
` You'll worsen your wound..."`
`Kanon sat up on the bed, and spoke to Genji, who was making no effort to believe Kanon's story.`
`"She will definitely kill all of us.`
` She's surely killed all of the people in the parlor by now.`
` If we don't kill her first, it will absolutely be us who are killed first.`
` Just like how I was killed first, everyone else will also be killed first.`
` Kill or be killed.`
` Kill or be killed kill or be killed."`
`"...K‐.........Kanon‐san, ......you...`
` ......Does it really not hurt...?"`
`"......Oh, this?`
` It isn't a serious wound."`
`"Wh‐...what do you mean, not a serious wound, ...you......"`
`"It really isn't a big deal.`
` It doesn't hurt at all anymore—it really isn't a serious wound."`
`As Kanon said that, he began to untie his own bandages which had been painstakingly wrapped...`
`The gruesome hole in his chest was immediately exposed...`
`"K‐Kanon‐san...!`
` You mustn't do something like that!`
` Quickly, lie down...!"`
`"I said it's fine.`
` ......Look.`
` See...?`
` It's...not...a serious wound, right...?"`
`Kanon showed off his gaping wound, which was still slowly spitting out foamy blood.`
`...Everyone averted their eyes reflexively.`
`"See, I told you that it wasn't a serious wound at all..."`
`"S‐......stop that... You mustn't play with your wound......"`
`"...Look, see?`
` ......It isn't a deep wound...at all.`
` .........Look.`
` ..................Look."`
`Kanon held up two fingers, showed them to everyone, and slowly started to stick them into the gruesome wound right in the center of his chest...`
`......Plunging, slimy, squishy, wet.`
`{n}The fingers...went in deep...to the base...`
` ......Squich, gloop, blorp...`
`"Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii...!!`
` K‐K‐K‐Kanon‐san, stop it, stop it...!!"`
`Having stuck his fingers completely into his chest......up to their base,`
` ......he slowly pulled them out in exactly the same way...`
`The fingers he pulled out were stained a sticky, solid, deep‐red color, and there was even a thread hanging...`
`...The fingers were, all the way to their base, covered......in deep red...`
`"......Y‐`
`.........you...`
` ......Wh‐wh‐wh‐what in the world.................."`
`".........See?`
` It is...not a serious wound...at all, you see?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`Just then, the door opened vigorously, and Shannon appeared.`
`...Even after she saw Kanon stained with fresh blood, her impregnable expression didn't falter.`
`"......Hey, Nee‐san.`
` Where'd you go?`
` I'm on the verge of death here, where'd you go?"`
`"Well.`
` I went to the boiler room.`
` Looking for something.`
` .........More importantly, I want to check.`
` Are you really...Kanon‐kun?"`
`"......Huh, ......huhh...?"`
`It was only natural.`
` Everyone believed he was Kanon.`
`{n}So they couldn't understand the meaning of Shannon's question.`
`When they looked, they noticed that Shannon was holding a handkerchief in her hand.`
`It was filthy, and looked like she had wiped up some trash or dust.`
`{n}And while holding that, she approached Kanon, .........and drew close to his legs.`
`"What is that......?"`
`"It's a handkerchief with a spider's web wiped onto it."`
`".....................`
` ...Why something like that?"`
`"If you're Kanon‐kun, you should be alright.`
` ......But if {i:spiders are your natural enemy}, I thought you might hate it."`
`"...........................`
` Hahaha, oh no.`
` Why would I hate spiders?"`
`"Sorry, I'll try it."`
`"......Sha‐...Shannon‐san."`
`When Shannon brought that handkerchief close to Kanon's thigh, ......something happened in an instant.`
`It happened all at once.`
` The human eye couldn't have followed it.`
`Kanon jumped back like a wild goat, ...fleeing from the thing Shannon was holding.`
`And his arm drew trails with some kind of afterglow that flashed purple.`
`They were three beautiful purple trails drawn in an arc, and they were traced across the throats of Nanjo and Kumasawa, who had been tending to him.`
`And Nanjo and Kumasawa's throats......had opened like gaping mouths, ...and it was the very instant before the blood was about to start spewing out.`
`The third purple trail should have traced across Shannon's throat.`
`{n}But Shannon wasn't there.`
`Because Genji, who had been behind her, had wrapped his own arm around Shannon's neck and pulled her back.`
`This all happened in an instant.`
`"...........................!!!"`
`In the instant Gohda tried to think fast in an attempt to understand this scene, the frozen moment in time shattered.`
`Blood spewed forcefully from Nanjo and Kumasawa's necks, which had been torn open.`
`Still mid‐jump, Kanon wall‐kicked off a picture frame that had been hanging from the wall behind him, springing forward just like a cat, and aiming for Shannon's throat again.`
`But Kanon's target once again disappeared from in front of him.`
` Because Genji had pulled Shannon again, and the two of them had fallen onto the ground, keeping flat to the floor.`
`"Nice reflexes, you senile old piece of furniture!!"`
`"......Gohda!"`
`"Uu...uooooooooooooooooooooooooooohhh!!"`
`Gohda wasn't an idiot either.`
` Even if he couldn't fully understand what was going on, he at least realized that if this "Kanon" wasn't seized, his own life would also be in peril.`
`He sprung at Kanon with his huge body, pushing him up against the wall with his weight and physical strength.`
`"Uuuoooooooooooooooooohhh...! Ooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!"`
`"Let...me...go, you fatass!!"`
`The tips of the fingers on Kanon's right hand began to trace out another purple trail.`
`And when he raised that blade‐hand up, aiming to strike at Gohda's back, there was a loud thunk.`
`Because Kanon's raised blade‐hand had been pinned to the wall.`
`He couldn't tear his palm away from the wall.`
`Sticking out from it was the knife Genji had thrown.`
`Under normal circumstances, it should have been surprising to see someone as old as Genji handle a knife so skillfully,`
` but in this abnormal space, no one paid it much mind.`
`"Genji‐sama, here...!"`
`"......Yes."`
`Genji took the handkerchief with the spiderweb stuck to it from Shannon.`
`{n}And he approached Kanon, who was pinned to the wall by Gohda's massive body and the knife.`
`"Sto‐stop it...!!`
` Don't co—Don't come near me with that...!!`
` Stop it, sto‐stop!!"`
`"Gyaooooooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!"`
`When Genji pushed the handkerchief up against Kanon's face,`
` ...there was a sound just like the one you hear when you set meat on a red‐hot iron plate.`
`Of course, the smell was the same too.`
` As he was burned and inflamed, festering in filthy red and black, and cried out in his death throes, Kanon's body burst open and scattered.`
`It was almost as though a balloon filled with gold leaf had popped.`
`{n}The entire servant room was completely buried under a storm of gold leaf—no, a rabble of gold butterflies...`
`Those butterflies began to softly fade into nothingness, as though dissolving into water, no, into the air itself,`
` ......and afterwards, all that was left was the three of them sitting on their behinds, stained with blood.`
`However, not everyone was just stained with blood.`
`{n}Some of them were lying on the ground, vomiting blood themselves.`
`"...Kumasawa...!`
` ......Doctor Nanjo...!`
` ....................."`
`A slit so sharp that it looked like it could cut your finger if you touched it was opened wide, causing large amounts of blood to keep pouring out...`
`"What was that, .........j‐...just now............"`
`"..........................."`
`".........Gohda.`
` Have you been injured?"`
`"I, I am alright...`
` But.........what did we see?!`
` What happened?!`
` E‐ev‐ev‐......even though I definitely pushed that thing against this wall with this very hand!"`
`"{i:I cannot understand what happened}...!!"`
`Gohda looked at his own hand.`
`The bright‐red blood left from his scuffle with Kanon...definitely remained.`
`...And yet, Kanon was nowhere to be seen.`
`Because he had disappeared.`
`{n}He had turned into gold butterflies and scattered.`
`Gohda kept screaming alone that he had no clue about what was going on.`
`Shannon sobbed in front of Nanjo's and Kumasawa's remains,`
` ...and Genji watched over her, silent as always...``"Doctor Nanjo and Kumasawa‐san?!`
` What in the world is going on?!"`
`"Aaah, Shannon!`
` Thank goodness you're safe...!`
` If something had happened to you, I...!"`
`"......George‐sama......`
` ......uuuuughh........."`
`"George‐kun, be quiet for a second!`
` A murder occurred before your very eyes, right?!`
` Did you see the culprit?!`
` Or not?!!"`
`"Tha‐......that is, umm,`
` ......how should I explain...?!`
` G‐Genji‐san."`
`"..................Even we cannot explain what we saw very well."`
`"It certainly, umm, ...happened right before our eyes!`
` It was right in front of my eyes!`
` But still,`
` ......that, umm,`
` .........what was that...`
` Even I do not understand!"`
`"What are you saying?!`
` It's impossible for you to have met anyone other than the witch, {f:5:Beatrice}, whose location has been unknown since last night,`
` or Kanon‐kun, who has gone missing!`
` Was it a man or a woman?!`
` You should be able to tell me at least that much, right?!"`
`"Auntie Rosa, calm down a bit...!`
` Anyone would be confused if two people were taken out right in front of them!`
` Gohda‐san, Genji‐san.`
` There's no need to rush.`
` Tell us what happened, one thing at a time."`
`"...............About that... ...How should I say it......"`
`".............................."`
`Doctor Nanjo and Kumasawa‐san had been killed.`
`{n}We understood that much.`
`...And it seemed that it had occurred in front of their eyes.`
`{n}But even so, they spoke awkwardly.`
`They admitted that they had definitely seen the crime with their own two eyes.`
`{n}But when asked to explain what they had seen, their mouths went suddenly shut.`
`I could understand why Auntie Rosa was irritated and losing her patience...`
`"...Shannon.`
` Did you see it?`
` When Doctor Nanjo was attacked."`
`"Ye‐.........yes."`
`"Tell me.`
` ...Just what you understand.`
` What in the world happened?"`
`"..................The back door............`
` ......In through there."`
`"...Tha‐that's right.`
` Someone came up to the back door.`
` Then, wondering who it was, I opened the door..."`
`"Someone at the back door?`
` Who was it?!"`
`"Let them finish!`
` And after that?!"`
`".........That person was...stained with blood, and had a large wound.`
` ...We carried them to the servant room, and Doctor Nanjo immediately began first aid.`
` ......It was a...very deep wound."`
`"For the last time, {i:who} are you talking about?!"`
`"...I don't know!`
` Certainly, ...in the beginning, I thought I knew.`
` No, I still think it was!`
`But.........what in the world was that!!`
` ...I don't know... ...I don't know!!"`
`In a manner that didn't match his large body, Gohda held his head and scratched at it...`
`I didn't have a clue whether he was confused because he couldn't remember,`
` or whether he was confused because he had seen something terrifying, and couldn't accept it.`
`And Shannon looked the same way.`
`If she let her guard down, what she had seen just a short while ago would quickly melt away like a daydream,`
` and she wouldn't even be able to remember what she saw.`
`......That's what she looked like.`
`Only Genji looked composed as usual.`
`...So the questions were naturally directed at Genji.`
`But even Genji had to take quite some time to gather his thoughts before he opened his mouth.`
`"Genji‐san.`
` You saw it, right?`
` Who was the person that came in through the back door?!"`
`"............At first, ...we believed that person...was Kanon."`
`"You see!!`
` He was alive after all!`
` My reasoning was correct!!"`
`"......By "at first", you mean that your impression changed later, right......?"`
`"Yes.`
` .........I cannot explain with words what happened after that.`
` ......It killed Doctor Nanjo and Kumasawa, ......then disappeared.`
` At that time, it was definitely not Kanon."`
`"Yes!`
` That's right!`
` It's just as Genji‐san says!!`
` You really couldn't explain it with words!"`
`"......Do you have the same opinion?"`
`"...Yes............`
` I......can only say the same thing as well......"`
`"..........................."`
`...If we interpreted what they were saying favorably,`
` ......it meant that Auntie Rosa's conclusion had been correct from the beginning.`
`Kanon‐kun had appeared from the back door in the kitchen with a serious injury.`
`{n}Then he had been taken to the servant room and cared for.`
`......Then, something terrifying had happened.`
`Since these people couldn't imagine that Kanon‐kun could have pulled that off, they had started to suspect whether that really had been Kanon‐kun.`
` Is that how things are?`
`In other words, this meant......Kanon‐kun had appeared.`
`{n}No matter how confused they were, no matter how they muddled their words, that's what it meant in the end.`
`So had Kanon‐kun indeed used some trick to escape that room while it was locked?!`
` No, that doesn't matter anymore.`
`The real problem is that Doctor Nanjo and Kumasawa‐san were killed.`
`Auntie Rosa had claimed that Kanon‐kun was behind this from the very beginning.`
`No matter how confused they became and no matter how much they tried to deny it, ...they were halfway saying that it was the truth.`
`......But even so, for some reason, I felt like their awkwardness couldn't be explained just by confusion...`
`......What had they seen?`
`Like they said, had they really {i:seen something unexplainable with words}...?`
`Auntie Rosa, having decided that she wouldn't be able to get any more out of them, concluded her questioning,`
` and said that she wanted to check the two bodies.`
`I was also interested in that.`
`Even if these people didn't have a clue what was going on in their confusion,`
` ...if those of us who hadn't been at the scene calmly looked at the bodies, we might find something.`
`.........But it was a little surprising that Auntie Rosa was also concerned about the bodies, just like I was.`
`Even at this point, I still wanted to expose the culprit and the truth myself, if we could find any clues.`
`But Auntie Rosa should have been different.`
` ......Hadn't Auntie Rosa's plan given a higher priority to staying safe than to finding the culprit?`
`I couldn't really see why Auntie Rosa wanted to check the bodies so badly that she would deliberately leave our fort in the parlor.`
`"We will all go to the servant room together.`
` If we all move together, it'll be safe.`
` Maria, stop that scribbling now!"`
`"Uu.`
` Not scribbliiing.`
` Solving {f:5:Beatrice}'s probleeem.`
` Uu..."`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}'s problem?`
` What's that? Tell me too."`
`"...Auntie Rosa, are you...umm...bringing Maria‐chan too?"`
`It seemed that George‐aniki had some resistance to bringing Maria to the bloody crime scene.`
`...But taking into consideration the fact that Maria would be left alone here, it would surely be much safer if we took Maria with us.`
`......In the end, it was just Aniki's irresponsible humanism.`
`{n}We decided that all of us, including Maria, would go to the servant room.`
`The bed in the servant room was stained with bright‐red blood.`
`...No, not just the bed.`
` The whole room was covered with a gruesome paint from countless blood stains.`
`That dreadful scene alone was enough to give us an idea of the repulsive sight they had been trying to describe...`
`"......Uu.`
` Wanna look too!"`
`"You wait here with me, Maria‐chan, okay?"`
`George‐aniki was standing by the entrance, covering Maria's eyes, with his back to the room.`
`......He probably didn't want to dirty an innocent girl's retinas with the repulsive red in this room.`
`That was surely the correct decision.`
`......I was acting tough right now, so I didn't mind,`
` ......but I would probably remember this room and start to vomit whenever I saw red paint scattered around,`
` for the rest of my life.`
`......My retinas already had this room burned into them.`
`{n}...In other words, it was too late for me...`
`"...............Huh......"`
`"Wh‐...where did they...!"`
`Right after they entered the servant room, Gohda‐san and Shannon‐chan appeared flustered.`
`...We shook, wondering what horrible new situation had arisen to fluster them for a second time.`
`"What happened?`
` What is it?"`
`Auntie Rosa also shuddered, raised her gun high, and searched for whatever it was that had them shaken.`
`......But she couldn't find it.`
` ...Which wasn't surprising.`
`{n}...They were shaken {i:because} they couldn't find it.`
`"Hey, hey, what in the world's going on..."`
`".........The two bodies...aren't here."`
`"What do you mean?"`
`"......Tha‐that can't be...!`
` Those two were definitely...here......!"`
`"...Wait wait wait.`
` What the hell—are you saying the corpses just walked off somewhere?`
` How could that happen?`
` I mean, wasn't the servant room locked?`
` Didn't you unlock the door when you came in just now, Gohda‐san?!"`
`"......So then, what?`
` ...Isn't this the same as Jessica's room?!`
` They've disappeared from inside a locked room again?!`
` That's ridiculous!!"`
`"I don't have a clue what happened either!!`
` When we left this room, we definitely locked it, and......!!`
` I don't have a clue what's going on anymore...!!"`
`There was a timid and pitiful smile on Gohda‐san's face that he definitely wouldn't have let show normally.`
`Shannon was the same.`
`"Both their corpses disappeared!`
` And furthermore, they disappeared while the door was locked!`
` Even if the culprit was Kanon‐kun, he shouldn't be holding a master key anymore!!"`
`"That's wrong...!`
` Kanon‐kun is not the culprit...!!"`
`"......Shannon...`
` I believe Shannon.`
` Kanon‐kun is not the culprit.`
` This must be the doing of someone who looks a lot like him."`
`"No.`
` Kanon‐kun could have gotten a master key.`
` ......After all, his master key was found in the pocket of Jessica‐chan's body.`
` ...And who took that key?"`
`"!!`
` Th‐that's right!`
` It was Doctor Nanjo......!!"`
`That's right.`
` Back then, it definitely had been Doctor Nanjo who searched through Jessica's clothes and found the master key...!`
`So, if someone had the opportunity to search Doctor Nanjo's corpse, it would have been easy for them to take the master key back...`
`Auntie Rosa searched under the bed and in the locker.`
`...By now, I also understood what that meant.`
`{n}If you assume that there had been two culprits, it could be easily explained.`
`The first person was Kanon‐kun, or maybe an impostor that looked like him.`
`{n}He had finished off Doctor Nanjo and ran off somewhere.`
`The second person was......probably the 19th person, {f:5:Beatrice}, whose location was unknown.`
`She had hidden under the bed in the servant room beforehand, and with Doctor Nanjo's body still enshrined here, she had waited for Genji‐san and the rest to leave.`
`Then after that, she had crawled out, taken the master key back from Doctor Nanjo's pocket, and carried the two bodies away for some reason.`
`If she had then locked the door with the master key, this locked room would be created.`
`"*cackle*cackle*.`
` You constructed that one pretty fast with your reasoning from Jessica's room as a premise.`
` With that method, you could indeed create a locked room even without magic.`
` Should I give you passing marks?`
` However, as truly fascinating as it was, ......there is something you must not forget."`
`"...If the culprit had taken the master key back by the method you say,`
` ......that culprit...`
`{i:would have to have known that Nanjo had taken the master key from Jessica's body}."`
`"......You don't have to tell me that...`
` You're probably trying to say that it's information only the people in that place, at that time, could know..."`
`"......Heh!`
` This third locked room was crushed so fast that you can't do anything but gripe.`
` There's no art in repeating the same content..."`
`Even though I was acting tough, that move of the witch's hurt bad...`
`{n}......I could feel cracks forming in the thing I most wanted to deny.`
`She's trying to close in on me from two directions.`
`On the one hand, there's the frontal attack, where she tries to force me to believe in witches, using locked room tricks that only a witch could do.`
`......And on the other hand, there's the rear attack, where she tries to lure me into thinking it would be better if there was a witch, by strengthening my suspicions of those close to me.`
`In the first locked room, the chapel, she had used the frontal attack, but it hadn't worked on me.`
`That's undoubtedly why, with the second locked room, and now the third, she's started to change the direction of her attack...`
`However, the fact that she was changing the direction of her attack also proved that my resistance was working a little.`
`...And she had surely given up on the frontal attack because she couldn't just win directly with it...`
`.........I tried to force myself to accept my own position by thinking that.`
`{n}But it seemed that the witch had seen through these thoughts of mine long ago.`
`"*cackle*cackle*.`
` The frontal attack is indispensable.`
` ...The rear attack only has meaning because it advances at the same time as the frontal attack.`
` If I were to degenerate into only using the rear attack, it would be nothing more than a foolish plan occurring when my means became my goal."`
`"...Ihihi, really?`
` Well then, won't you repeat "no one was hiding in the servant room" in that red you're so proud of?"`
`"There is no need.`
` The premise of your reasoning is about to be destroyed."`
`"Oh, oh?!`
` You decline?!`
` So someone really is hiding?!"`
`"Rosa will destroy your premise right now.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*!`
` Well, try listening in."`
`"Please believe us, Rosa‐sama...!!`
` The two bodies were certainly lying here!`
` The bright‐red blood on the floor is theirs...!!"`
`Auntie Rosa began to search through various objects around the room, her back to Gohda‐san as he cried out in supplication.`
`......Eventually, she found something, and for a while, stopped moving.`
`"Rosa‐sama, we definitely aren't lying...!!`
` The two bodies were definitely here!!"`
`"Quiet down.`
` .........The person who hid the corpses has confessed that they took them to another place.`
` .........With this."`
`Rosa showed them a single sheet of paper over her shoulder.`
`"What on Earth is that?!`
` It couldn't be......a letter in a sealed envelope with crest, just like in the chapel?!"`
`"......Yes, that's right.`
` It was set here, out in the open.`
` I'll read it."`
`{e:070:―People of the Ushiromiya family.`
`I wonder if your attempts at solving the epitaph's riddle for the gold are reaching a climax.`
`Solving the riddle of the epitaph is the single method by which you all can stop me.}`
`{e:070:You will not be able to stop me, or the ritual, by way of any other method of any kind.`
`I ask all of you that you take care not to mistake your goal.}`
`{e:070:Attempting to search for me is useless.`
`Attempting to escape from me is useless.`
`Attempting to deny me is also—useless.`
`—{f:5:Beatrice} the Golden.}`
`"......P.S.`
` I borrowed the two bodies for the ritual.`
` I will return them later, so please accept my apologies.`
` ...Furthermore, since these keys belong to all of you, I shall return them."`
`As Rosa read that aloud, the contents of the envelope lay exposed on the palm of her hand.`
`They were two master keys.`
`{n}The master key that Nanjo had found in Jessica's pocket, which had originally been Kanon's, and Kumasawa's master key.`
`"What the helllllll......`
` So what does that mean...`
` Damn you, again?!`
` You're saying I can only suspect the servants holding keys again?!"`
`"I haven't said it in red, you know...?`
` I haven't denied the possibility that at the time they locked the door and left, someone was hiding in this room...`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`"......If they were hiding under the bed, it wouldn't have been impossible for them to have carried the corpses away somewhere.`
` But that way they couldn't lock the door!`
` The master key they went to all that trouble to get their hands on was set down right here!"`
`"......That's right, I'd forgotten.`
` What about the keys specifically for this room, the servant room keys?!"`
`"Mmhm.`
` Those {p:1:are in the key box in the center of the servant room}.`
` There are several servant room keys, but {p:1:all of those are inside the key box}."`
`"Which means that the situation isn't any different from the time with the key to Jessica's room...`
` It's not like the servants would walk around with an unnecessary key when they have those convenient master keys.`
` I can accept that they were all still shut away in the key box..."`
`"And nothing has changed in the other conditions.`
` {p:1:Entry and exit are impossible except for the single door and the single window}.`
` Therefore, hidden doors and irregular methods of entry cannot exist.`
` Rejoice, great detectives.`
` *cackle*!"`
`"`
`{p:1:And those were both locked}.`
` {p:1:The door and the window do not permit any kind of entry or exit when they are locked}.`
` So it won't work to remove the door, make a crack to slide in through, or anything like that while the lock is maintained.`
` And obviously, {p:1:it is impossible to unlock the door without the servant room key or a master key}."`
`"...It's a pain having to read all these aloud every time.`
` Sooner or later, I should think of some word to abbreviate all this into a single phrase."`
`"But you can't repeat that no one was hiding in this room!`
` ......However, that alone won't break open the door of a locked room...`
` Aaah, damn it, damn it!!`
` It's no good, no good, no goddamn good at all...!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` What happened to that flipping over the chessboard thing that you're so proud of...?`
` Please, announce your boastful strange theory."`
`"...............Flip over...the chessboard.`
` ............What would I do if I were the culprit?`
` I carry the corpses off somewhere.`
` ......I leave a letter.`
` .........I lock the door from the inside.`
` ......Then I just have to escape this room by some means."`
`".........Damn it, is that even possible?!`
` I was told in red that you can't get outside except by the door or the window...!"`
`"..................ah—"`
`......At that moment, ......I got it.`
` That's right.`
`......Carry the corpses, leave the letter.`
`{n}......And not rely on a "hidden door"—{i:in other words, not even able to escape}.`
`...That's it.`
` This isn't a question, it's an answer......`
`"Beato.`
` ......Before my repetition request, I want to check the {i:definition of these hidden doors} that you're talking about."`
`"What have you thought of?`
` Very well, I'll explain.`
` A hidden door refers to an entrance or exit that cannot be recognized by those who do not know of it.`
` Even children know that."`
`"......So in other words, if you can't get outside the room with it, it isn't a hidden door?"`
`"Hoh.`
` .........That angle."`
`"I kept thinking that the culprit had escaped the locked room."`
`"......That's wrong.`
` Even the culprit couldn't escape the locked room!`
` So the culprit decided to hide until we passed by!"`
` I had used this theory for the second locked room, and reasoned that Kanon‐kun might have done this.`
`......But I had given up that reasoning when I was told "Kanon‐kun was killed" in red.`
`And next, I had reasoned that if there had been a third person in the room, it would have been possible for them to escape through a hidden door.`
`And that was when, for the first time, the claim had been made in red that "no hidden doors exist".`
`And what I'd learned just now.`
` These "hidden doors" the witch was talking about referred to things that made it possible to get into or out of the room.`
`......In other words, things that didn't permit entry or exit to the outside, and also wouldn't be noticed by people who didn't know about them, wouldn't fall under the definition of "hidden door".`
`In other words, if there were, for example, something like a "hidden shelf" or a "secret closet", they wouldn't be defined as "hidden doors"!`
`In other words, the third person in Jessica's room was hiding here, waiting for us to pass by!`
`Heh, how pathetic, just a little playing around with words!`
`{n}With this method, it looks like I can even manage the third locked room, the servant room.`
`If there's a hidden shelf under the bed or anything like that, that would be enough.`
`{n}The culprit's hiding somewhere, waiting for us to leave.`
`.........The culprit is also trapped in the locked room even now!!`
`Which means......at this very moment!`
`The culprit is still hiding in the servant room, holding their breath...!!!`
`And that means......... What the hell...`
`Even though we've been tortured with locked rooms three times,`
` ......in this very moment, we've actually gotten the culprit in checkmate!!`
`"I've finally started to see it.`
` ......Take this, Beato!!"`
`"Repetition requested!`
` "There is no one in this room other than us"!`
` By us, I mean me, George‐aniki, Maria, Auntie Rosa, Genji‐san, Gohda‐san, and Shannon‐chan, alright?!`
` Well?!! You can't say it, can you?!"`
`".........Hoh......`
` .........Hoh......!"`
`"I'll bet I hit you where it hurts!!`
` If you decline, then say you decline, damn it!!`
` Here comes the next one!!`
` Repetition requested!!"`
`I don't know how they're hiding in this room.`
`But if that's a fact, then this also resolves the second locked room, Jessica's room, at the same time!!`
`I've finally caught her by the tail!`
`{n}With this, I can explain everything!`
`{n}Witches don't exist, I don't have to doubt anyone!!`
`Alright, starting now, I'll flip it over!`
` The next thing I'll request she repeat is—`
`"`
`{p:1:No one exists in this room except your group}.`
` {p:1:"Your group" refers to Battler, George, Maria, Rosa, Genji, Gohda, and Shannon}."`
`"......Wha‐............"`
`"Let's go back to Jessica's room.`
` {p:1:At the time of Jessica's corpse discovery,`
` only Battler, George, Maria, Rosa, Genji, Gohda, Shannon, Kumasawa, and Nanjo were in Jessica's room}."`
`"Whoops, the corpse of {p:1:Jessica is also included, of course}.`
` {p:1:Therefore, both in the case of Jessica's room and the case of this servant room, no humans exist that you were not aware of}.`
` {p:1:No one is hiding}."`
`"And I'll say more.`
` {p:1:No method exists by which the doors can be locked from the outside without using a key}.`
` {p:1:Regarding the windows, no method exists by which they could somehow be locked from the outside}."`
`"And while I'm at it.`
` {p:1:You are incompetent}!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*, {p:1:hiiihhi{0}hi{0}hhi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi}!!"`
`"S‐.........son of a biiiiitch......`
` Then.........it really is......a locked room, isn't it............"`
`"It, ...it was so hard to think of, too.`
` If you had been hiding...that explanation would fit everything.`
` Just when I thought I'd broken the trick... .........Damn iiit..."`
`".........u............uoooooooooooooooooooooohhh!!"`
`It's no good no good no good no goddamn good!!`
`{n}For a second, I thought I had it!`
` It was no goddamn good at all!!`
`{f:5:Beatrice}, you bitch,`
` I thought you were all smoke and mirrors, playing word games that made clever use of red,`
` I was certain you'd just cleverly deceived me...!!`
`......Just when I thought I'd seen a light in the darkness,`
` ............it disappeared,`
` .........it just disappeared.........`
`swallowed up...`
`...by a blood‐red sea.........!`
`Red,`
` ...`
`...`
`red`
` red`
` red`
` red!!`
`No one is hiding!`
` And there's no hidden door, and no way to trick the doors or the windows while they're locked!!`
`Have you just proven that it's all impossible?!`
`Has the Devil's Proof...`
`...been pulled off...`
`...with a frontal attack?!`
`Impossible,`
` ......this is impossible!!`
`"What's wrong, Ushiromiya Battlerr?`
` Weren't you so confident you could deny witchesss?`
` Why are you groveling and wringing out bitter tears in a place like thaaat?"`
`"Oh, yes, that's a really wonderful method.`
` Truly wonderful how you're trying to make me fall over laughing and drown in a sea of the tears of my own laughter.`
` That's what you're really trying to do, riight?`
` You're trying to make me laugh and laugh and laugh myself to death, riight,`
` U`
`shiro`
`miya`
` Batt`
`le`
`e`
`rr`
`???"`
`"Magic?! Screw that! I'll definitely deny witches exist!!`
` I'll never believe in you!!`
` You used the power of magic,`
` ......and bullied and killed everyone for fun?`
` ......I'm never gonna accept thaaaaaaaat!!"`
`"Hey, Battler?`
` Sorry for bullying you too much.`
` I'll "flip over the chessboard" from my side.`
` I'll teach your side the best move in your place.`
` Want to heeeeeaar??"`
`"Screw you, I don't wanna hear, I don't wanna hear!!"`
`"The case of Jessica's room.`
` You really struck on a good spot, you know...?`
` Trying to hide and wait for you to pass by.`
` That truly was a good observation."`
`"...But why did you think that could only be Kanon or me, the 19th person......?`
` I see, the "hide" part of "hide and wait for you to pass" must have gotten in the way, so you didn't think that far."`
`"...Loooook, now do you understand?`
` It's Jessica.`
` Jeeeessicaaaaaa!!"`
`If Jessica were the culprit, ......a farce like this could be easily constructed!!`
`She killed Kanon‐kun, and carried him off somewhere!`
`{n}Then, she played dead and let us walk by!`
`But that's ridiculous!!`
` Doctor Nanjo had definitely checked that she was dead!`
` So is Doctor Nanjo an accomplice too?!`
`That's wrong!!`
` I had also made sure that Jessica was really dead!`
` Sure, I'd never performed an examination of a corpse before, but she was definitely dead!`
`I think she was dead!!`
` No, she probably, surely, definitely, at least I think so but she has to be, no, no......`
` ...She was dead!!`
` She was dead!!!`
`"Jessica was also an accomplice.`
` And Nanjo, who examined her corpse, was also an accomplice.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!`
` Then the third locked room was a faaaarce."`
`Yeah, then it's simple.`
` Doctor Nanjo was an accomplice so in other words, he was on the culprits' side so in other words in other words...`
`he was never killed in the first place?!`
`We thought he had been killed and the body had disappeared, but he wasn't in the servant room in the first place?!`
`Then is Kumasawa baa‐chan, who disappeared with him, also an accomplice?!`
`......That's not all that's not all!`
`{n}The servants who are going along with that story—Genji‐san and Gohda‐san, and even Shannon‐chan are accomplices!`
`Then, the one who stole the key from Maria's handbag was Jessica,`
` ...no no, it's also possible it was George‐aniki!`
`After all, if Shannon‐chan was on the culprit's side, then George‐aniki would automatically be on the culprit's side as well!!`
`Wait a second just wait a second, they're all wolves...`
`{n}They're all wolves!!`
`Not only am I drowning in an ocean of bright‐red blood,`
` there are packs of wolves clamoring on the banks, whose blazing eyes tell me that if I crawl out, they'll eat me!!`
`Which way should I die?!`
`{n}Will I have everything denied, and drown in a bright‐red sea?!`
`{n}Will I know the truth, and have my whole body chewed to bits by the wolves?!`
`It's either one hell or the other!!`
` I can't choose!`
`{n}Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!!!`
`"That is why I am here...!!`
` {p:1:Come on, Ushiromiya Battler, kneel}.`
` Then swear your eternal loyalty and lick my shoes...!!"`
`"{p:1:If you accept me, all of the riddles will be resolved}.`
` {p:1:With my power, any kind of locked room can be created or destroyed}!!"`
`"Battler, don't you want to abandon yourself to the joy of surrendering to one with poweeeer??`
` {p:1:I'll make you my favorite piece of furniture}.`
` {p:1:I'll love you so much and make you my toy until you turn to ashes}..."`
`"{p:1:*cackle*cackle*cackle*hihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hya{0}hya{0}hya{0}hha{0}hha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hha{0}hha{0}hha{0}hha{0}hha{0}hhahha}!!!"`
`".........Now it's clear.`
` There's no longer any reason to doubt."`
`"Hm...?`
` ......What do you mean by that......?"`
`"Those two that you kept saying were dead aren't here.`
` ...And now we have the letter from {f:5:Beatrice}, where she was kind enough to confess that she carried the corpses off.`
` ......That's what it is."`
`"I've had enough of this farce!!"`
`As Auntie Rosa yelled this, she looked over at everyone with a harsh expression.`
`"Fa‐`
`......farce?`
` ......What do you mean...?!"`
`"I said it in Jessica‐chan's room.`
` ......You can't trust anyone but yourself and those whose corpses have been found."`
`"And since we cannot find the corpses, there's no reason we should accept that those two were killed."`
`"......P‐please wait, Auntie Rosa.`
` What do you mean by that...?!"`
`"Doctor Nanjo and Kumasawa‐san aren't dead, they're alive!`
` They made it seem like they were killed, and are hiding somewhere in this mansion.`
` So that they can attack us!!"`
`"How could you know that?!`
` Are you saying that Gohda‐san and the rest are lying?!"`
`"......Rosa‐sama!!`
` I swear—no, all of the Ushiromiya family servants do!`
` We all swear that we would do nothing of the sort!!"`
`"You all say that those two were killed.`
` But since there are no corpses, there's no reason to believe that.`
` There's a chance that you worked out a story beforehand, and that you're lying about that!!"`
`"There's a good way to prove your innocence, isn't there?`
` For Doctor Nanjo's and Kumasawa‐san's bodies to be found!!"`
`"If we find them, then maybe I'll start listening to your story.`
` But until we do, you cannot deny that you are all wolves!!"`
`"You too!`
` And you!!`
` You were probably bought by that witch, your eyes blinded with gold!!`
` Do you really want money that much?!`
` That's right, isn't it?!`
` You want to play around for the rest of your life?!`
` What is that kind of life worth?!!"`
`"Rosa‐sama...!!`
` We...... We couldn't!"`
`"Silence!`
` And Shannon, don't get any closer!!`
` I can't believe that you would repay a ten‐year‐long debt of gratitude with betrayal!!`
` I'll pull the trigger without mercy!!"`
`"How......`
` .........How could you...`
` .........It's too......`
`cruel......"`
`"......A‐Auntie Rosa!!`
` That's horrible!!`
` A murder occurred in this room!`
` Then the culprit carried the corpses away!`
` They are only honestly reporting that to us!!"`
`".........uuu, ......uuuUUuuUUuughhu!!!"`
`Shannon had finally broken down in tears...`
`She had sacrificed ten years to the Ushiromiya family.`
`{n}She had sacrificed ten of the most brilliant years of her life.`
`.........And she had believed that she had built up a friendly relationship with Rosa, as well.`
`...And this was how she was treated!!`
`{n}You could kill a person without using a knife...`
`It wasn't just George‐aniki;`
` ...even I could recognize that Shannon‐chan had been stabbed deep into her heart, as blood by the name of tears flowed out...`
`"Shannon‐san, stay back...`
` ......Rosa‐sama, it is true that I have not served for many years, and I understand that I have not earned your trust..."`
`"...However, ......could you not at least believe Shannon‐san...?!`
` She has dedicated a full ten years of service to the Ushiromiya family...!"`
`"I'm not telling you to believe me...!`
` At the very least, would you at least believe Shannon‐san...?!!"`
`...But......I don't understand anymore!!`
`{n}I don't understand!!`
`We can't seek an answer without suspecting them!!!`
`That's it, bit by bit I'm starting to understand...`
`......It's because we seek an answer; ...that's why everything keeps getting stranger...`
`We don't need...an answer.`
` These are all strange murders committed with bizarre magic by the 19th person, the witch {f:5:Beatrice}, as she follows a creepy ritual.`
`............Isn't that......good enough.........`
`I don't...want to suspect...anyone anymore.........`
`Shannon‐chan and Gohda‐san were protesting their innocence, half in tears.`
`Genji‐san quietly stopped that.`
`"............Stop.`
` ...What Rosa‐sama says is quite right.`
` ...Until we find the corpses,`
` {i:we cannot prove that Doctor Nanjo and Kumasawa are innocent}."`
`That's right.`
` ......By Rosa‐san's argument, if the corpses could be found, then the innocence of at least those people could be proved.`
`But only the people who were corpses.`
` Even if they searched around the mansion and found the corpses, in the end, their own innocence would not be proved.`
`They had abducted Doctor Nanjo and Kumasawa‐san, killed them in another place, and locked the room with their own master keys.`
`Unless the locked room could be broken by a method other than that one,`
` ......it would be impossible to prove their innocence...`
`......But, .........that couldn't be done!!`
`They only have one chance to prove their innocence.`
`......That can only happen when they meet with the culprit, become corpses, and are reunited with Auntie Rosa.`
`That's messed up!!`
` Innocent if they die, guilty as long as they live, almost like a witch's trial!`
`...Oh, right, the enemy's a witch.`
`{n}So that makes it OK...?`
`"......Rosa‐sama.`
` We are furniture working for the Ushiromiya family.`
` ......Whether we are trusted by you or not, that is not our concern.`
` No matter what assessment you give us, we will only continue to serve until our final hour."`
`"You really are a model servant.`
` ...I truly understand why Father trusts you.`
` It is truly heartrending that I must suspect even you."`
`"........................"`
`Genji‐san stuck his hand into his pocket and pulled out a master key.`
`...Then he set it on an adjacent table.`
`"......I believe that I hold this as a proof of trust.`
` If that has been lost, I think it is only natural that I return it."`
`"..................`
` ......That's good judgment.`
` Those master keys are the greatest basis upon which you have been suspected several times today.`
` Relinquishing them in order to clear away that suspicion may only be a first step,`
` but, well, I think it isn't a bad start."`
`"...............You two."`
`Genji‐san looked at Gohda‐san and Shannon‐chan.`
`......The two of them nodded, and set their own master keys onto the table.`
`Auntie Rosa lay the two master keys that had come out of the envelope on top.`
`With that, all five master keys were gathered in this place.`
`In other words, this was proof that all of the servants' service until today had been negated,`
` and even the final honor that they should have been permitted had been stripped from them...`
`"Maria, give me that handbag."`
`"......Uu!!`
` Give it baaack!!"`
`Auntie Rosa snatched Maria's handbag, tossed all the master keys in there noisily, then lifted one out and held it up for all to see.`
`She was announcing that she had all of the master keys.`
`"A‐.........are you satisfied now, Aunt Rosa?`
` ......Now the only master keys are the ones you are holding yourself.`
` ......I hope you're satisfied!!"`
`"Yes, I'm satisfied.`
` Even if I can't trust anyone, I can at least trust myself!"`
`"I've been able to get the gun and all the master keys for myself!`
` Now, I don't have to suspect anyone.`
` You're all happy too, right?`
` Now you don't have to be suspected anymore!`
` Ahahahahahahahahaha, hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐ha!"`
`".........Kihihihihi."`
`Then, Maria, who had looked like a spectator off by herself, sneered at her mother.`
`...Auntie Rosa reacted nervously to that laugh, and turned around.`
`"......Keys don't matter.`
` ......{f:5:Beatrice} can open doors with magic.`
` She doesn't need keys.`
` ...It doesn't matter who has or doesn't have something like that.`
` Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi...!"`
`"Aren't I always telling you to stop laughing like that?!!`
` ......?`
` What is iiiit, Battler‐kun?"`
`...I had just cut between the two of them.`
`......No, that's not it.`
`...I was on my knees, and hugging Maria's head.`
`{n}......I was......crying.`
`"Just...stop it already, Auntie Rosa......`
` ...Maria was...right......"`
`"......Wha‐...what are you talking about......?"`
`".........Maria...`
` I'm sorry for...`
`......doubting.`
` ......I'm sorry for...`
`......not believing."`
`"...............Battler."`
`"It was all...`
`...the witch's doing...`
` ......The witch's...`
`...doing......`
` ...All that stuff about tricks and locked rooms never mattered..."`
`".........It's just, it's just...`
`.........that the witch {f:5:Beatrice} actually exists,`
` .........and she really was a witch...`
` ......Because I didn't believe that,`
` ............it was this painful,`
` ............this sad............"`
`".........Battler, ......you believe in {f:5:Beatrice}......?"`
`"Yes...!`
` I believe.`
` ...{f:5:Beatrice} "exists".`
` And she's a witch, who uses strange magic...!"`
`"Battler......"`
`Maria let go of my hand, ...and then she was the one holding my head.`
`"......That's the way, Battler.`
` ............{f:5:Beatrice} "existed".`
` ......You just couldn't believe that easily, so couldn't see her.`
` ............The witch "exists".`
` "Exists".`
` Will soon "come"."`
`".........You believed in Beato, so I'm sure you'll be invited to the Golden Land.`
` ......Very soon.`
` ......It'll be very soon.`
` Nothing to be afraid of anymore."`
`"............Not afraid, okay?`
` Always be with me, holding hands, okay...?`
` Let's solve the epitaph's riddle together.`
` Let's think about Beato's problem.`
` .........Beato has been saying it from the beginning.`
` She hasn't said anything other than let's play and solve the problem."`
`"Right...... She did......`
` Searching for the culprit was just a total waste of time...`
` ......If only we had...`
`...just believed in...`
`...the witch........."`
`After softly brushing my cheek as my tears kept dripping down,`
` ......Maria kissed my forehead, as soft as a feather.`
`For just that instant, ......Maria's smile, which I had once thought was creepy, looked like an angel...`
`"We have returned the master keys, ...but our loyalty to the Ushiromiya family will not change.`
` .........From now on, we will not enter the parlor without permission.`
` Rosa‐sama, please lock the parlor from the inside."`
`"......You truly are an admirable person.`
` When the typhoon passes, ......if the cries of the seagulls return to this island again,`
` .........I wonder if we will be able to trust each other once more."`
`"......If you were to grant us your trust once again, there would be no greater pleasure."`
`"You're right.`
` ......We'll definitely be able to understand each other.`
` ......When the seagulls cry."`
`".........It would probably be better if we left this room as it is until the police come.`
` Rosa‐sama, if you would please lock it.`
` ......We will return to the kitchen.`
` If you need anything, please command us at any time."`
`"Thank you.`
` ............If you are a wolf,`
` how shamelessly you speak."`
`"......And if you are a sheep,`
` .........I'm sorry for throwing you into the wolf cage."`
`"......Furniture entrusts its fate to the family.`
` ......Even if it comes to throwing away this life, if by that your trust could be regained,`
` it would be a great honor."`
`".....................`
` I hope that you all can remain healthy until the typhoon passes, if that is at all possible.`
` This is all a rhapsody of blowing winds and pouring rain performed by the typhoon.`
` ......When the performance ends, and the curtain closes,`
` ......we will surely be able to grasp hands together again."`
`"......When the seagulls...cry."`
`Auntie Rosa nodded in response...`
`Genji‐san turned on his heels.`
`{n}He left the servant room.`
`Gohda‐san's face was still streaked with tears,`
` ......but as he had listened to Genji‐san's words, maybe he had managed to sort out his heart.`
`......His face had been truly shameful,`
` ......but it had returned to the face of the Gohda‐san we knew well.`
`".........I will also be waiting in the kitchen.`
` ......If you need anything, please command me at any time.`
` .........If you wish for some warm food, I promise to have the very best prepared for you."`
`"............Thank you.`
` I would like to ask you for breakfast tomorrow.`
` ......And the boat will probably come by midday tomorrow.`
` ...Thanks for everything up until now.`
` Your cooking was my only pleasure on Rokkenjima."`
`"...Certainly.`
` I promise you, I will prepare a supreme breakfast.`
` Please, look forward to tomorrow morning."`
`"Thank you.`
` ............And Shannon‐chan.`
` Tomorrow morning, ...let's make up while drinking some delicious coffee."`
`"............"`
`"......?`
` George‐kun?"`
`"......I'm...going with them too."`
`"...It's alright, George‐sama...`
` Please, return to the parlor.`
` There are no more master keys anymore.`
` So if you are with Rosa‐sama in the parlor, you won't be threatened by anyone."`
`"That's right.`
` ...That's how things are.`
` ...Objectively speaking, I think that being with me in the parlor would be the safest."`
`"......But I won't force you to stay with us.`
` George‐kun, you may stay in any place you feel is safe.`
` .........You are already an adult.`
` It's up to you where and with whom you spend the time until tomorrow morning."`
`".........Yes.`
` I will decide, by myself...`
`who I'll spend the night with."`
`"A‐.........Aniki......"`
`"Battler‐kun, stay with Auntie Rosa in the parlor.`
` I'm sure that's safest.`
` ......Compared to that, I think being outside the parlor isn't as safe.`
` ......So I can't leave her in a place like that alone."`
`"......It's......not like I suspect Shannon‐chan and the other servants—`
`no, anyone at all......`
` I don't want to suspect anyone..."`
`"The inheritance?`
` The gold?`
` ...That's just stupid...`
` ...There's no way people are killing each other over that......"`
`"Yes.`
` I know better than anyone how pure your heart is, Battler‐kun.`
` ......No one will blame you.`
` No one."`
`"..................Anikii..."`
`"...It's okay.`
` I'll protect you.`
` ......If you're with me, even {f:5:Beatrice} can't lay a hand on you.`
` 'Cause even though I'm small, I'm a witch."`
`"Yeah.`
` .........Maria‐chan.`
` I'm leaving Battler‐kun in your care.`
` .........Alright, Shannon.`
` Let's go."`
`"Yes......`
` ......Rosa‐sama, if you would excuse me.`
` If you have an order, please call me at any time."`
`".........I'm sorry for saying something so cruel just now.`
` ............I don't expect you to have forgiven me by tomorrow morning.`
` But when tomorrow morning comes, let me apologize again."`
`"Yes...`
` ............Thank you very much."`
`George‐aniki and Shannon‐chan left the servant room together.`
`.........Now, only Maria, Auntie Rosa and I were left in this disgusting, blood‐stained room.`
`Until Genji‐san disappeared—until Gohda‐san disappeared—until George‐aniki and Shannon‐chan disappeared—we stood there, in a daze...`
`After their presence and their footsteps had disappeared completely, Auntie Rosa giggled at them, as though she had just remembered something pleasant.`
`".........You can't trust them at all.`
` Goddamn furniture."`
`That one sentence...`
`...made me choke.`
`"...Wh‐`
`.........why are you...`
`.........saying...`
`something like that......?"`
`"There are five master keys in all?`
` Who would believe that?`
` It's obvious that some duplicate keys exist.`
` ......As if we could trust them just because they pulled keys out of their pockets...!!"`
`"Th‐......that's not fair.........`
` By, ......by setting down those keys, ......they weren't just letting go of the keys..."`
`"......You've...made all their hard work count for nothing, disgraced it, trampled it,`
` .........and caused them to give up the keys at the end of it all......"`
`"What's with that parting line...`
` They've shown that they're willing to go this far, ......and you still can't trust them?!`
` Too much... That's just too much......!"`
`"It's a Devil's Proof!`
` There are five master keys in all?!`
` It's impossible to prove something like that!!`
` You can show that there are five master keys by placing them here!`
` But you can't prove that no more than five exist!!`
` Only a demon or a witch could prove something like that, you know?!"`
`"Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!`
` Stop it already stop it already...!!"`
`"Please, {f:5:Beatrice}, show yourself right now,`
` and tell Auntie Rosa in red that "there are only five master keys"!!`
` Please, I beg you, this can only be proved by devils, a witch like you could prove it!"`
`"Please, Beato, show yourself here and tell Auntie Rosa...`
`that those are all of the master keys, and that there's no need to suspect anyone anymore...!!!"`
`"`
`{p:1:There are only five master keys}.`
` {p:1:There are only five master keys}."`
`"...*cackle*, whatever could be wrong?`
` It doesn't reach Rosa's ears no matter how often I say it.`
` It seems there must still be someone who denies that I exist, isn't that riiiight?`
` Ushiromiya Battleeeeeeeer???"`
`"I accept it!!`
` I accept it, you exist you exist you definitely exist!`
` So, I beg you, stop this already!!`
` Stop it already! Stop it already!!`
` HiiiiIIIiiiiiIiiiiiiii!!"`
`"Your words alone will not reach me; show it with your actions.`
` Swear from your heart that you will become my furniture."`
`"Can you do it?`
` Take off your clothes, be naked, then put both your hands flat and crawl on the ground.`
` Clothing is proof of one's humanity.`
` From now on, you will become furniture, so you will lose that right, it's only natural!!"`
`"Then kneel, make your tongue crawl on my shoes.`
` Can you do it?`
` You can do it, riiiiiiiight??`
` Then I'll appear, sure, I'll say it in red, sure!`
` I'll tell Rosa that {p:1:there are only five master keys}!!"`
`"Oh, but I understand, there's no way you could throw away your lordly pride.`
` But that's alright, that's more than enough, you're starting to waver a bit, aren't youu?"`
`"For just an instant, you thought maybe it would be alright to lick my shoes, didn't youuu?`
` And you immediately denied that and felt ashamed, riiiiight??`
` Just looking at that expression makes me feel just wooonderful!!"`
`"That face of yours is so pathetic, go look in a mirror,`
` see how low you are there, naked and licking my shoooooes?`
` Can you see it, Ushiromiya Battleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeer???"``"............Unbelievable.`
` ......Are you...saying that's the truth?"`
`"......Yes.`
` ......We described everything as we saw it."`
`George folded his arms and started humming again.`
`{n}...And the kitchen was once again absorbed by a long silence.`
`"George‐sama, I understand well why you aren't able to believe it so suddenly.`
` ...After all, ...even though I'm sure I saw it with my own eyes, I still don't know what it was I saw..."`
`"I'm sure I saw it.`
` And I'm sure I even got into a scuffle with it!`
` And yet, ......I almost feel like it was all an illusion..."`
`"...I see.`
` ......So that's why you couldn't go into the details in front of Auntie Rosa."`
`"......If you had actually told her what you just told me, then it would have created even bigger problems.`
` ...Yes, I now understand that Genji‐san handled it all in a remarkably composed fashion."`
`"...............If only I had the power to explain it."`
`George had not actually seen it, so even when pressed to believe, he just couldn't imagine it.`
`......It was only natural.`
` Because even the people who had actually seen it had ended up questioning themselves as to what it was...`
`"...Let me back up a bit.`
` ......Shannon, you said that when you thought Kanon‐kun was an impostor, you went to pick up some spider webs, right?`
` Why did you do that?"`
`"......That's right, I was thinking about that as well.`
` Why spider webs?"`
`"I heard it once from Kumasawa‐san.`
` ......A long time ago, evil spirits lived in Rokkenjima, and they, umm, feared spider webs.`
` And they say there's a legend that people treasured spider webs as wards against magic."`
`"......So I, umm, ......just went with it.`
` I, I think I was also a bit confused..."`
`"............Interesting story.`
` ...Kumasawa was very knowledgeable about those kinds of tales."`
`"Spiders are useful, after all.`
` ......Certainly, the existence of such a creed isn't strange at all."`
`"............I'm sure...`
`...that torii shrine was entrapping the power of those evil spirits.`
` ...And since the spirit mirror was broken, that power revived...`
` ......I have no doubt that it became the power to make {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama revive..."`
`"............If I,`
` ......while I was in that weak‐hearted state,`
` .........hadn't done such an outrageous thing.........`
` Uuuuughh...!!"`
`"...Shannon.`
` You don't have to worry about that anymore.`
` ......I don't blame you for that."`
`Since long ago, Shannon had often hinted at a certain occult aspect regarding how she had met George.`
`While he did lend an ear to her tales, George had always thought that this was typical of a girl, associating love with fate, chance, and miracles.`
`......George had thought that breaking the spirit mirror offered to the torii shrine was going a little too far,`
` but he had forgiven her, laughing it off as just a little prank she had done because she had seriously desired a relationship with him.`
`......Just breaking a mirror in some musty shrine wouldn't change the fate of our meeting.`
`And that would never cause any curse.`
`{n}I remembered cheering her up, saying it was only a musty mirror covered in dust.`
`"...After I started working on this island, many of my coworkers told me of the existence of a spirit called {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama."`
`"In the beginning, I thought it was ridiculous,`
` but since it appeared indiscreet to comment on that,`
` ...outwardly, I conducted myself as if I also believed it.`
` ......But, it's astonishing, she really—"`
`"Existed.`
` ...{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama was in this mansion all along.`
` ......But {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama had lost her powers, ...and could not appear before us.`
` She did "exist" all along.`
` ...It's just that we couldn't {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} her."`
`"............I'd like to hear Genji‐san's opinion."`
`".........I do not have any opinion.`
` .........All that I would like to say is......that when it happened......there were five of us here."`
`"......And I thought that Kanon had returned through the back door.`
` Then, we carried him to the servant room,`
` .........something happened, and Doctor Nanjo and Kumasawa passed on."`
`"......That is all.`
` ......We have already explained everything we saw.`
` ...I understand that it would be very unreasonable to try to force you to believe it when you did not see it yourself."`
`"How could he believe it?`
` .........I thought that it was undoubtedly Kanon‐san."`
`"......But when that thing got up from the bed,`
` ...and, that's right,`
` started to grope about that wound in its chest like this,`
` ......I felt that it wasn't Kanon‐san, but some different being."`
`".........You probably can't understand, George‐sama.`
` ...The terror of that moment when a person you thought you knew well exposes that he is in fact someone else...`
` .........I can't explain.`
` ...I can't explain it at all..."`
`"I understand.`
` ......I can tell just how dreadful a thing must have happened to cause you such a shock."`
`"......Thank you very much,`
` ...George‐sama."`
`And they all went silent again.`
`No matter how many times she was consoled, Shannon kept on crying, weeping that listening to the witch's sweet whispers and breaking the spirit mirror on that day had been where this had all gone wrong...`
`"..................The witch that whispered to you...loses her powers if that mirror exists?"`
`"...I think she explained it to me a little, but I don't really remember.`
` ......I think she said something about how she couldn't release her power if that mirror existed."`
`"......What happened to this mirror that you broke?"`
`"I don't remember.`
` I suppose, ...since I left it broken, ...it would just have been lying there the way I left it."`
`"......So when, as they say, the reef was struck by lightning and disappeared, it would have gone to the bottom of the ocean...`
` Well, I'll bet picking it up and taping it together wouldn't have made it effective again anyway.`
` Hahahahaha."`
`".........Truly, .........what.........have I done........."`
`"......Sorry.`
` I shouldn't have said that."`
`He didn't know whether Shannon breaking the mirror had really been what had started everything off.`
`The servants didn't go so far as to blame Shannon, but it seemed that they believed that it had been the trigger.`
`...But even now, there was no way George could believe that much.`
`......Even if he was told a story about witches and evil spirits, it just sounded fake to him.`
`Even so, he listened seriously to Shannon's story, trying to find a hint that might relieve at least a little of the pain in her heart.`
`"Come to think of it, .........I think it is different from the one in that torii,`
` ...but I have heard that Madam keeps a spirit mirror as a charm."`
`"......Oh?`
` Aunt Natsuhi does?"`
`"Yes.`
` I believe she received it as one of the mementos of her grandfather or something, and that it held a very strong magic repelling power, a "historically rich"(?)`
` spirit mirror or something..."`
`"............I have also heard the same story.`
` ......Something about the mirror having the power to reflect that which is not good and send it back."`
`"If we had that spirit mirror, ......could we resist the witch, {f:5:Beatrice}?"`
`"Huh......"`
`When George proposed this, the servants looked up.`
`"......The shrine and the torii where it was enshrined are gone now, but the important thing is that there is still another spirit mirror."`
`".........I've heard that Aunt Natsuhi's family is descended from Shinto priests.`
` Maybe that isn't just a simple mirror."`
`"I, I believe I have heard Madam say that she keeps it safe in a treasure box.`
` ...It might not be very large."`
`".........I don't think its size is a problem.`
` Even the mirror I broke looked small and insignificant at a glance."`
`"............If our opponent is occult, then we too must resist by using occult measures.`
` ...If we just sit around here, nothing will be resolved.`
` It's worth trying, if only for some peace of mind."`
`Of course, this didn't mean that George had accepted the witch.`
`{n}......However, he thought it would be necessary to have some kind of purification ceremony to heal the wounds in Shannon's heart.`
`...So this story about Natsuhi's spirit mirror was just what the doctor ordered.`
`"Let's go.`
` ...I won't suggest going to finish off the witch or something so outrageous.`
` ...However, I think it would be nice if we had something that repels magic to protect us from the witch."`
`"......Maria‐chan told me about this earlier, but the door to Grandfather's room is supposed to be able to repel magic, right?`
` ......As expected of Grandfather.`
` He had sufficient defense against the occult as well.`
` .........Let's go.`
` To Aunt Natsuhi's room!"`
`"Bu‐but, I think Madam's room is locked...!`
` We returned the master keys to Rosa‐sama,`
` ...and even the servant room, which contains the key box, has been locked up..."`
`"......In that case, Aunt Natsuhi should have been walking around with that key.`
` ...Aunt Natsuhi's body should still be in the chapel.`
` It will be bad to disturb it ourselves before the police come, but we can fully explain that."`
`"However...the entrance to the chapel is also locked..."`
`"Hahaha, Gohda‐san, are you not strong enough to break a single glass window?`
` You could smash it with a rock from around there."`
`"W‐would it, ...umm, be okay to break the window of that important chapel...?"`
`"When Grandfather gets mad at us, I'll take responsibility.`
` ......From the beginning, I was planning on fighting with the whole Ushiromiya family today.`
` So that they would permit my engagement with you.`
` ...So I am already prepared."`
`"Let's break the glass.`
` Then, let's borrow the key from Aunt Natsuhi's body."`
`It seemed that George's claim that he would take responsibility had given the servants a great amount of courage.`
`...Shannon and Gohda glanced at each other, and then looked at George's face again.`
`"Grandfather knows everything about the occult.`
` I'm sure he'll understand if it's about the power of Aunt Natsuhi's spirit mirror.`
` Don't worry, he won't get mad at you."`
`".........I wonder if Madam's mirror...`
`...can really seal {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama...`
`...once again."`
`"I don't know.`
` But I think it's worth trying.`
` ...So let's go.`
` It's getting darker and darker outside.`
` Let's hurry!"`
`"Shannon, get a flashlight!`
` Gohda‐san, find something that looks like it can break the glass!`
` Genji‐san, sorry, but could you get us some umbrellas?"`
`"""Yes!"""`
`The servants, who had been rejected by Rosa, started to move once again, having gained a new master.`
`{n}George, who was normally calm and gentle, was now exuding a commanding presence.`
`Shannon checked the emergency flashlight.`
`{n}Just in case, she changed the batteries.`
`Gohda was examining several heavy‐looking cooking tools.`
`{n}...Normally, a self‐respecting chef like himself wouldn't want to use them for anything other than their intended purpose.`
`But now he was frantic to fulfill the orders of the one he accepted as his master.`
`After some deliberation, he took a large, weighty frying pan.`
`Genji removed several umbrellas from the umbrella stand set in the corner near the back door of the kitchen.`
` ...He took three of them.`
`"Genji‐san...?"`
`".........I cannot go with you.`
` ......It would be embarrassing for me, as the head servant of the Ushiromiya family, if we were all absent when an order was to be given."`
`"Wh‐...what in the world, Genji‐san?!`
` Even you should understand how dangerous it would be to be alone in this mansion now...!"`
`"......I can't go.`
` ......I must stay here so the Master can call me at any time."`
`"Genji‐sama......"`
`"......Go, and serve George‐sama.`
` Don't make any blunders.`
` Gohda, I'm counting on you to be an example."`
`"Ye‐.........yes.`
` ...Leave it to me."`
`"I will surely fulfill my duty..."`
`"Is this really alright, ...Genji‐san?"`
`"Yes.`
` .........I am already at this age.`
` All the days of my life until now have been in repayment for the Master's favor."`
`"...Whatever happens to a senile old man like myself will be decided by the roulette.`
` I think I would like to sit here and see what the result will be with my own eyes."`
`As Genji said that, he sat down.`
`As though saying that he didn't intend to discuss this anymore, ...his gaze fell to the chessboard that he had played on with Nanjo.`
`When George saw this, he decided to leave Genji there.`
`"Let's go, everyone.`
` It looks like the wind is a little softer right now!"`
`George took an umbrella and dashed out into the hallway, and Shannon and Gohda chased after him, each holding a tool.`
`......After they flew out of the room, Genji quietly extended his hand to the side of the chessboard.`
`.........He softly pulled something that was there towards himself, and hid it by covering it with his palm.`
`Genji killed his breathing even more than before.`
`{n}.........As he did, .........something flashed gold.`
`From inside an ice pail set on the counter, ...a small gold butterfly appeared, softly and silently.`
`It was almost as though it had watched George and the rest leave, and was trying to secretly follow them......`
`It happened in an instant.`
`...The gold butterfly, elegantly flapping its wings, was pinned against the wall by the knife Genji had thrown, just like a butterfly in a bug collection.`
`After the gold butterfly beat its wings several times, looking like it was in pain, it accepted the fact that it couldn't break free, became fine gold powder and smoke, and disappeared as though dissolving into water...`
`Genji's gaze was still lowered at the chessboard, as though nothing had happened.`
`......Maybe he would think up a brilliant move very soon.`
`But no matter what move he made, his opponent would not be able to respond for all eternity.`
`Even though he knew that, Genji searched for a brilliant move.`
`......It must have been the perfect way to kill time, during the short period before some fate would be given to him...`
`......He didn't know what result the roulette would bring about.`
`{n}But that decision would be made very soon.`
`.........No one could interfere with the tumbling roulette ball...`
`The door to the parlor was not only locked, but blocked with a barricade made of sofas and the like.`
`So Auntie Rosa seemed to suspect that if a suspicious person appeared, it would be by breaking the window.`
`Sitting on a one‐person sofa, her back to the door, she continued to hold onto her gun.`
`I didn't know what was what anymore, and so, my body and mind worn out, I was just playing with Maria however she wanted.`
`In Maria's words,`
` ...{f:5:Beatrice} was testing us to see whether we could solve the epitaph of the gold, so we had to challenge this riddle.`
`In the beginning, I had been a little interested, and had tried to solve it, but I didn't have a clue what those weird paragraphs even meant in the first place.`
`......I didn't doubt that there was some riddle hidden there, but I couldn't imagine that I would solve it by chance.`
`In the middle part of the epitaph, there were lines saying to journey to the Golden Land, over the course of the first to the tenth twilight.`
`On the first twilight, sacrifice the six chosen by the key.`
`{n}On the second twilight, those who remain shall tear apart the two who are close.`
`It was obvious that this hinted at the first six murders that had already occurred in the chapel, and Jessica and Kanon‐kun's murders.`
`If this was being followed, we would have to be prepared for yet five more people to be killed.`
`On the fourth twilight, gouge the head and kill.`
`{n}On the fifth twilight, gouge the chest and kill.`
`{n}On the sixth twilight, gouge the stomach and kill.`
`{n}On the seventh twilight, gouge the knee and kill.`
`{n}On the eighth twilight, gouge the leg and kill.`
`The bodies of Doctor Nanjo and Kumasawa baa‐chan hadn't been found.`
`...However, if we reasonably assumed that they were the sacrifices of the fourth and fifth twilights,`
` ......they would surely be found in a pitiful state, with their head and chest gouged.`
`In which case, could we expect that three more would be gouged in the stomach, knee, and leg, and be killed?`
`......Who would that be?`
`{n}...I looked around the room, noticing that there were three people here, but, how should I say it, my emotions seemed paralyzed.`
`...Strangely, I didn't find it terrifying.`
`Maria noticed me, with my upper body entrusted to the sofa, gazing lazily up at the ceiling.`
`...Apparently, she felt I was slacking off in my riddle‐solving.`
`{n}She got mad at me, and told me I wasn't being serious enough.`
`"......Hey, Maria."`
`"Uu...?"`
`"What was it again, that {f:5:Beatrice} said she would do if we solved this?"`
`I was sure that the witch had written in her letter that she would give up on collecting the interest, or something abstract like that.`
`...I was optimistically taking that to mean that she would give up on killing the whole family,`
` ......but was it really written with that meaning?`
`I didn't really feel that solving this riddle would actually save us.`
`.........I thought that even if we did solve it, that would be doing just what the culprit wanted us to, and it would all be a wasted effort...`
`"No, that's not true.`
` ......If you solve the epitaph, Beato's ritual will be over.`
` So there won't be any need for more people to die."`
`"......Really?`
` Isn't that rule just something she made up...?`
` If we solve this riddle, ...we'll probably know the location of Grandfather's hidden gold.`
` ...She'll surely go after that and—"`
`"Uu.`
` Won't."`
`"...How...can you be so sure?"`
`"The gold was Beato's from the start.`
` She won't go after something that's hers."`
`"......Then, ...then why is Beato giving us all these big hints?`
` ......Not just that, why did she even set up this game‐like thing?"`
`"Magic needs risk."`
`"......Risk.`
` ...I don't really get what you mean."`
`"For example, in a marathon,`
` ......do you think that a medal that anyone can get by running the whole thing is worth the same as the medal given only to the person who gets first...?"`
`"No, I don't...`
` ......What are you trying to say? That in the end, she's just playing around?`
` Purposefully giving us a chance—"`
`"Noooooo.`
` That's what magic {i:is}.`
` No matter how great the magic, there are always risks and weak points.`
` No, there has to be."`
`"...I don't get it when you call it magic, ...but if I think about it as a gamble, I can understand a little.`
` If you aren't prepared to lose big, then you can't win big.`
` And the slimmer the chances of winning, the bigger the payoff."`
`"That's it, exactly.`
` That's why Beato properly explained the risk of the ritual to everyone.`
` That's why, if this riddle is solved, the ritual will be interrupted as promised.`
` After all, if she breaks her promises, then there wouldn't be any risk."`
`"If we solve this, ...will she really keep her promise?"`
`"Why are flowers beautiful even though they wither?`
` Why is it that an artificial flower isn't beautiful, even if it's so elaborate you can't tell the difference by looking?"`
`"Humans can bring about miracles by gambling their death.`
` If there were an undying human, that person would have no way of bringing about a miracle.`
` .........It's the same for us, for life, for witches and for rituals.`
` If we don't bear a risk, we can't achieve anything."`
`"......What do we do if we solve the riddle?`
` Do we press our answer buzzers and put a hand in the air, tell the witch our answer and see what she says?"`
`"Uu.`
` I don't know about that.`
` But, if we solve it, the ritual will surely end automatically."`
`"........................`
` ...You sure know a lot, Maria.`
` ...Did you learn all of that......from {f:5:Beatrice}?"`
`"Uu."`
`So, ...if you don't bear a risk, nothing can be gained.`
` That is doubtlessly the way of the world, ......but it was in conflict with the chessboard theory style of thinking that I liked.`
`A move in chess is always a search for the best play, that minimizes the risk, and promises an advantageous turn of events.`
`You don't trust your plays to chance, like in gambling.`
` ......That's right, there's no room for gambling in an intellectual game.`
`And yet, this person called {f:5:Beatrice} was carrying out such an outrageous crime,`
` ...or maybe a ritual,`
` ......while purposefully imposing conditions for her own loss and announcing them to us.`
`In chess, you always play the best move.`
`{n}So by standing in your opponent's position, you can predict their next move.`
`...However, you couldn't say for sure that {f:5:Beatrice}'s moves were always the best moves.`
`I thought she was probably making us focus on the epitaph as a smokescreen, to mislead us about something.`
`......But Maria said that of all things was impossible.`
`She said that this was a genuine risk that the witch had taken, and therefore proof that this was a formal magical ritual.`
`.........I can't understand this witch called {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`She must be committing this chain of murders with some goal in mind,`
` ......so why would she deliberately expose the conditions for her own defeat?`
`......No matter how I flip over the chessboard and think from my opponent's perspective, ......I can't understand why she would give up if this riddle was solved.`
`Isn't it almost as though {f:5:Beatrice}...doesn't care whether she wins or loses?`
` It's natural that chessboard reasoning wouldn't work if you played chess against an opponent like this...`
`...I don't understand, I don't understand.`
` ......What is {f:5:Beatrice} after that's making her commit this crime?`
`If she just wants to massacre us all, she could just do it secretly, without this whole crazy setup.`
` There was no need for that scrupulous advance notice, dramatic suggestions of locked rooms, or anything.`
`...It's all over‐dramatized.`
`{n}I don't get the point at all.`
`As long as I continue to think of {f:5:Beatrice} as a greedy human culprit, will I be unable to understand anything?`
`...If I don't accept her as a witch, will I be unable to even set the pieces on the chessboard at all......?`
`......If she really is a witch, and everything Maria has said is true...`
`...then there's only one thing we should have been doing.`
`{n}...We shouldn't have bothered with any of the reasoning or the discord or the searching for the culprit.`
`We should have all gathered in the dining hall, and pooled our knowledge to solve the riddle.`
` If we had pooled the knowledge of that many people, maybe we would have been able to at least grasp a thread of the answer...`
`We greedy humans, desiring to gain something more than one another, ......never pooled our knowledge, and were being offered up as sacrifices one by one.`
`.........In the end, were we humans getting what we deserved?`
` We thought we were thinking, ...but we were actually thinking only of our greedy selves.`
`In the end, chessboard theory is a technique of thinking where you project yourself on your opponent.`
` ......So greedy people look inside their opponents and see their greedy selves...`
`I looked vaguely at Auntie Rosa.`
`She was probably tired from being under all this tension the whole time.`
`{n}She wasn't sleeping, but she was continually staring vaguely at some point off in space.`
`Auntie Rosa had proclaimed that she couldn't trust anyone who had not been killed.`
`......Auntie Rosa's chessboard thinking......saw herself inside her opponent.`
`...In other words, Auntie Rosa...`
`...might be an isolated woman, unable to trust anyone and unable to let her guard down.`
`...Long ago, I think I heard a bit about it from my dad.`
`{n}Auntie Rosa had originally been a very obedient child.`
`......But because her age was so far separated from her other siblings,`
` and because her confrontational siblings had often made conflicting demands of her,`
` she had been going through psychological hardship ever since she was young.`
`Apparently, when she had taken the side of one sibling, often another gave her a hard time for it.`
`Certainly Auntie Rosa had said many things today that could be taken as abusive language.`
` .........But those were words that had been engraved into her vocabulary because they had been showered upon her as well.`
`The many abusive words that she had spoken......were also the same abuse that Auntie Rosa had been showered with in the past...`
`...Now that I think about it, I have the feeling that her style of speech today has had occasional traces of Uncle Krauss and Auntie Eva in it.`
`......I'd just assumed the similarity came from being siblings, ...but maybe that wasn't the case...`
`For the first time, I was able to sympathize from my heart with Auntie Rosa, who I had come to think of as being only gentle...`
`Then, what about Maria...?`
`{n}Maria had been claiming something for a while.`
`If we could solve the riddle that the witch had presented to us, the ritual would be halted and we would definitely be saved.`
`And I think she also said that {f:5:Beatrice} would never break a promise she made.`
`......So that describes Maria herself.`
`{n}She's the one with the most innocent heart, who would never break a promise...`
`So she believed that {f:5:Beatrice} wouldn't break a promise either.`
`{n}She could believe that.`
`But wasn't that just an image of {f:5:Beatrice} that Maria imagined...?`
` There's no proof that the real {f:5:Beatrice} definitely keeps her promises, right...?`
`"`
`{p:1:I keep my promises}.`
` If you solve the riddle of the epitaph, you shall be able to reach the Golden Land.`
` When that happens, the ritual will end.`
` No more people will die."`
`"......So you're saying a complete monster like you follows the rules?"`
`"I won't deny that I am brutal and unjust and a monster."`
`"......However, I am a witch.`
` I use magic.`
` In order to use magic, there are some rules that must be followed.`
` ...It is precisely because I am a witch that I cannot neglect those.`
` You should believe at least that much."`
`".....................`
` ......Even after pulling all this shit, you're still telling me to trust in at least the rules?"`
`"......I do play tricks.`
` Of course, I also deceive people.`
` That's no different from humans.`
` ......But not once have I disregarded something that I have said as a promise."`
`"What about you humans?`
` Do you always keep your promises?"`
`"............Given that we have catchphrases like "keep your promises",`
` ...it's doubtful that we always follow them as we should."`
`"From my perspective, humans are much more selfish monsters.`
` ......There's nothing as doubtful as a human's promise.`
` Even I sometimes make contracts with humans, but I doubt you can even imagine how strict an agreement must be made just to grant a single foolish wish."`
`"...If there's even a small loophole, they'll immediately say something like "increase the number of wishes to one hundred", or "try transforming into a tiny speck"."`
`"......Dad often tells me something.`
` He says that there's nothing as scary as contracts.`
` ......He said it's only natural that people who agree without reading them thoroughly will be chewed to the bone.`
` ...He made a killing through vice."`
`"............Realize this.`
` People do not know of fraud from birth.`
` ...They suffer it somewhere.`
` And so it is learned."`
`"..........................."`
`"Yes, the sins of the human world, which must be forced on one another.`
` ......Now who was the witch I heard that from...?`
` Oh well.`
` ......I'm not as heartless as you think, you see?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`"Liar!!`
` All these people, and it's not even the first time!!`
` And you did it in such a horrible way too, how could you not be heartless?!!"`
`"You say you keep your promises?!`
` Don't say stuff like that!!`
` I won't accept you.`
` Never.`
` I believe that not giving that up is the only way I can resist you!"`
`"............I see.`
` So you're saying that this eternal torment will be the same for me.`
` .........*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*."`
`"......Maybe so.`
` One thousand years is a long time......`
` Maybe a witch's true strength is decided not by their magical power, but by their endurance.`
` ...Yes, it explains how terrifying Lady Bern is."`
`"Damn you, babbling on and on about incomprehensible stuff.`
` .........Hurry up and continue that eternal torment or whatever.`
` I'm prepared to stick around for a thousand years, or even ten thousand."`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` Good, good.`
` It looks like you've regained some of your will to fight.`
` It would be boring otherwise."`
`"Come now, don't you often see it in multiplayer games?`
` You enter as a new challenger, but the opponent is so weak that it's a bit of an anticlimax, so you lose on purpose to extend the game until the last round,`
` then get serious and beat them to a pulp, riiight?"`
`"......I don't get the analogy."`
`"It's the same as wine.`
` If you don't let it age well, it won't sparkle."`
`"......You are a wine that can withstand that process.`
` I'll age you carefully.`
` ......I'll raise you to be the best alcohol to color my elegant time..."`
`"So don't let this much break you.`
` Keep on denying me.`
` After all, as long as you don't accept me, I'm nothing more than a fleeting illusion.`
` ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"...............No matter how many times I see it, ......it's awful."`
`"......I sympathize with all my heart.`
` ......Shannon‐san, please get the key.`
` ......Even though she has passed away, Madam is a lady.`
` I cannot touch her."`
`".........Yes."`
`Shannon nodded sharply, her expression filled with a sense of duty.`
`George, Gohda and Shannon had broken a suitable window, and were inside the chapel.`
`{n}...Since they really hadn't wanted to break one, they had searched for another way in, just in case.`
`...But, in the end, that only proved once again that there was nowhere that anyone could slip in through,`
` and emphasized further how inscrutable was the chapel's locked room...`
`Inside the chapel, time had stopped since they had left it earlier.`
`Of course, even George could not approach that horrible Halloween party again.`
`It was only natural.`
` Because it made him remember again the sadness of losing both of his parents at once.`
`......And Gohda, thinking of the possibility that their bodies might have changed in some horrible way now that a half of a day had passed, didn't want to let George approach.`
`Shannon followed Gohda's instructions, and approached the party table...`
`...Normally, Shannon might have resented having another dirty job forced on her.`
` ......But now, she could truly understand Gohda's mental state.`
`Despite Gohda's prodigious skill, he had gotten into trouble, lost his job, and been left out in the streets, and then Natsuhi had given him a new life.`
`......Even though it had just been a casual employment for Natsuhi, Gohda must have felt that it was a turning point in his fate.`
`...Those around Gohda could see that he felt a special kind of loyalty to Natsuhi.`
` ......So he probably didn't want to lose that feeling, even though she was dead.`
`......Now that half a day had passed, the bodies of Natsuhi and the rest had changed completely.`
`{n}Small bugs that had sniffed out the smell of death had started to gather.`
`{n}...It really wasn't something you could look at directly...`
`"......Madam, ............excuse me......"`
`Because of her long experience as a servant, Shannon had an idea of which pocket Natsuhi had kept the key to her room in.`
`.........Probably, in this pocket...`
`Her guess didn't fail her.`
` Just by touching the outside of the pocket, she was immediately able to feel it...`
`"It's here.`
` ......The key to Madam's room."`
`Shannon held the key up high, showing the others that it had been found.`
`As George and Gohda watched her, their eyes opened wide...`
`{n}That wasn't the expression Shannon was expecting, so it startled her.`
`Because Shannon hadn't noticed.`
`{n}George and Gohda, watching from afar, had been able to notice it first.`
`Because when Shannon had held the key up high, ......a blizzard of gold leaf had billowed up from around the table.`
`They were...countless gold butterflies.`
`Because it was the first time George had seen them, to him, they might have looked fantastical.`
`......But Gohda already knew.`
`{n}...He knew that those gold butterflies, far from being beautiful, held sway over something disastrous.`
`And that gold swelled, trying to suck Shannon in.........`
`"Sh‐Shannon‐san!!`
` Run!!"`
`"Huh?!`
` Kyaa!!!"`
`Shannon also realized that she was about to be swallowed up by gold butterflies.`
`She ran unsteadily, her expression still shocked.`
`{n}As she did, the gold butterflies danced around Shannon in unison.`
`{n}They grouped together.`
` They tried to swallow her up!`
`"Shannonnnnn!!`
` Damn it, what is this?!`
` Are these...the gold butterflies you guys were talking about?!"`
`"Outside, quickly!!`
` You bastards!`
` Damn it, damn it!!"`
`George and Gohda rushed up to Shannon, driving off the group of butterflies.`
`{n}And while the butterflies were scattered, they ran towards the broken window!`
`However, they needed good footing to get out of the window, which was surrounded with shards of broken glass.`
`When they had entered, there had been enough time to prepare for that, but now there was none.`
`"Let's go out through the door!!`
` There's no time to look for footing!"`
`"......I‐`
`...it won't open...!`
` It's stuck...!"`
`"Give it to me!!`
` Damn this ancient piece of crap—`
`nnnnnnnn!!"`
`"George‐sama, quickly!!`
` Damn it, you want a piece of me?! Uooooooooooooooohhh!!"`
`Gohda took off his jacket, swinging it around and scattering the group of butterflies.`
`{n}But he was vastly outnumbered.`
`{n}It was doubtful that it even bought them a short amount of time.`
`George struggled with the virtually broken handle.`
`{n}Its age showed, and it didn't turn well.`
`Brute force alone won't do it, it needs the right angle or some trick......`
`"George‐sama!!`
` Damn iiiiiiiiiiiit!!`
` You monsteeers!!"`
`......Just then, Gohda saw it.`
`......He was seen by it.`
` In other words, their eyes met.`
`On top of the party table,`
` ......no, floating above it, backed by a stained glass window, laughing: the figure of the witch.`
`He saw the figure of the witch, laughing in the center of the golden whirlwind, allowing the gold butterflies to attend to her whims.`
`"...............`
`B‐`
`......{f:5:Beatrice}........."`
`It should have been Gohda's first meeting with her.`
`{n}...But he knew her at a glance.`
`Just like the other servants had said, this was certainly, certainly...the witch of the portrait herself...!`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*, hahahahahahahahahahahaha!!`
` It is almost time for dinner, is it not?`
` ......I am already the host of this mansion.`
` So I must give you a warm reception with a wonderful dinner.`
` ......And how perfectly ideal, there are {i:three} of you!`
` ......My, my, how truly, truly convenient!!"`
`"U‐...uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"`
`"I‐it opened!!"`
`"Gohda‐san, quickly...!!`
` ............!`
` {f:5:Beatrice}......sama..."`
`"Huh?!`
` ...............?!?!"`
`"Are you sure you want to just stand there...?`
` If you think this place is suitable for your cemetery, then very well.`
` *cackle*cackle*!!`
` I'll praise your spirit for wanting to stay by your former masters' side, serving them even after death!"`
`The golden whirlwind enshrouding the witch burst.`
`It was like...an evil hand had literally spread its fingers and was trying to attack them!`
`The group of gold butterflies attacked with a "whoosh" sound.`
`"Hurry!!`
` We can't stand here!!"`
`George's voice brought Shannon and Gohda back to themselves.`
`{n}Standing here now would be the same as a frog being stared down by a snake.`
`They had to resist.`
`{n}......They had to fight this incarnation of the new, brutal, and frightening order that had enveloped Rokkenjima...!`
`There was no time to take out their umbrellas.`
`{n}The three of them dashed out into the pouring rain.`
`They never realized because they didn't turn around,`
` but the gold butterflies apparently couldn't handle the rain too well, and this hampered their ability to chase after the three.`
`The three people ran from their golden pursuers and flew into the mansion...`
`"............*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*.`
` How nice, how nice.`
` If it wasn't like this, it wouldn't be interesting!"`
`They unlocked the door, and flew into the room.`
`A bit of the scent from Natsuhi's favorite gentle incense remained in the room.`
`...However, there was no time to let that calm them now.`
`"Where is it?!`
` You said it was in a treasure box, right...?!"`
`"It's just something I heard...!`
` I never knew where it actually...!"`
`".........I, I think it's probably in her dresser, or in the corner by the bed!"`
`Shannon claimed that because of her woman's sense.`
` But in the corner by the bed, there was only an incense burner, a half‐read novel, and a pair of glasses.`
`But the dresser was elegant and had many drawers, and it would be understandable if she had kept some of her valuables there.`
`"Auntie Natsuhi, I'm sorry...!!"`
`He began to violently open each one of the drawers.`
`{n}He had to hurry.`
`He couldn't actually hear footsteps, ...but he had the feeling that the witch was approaching...`
`He had the feeling that her laugh was approaching...!!`
`He pulled out the drawers one by one and examined their contents.`
`......Every small box for makeup looked like a treasure box,`
` and the amount of effort it would take to inspect all of them made him feel a little dizzy.`
`"May‐......maybe it's this box...`
` It's locked, and I can't open it...!"`
`At a glance, it looked slightly larger than a music box.`
`{n}When shaken, it rustled, as though various small objects were inside.`
`{n}But it was locked and wouldn't open!`
`"N‐normally, you'd hide the key somewhere nearby.`
` ...But maybe some people always take it with them......`
` I don't know, ...I don't know...!!"`
`"There's no choice—let's break it!`
` But we can't do it recklessly, right, we might break the mirror inside.`
` Isn't there some tool we could pry it open with...?!`
` Damn it...!!"`
`Gohda looked all over the room, trying to see if there was some tool that they could use.`
`{n}And he noticed the door, which had been left open ever since they had entered.`
`He approached the door to close it, ......and noticed the abominable shadows of people approaching from beyond the darkness in the hall...`
`No, the phrase "shadows of people" wasn't right.`
`{n}Because that referred to {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} shadows.`
`......You can't call the shadows of beings that aren't {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} "shadows of people"!!`
`"...............G‐`
`......George‐sama!!!`
` H‐`
`......hurry......"`
`Gohda's voice trailed off...`
`{n}It was the shock from seeing a procession of those not of this world.`
`He was a servant.`
`{n}So he knew all of the servants that worked for the Ushiromiya family.`
`...But he didn't know about these.`
`{n}However, they were definitely servants...!!`
`They weren't servants working for Ushiromiya Kinzo or Ushiromiya Krauss.`
`...They were new servants, who worked for the new master of the mansion, the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice},`
` and who had goats' heads and bright‐red, boiled eyes of lava!!`
`As the new master laughed loudly and trimly directed six of the new servants,`
` he saw her pierce the darkness as she came.`
`...Of course, she was clad in the gold butterflies that were her symbol.`
`Gohda hurriedly closed the door and locked it!`
`However, the instant he locked it, it returned to normal, just as though it had been knocked back by a spring or something!`
`It almost gave the illusion that some prankster on the other side of the door was opening it every time he closed it.`
`......Distance‐wise, they shouldn't have reached the other side of the door yet!!`
`Then who, how...?!`
`It felt just like playing with a broken toy.`
`Click, boing.`
`{n}Click, boing!!`
`"U‐uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!`
` I‐it won't close!!`
` It opens even if I close it!`
` What's going on, damnitdamnitdamnitdamnit!!"`
`"Ku‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐ha...!!`
` Did you think a lock would stop me?`
` Did you think the door to that room would inhibit the room's new master?!"`
`It was like the witch could see Gohda's frantic effort through the door.`
`Even as he struggled, their footsteps continued to approach.`
`And when not just footsteps, but their breath too could be heard,`
` Gohda gave up on the lock and rammed the door with his shoulder, making the lock his own large body.`
`"......George‐sama, quickly quickly quickly!!!"`
`"George‐sama, what about this?!"`
`"A letter opener!`
` That's better, let me have it!`
` The fountain pen isn't working!"`
`George took it, and once again dug into the crack under the lid of the treasure box.`
`{n}...It looks like it's working...!`
`"Quickly quickly!!`
` HiiIIiii,`
` UOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!"`
`The pressure from across the door grew even stronger.`
`......Gohda screamed.`
` It wasn't a war cry for this test of strength.`
`{n}......He was terrified.`
`He was simply terrified that, except for a single wooden door, he would be touching something not of this world.`
`But he was still lucky.`
`{n}He wasn't touching them directly.`
`{n}Because they were on the other side of the door.`
`So it was natural that if he did touch them directly, ...Gohda's cry would turn from something brave into a shameful,`
` ...and yet very real scream that would make glass shatter.`
`Gohda couldn't believe what was right before his eyes.`
`...Going through the door,`
` ...an arm,`
` ......an arm,`
` ......almost as though it was sticking through the surface of water,`
` slipped through, as though it was perfectly natural, and stroked the back of Gohda's hand as he tried desperately to hold the door closed.`
`.........It...`
`traced slowly up his arm,`
` ...to his chest,`
` ...and then...`
`......his chin.`
`By now, Gohda's scream was not even vocalized.`
`{n}He could hear a sweet whispering voice from across the door.`
`......It wasn't coming from the witch, but judging by the sound of the voice, it was a young woman.`
`...But there was no difference in the fact that it was a voice from one not of this world.`
`"......*giggle*giggle*.`
` How cuuute.`
` ......Hey. You see it, right? Your life flashing before your eyes.`
` ......Tell me. When it's over."`
`"HIIIIIIIIIiiiiiIIIIIIIIIIIiiiiIIIIiii!!"`
`"Thanks.`
` Over already, huh?`
` ......*giggle*giggle*!"`
`That obscene arm burst apart.`
` And they heard the sound of something jumping around the room at an incredible speed.`
`They didn't know what it was.`
`{n}Incredibly fast, small, like steel or maybe a beetle...!`
`When it buried itself right in the center of Gohda's chest and stopped,`
` .........for the first time,`
` ...they realized that its true form...`
`...was something like a stake with a strange design on it......`
`Gohda's large body shook, ...`
`...bent backwards,`
` ......and fell over.`
`As it did, the door opened softly, even though no one was pushing it,`
` ......and the new masters of this room were welcomed in.`
`It looked almost as though the door itself had accepted them.`
`The goat attendants entered one after another, six of them...!!`
`Then that witch entered, and the gold butterflies entered!!`
`The room was wrapped in a blizzard of gold leaf, which fell and piled up, turning it into a world of gold...!!`
`".........Shannon.`
` The roulette has chosen you and George.`
` Thank me for your day of release.`
` I assume you have no regrets?"`
`"None at all, riiight?`
` Receiving an engagement ring from the man you fell for, and then being killed before spending a night together, that isn't a regret at all, riiiiiiiiiiiiight???`
` You wanted him to teach you the happiness of being a woman, didn't yooouuu?`
` Kuhihihyahya{0}hya{0}hya{0}hya{0}hya{0}hyahya!!"`
`"Ahh, no, no, Shannon, it's hanging! Your regret. From your mouth.`
` I can see it dribbling from your moooooooouth, Shannonnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn???`
` Hiiihya{0}hya{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha`
` kyaaa{0}kya{0}kkya{0}kkya{0}kkya{0}kkya{0}kkya!!!"`
`Crack.`
` It was the sound of the lid to the treasure box breaking and opening.`
`When George turned it over, out fell accessories, charms,`
` ......various small objects that Natsuhi had treasured when she was a girl.`
`...Mixed in with those was a pouch that stood out from the rest.`
`He picked it up, and checked it immediately.`
` .........This was it.`
`"I found it—this is it........."`
`"One move short.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`"Die!"`
`"......Da‐damn it!!"`
`All at once, the gold butterflies attacked George, who was painfully slowly trying to remove the contents of the pouch.`
`Just then, it seemed like, for just an instant, a bright red flash lit up the room...`
`That red flash seemed to wipe out the gold butterflies that were raging around the room, ......within a circle drawn with Shannon at the center...`
`......Therefore, it was a very divine scene.`
` ...Almost as though a single streak of light had cut through the clouds in the ceiling, in this world of gold...`
`George, who was curled in a ball trying to protect himself from the group of butterflies, didn't have a clue what had occurred.`
`......Then he noticed that Shannon was blocking the way to him, shielding him,`
` with a serious face that she had never shown him before, as she glared at the witch and the rest...`
`".........I'd forgotten.`
` You were also Kinzo's excellent furniture.`
` And you've matured much more than Kanon, ......"`
`"..................How dare you...do that to Kanon‐kun.`
` .........Not the fact that you killed him.`
` ...How dare you...erase his remains,`
` ...and even try to disgrace his honor......"`
`"Come now, Shannonnnnn, is that what's making you maaad?`
` If you're lonely because you can't meet Kanon, just ask meee, I'll bring you together anytiiiiime!!"`
`When the witch snapped her fingers, ......one of the six goat attendants......glittered gold and changed into Kanon.`
`It was definitely a sight to make one doubt their eyes.`
`{n}...It was definitely Kanon's face.`
`......However, in those eyes, there was none of that sincere glint of Kanon's.`
`...They were only the clouded eyes of furniture that did nothing but obey the orders of the witch.`
`...George couldn't understand the scene right before his eyes.`
`{n}......And he finally understood why Gohda and the rest had been unable to talk about what they had seen in the servant room.`
`".........Is it fun?"`
`"Oh yeah, it's fun.`
` It's always fun to reunite two that have been torn apart by death.`
` Because I get to enjoy it thrice—once tearing the two apart by death, once reuniting them, and once tearing them apart again."`
`"So, Kanonnn, play with your sister.`
` If she knocks you about, show her a face with as much anguish as you can manage.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`......From the impostor Kanon's arm, ...a strangely shining trail extended.`
`{n}.........It planned to tear Shannon apart with that.`
`......Shannon, who still hadn't prepared her heart, apart with a single stroke...`
`"......I won't forgive you.`
` ......For dishonoring the dead not once, ...but twice, ...I won't forgive you."`
`"Stop babbling, get killed by your brother, Shannonnnnn,`
` I'm sure you'll be able to have a good dreeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaam!!!"`
`As the impostor Kanon drew several purple trails, he definitely had attacked Shannon...`
`But when he flew at Shannon, ......it felt like some kind of invisible wall had been set up in front of her.`
`A bright red ripple trail was left on the wall, ......and it repelled the impostor.`
`......No, it didn't repel him, it smashed him.`
` ......It knocked him back, turning him into golden dust, into pieces, scattering him...!`
`The figure of the foolish furniture, who had mocked Kanon's form and even disgraced his honor after his death, broke into countless gold butterflies,`
` and then those butterflies themselves broke into pieces, and those pieces were broken into pieces,`
` until they were no longer butterflies, but a spray of gold, and disappeared.`
`"......Sha‐...............Shannon..............."`
`"............George‐san, please don't move from there.`
` I don't want to shift the central axis."`
`"This is.........a surprise!!`
` Even though you make a face like you wouldn't hurt a fly, .........you can display such power?!!"`
`"I see, so the spirit mirror is lending you power...`
` But you don't have the preparations or the time to draw out the true power of that spirit mirror."`
`"I won't give you either one.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`The spirit mirror George gripped was letting out a divine radiance, and displaying its strength not to submit to wicked power.`
`But that radiance was no match for the witch's sinister nature...`
`"This is why furniture is frightening!`
` That feeling, like unexpectedly hitting the corner of a cabinet with your little toe."`
`"...This is why furniture is frightening!!`
` You furniture, furniture furnituuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuure!!"`
`"............I am not furniture.`
` ...And I think you are very pitiful right now."`
`"Whaat...?`
` Hohh.`
` ......I wonder, what did this furniture, who hasn't lived even a hundred years, just say to a witch of one thousand......?"`
`"......You are a very pitiful person.`
` .........Of course there will be lingering regrets between two people who love each other.`
` But there isn't even a scrap of the kind of regrets you're hoping for."`
`"You dare speak, furniture...!!`
` When you say that, have you forgotten the days that you wanted to be tied to George so much that you licked my shoes?!!"`
`"Living with love, and crawling in muck is what humans do.`
` For sneering at that and thinking you can look down on it, you are far inferior to them."`
`"Especially now, I think you are pitiful.`
` ......How much does it mean for a loving couple to consummate their love?"`
`"......It does mean something, it definitely does.`
` ...But it's completely different from what you're saying.`
` It means something more sacred, so sacred that one such as you has no right to speak of it wickedly."`
`"So I no longer have any regrets.`
` George‐san and I have sworn our love to each other.`
` As proof, I accepted the ring."`
`"......With that, our eternal vows were completed!`
` No matter how you torture us with your wicked magic and your malice, you cannot disgrace that for all eternity!!"`
`"......Ha!`
` Don't speak as a poet like it's so neat and clean!!`
` Love is lust it can't be talked about with only pretty words like in a shoujo manga.`
` Men are flies and maggots that get caught in your scent and gather around you.`
` Do you still not understand that at your aaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aage?"`
`"You'll despair, when you get even one glimpse of the black‐as‐tar lust of that glasses man behind you,`
` you'll be devastated speechless no words no reaction no expression no goddamn good at all Shannoo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}oonnn{-}n{-}n{-}n{-}n{-}n{-}n{-}n{-}n{-}n{-}n{-}n{-}nnnnn???`
` Hiiiihaaaaa{0}aa{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haaa{0}haaa!!"`
`"That's enough stop talking furniture you furniture furniture furniture,`
` who the hell do you think you are talking like that, love is just a fraud how to pretty up something that's ultimately filthy as all hell,"`
`"Don't people become adults when they realize thaaaaaaaaaat, die you trash, furniture furniture scrap,`
` I'll turn you into a filthy maggot then we'll see whether that glasses guy still loves you,"`
`"I'll show you the goddamn filthy reality of his looooooooooooove,`
` die you piece of craaaaaaaaaaaaap don't you tell me about looooooooooooooooooove!!"`
`The invisible column of light with Shannon at the center started to have bright red ripples drawn all over it at once.`
`...The wall did its best to withstand the invisible malice that was trying to corrode it from all directions.`
`"What is this you call that resiiiisssting?!"`
`"You're insignificant you're frail, just like the pretty picture you try to paint, just a frail pretense,`
` you're just hiding what you don't want to see by covering it with a veil do you stiiill not understand that's why you're furniture you fuuuuuurniture,"`
`"see see see see see it's chipping awaaaaaaaaay crackcrunchsmacksnap how thin how shameful,`
` compared to your frail resistance Parmigiano‐Reggiano would take muuch more effort to shaaaaaaaaaaaaaave`
` hiiyahhaaahahaah!!"`
`The golden windstorm that covered the room gradually shaved away the walls of the column that protected Shannon and George.`
`The bright‐red ripples frantically drew a pattern of resistance, but the wall was beginning to envelop the two, becoming instead a red wall of despair...`
`"............George‐san, I'm sorry......`
` .........It was impossible...`
`......for me,`
` ...after all........."`
`"......Yes... Thank you.`
` ...You fought for my sake.`
` ...That alone makes me happy."`
`...As the column that had once protected them was assaulted and covered with a trail of bloodcurdling red ripples, it contracted,`
` ...and began to suck the two of them up instead.`
`"George‐san, can I ask a favor?"`
`Shannon grasped George's hand behind her.`
`{n}So George hugged her shoulders just as strongly.`
`"What is it?"`
`"Before the end, ......please let me hear you say you love me."`
`"Sure.`
` ...Sayo, I will forever"``After Genji finished taking his late meal, he went out to do the nighttime rounds inside the mansion.`
`He reheated the soup that Gohda had started making, and ate some random leftovers from the refrigerator.`
`They were all things Gohda had made himself, and were, of course, delicious.`
`He had half‐heartedly gone to ask Rosa and the others what they would do for dinner, but he had been yelled at by a voice telling him that they had canned food so they were fine, and the door wasn't even opened for him.`
`......So, ironically, it was the servant Genji who was able to eat the more delicious meal...`
`But even though all of those crimes had been committed, and many people had already met a brutal end,`
` ......why was it that Genji wasn't afraid to do the rounds all by himself?`
`...Judging by his appearance as he carried out his normal tasks without a trace of fear, as though everything was normal,`
` you might think that all of the horrible events that had happened today were just a dream or an illusion.`
`Was he taking a philosophic view, or was it simply resignation?`
`Genji must have considered it a virtue to systematically carry out his duty until the last moment,`
` since the fate that awaited him was unavoidable.`
`It would probably be eternally impossible to perceive the depths of his heart, unless he told of it himself......`
`Because he had given the master key back to Rosa, the places he could go to were extremely limited.`
`All he could do was walk around the hallways, checking to make sure that the windows were closed.`
`{n}So he was able to go around that route far more quickly than usual.`
`".......................................`
` ......mgh."`
`After the sound of a moderate knock,`
` Auntie Rosa, who had been falling into a doze shortly before, jumped and woke up, pointing the barrel of the gun at the door as she yelled.`
`"Who is it?!"`
`I was napping on a sofa, and that voice also brought me back to reality.`
`"......Rosa‐sama.`
` It is Genji."`
`"Do you have some business?`
` We'll be fine without opening the door.`
` Tell us from there."`
`".........Yes.`
` Well then, forgive me for speaking in this fashion.`
` ...I have found the bodies of Doctor Nanjo and Kumasawa."`
`"Wh‐...what did you say...?!!"`
`"............I see.`
` Alright, let's go and check them.`
` ...Until I see the corpses, I won't believe anybody."`
`"....................."`
`"......Uu.`
` It's alright, Battler.`
` If you're with me, it'll definitely be alright."`
`Maybe my face was shadowed with anxiety.`
`{n}...Maria grasped my hand with her small hand, and spoke softly, trying to give me courage.`
`Since it was Auntie Rosa's job to ready the gun and stand guard, it fell to me to remove the barricade of sofas.`
`When I finished, I took a backward glance at Auntie Rosa, who was pointing the barrel of the gun over my shoulder, and opened the door.`
`"Genji‐san, where are their corpses...?"`
`".........In the courtyard.`
` I shall guide you."`
`"Battler‐kun, wait!`
` Just in case, I'm going to check the doors and windows of this room before we go.`
` Wait a second."`
`Auntie Rosa called me to a halt to prevent me from going on ahead, and began to carefully check the locks on each of the windows.`
`......But those locks had already been checked once.`
`......It felt kind of unpleasant, as though she suspected that I might have secretly unlocked them when she wasn't looking.`
`...No, maybe she was right to be this cautious...`
`Even though it was called a courtyard, it wasn't really a pretty place you could take a walk in like the rose garden.`
`On the contrary, since it was surrounded by the mansion on all sides,`
` it made you feel a little discomfort, as though it was telling you that you couldn't escape from the mansion even if you tried to escape to the outside.`
`On the other hand, thanks to that, even though the violent winds could be heard, the wind itself was blocked.`
`Genji‐san held out an umbrella, but Auntie Rosa ignored him.`
`...She probably wanted to say that the gun took two hands, so taking the umbrella would be dangerous because she wouldn't be able to fire the gun.`
`Even without Genji‐san pointing his finger, we could tell immediately.`
`Right in the center of the courtyard, ......we could see where Doctor Nanjo and Kumasawa‐san lay...`
`Auntie Rosa entered the courtyard without even an umbrella.`
`{n}...So Genji‐san and I also entered the courtyard without opening one.`
`{n}Only Maria had one open like normal.`
`"..................Maria...`
` ......Is this......you know?"`
`"......Uu.`
` ......It's the seventh twilight and the eighth twilight."`
`"I, ......I see.`
` Certainly, just as Genji‐san and the others said, there are horrible wounds on their necks.`
` ......Very sharp.`
` Almost as though they've been sliced with a katana or something..."`
`That gaping wound on their necks definitely made me want to avert my eyes,`
` but after seeing the Halloween party in the chapel, even though I thought it was horrible, it was no longer enough to make me feel sick.`
`Instead, our gazes were directed to their legs.`
`{n}In Doctor Nanjo's knee.`
` In Kumasawa‐san's ankle.`
`......Driven into each of them was something like a knife or a stake with a demonic decoration.`
`...They would surely be the same as the one that had pierced Jessica's back.`
`"......What is this?`
` ...It's the same as Jessica‐chan.`
` Is this supposed to be some kind of occult ritual, I wonder?"`
`".........I do not know.`
` The last time I saw their bodies, there was nothing like this.`
` Maybe it was done after they were carried out of the servant room."`
`The one that had been stuck into Doctor Nanjo's knee was still standing erect,`
` but the one that had been thrust into Kumasawa‐san's ankle might have been a little shallower.`
` It had come out and fallen over.`
`So, it was only when I saw that one that had fallen over, that for the first time, I realized that it wasn't a knife,`
` but something like a stake.`
`Its full length was probably about thirty centimeters.`
`{n}It was probably made out of bronze or iron or something of the sort.`
`Even without touching it, I could tell that it had some weight to it.`
`{n}It was composed of a grip and a cone‐shaped part, and it was obviously made to be a piercing weapon.`
`Maybe you could describe it like a miniature version of those lances Western knights used on horseback.`
`The grooves that had been carved in a spiral shape made it also look like a drill.`
`......However, the grip had an occult‐like design of a demon or something,`
` so instead of a weapon used in war,`
` it felt like something that would be used in a ritual to offer up a sacrifice.`
`"......There's no mistake.`
` ...They're meant to be...sacrifices."`
`".........On the seventh twilight, gouge the knee and kill.`
` On the eighth twilight, gouge the leg and kill."`
`"Wait.`
` Then, they've left out the fourth, fifth, and sixth twilights.`
` ......D‐......don't tell me..."`
`That's right.`
`{n}Why is Genji‐san alone?!`
`If something like this had happened, why wouldn't George‐aniki, Gohda‐san, or Shannon‐chan be here?!`
` Why was Genji‐san alone?!`
`"What is this?`
` Where did George‐kun and the other two go?!"`
`".........They told me that they wanted to go to Madam Natsuhi's room to search for something, and left.`
` They have not returned yet."`
`"What did you say...?`
` Umm, you say they left, when was that?!"`
`"Two or three hours ago, I believe."`
`"N‐no way...!!`
` Why didn't you say something that important—wait, no—why didn't you think that was suspicious?!"`
`"......There must always be one servant awaiting orders.`
` It was my duty to wait for orders until they returned."`
`Was Genji‐san really this much of a robot?!`
`This is bad, this is bad, it's really bad...!!`
`The fact that Doctor Nanjo and Kumasawa‐san {i:had been killed in this way} meant that three people had already been killed...!!`
`We ran towards Aunt Natsuhi's room.`
`{n}.........With a touch of anxiety, and just as much resignation.`
`Before we even saw the inside of Aunt Natsuhi's room,`
` ...we were imprisoned by a certain resignation.`
`On that door was bizarre...`
`graffiti—`
`no, filth...?`
`In any case, the door wasn't in a normal state, and we were able to imagine what was inside that room without opening it.`
`On the face of the door...... How should I say it?`
`......Someone had heavily painted their hands with the same red paint that the magic circles from before had been drawn with,`
` ...and had banged on the door, scratched it, dirtied it.`
`......It was dirtied like the aftermath of a kindergartner playing in the mud.`
`I didn't know what it could mean.`
`{n}...The bright‐red paint that had been slathered on was dripping down, and even though no one said it, it made us think of blood.`
`"...G‐...Genji‐san, please open it."`
`Auntie Rosa held her gun up high and ordered Genji‐san to open it.`
`Genji‐san approached the door without being particularly troubled by that stuff on it, and turned the knob,`
` but he immediately turned around, shaking his head.`
`It was locked.`
`Right now, there was only one person in this mansion who could lock and unlock doors at will: Auntie Rosa.`
`This time, Genji‐san asked Auntie Rosa to unlock the door, instead of the other way around.`
`After making a slightly disgruntled face, Auntie Rosa handed me a master key, and told me to open the door.`
`"......Battler‐kun, would you open it for me with this?"`
`"Just trusting Genji‐san with something like that wouldn't..."`
`Auntie Rosa glared at me with an intense gaze.`
`{n}......Getting into a fight here would only make the environment turn even more sour.`
`Without talking back any more, I approached that creepy door, and tried the knob.`
` ......It didn't open.`
`It was definitely the resistance of the lock.`
`{n}I stuck the master key into the keyhole.`
`Clunk.`
` A light resistance.`
`While listening to Auntie Rosa as she told me to be cautious, I opened the door without being particularly cautious at all.`
`And there.........was the scene, laid out before us, not betraying our expectations in the slightest.`
`"...........................!`
` How...horrible......"`
`"....................."`
`"As I thought, ......it was a reproduction of the fourth, fifth, and sixth twilights."`
`".........Uu."`
`The inside of the room looked as though a robber had just broken in.`
`Drawers were flung open, pulled out, with their contents thrown all over the floor,`
` the room devastated so that it looked nothing like the room of the methodical Aunt Natsuhi.`
`But the thing that caught the eye before that...`
`......was Gohda‐san's body lying facedown right in front of the door...`
`One of those demon stakes had been rammed right into the center of his chest, almost as though it had been stuck there to finish off a vampire.`
`......Exactly how far would it have reached after being stuck that deeply into his chest?`
`...My own chest hurt just imagining it.`
`"...Gouge the chest was the fifth twilight?"`
`"............Uu."`
`Maria grabbed my hand.`
`......Her expression looked just like normal,`
` ...but maybe she really was afraid of the aura in this room where three bodies lay.`
`And, along the wall farthest into the room, George‐aniki was dead.`
`......This time, one of those stakes had been rammed right in the center of his stomach.`
`{n}...Gouging the stomach was the sixth twilight, I think.`
`Shannon‐chan's body was face down over the front of the dresser, lying in a sea of blood.`
`In its horribly broken mirror, sprayed with blood, had she seen her final worldly expression?`
`...Because she was face down, I couldn't see her face, but I could imagine even without seeing it.`
`Nearby, in the sea of blood she lay in, a demon's stake had fallen...`
`......Only the fourth twilight was left.`
`{n}Gouge the head and kill...`
`Maybe my heart was completely tired out and dead...`
`Even though I knew what I was doing was wrong, ...I lifted her head, and checked.`
`......And confirmed that my guess was right on the mark.`
`There was a gaping hole in Shannon‐chan's forehead, and her insides were dripping out.`
`Not only that, ...you could even see...inside her.`
`After seeing that, I finally noticed that what I was doing was wrong.`
`I immediately averted my eyes, but by now, it was probably pointless.`
`"Hey, Battler‐kun!!`
` We have to leave everything alone until the police come!!`
` What do you think you're doing, touching it?!`
` What will you do if our precious evidence from the crime scene gets disturbed?!!"`
`Auntie Rosa yelled furiously at me, and even yanked the back of my collar.`
`I tottered limply and fell on my butt, ......and gazed dimly up at the ceiling...`
`"......Maria."`
`"Uu......?"`
`"......Now even the eighth twilight is over.`
` ......What was the ninth twilight again?"`
`"...........................`
` ...On the ninth twilight, the witch revives, and none shall be left alive."`
`"I see.`
` ......So now, the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice} will be revived.`
` ......What then?`
` ...On the final tenth twilight?"`
`"...On the tenth twilight, the journey ends, and you shall reach the Home of the Gold.`
` .........Very soon, the door to the Golden Land will be opened.`
` ...Very soon."`
`".........The witch revives, and none shall be left alive, you say.`
` .........We're going to die?`
` Or is the sacrificial ritual over now, ...and our journey will end, and we can make it to the Golden Land...?"`
`"................................."`
`"......Our journey, yeah right.`
` ......We've spent the whole day trying to find the culprit, racking our brains as we tried to break out of this situation,`
` ...and we haven't gotten anywhere.`
` It's like they say—thinking stupid is no better than sleeping."`
`"That's right, we've spent the whole day burning ourselves up with hatred and paranoia.`
` ......We said we could only trust dead people,`
` ...and we came all the way here just to check out their dead faces...`
` ...If we're like this,`
` ......how...`
`......can you say we can make it to the Golden Land......"`
`That's right... ......If nothing could be solved, it would have been much better if we had locked ourselves up the whole time without thinking at all.`
`Grandfather was the wisest of us.`
`{n}He's been shut up in his room since yesterday, without any contact with anyone.`
`......That would have been fine.`
`{n}Grandfather was the most correct...`
`"......It'll be alright, Battler.`
` ......If you're with me, it'll be alright.`
` .........Witches are very fickle, and they're terrifying beings who maybe kill humans for fun sometimes."`
`"...But, if you're together with me, it'll definitely be alright.`
` So, don't be afraid."`
`".........Thank you.`
` ......Even if that's just to comfort me, ...it makes me happy."`
`After Auntie Rosa finished investigating their deaths, she proclaimed that she would seal this room again,`
` chased the rest of us out, stole back the master key she had lent me, and locked the door again.`
`It seemed that George‐aniki had been holding the original key to Aunt Natsuhi's room.`
` She had also collected that.`
`............Wait a second.`
`{n}She had all of the master keys in her hand.`
`And if the original key had been shut up inside that room,`
` ......wasn't this another locked room?`
`So this is a fourth locked room......?`
`Now that we had been released from our suspicion of those three, ......we once again returned to the parlor.`
`I don't have a clue what's going on anymore.`
`......If only the dead are safe, and everyone alive is a wolf,`
` ......then all that's left is me, Auntie Rosa, Maria, and Genji‐san.`
`......Only those, Grandfather, and that 19th person—the guest who I hadn't even sensed— {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`Thirteen people had died, and six were left.`
` ......With only six people, how would the wolves and sheep puzzle end...?`
` Even though the puzzle which had had nineteen people in it had been reduced to a mere six,`
` ......I couldn't find any answer...`
`We returned to the parlor.`
`......I felt a little anxious that, while we were gone,`
` a creepy magic circle or something might have been drawn on the door to the parlor,`
` but thankfully, there was none...`
`"Thank you, Genji‐san.`
` This is far enough.`
` Please rest for the day."`
`"......Certainly.`
` ...Then, if you will allow me to rest."`
`"H‐...hey, Auntie Rosa...`
` ......Are you saying that you'll leave Genji‐san all alone in a situation like this...?"`
`"......You are right.`
` I do think it's very dangerous."`
`"......But, in that case, why is he safe?`
` After those three headed to Natsuhi nee‐san's room, he was alone the whole time.`
` And yet he's safe."`
`"......It's the wolves and sheep puzzle.`
` Why would an isolated sheep—a sheep in its weakest position—be safe?"`
`"...P‐......probably because, by coincidence, there weren't any wolves..."`
`"Wrong.`
` Because it wasn't a sheep."`
`"Are you saying Genji‐san's...a wolf...?"`
`"He said that he was alone in the kitchen, but that's impossible to prove.`
` The only ones who could have carried Doctor Nanjo and Kumasawa‐san's corpses, and who could have killed George and the rest, were him and {f:5:Beatrice}, right?"`
`"W‐wait, with that argument, anyone—"`
`"......Battler‐sama.`
` Thank you for your concern."`
`"...I believe that trust will be won not with a hundred excuses, but with a single unending faithfulness.`
` ......Even if I am not able to gain your trust, I wish to be faithful until the end."`
`".....................Genji‐san..."`
`"......Then it's settled.`
` ......If you are truly innocent, the police will prove that for us when they come tomorrow.`
` So, until then, we cannot remove you from suspicion."`
`".........After your long years of service to the Ushiromiya family, I find it truly painful to treat you so poorly.`
` ...But please understand for tonight.`
` ...Then, when tomorrow comes, please let me make up with you again."`
`Genji‐san gave his head a small shake.`
`"......Whether today or tomorrow,`
` I will continue to be a servant of the Ushiromiya family.`
` ......If you have any business, please say so at any time.`
` ......Then, if you will excuse me."`
`After hearing all that, there was nothing left to say.`
`{n}Genji‐san bowed deeply, and left down the hall...`
`And we entered the room.`
`...Even though Auntie Rosa still held all of the master keys herself, she began another thorough check of the inside of the parlor.`
`She opened the curtains, and checked again to make sure the windows were locked.`
`{n}As I watched, ......how should I say it, I felt like it didn't really matter anymore.`
`If I said anything unnecessary, it would turn into another fight.`
`{n}For a while, I gazed at her from the corridor, figured I had waited just about long enough, and entered the parlor behind her.`
`......If she can't trust anyone but the dead, she should just go around killing everyone with the gun she's got in her hand.`
`And then in the end, she'll realize that she herself was the wolf.`
`{n}...And then she can blast through the head of the final wolf, and the curtain will close on this insane murder theater...`
`As I thought that bitterly, I returned to the sofa where I had been encamped before,`
` and rudely rested both of my feet on the table...`
`......Or was about to, when I found something there and stopped my feet.`
`"........................`
` .........What is...this...?"`
`Right there, almost as though it was addressed to me, ...was a Western envelope.`
`It was that envelope from before, with the seal of the One‐winged Eagle.`
`{n}...And it was unopened.`
`W‐`
`.........wait wait wait wait...`
`...What is...this............?`
`When, who, put it in a place like this......?`
`I had been sitting here the whole time, until I went with everyone to check the corpses.`
`And there hadn't been anything.`
`...And when I returned,`
` it was...`
`here.`
`"......It's alright.`
` There was no problem with the locks on the windows.`
` This room is safe."`
`I heard Rosa muttering that...`
`......Wait wait wait wait.`
`{n}...Wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait.`
`We had made sure this room was safe when we exited it.`
`{n}We had checked that the windows were all perfectly locked.`
`{n}...And we had locked it, come back, and the windows were still locked.`
`......Then, wait, who had put this letter here and how......`
`I opened the letter.`
`{n}Two pieces of stationery came out.`
`The first page......had a magic circle drawn on it, in something like blood.`
`If I asked Maria, she'd probably know what it meant.`
`And there was writing on the other page.`
`{e:070:― Are you making progress solving the riddle of the epitaph?`
`Very, very soon, you'll run flat out of time.`
`The ninth twilight will start very soon.}`
`......There was no mistake.`
`{n}...It was a letter...from {f:5:Beatrice}...`
`"...Uu?`
` ......Battler,`
` ......what is that?"`
`"Ah, ......right.`
` When I came here just now,`
` ...i‐it was just placed here."`
`"What happened, Maria?`
` .........Huh?!`
` Battler‐kun, that letter?!"`
`"W‐wait, err!`
` It was just placed here.`
` Why?!`
` Even though we properly checked to make sure this room was closed!!`
` Why?!`
` Why!!"`
`".................................`
` ......Maria, come here."`
`Auntie Rosa closed her eyes just a little, and after silently thinking something, told Maria to come.`
`Maria obeyed her mother's words.`
`As she did, something unbelievable happened.`
`Auntie Rosa pointed the barrel of that gun at me...`
`"Battler‐kun, I've concluded that you are a "wolf"."`
`"Wh‐.........why?!?!"`
`"When I came into the room just now, I saw that there was nothing at all on the table.`
` ...And I know that Maria did not approach that table.`
` ...It was for a short time.`
` But the only one who approached the table, and claimed to have found the letter, is you."`
`"How can you,`
` ............wait, tha‐that's all screwed up!!`
` Why would I put something like this here?!`
` Wait wait, I just found something suspicious and reported it, right?!`
` Why are you suspecting me?!"`
`"Because only you could set that letter there!!`
` That's right, this is all a charade!!`
` You pulled an envelope from your pocket, and then acted as though you had just found it.`
` To create the illusion that the witch entered a locked room, set down a letter, and left!!"`
`"...............You dumbass...`
` Are you thinking like that a‐......again...?`
` Because of something like that,`
` ......you're going to suspect me?!"`
`"Cut that out!!`
` My family has been killed!!`
` Why would {i:I} of all people take part in the culprit's scheme?!!"`
`"Yes.`
` Even under the assumption you could receive a large amount of money, I don't want to believe a demon exists who would sell their own parents."`
`"But, ...maybe he does.`
` No, that's a bad way to say it.`
` ......What if, in your eyes, Battler‐kun, Rudolf nii‐san and Kyrie‐san weren't your parents?"`
`"...Wh‐......whaaa?!?!`
` Think about what you're saying!!"`
`"Dad is Dad!!`
` Sure I'm not related to Kyrie‐san by blood, but she's like a big sister to me!!`
` Don't you dare say otherwise, you bastard!!"`
`"Uu‐uu‐uu!!`
` Stoooppp iiiiit!!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`"Stop saying "uu‐uu"!!"`
`"......I'm sorry, that was a bad way to say it.`
` Of course, Ushiromiya Battler‐kun might be Rudolf nii‐san's child!"`
`"......But, are you really Battler‐kun, the son of Rudolf nii‐san?!"`
`"What the hell are you talking about?!!`
` If I'm not Battler, then who else do I look like?!"`
`"All of us, including Rudolf nii‐san, reunited with you after a six‐year gap.`
` No one can prove that you really are Ushiromiya Battler, right?!"`
`"Maybe you aren't really Ushiromiya Battler, but someone who's snuck in, trying to skillfully steal the wealth of the Ushiromiya family!!`
` Can you clearly prove that you are Ushiromiya Battler?!`
` Right here, right now!!!"`
`"Cut it out, damn it!!`
` I am me!`
` Ushiromiya Battler!!`
` If we're going to doubt even that much, are you really Ushiromiya Rosa?!`
` I'm myself, no one else!!`
` Yeah, that's right, it's just as you say, the only one you can trust other than corpses is yourself!!!"`
`"If you're going to say that much, it's time I argued back!"`
`"The door to Aunt Natsuhi's room, where George‐aniki and the others died, was locked!`
` George‐aniki was holding the key to that room, right?!`
` And by now, the only one holding a master key is you!`
` Weren't you the only one who could have locked that room?!?!"`
`"My reasoning goes like this.`
` You're in contact with the real culprit,`
` and while I wasn't looking, you lent them one of the five master keys!!"`
`"I wouldn't do that!!`
` See, there are five of them here, right?!"`
`"As if that matters!!`
` You could have had them set it in a pre‐arranged spot and then collected it back!!`
` And weren't you the one who said it was suspicious whether there really are five master keys?!"`
`"So how are you saying that someone other than yourself set that letter there?!!`
` {i:As long as you can't prove that}, you are a wolf!!"`
`"Shut uuuuuup!!`
` Then why don't you show me some proof,`
` how do you say the culprit killed George‐aniki and the rest in that locked room?!`
` How did they lock it?!!"`
`"Absolutely and totally correct!`
` {p:1:Natsuhi's room was exactly the same, just like usual}!`
` {p:1:The door and the windows were locked from the inside}."`
`"{p:1:There were no frauds or tricks, no means of secret passage nor places in which to hide}!`
` {p:1:Natsuhi's own key was in George's pocket, and locked inside the room}.`
` {p:1:That leaves only the five master keys, and "Rosa" was holding all of them}!"`
`"{p:1:And while I'm at it, the parlor is the same}.`
` {p:1:The key to the parlor itself is sealed away in the servant room}.`
` {p:1:So unlocking it with anything but a master key is impossible}! {p:1:The locked‐room definition of the room is the same as always}!"`
`"Come onnnnn, there's only one suspect noooooooooow,`
` or are you still playing dumb, Ushiromiya Battleeee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}eeeer?!"`
`"Shut uuuuuuup!!`
` You keep silent as wellll{-}l{-}l{-}l{-}l{-}l{-}l{-}l{-}l{-}l{-}llllll!!!"`
`"You're the one who should keep silent, how do you say that letter was set there by someone other than you?!`
` As long as you can't prove that, you're a wolf!!"`
`"If I can be suspected, then you can be suspected, you try showing me some proof,`
` weren't you the first to enter the room and begin checking the windows?!"`
`"Then you anticipated that I'd return to where I'd been sitting before, and secretly placed the letter.`
` I can also suspect that this is your trap, can't I?!"`
`"Why would I use a trap like that?!!`
` If I was a wolf, I'd shoot you with this gun without question!!"`
`"That's no reason!!`
` Maybe, because you couldn't commit murder in front of Maria, you chose the roundabout way of setting a clever trap!!"`
`"All of the master keys are in your hands!`
` So this place and the room just a while ago, are all your doing, aren't they?!!`
` If you can talk your way out of this, then let me hear your excuse!!"`
`"That's right, you've been suspicious from the start!`
` Why is it that six of the adults in the family conference were killed, and you were the only exception?`
` Why were you the only one not in that chapel?!"`
`"There can only be one reason, you called Dad and the rest out there and killed them!!`
` Damn it, damn it,`
` that explains everything, doesn't it, don't fuck with me don't fuck with me,`
` stop saying things that don't make seeee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}eeense!!"`
`"Uuuuu!!`
` Stooppppp iiiiiiiiit!!`
` You mustn't fiiiight!!"`
`"Mama too, Battler too, stop iiiiiiiiiiit, stop iiiiiiiiiiiiit!!!`
` It's no one's fault!`
` It's not Battler's or Mama's fault!!`
` The witch did all of this!`
` She did it with magic!!`
` It's no one's faaaaaaaaaault!!`
` Uu‐uuuu!!"`
`Maria thrust herself in between me and Auntie Rosa, both of us incensed.`
`I was taken aback by Maria's crying voice and returned to my senses.`
`{n}...At that instant, I became filled with shame.`
`{n}Tears flowed from my eyes.`
`"......That's right...`
` ......It's all...`
`......the witch's fault, isn't it......!!`
` All this about keys and tricks and alibis......`
`all of it, all of it was stupid!!"`
`"Even though it's the work of the witch, we weren't even able to trust each other as fellow humans...!!`
` Right, Auntie Rosa? From the beginning, there wasn't a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} culprit, it was all the work of the witch."`
`"So there's no way you're the culprit,`
` and there's no way I'm the culprit, or Maria, or Genji‐san, or aaaaaanyone!!`
` Why has it come to this?!!"`
`"Why am I screaming with Auntie Rosa, ......who I loved?!`
` Why am I having this fight...`
`...with the kind aunt who I loved?!"`
`"Why, why does everyone have to suspect each other?!?!`
` I'm not going to doubt my auntie, I'm not going to doubt anyone,`
` it's all the work of the witch, it's all the work of {f:5:Beatrice},`
` it's all, all a crime that {f:5:Beatrice} committed with magic!!"`
`"{f:5:Beatriceeeeee}, please, show yourself here,`
` and confess to us that you did everything,`
` I've had enough already, I've had enough of doubting each other like this!!"`
`"So forgive us,`
` release us,`
` release us from this hell of suspecting each other until we see each other's deaths!!`
` Give me my kind relatives and cousins back!!`
` I hate it, I hate it, I hate it all!!`
` You definitely exist, you win!!"`
`"Show yourself, ooo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}oooohhh, {f:5:Beatriceeee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}eeeeee}!`

`".........Am I...............still...alive?"`
`Kinzo seemed to have fallen into a doze at some point.`
`He searched for his spectacles, and looked at the clock.`
`{n}......It was 10 p.m.`
`"...Her ritual, I wonder, how far has it progressed?`
` ............It must have progressed quite far by this time."`
`Kinzo lifted his heavy body from the chair, ......and approached the portrait of the witch that he had gazed at every day.`
`".........{f:5:Beatrice}.`
` Very soon, ......I will be able to be reunited with your smile.`
` ............It doesn't matter if I die!`
` If I could just see your smile once more, I would gladly give this life of mine!"`
`"So,`
` ...I beg youuuu, let me...`
`...meet with you one more tiiii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}iiiiime...`
` And let me swear my love to you, let me apologize for my crimes, uuuoooooooooooo......"`
`"......But I won't let you escape!!`
` You are mine!!`
` From your hair to the tips of your toes, to the dirt under your nails, you are mine!!`
` Every fragment of your flesh is mine, even the broth of your corpse is mine!!"`
`"I won't let you escape, this time you won't spill from my hands!!`
` I'll make you mine for all eternity!!!`
` I will never let you escape a second time,`
` I will never let you escape a second time!!"`
`Kinzo howled in rage, then suddenly fell to his knees, ...as he shook and scraped at the wall...`
` ...In an instant, he had started sobbing.`
`"............uuuuuu, hic...,`
` that's wrong,`
` that's not what I wanted to sayyy, {f:5:Beatriceeeeee}..."`
`"Please,`
` ......let me meet you one more time...`
` Even if you only let me apologize......`
` Uuuuuuuuu, {f:5:Beatriceeeeee},`
` ...hic, ...hic...! Uwaaaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}u{0}a{0}a{0}uauau...!!"`
`"You are beloved, yearned for...! I was wrong...!`
` If you would just smile, I wouldn't need anything else...`
` I made a mistake, I got it wrong,`
` ......I did something that cannot be taken back...!"`
`"In atonement, I have offered the whole remainder of my life...!!`
` In order to apologize to you, in order to atone for my sins,`
` .........I have...`
`...offered everything.........`
` ......Please, even if it is as I die..."`
`"............At least...`
`............let me...`
`say one word...`
`...of apology...y......`
` {f:5:Beatriceeeeeee}......`
` Uuuuuu, hic, uuuuuuuu, uuuuuuuuuuuuu!"`
`......As Kinzo shook and cried, behind his small back, a butterfly appeared out of nowhere, like a flake of gold leaf, and softly fell down...`
`...You fool, Kinzo.`
`{n}Do you think a woman exists who would fall for a man's tears.........?`
`Well, ......even if it wouldn't make a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} woman fall for you, ...it might for a woman who is not {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.`
`Kinzo.`
` Do you remember......?`
`{n}The board position of our chess game, which we never finished......?`
`Kinzo, as though he had suddenly remembered something, approached the chess set.`
` The game he had been playing with Nanjo until yesterday remained there still.`
`...He wiped the pieces from the chessboard with a wide sweeping motion, and began to line them up again one by one.`
` ...It was the setup for a game in progress.`
`".........That's right. Like this.`
` ............I advanced my queen.`
` ...That was a very spectacular move.`
` It might have been a little too intense for you.`
` .........I deliberated whether you would throw away your piece or not,`
` ......deliberated and deliberated............"`
`Kinzo waited, with the opposite seat empty.`
`......Surely, very soon, his opponent would appear there,`
` ......and he would be able to restart this game again...`
`...You fool, Kinzo.`
`You want to apologize?`
` You want to see my face again?`
` You want to make my smile an eternal thing?`
`Why can't you say a much, much simpler word?`
` Even though that is the single element of the world.........`
`At that time, Kinzo muttered.`
`{n}......A prayer?`
` An entreaty?`
`{n}.........It was probably best to just call it muttering.`
`"......I.........love you...`
` ......{f:5:Beatrice}..............."`
`They were pure words, like something an innocent child would say, without any evil intent...`
`...You really are a fool, Kinzo.`
`If you ever have the chance to do your life over again...`
`{n}...know that those words could never cause a woman to fall for you.`
`Yes, ...not without a miracle.`
`{n}So this.........`
`Just then.`
` .........Kinzo definitely heard a small knock, with a different tempo than those of the servants.........`
`".........Who is it?"`
`The woman beyond the door......didn't answer.`
`"......I'm asking who you are!!`
` Will you not answer?!!"`
`The woman beyond the door...`
`...didn't answer.`
`"Could it be...`
` ............Oooooh,`
` ......could it be......`
` B‐`
`......{f:5:Beatrice}?"`
`".........{f:5:Beatrice},`
` .........{f:5:Beatriceeeeeeeee}!!"`
`The woman beyond the door......answered.`
`On the ninth twilight, the witch revives, and none shall be left alive.``Battler could be found in the dining hall.`
`Unable to summon the will to return to the guesthouse in the middle of this rain,`
` he had wandered halfheartedly around the mansion in search of a random place to sit, ...and had stationed himself in the dining hall.`
`He hadn't bothered to lock it.`
`He did think that maybe the shapeless murderer, or the Golden Witch, might come to kill him now that he was isolated,`
` but he no longer thought about resisting that.`
`On the contrary, he had no intention of blocking the culprit with a lock.`
`{n}He wanted that person to come at him openly, from the front.`
`...If it was a murderer, he thought he'd ask them to tell about some of those wonderful locked room tricks as a parting souvenir.`
`And if it was a witch, he thought he'd ask her to at least take his life with some wonderful magic.`
`......However, ironically, neither of these two came to meet Battler...`
`Battler opened the liquor cabinet on his own and enjoyed the liquor to his heart's content.`
`{n}No longer was there anybody anywhere who would have a problem with him drinking alcohol.`
`He boldly set both of his legs on the extravagant tablecloth and savored the high‐quality liquor, which probably had a mind‐boggling price, straight from the neck of the bottle....`
`At that time, ......someone knocked.`
`Battler realized that he was about to meet his maker...`
`"Heee~yy, it's not locked.`
` Come in, whoever you are.`
` And please introduce yourself.`
` If you're human, gimme your name.`
` And if you're {f:5:Beatrice}, gimme your three sizes."`
`"You might not believe this, but I'm a pretty well‐known breast‐sommelier, y'sheee?"`
`".........It is Genji, Battler‐sama."`
`"...Genji‐san, huh.`
` ......Sorry, but I'm not interested in your bust size.`
` Please, come in. It's open."`
`".........Excuse me."`
`Genji‐san opened the door and bowed.`
`.........So Genji‐san was the culprit after all, ...or maybe an accomplice?`
` ......That theory would probably explain most of the tricks...`
`"Did you come to give me my last rites?"`
`".........Nothing of the sort.`
` ......I shall excuse myself if I am disturbing you."`
`"...Wait, wait, excusing yourself without even telling me what you wanted would actually just be creepy.`
` ...What do you want?`
` ...Please, let me do as I wish, at least in the very end."`
`".........Battler‐sama, is it truly your wish...`
`to spend the little time you have left in such an indolent fashion?"`
`Those words...stung...`
`{n}......Of course it wasn't.`
`"...............................`
` What can I do at this point?`
` ......I'm ready to die at any time..."`
`"......You are just like the Master.`
` Indeed, you inherited the Master's blood strongly...."`
`"You mean to tell me that Grandfather, that larger‐than‐life man, was actually willing to die at any moment...?`
` First I've heard of that."`
`".........The Master's life,`
` ......after a number of sad incidents,`
` ......was completely reduced to atonement."`
`"...What do you know?"`
`"............{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama's ritual has been entirely completed up to the eighth twilight.`
` ...I believe...that I can now tell you everything."`
`"Wha‐......what did you say...?"`
`My drunkenness was completely blown away.`
` I lowered my feet from the table and listened carefully to hear what kind of words Genji‐san would say next...`
`"Battler‐sama.`
` ......I shall guide you to the Master's study.`
` ......It would probably be better to hear it directly from them."`
`"From......them...?`
` H‐hey, what in the world do you mean by that...!!"`
`"......Come, this way.`
` I shall guide you.`
` Battler‐sama."`
`After Genji‐san told me to follow him, he started to walk down the corridor.`
`I sobered up completely and went after him...`
`We climbed the big staircase, .........towards the third floor.`
`{n}Genji‐san stopped walking halfway.`
`{n}He then turned back and spoke.`
`".........Battler‐sama.`
` ......From here on, you will...`
`......probably see things you will not be able to understand."`
`"Don't try to intimidate me.`
` .........I've already seen plenty of things I can't understand today."`
`".........Please accept what you see as you see it,`
` and what you hear as you hear it."`
`"Questions like "Why?",`
` or "What?",`
` ...there is no need for such things.`
` ...Battler‐sama, you will probably simply learn the truth.`
` Whether to accept it, believe it,`
` or even deny it, are all choices I leave to you."`
`"....................................."`
`Genji‐san checked one last time to see whether I was prepared to learn the truth.`
`The eighth twilight had already ended.`
` And on the ninth twilight, the witch revives, ......and none shall be left alive.`
`It meant that {f:5:Beatrice} had already revived.`
`{n}...And probably, none of us would be allowed to return alive.`
`If I was going lose my life anyway, ......I wanted to know the truth in the end.`
`{n}...It didn't matter how hard it might be to accept.`
`"..................Yeah.`
` ......Even if a demon or a witch shows up, ...I'm prepared."`
`".........You really are just like the Master in his youth.`
` ......Battler‐sama, please be diligent in your studies.`
` In the future, you will surely have great aspirations.`
` And make sure that at that time, you are not forced into a lifetime of regret by a lack of academic knowledge."`
`".........If I have a chance to work hard in my studies, then no problem."`
`".............................."`
`Genji‐san's silence forced me to consider that resignation of mine more deeply...`
`And, .........we could see the door of Grandfather's study, impregnated with a sweet smell.`
`From his pocket, Genji‐san withdrew a gold key with an elegant design.`
`The master keys had been confiscated by Auntie Rosa, but the key to this study alone, he had kept with him.`
`He put it in the keyhole, .........and it made a heavy clunking sound.`
`".........My lord.`
` It is Genji.`
` I have brought Battler‐sama with me."`
`There was no reply, but it seemed that permission to go in had been given...`
`"Come, Battler‐sama.`
` ......Please enter."`
`"..................Yeah.`
` ......In I go."`
`I readied myself, ......and threw the door open...`
`At that moment, ...I got slightly disoriented by the dazzling golden glow..........`
`It was, .........somehow,`
` ......a swarm of butterflies, shining gold.`
`The golden butterflies that were completely filling the inside of the study poured out all at once.......`
`"Wha‐............`
` ......What the heck...`
`......is thiiiss.................."`
`It was almost like golden leaf confetti.`
`{n}The interior of Grandfather's study was filled with a golden glow...`
`And......there were reception sofas and a table for guests placed in front of the study desk,`
` .........and I could see Grandfather's back.`
`There was someone on the side opposite from Grandfather.`
`{n}...It was in shadow, so I couldn't see it well...`
`"......My lord.`
` I have brought Battler‐sama."`
`"............Battler, is it?`
` I'm busy thinking now...`
` Be silent for a while......"`
`Kinzo declared that in displeasure, his back still turned.`
`It seemed that he was enjoying playing chess with a visitor...`
`Apparently, the opponent had counterattacked with a superb move.`
`{n}Kinzo seemed to be enjoying himself as he thought deeply, while occasionally laughing and groaning...`
`"I thought for thirty years.`
` ......I thought for thirty years about how to counterattack this move...`
` Have fun, have fun with the move I fermented for thirty years."`
`"......Heheheheheheheh.`
` Indeed, this is a deeply matured move.`
` ......Such fun, such fun... *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*, hahahahahahaha...!!`
` Unbeatable, unbeatable."`
`"......Wha‐`
`............what is...`
`......this........."`
`"So you came, Battler.`
` Wait just a moment.`
` Be silent for Kinzo's sake.`
` ...Isn't it too early to resign, Kinzo?`
` I can already counterattack for several moves.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*...!"`
`It should have been...`
`...my first meeting with that witch.`
`However, ...I knew this witch.`
`{n}Even though it was our first meeting,`
` ...I knew her,`
` ......from the portrait......!`
`"Genji.`
` Serve something for Battler.`
` What would be the most appropriate for this man...?"`
`"......The same which the Master has loved since the days of his youth."`
`"That is ideal; serve it to him.`
` ......You did well coming here, Ushiromiya Battler.`
` First, take a seat."`
`".........You called my name many times, did you not?`
` In deference to that, I allowed you to meet me.`
` ...So, what will you ask me?`
` What will you inquire?"`
`"......The door to the Golden Land will soon be opened.`
` Soon, we will have a banquet to celebrate my revival, to which I will be welcoming the witches.`
` ...In the meantime, I'll be answering your questions, as many as you like."`
`"I, ......I have a bunch of things I want to ask about!!`
` What happened on this island?!`
` And why did these incidents happen?!"`
`"I want to ask about the locked rooms too!!`
` What about the chapel?!`
` What about Jessica's room?!`
` And the servant room?!`
` And Aunt Natsuhi's room?!`
` And the parlor?!"`
`"There's more still I want to ask about!!`
` About the witch's true nature!!`
` Are you really a witch?!!`
` What is your purpose, what do you want to make us do and why did you call me here?!!`
` Answer me, about everything!!!"`
`"Arrrrghhh, be quiet!!`
` You think merely asking will get you answers?!?!"`
`"Don't say that, Kinzo.`
` A fragile and fleeting spider web did protect from King Herod once.`
` ......Just as there are no useless things in this world, there are also no useless questions."`
`"Very well, I'll answer all your questions.`
` ......But, I do have one condition."`
`"What is it?"`
`"Once you have heard everything, if you are satisfied of my existence,`
` ............kneel, and kiss my shoes.`
` I called you here because I wanted to make you submit to me."`
`"...Kinzo and I made a bet.`
` We bet on which would come first, Kinzo thinking of a new move, or me forcing you to submit.`
` I don't see myself losing.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"...D‐............Damn you, talking so tough!!`
` Yeah, alright.`
` Try to make me admit it.`
` ...Try to make me admit that you're a witch and that you can use weird, awesome, and great magic!!"`
`"If I submit, I'll kiss your shoes or do whatever else you want!!!"`
`The witch cackled gloatingly.`
`{n}Then, she glared at him unpleasantly with eyes that said a man can't go back on his word...`
`"Well said!!`
` So, from what question shall I begin?!`
` I'll answer everything!!`
` Come, what will the first one be?!?!"``"Where are you, {f:5:Beatrice}!!`
` Show yourself!!`
` {f:5:Beatriceee}!!"`
`Rosa finally arrived at the chapel.`
` She pointed her gun around her, screaming the witch's name, but there was no way there would be an answer.`
`After grimacing slightly, she noisily approached the table where her siblings' corpses were still exposed, and stretched out her arm towards the gold ingots.`
`They were very heavy, but Rosa paid that no regard.`
`{n}She wrapped one of them up in a blanket, and slung it over her shoulder.`
`"At least...just this one......`
` Just this should be worth more than ten million..."`
`Rosa did not part with her gun either, carrying the gold in addition to it.`
`{n}...Her shoulders were screaming, but Rosa didn't care.`
`"......Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi.`
` It will happen very soon.`
` ......Very soon, the door to the Golden Land...will open."`
`"Stop laughing with that creepy voice!!`
` Where is {f:5:Beatrice}?!`
` Yes, I know it, she's around here somewhere, isn't she?!`
` You know, right?!`
` Where?!"`
`"Kihihihihihihihihihihihi.`
` I dooon't knowww.`
` Even if you don't search for her, you can meet her in the Golden Land.`
` ...Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi,`
` ouch."`
`"Stop that laugh!!`
` ......Aaah, it almost makes {i:me} want to laugh!!`
` That's right, that was definitely a witch, definitely a witch!!`
` I didn't understand, I thought it was a human calling herself a witch, I was wrong!!!"`
`"...It really was a witch!!`
` I won't be fooled by a thing like that!!`
` You're there, aren't you?!`
` Come out, show yourself!!`
` {f:5:Beatriceeee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}eeeee}!!!"`
`"I told you, she'll appear very soon.`
` The door to the Golden Land will be opened.`
` ......Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi..."`
`"............Of course.`
` That's what I should have done!`
` I don't care, I shall throw away the rook!`
` You, woman, are the king, who can't even be reached without the resolve to lose everything one has.`
` I'll corner you, {f:5:Beatriceeee}.`
` Hihahahahahahahahahaha!"`
`"At least call me a queen.`
` Hoh, what a brilliant move.`
` Tenacity is in your, ...no, in the Ushiromiyas' blood."`
`"......How pleasant!`
` Truly an elegant night.`
` Ku‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐ha...!!"`
`".........My lord; {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` It will soon be time for the banquet."`
`"Already?`
` ......That's fast.`
` Every night I pass with you goes by fast;`
` the moon falls like an apple, and the sun rises like a small fish leaping out of the river."`
`"Shall we go, it is time.`
` ......Stand, Battler.`
` It is the beginning of the banquet to celebrate my revival."`
`"I'll introduce you as my new furniture, ...no, as my toy.`
` To the dignitaries among witches."`
`The witch was relaxing elegantly, her feet thrown out from the sofa and sitting on top of a footrest.`
`...However, the footrest wasn't a part of the sofa, ......it was a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.`
` Which was down on all fours......`
`"......{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, your silk dress."`
`"You are the guest of honor, but I am the host.`
` I will go out first.`
` It would have been nice if Shannon were here to help dress you, but, unfortunately, it seems that she no longer remains."`
`"......She's never around when I want to use her.`
` Completely useless.`
` .........However, you did well to remain here.`
` ...I'm happy, my friend."`
`"......I am grateful for your words."`
`"Good.`
` Wait downstairs, you two.`
` Genji, good work, set the dress down over there."`
`"......Certainly.`
` .........Well then, my lord."`
`"We will go first.`
` ...{f:5:Beatrice}, I will see you later."`
`"Indeed."`
`Kinzo and Genji left the study.`
`{n}After that, only the witch and the dress and the furniture remained.`
`".........Do you know why I am not embarrassed to show myself to you naked...?"`
`"..........................."`
`"It's because you are furniture.`
` Furrrrniture.`
` Understand?`
` Furniture, just furrrrniture!"`
`"Who would feel shame at exposing their body to furniture?`
` So there is no reason for me to feel shame because of you.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`The witch stood up, and removed her jacket just at the shoulders.`
`{n}......The jacket slumped down at the back.`
`When the furniture respectfully approached to pick up her clothing, the witch gave it a small kick and it fell over.`
`...The furniture was afraid of what misconduct it had shown...`
`"Do you, as furniture, plan to force me to unbutton myself?"`
`"......Stand.`
` And undo the buttons.`
` ...One by one, carefully.`
` Quickly.`
` Beautifully.`
` With no mistakes.`
` The guests are being kept waiting, change my clothes quickly."`
`"..................Yes..."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*, kakakaka, hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐ha!!`
` Undo them carefully.`
` Those buttons are each worth more than one of your eyeballs.`
` ...If you accidentally tear one off, I'll sew on an eyeball of yours in its place...`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`The entrance hall was bustling with a large number of figures.`
`{n}And it was sparkling gold with the gold butterflies flying around.`
`The gentlemen in suits and tuxedos and the ladies in dresses looked like they were having a great number of friendly chats.`
` At a glance, it might have looked like a fabulous medieval ball.`
`But they all had one thing in common, and that thing was exceedingly bizarre.`
`......Because all of them...had goat heads.`
`It was impossible to tell whether it was a goat mask masquerade,`
` .........or whether they really had goat heads.`
`...The latter was a ridiculous notion, but in this bizarre world, there was serious doubt about which was true...`
`Kinzo was amongst those goat nobles, greeting them.`
`Every one of them seemed to be an honored guest, and Kinzo greeted them more respectfully than could ever have been imagined from his normal demeanor.`
`At that time, Genji's voice rang out through the hall.`
`{n}It was a voice calling for silence.`
`{n}That voice stopped the voices of idle chatter, and everyone turned to face Genji.`
`".........Tonight marks the entrance of our Golden Witch, who has achieved her revival,`
` the Lady {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` I ask you all to join me in welcoming her with your applause."`
`When Genji began to applaud, it quickly spread through the guests, and became thunderous applause.`
`And.........the Golden Witch appeared at the top of the large staircase...`
`She gracefully waved her hand as she slowly descended the staircase...with her preferred furniture in tow...`
`The goat nobles offered unanimous words of celebration in some long‐forgotten language.`
`And those with whom she was closely acquainted embraced her, filled with joy at their reunion.`
`As the witch offered greetings of reunion, ...the witch's furniture followed behind her the whole time.`
`.........There was a chain around its neck.`
`{n}This was gripped in the witch's hand, like it was a trained dog.`
`The chain wasn't there to restrain it.`
`{n}...The only purpose of the restraining device was to injure the furniture's dignity...`
`It wasn't permitted to wear anything else on its body.`
`One of the young woman goats, mixed in with the goat nobles,`
` softly removed her goat mask as the furniture passed in front of her, and spoke with eyes that had no light in them.`
`That face...looked like it belonged to a long‐haired young girl...`
`"...............How pitiful."`
`"Ohh, Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}.`
` Welcome.`
` Do you like my furniture?"`
`".........Good taste."`
`After saying only that, the witch called {f:5:Bernkastel} once again put on her goat mask,`
` and was swallowed up in the shadows of the other tall goats...`
`"Ahahahahahahaha...`
` Sore loser.`
` She's irritated."`
`"You're right.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`The young women goats giggled, and the witch once again let out a high‐pitched laugh.`
`"Thank you for gathering here for my sake tonight!!`
` Why don't we enjoy to the fullest this "banquet of the witch", where old friends have gathered from past and present, east and west...!"`
`"Come, we will eat all night,`
` drink all night,`
` slurp all night,`
` and chew to bits all night as we enjoy ourselves!!`
` Look at the clock, it shows the time when the ending hour and the beginning hour melt together... ...Come!!`
` Let us begin the banquet of the witch!!!"`
`When the witch proclaimed the beginning of the banquet, the large clock pointed to 24:00, and the sound of a bell began to ring out loudly...`
`"Come...... Now is the time!!`
` Open the golden door............!!!"`
`All at once, the butterflies leafed in gold flew all around the inside of the room.`
`Amidst the golden storm and the brilliant gold‐colored light, the cross‐section joining this world and a different world......was cut open......`
`Amidst the goats' delighted voices, the mansion of the human world and the mansion of those not human overlapped,`
` ......and, in the form of golden butterflies, all those folk who praised the resurrection of the Golden Witch...`
`...poured out of the depths of hell...`
`It was...a golden...tornado.`
`{n}...A rondo of golden demons.`
`Come, tonight we will put aside rank.`
`Throw open the wine cellar,`
` drop the snake's head into the liquor pot,`
` throw cows and chickens into the furnace alive,`
` drink and eat and sing and dance,`
` sneer and kill and desecrate and degrade!!`
`"Aaaaaahh, {f:5:Beatrice}!!`
` Take me to the Golden Land now!`
` To the Golden Laaaaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aaaand!!!`
` Oooo{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}ooohhh{0}h{0}hhhhh, aaaaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaaaahhh!!!"`
`The goat nobles were suddenly crushing in around Kinzo.`
`...Almost like they were kids demanding the autograph of some famous movie star.`
`There were two differences.`
` First, they were witches, not kids.`
` And second, what the witches demanded were not autographs.`
`Kinzo began to drown in the sea of goat nobles.`
`{n}Only Kinzo's laughing voice echoed throughout the area.`
`It was a grand mixture of laughter and his death throes.`
`{n}And Kinzo became wine and meat and bread.`
`An aroma if slurped, a rich taste if gnawed, and pleasant to tear to bits!`
`The voice of his death throes lingered on sweetly,`
` and adorned with melted chocolate and silver dragées, it would make a wonderful dessert!`
`If you took the bones home, you could also use them for a soup,`
` and the remains could even become toys for the children to play with,`
` and they could also become good tools for fortune‐telling that always gave misfortune!`
`That entire scene, ......was watched by the piece of furniture.`
`{n}It was all fantastical.`
` ...It was all demonic.`
`...Was the quaking of its heart, which should have been paralyzed, ...proof that it could still feel fear?`
`Just then, its knees buckled, and the furniture's body tumbled onto the center of the carpet.`
`Because the witch had kicked those knees from behind.`
`"Kneel and show your respect.`
` Rub your forehead against the carpet and show how vulgar you are.`
` Join your hands behind your back and swear that you will offer all your flesh and blood to me."`
`"..................u............ah........."`
`The piece of furniture let out a painful voice.`
`...Fear is the most primal emotion {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s have.`
`{n}...Was that emotion reviving his sense of self, which should already have been killed?`
`".........Hmph.`
` So, you are still far from being appropriate for my furniture."`
`"Good!`
` I will carefully make you into the kind of furniture I like, the kind appropriate only for me.`
` ...I suppose the best you can do for now is simply entertaining the guests!"`
`The goat nobles were surrounding the cowering furniture...`
`{n}It seemed that their blazing, blood‐red eyes couldn't hide their ecstasy at this new young food that they had been given.`
`And from their mouths, from which protruded countless ugly teeth, saliva,`
` ...or maybe the traces of meat and wine that they had just eaten, dribbled down...`
`".........e............eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek!!"`
`As the piece of furniture let out a wild scream, it retreated, still sitting on its backside.`
`...But the circle of goat nobles was closing in...`
`And the piece of furniture looked at the witch's face.`
` ...It stared at her face one final time, believing that because it had submitted to the witch, she would show it some mercy.`
`But there was nothing but scorn on the witch's face, and she wasn't even facing it anymore.`
`The witch went off to greet an honored guest with whom she had crossed gazes...`
`The goat nobles looked down upon the furniture.`
`They were, in fact, waiting.`
`Just like how one must remove the cork in order to drink champagne,`
` before bringing the offering served at the banquet to their mouths, they were waiting for just one of {i:those}.`
`Of course, the furniture didn't know what that was.`
`...But it would come out of his mouth all by itself.`
` In the same way there is always a pop when the cork is removed, it too would certainly leave his mouth.`
`"...G...`
`......yaa...`
`ahiiii{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}i{0}iiIII!!!"`
`{nobreak:{m:-5:—}—}A scream.`
`{n}It was a sign that the modest banquet at which he was to be served...had begun.`
`"Gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaa`
`gebu{0}ki{0}kya{0}kya{0}ka{0}ku`
`oooo{0}ga{0}a{0}ge{0}o{0}e`

`Gapupogyugukigukiboryu.`
`By now the rose garden was a garden of roses and gold.`
` A gold‐colored garden where gold butterflies, gold fairies, gold lizards rampaged and flew about wildly.`
`"Maria, hurry!!`
` Run!!`
` Hurry hurry hurry hurry!!"`
`Holding onto the gun and the blanket wrapping the ingot,`
` Rosa ran at a speed Maria couldn't catch up with, sometimes pausing to call out at Maria to run faster.`
`Therefore, she saw it every time.`
`{n}...She saw the golden pursuers chasing them from the mansion!`
`The mass of gold butterflies was chasing after them like a massive crawling hand!!`
` And horrifyingly strange‐looking shadowy figures with goat heads were chasing after them...!!`
`There was no need for her to strain her eyes.`
` Because those blazing pupils told her what would happen if she was captured.`
`"......Mama, wait,`
` Mama, wait......`
` ...Uu‐uu,`
` ......au!!"`
`Maria tripped over.`
`Rosa, ashamed that for just an instant she had entertained thoughts of abandoning her daughter and running away, kicked back against the ground and instantly reversed direction.`
`As Rosa's own child tried to stand,`
` the goat‐head that had sprinted over to get the first bite grabbed a fistful of her hair and pulled her up from the back...!!`
`"Mamaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa,`
` noooo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}ooooo!!"`
`Rosa rammed into the goat‐head with her shoulder,`
` spun,`
` bashed the back of her elbow into the goat's jaw,`
` and buried her knee into its protruding chest!!`
`And she thrust the barrel of the gun inside the goat‐head's mouth as it doubled over from the pain in its gut!`
`"......Just try laying one finger on Maria in front of me.`
` I'll show you just how lukewarm the hell you came from is."`
`The blast from the 45‐caliber Long Colt bullet exploded inside the goat‐head's throat,`
` and its medulla oblongata was instantly pulverized.`
`The goat‐head couldn't understand.`
`It had thought that women were like already opened wine bottles!`
`{n}It had thought that they were wine bottles, and that turning them upside down would immediately cause their deep‐red contents to come out!`
`"Mama!!`
` Mamaaaaaa!!"`
`Released, Maria flung her arms around Rosa.`
`But the pursuers were still coming!`
` They could see the giant goat‐heads, who had given up even pretending to be {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}, running towards them from across the rose bushes.`
`Rosa spilled several extra bullets, which had been in the pocket of her coat, all over the place, and told Maria to pick them up.`
`"Y‐yes...!`
` Pick up, pick up...!!"`
`"Maria.`
` If Mama falls down,`
` run.`
` Go to the shore.`
` And swim, and swim, and swim!`
` There's no place on this island where we can survive!!"`
`"N‐no!!`
` Together with Mama!!`
` Uuu!!"`
`Rosa's gun roared four times.`
` But even though she really did land four shots in the chest of the massive, approaching goat, it didn't even flinch!!`
`The goat ran with a violent vigor, as though it planned to crush Rosa and Maria with its massive body!!`
`"Put the bullets in!!`
` Quickly!!"`
`"U‐uu!!"`
`Rosa grasped the blanket with the ingot in both hands,`
` and she herself sprinted at the goat, dragging the ingot along behind her!!`
` Without even an ounce of fear of that strange‐looking giant!!`
`If it's to protect my daughter, I'll overcome even hell!!`
`"I'll show you...`
`what a golden dream looks liiiiiiiiiiike!!!"`
`Rosa's roar.`
` The goat‐head's roar.`
`The terribly heavy ingot, after picking up a terrible centrifugal force and speed, slammed into the goat‐head's cranium.`
`Rosa pulled a fountain pen from her pocket.`
` But she held it crooked.`
` She placed it in her palm,`
` in the gap between her middle finger and her ring finger, so that it stuck out when she made a fist, almost like it was a stinger growing out.`
`She jabbed that stinger into the left eye of the goat‐head as its head toppled forward.`
` Was the goat‐head's roar a scream?`
`But Rosa's roar was different.`
`She pulled back her fist and slammed it into the fountain pen that was still sticking into the goat‐head's eye.`
` The pointed tip was gouged destructively into the depths of its head...!`
`"Mama, bullets in!!"`
`"Good job!!"`
`As I grabbed the gun Maria had thrown, I finally heard the thunderous crash of the giant tumbling to earth.`
`However, at the same time, I saw the goat‐head pursuers on the other side of the rose bushes increase in number.`
` I've gained some distance, more than enough now!`
`Holding onto the gun and the blanket wrapped around the ingot, I once again ran with Maria.`
`...Why am I running with a gun in my right hand and the gold in my left?`
`Why don't I free one hand and grasp Maria's hand...?!!`
`I can't let go of the gun that protects my body.`
`{n}I can't let go of the gold that protects my future.`
`And yet I would let go of the hand of my daughter, who {i:is} my very future...?!`
`Run.`
` Run. Run.`
`She got out of the rose garden and began to run down the staircase through the grove of trees.`
`But Rosa knew.`
` This path through the grove was only turning and twisting many times to make it seem long.`
` She tore straight through it!`
`She had always played here since she was a kid.`
`{n}So she knew!`
`To the beach. To the beach.`
` To the sea, to the sea, to the sea.`
`And after reaching the sea?`
`Nothing to do but swim, swim swim, if Maria can't swim, I'll carry her as I swim!!`
`There is nothing but death on this island!`
`"Kya!!!"`
`"Mamaaaa?!"`
`As she raced down the stairs, she took a bad step.`
`{n}A violent pain ran up her left ankle and her mind went completely blank.`
`Rosa fell down several stairs, and stared in shock at her ankle, which was bent at an odd angle.`
`...And the blanket with the ingot wasn't there.`
` She had let go of it the instant she fell, and it had disappeared somewhere into the darkness.`
`Only the gun was left.`
`The tremors in the earth were getting closer.`
`{n}It was only a matter of time before the goat‐heads flooded in.`
`She didn't want to imagine how many there would be, or how strange they would look.`
`The lightly dancing gold pursuers arrived.`
`The gold butterflies surrounded Rosa and Maria, sparkling and clamoring as though saying "the prize is here, the prize is here".`
`Rosa couldn't even try to get up.`
`{n}The violent pain from her broken ankle was so great that she couldn't ignore it, even in her last moments.`
`Aaaaaaaaaaaaah, what am I doing...`
`{n}I had the gold, it would have been worth several million yen.`
`I might have been able to start over with that!!`
` And yet I fell, lost it, and that's not all, my own life is in danger, even Maria's life is in danger?!`
`......What has my life been?!!!`
`I was born in an incomprehensible house!`
`{n}With an irritating older brother and sister since the day I was born!!`
`What did I do?!`
`No matter what I did or didn't do, I was always in trouble and bullied and made fun of!!`
` What has my life been?!?!`
`"Mama..., Mama, Mama...!!"`
`"........................"`
`The roar inside Rosa's heart shriveled away and disappeared.`
`...It disappeared when she listened to Maria's crying voice, as her daughter sobbed and clung onto her.`
`".........Maria.`
` Mama remembered that there's something she has to do.`
` Please go on ahead."`
`"No, no no no no!!`
` Want to be with Mama!!`
` Don't want Mama to die!!"`
`"Maria,`
` ...even though I'm such a bad mama,`
` ......you still say you want to be with me?"`
`"Yes...!`
` ......Want to be with Mama...`
` Want to be with Mama...!"`
`"...I made it look like I was putting you first,`
` ...but I was always putting you off.`
` I went to your sports day,`
` I went to parent's day,`
` ...but I was always thinking about how I appeared to the world, and you were never in my eyes."`
`"......Are you saying...that you want to be together, even with that kind of mama......?`
` Even though...`
`...I've been such a bad mama............!!"`
`"Hey, Mama.`
` ...Did you know?`
` There's only one Mama in the world.`
` There's no good Mama or bad Mama.`
` ...There's just one Mama.`
` So all I want is for Mama, the only Mama in the world, to be here.`
` And I want to become the only Maria for Mama."`
`".........The Maria who's in a good mood that you want to spoil, and the Maria who's a nuisance and you don't want to be around, aren't different people.`
` I'm also just one Maria.`
` ......So the scary Mama and the nice Mama are just like that.`
` ......To me,`
` ...there is just one...`
`...Mama......"`
`"...............I was...`
`......such...`
`.........an idiot...`
` .........I didn't need gold.`
` If only I had just pulled your hand...`
` ......I was such a...`
`...stupid mama...!!"`
`The shadows of the goats covered the sky even more than the trees of the forest.`
`{n}Their roars blotted out the world with fear.`
`Rosa, still hugging Maria, readied her gun with one hand.`
`"Maria, let's go together.`
` Always together.`
` ...So that Mama doesn't lose her way, always together...!"`
`"Yes...!!`
` Can see each other soon.`
` Always together...!!`
` ...Can see each other...in the Golden Land...!!"`
`"And then we'll play together!`
` Play with the "Wolves and Sheep Puzzle"!!`
` You still haven't solved more than one question, Mama, but I solved them all.`
` So I'll be the questioner!!"`
`She had bought that as a birthday present, ......and then hadn't played it with Maria after that night.`
`"Yes, let's play, together!!!`
` I promise!!!"`
`"Mamaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"`
`Those eyes, sparkling like red‐hot lava, looked just like a group of fireflies.`
`{n}They danced, closed in, and attacked.`
`"Oooooooooooooohh, come ooooooon!!`
` Whoever wants to eat these bullets Maria chambered for me, step forwaaaaaaard,`
` uwoooo{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}oooohhh!!!"``"................................."`
`Rosa woke up from her doze.`
`......It must have been a very deep sleep.`
`{n}Her mind was fuzzy and she wasn't thinking clearly.`
`Where was she...`
`{n}It felt like some mansion, but at least it didn't seem to be the Ushiromiya family mansion.`
`She was in a room that looked like a parlor.`
`......And there was some tea that had been prepared.`
`{n}It had almost certainly been prepared for her.`
`Sparkles like gold leaf were dancing around the room, and it looked very dreamlike.`
`...She eventually realized that they were gold butterflies, which made that stand out even more.`
`There was someone across from her.`
`......Female.`
` ......A lady.`
`.........The witch...`
`of the portrait.`
`She looked like she was having a one‐sided conversation.`
`She was probably talking to Rosa,`
` but Rosa's mind was clouded up by a deep fog, and she didn't have a clue what was being said...`
`"......It can be anything.`
` If there is anything you desire, I will give you it all.`
` You may think of it as a reward for your good luck, or as a proper trade for my demands."`
`"To you, it may not be that great a thing at all.`
` But that is how significant this transaction is to me."`
`............What is she...talking about.`
`...I don't know,`
` ...I don't know.`
`"Only, ......considering that I {i:am} a witch,`
` I think it would be wise to ask for something that only a witch can grant."`
`"Isn't this a rare chance.`
` You can actually receive a favor from me, {f:5:Beatrice} the Golden.`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"........................u........."`
`Finally, Rosa started to feel the blood flowing through her body.`
`{n}...Her movements were still sluggish, and she couldn't even voice the words she was thinking.`
`"I am commonly called the Golden Witch.`
` Bestowing a mountain of gold, like I gave to Kinzo, is no problem for me.`
` ......After all, every pleasure of the human world can be expressed in terms of cash.`
` Put another way, gold is human pleasure itself."`
`"Can you imagine?`
` A mountain of gold that you couldn't use up as long as you lived."`
`The witch blew on her pipe, and seven colors of smoke covered the area.`
`When she did, the inside of the parlor...had suddenly become filled with stacks of gold ingots.`
`It looked like a shining gold‐colored wall.`
`...If each ingot was worth tens of millions of yen,`
` how much would all of this be worth?`
`It seemed sinful to even think of that number.`
`"......However, the human world is difficult.`
` I know that there are some things that cannot be satisfied no matter how high into the sky you pile up gold.`
` I know that there are cracks that can't be filled."`
`"I won't make light of that, and in fact, I believe that is why this is a gift that only a witch such as I can give."`
`"......Why don't I fill those cracks in for you?`
` Yes, how about this.`
` It's something that only I can give.`
` You should be very happy."`
`"......You don't have to say it out loud.`
` I can understand it right away, the cracks in your heart are written on your face, *cackle*cackle*!"`
`Rosa felt a touch of discomfort at this witch,`
` who kept on talking even though she herself hadn't uttered a single word,`
` but since she still couldn't speak well, and found it difficult even to move a finger, she could do nothing about it,`
` and was unable to do anything but listen.`
`"How far back must I trace the deep wounds in your heart in order to heal them?"`
`"......This is...`
`...deep,`
` deep.`
` ......Sometimes, wounds close up while a fragment of something is still inside.`
` ...Even when those wounds appear to have healed, they will continue to throb for all eternity.`
` Sometimes you have to open the wound once to completely heal it."`
`As the witch spoke, she was staring deep into Rosa's eyes.`
`......What in the world...was she peering at?`
` Rosa felt uncomfortable, but she couldn't look away.`
`"............So this pain of yours was preordained from your very birth.`
` ...How heart‐breaking.`
` ...You don't have to say it.`
` I understand.`
` ......I understand......"`
`Gradually, Rosa, in turn, was drawn into the witch's eyes.`
`Gradually, the world grew dark, spinning round and round as she was sucked in...`
`Rosa, Rosa.`
` Why are you such an idiot?`
`Oh, that's Krauss nii‐san's voice.`
`{n}Krauss nii‐san is very grown‐up, so he's very smart.`
`{n}So he hated the stupid kid Rosa.`
`And he was a very scary person, and I was often hit, and my toys were taken from me and broken.`
`He would say it was a punishment because I did something bad, but I didn't really understand what that was, or why I was being punished.`
`I was always punished suddenly, and then after the fact, I was told in a contrived manner that it was a punishment for something or other,`
` but it was always something I didn't remember doing.`
`......So I really hated Krauss nii‐san.`
`Rosa, Rosa.`
` Why are you such an idiot?`
`Oh, that's Eva nee‐san's voice.`
`{n}Eva nee‐san is very grown‐up, so she's very smart.`
`{n}So she hated the stupid kid Rosa.`
`And she was a very sly person, and I was often lied to, tricked, and bullied a lot.`
`She would say it was because I was stupid, and that it was only natural for stupid people to be swindled by those smarter than them.`
`So I wanted to become a wise person like Eva nee‐san, and listened to what she said, but when I obeyed her, for some reason, someone always got really mad at me.`
`......So I really hated Eva nee‐san.`
`Rosa, Rosa.`
` Why are you such an idiot?`
`Oh, that's Rudolf nii‐san's voice.`
`{n}Rudolf nii‐san is very shrewd.`
`{n}So he hated the stupid kid Rosa.`
`When Krauss nii‐san was around, he was friendly with Krauss nii‐san.`
`{n}When Eva nee‐san was around, he was friendly with Eva nee‐san.`
`...And when Krauss nii‐san wasn't around, he was violent like Krauss nii‐san,`
` and when Eva nee‐san wasn't around, he played dirty like Eva nee‐san.`
`And even though he too was bullied most of the time,`
` when Krauss nii‐san and Eva nee‐san weren't around, he gave me two people's worth of bullying.`
`......So I really hated Rudolf nii‐san.`
`......Oh, but these are my memories from when I was a kid.`
`Quite a lot of unfair things happen when you're a kid.`
`{n}And you can't drag them out forever.`
`In time, you bury them away in the far reaches of memory, and forget them bit by bit; that is supposed to be what it means to grow up, and become an adult.`
`So becoming an adult is the same thing as separating yourself from all of those memories.`
`And so.`
` No matter how much time passed, Rosa couldn't become an adult.`
`......Even though she had been blessed with a daughter called Maria and was called a mother,`
` ...she didn't at all feel like she had become an adult.`
`The witch pitied that.`
`And she smiled, saying that she could heal that pain herself.`
`"......How to heal you.`
` It's possible, but not easy.`
` ...I could even rewind time, and give you a world where you have no elder siblings."`
`"But that way, your "memories of being hurt by your elder siblings" wouldn't remain,`
` and therefore, you would be unable to acknowledge it as a reward."`
`"It is the relieving of hunger that brings satisfaction.`
` If you erase hunger itself, no one will thank you.`
` Just like how there are no young people who give thanks for their daily gluttony.`
` ......Understand?"`
`I think she just told me something really difficult.`
`...In short, even if she makes it so that I never had elder siblings, the pain wouldn't be removed,`
` maybe that's what she's saying.`
`Strictly speaking, it's different.`
`{n}Healing isn't the same thing as removing pain.`
`{n}It's the pleasure earned for withstanding pain.`
`Therefore, there can be no healing without pain.`
`{n}To know the joy of healing, you have to know the pain.`
`"In that case, ......you will require joy that compensates for your pain.`
` You can feel proud of the past you have suffered.`
` Because you are qualified to know a kind of pleasure that those who have not known suffering cannot taste.`
` ...Those that have known this pleasure cannot help but give the same joy to others...`
` *cackle*cackle*..."`
`The witch snapped her fingers, and even though the room was still filled with a mountain of gold,`
` and was already like something from another world, a fabulous tablecloth appeared on top of the table,`
` and wonderful cooking was laid out, almost as though it was the opening of a banquet in a castle from some fairy tale.`
`For an instant, Rosa felt a pleasurable surprise at how fabulous it was,`
` ...but at the same time, she felt a bit of anticlimax.`
`Because she found herself thinking that being bullied by her siblings...`
`couldn't be wiped away by just one meal, no matter how delicious.`
`"Food contains many of the human pleasures.`
` You must eat like a pig as long as you live."`
`"If one meal isn't enough, then as many as you want.`
` Let us continue this gourmet banquet until the pain of your heart is healed.`
` ......Begin, furniture."`
`As the witch clapped twice,`
` there were suddenly goat‐head servants there, and they began to prepare the meal.`
`From the beautiful food dishes adorning the table, they efficiently took some food and began to pile it up on Rosa's plate.`
`It really did look delicious, but Rosa's body still felt as heavy as lead,`
` and there was no way she could eat.`
`Maybe they also understood that.`
`The goat‐head servants tied a napkin around Rosa's collar,`
` and gallantly brought a glass of before‐dinner alcohol to her mouth, and even tilted it for her.`
`She remembered an old servant who had once carried rice porridge to her mouth when she was laid up with a high fever.`
`She couldn't drink it well, and it dripped down from her mouth, but she felt the fragrant sweetness spread throughout her mouth.`
`"It's a sweet aperitif of noble rot German‐made wine.`
` A wine cocktail of white wine tinged with crimson golden drops."`
`"If I had to give it a name, I'd call it a Bloody Krauss.`
` The color comes solely from golden drops of your brother's blood, obtained by placing him in a compressor."`
`"Bghk......?! *cough*, *cough*......!!"`
`Rosa coughed violently.`
` And the bright red that stained her face made it look as though she had coughed up blood.`
`"You know a lot about black tea, so you should know what it means, right?`
` "Golden drop" refers to the last drop.`
` It is called the most precious drop in black tea."`
`".........So a golden drop of blood is the same.`
` The last and most precious drop of blood squeezed out of a human.`
` It's squeezed with that."`
`As the witch snapped her fingers, a bright red veil was pulled off something large which had not been there moments ago.`
`......The solemn and massive machine there was just like...`
`a coffin for a large‐sized person, with many large bulb‐like things stuck to it,`
` and it looked like a sinister torture device.`
`By its unnerving shape,`
` you could tell that it used manpower to tighten and compress something.`
`...And it seemed that there were still some squeezed dregs remaining inside,`
` because of the bright red remains that stained it.`
`"But you can't take more than one golden drop at once.`
` No matter what kind of human you take it from, you can't get more than one drop.`
` But I am a witch.`
` It is also easy to revive a person."`
`When the witch snapped her fingers, suddenly, the human compressor began to shake.`
` ...No, you could also hear a groan.`
`......It looked almost as though someone had been sleeping in that man‐sized coffin,`
` had woken up, and was now struggling to get out.`
`But that was wrong.`
`{n}What was inside had definitely {i:been squeezed dregs}.`
`Using her magic, the witch had once again revived the squeezed dregs to how they had been before they were squeezed.`
`Three goat‐head servants with muscular physiques approached the compressor, and forcefully started tightening the large bulbs.`
`...As they did, an unearthly moan came from the inside of the coffin.`
`{n}...Rosa thought she knew the owner of that voice.`
`"It is fitting for cooking to be done in the kitchen.`
` That is enough, stand back."`
`"......Do you understand now how precious a golden drop is?`
` To have it stained this crimson requires that {i:several dozen people's worth} be squeezed."`
`The witch had definitely said that only one golden drop could be taken from a single human.`
`And yet, she had dozens of people's worth of golden drops from a single human.`
`{n}......Only a witch could do this.`
`The Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice} could kill a single human "endlessly".`
`......In other words, before {f:5:Beatrice}, even death did not mean release.`
`"Want a second sip?`
` Have you forgotten the day this man hit you, and you swallowed the blood that ran into your mouth?"`
`"That's right, remember that taste.`
` Remember the taste of the tears that you spilled until you were dry.`
` I believe this aperitif will be sufficient to heal that regrettable memory.`
` *cackle*cackle*!!"`
`Once again, the goat‐head servants tilted the deep red glass against her mouth.`
`...Rosa attempted to close her lips in resistance,`
` but the deep red liquid was relentlessly poured into her mouth, which was hanging open with shock,`
` and the inside of her mouth was filled with a ghastly sweetness...`
`It was definitely a fragrant sweetness.`
`Her brother, who she had thought of so hatefully, and who had made her soak her pillow so many times,`
` had died dozens of times over to tinge this wine crimson, so it must have tasted sweet.`
`But Rosa tried to spit it out.`
`Because of that, the deep red wine that spilled out of Rosa's mouth made her look as if she was covered in blood.`
`......If this ghastly substance was only the aperitif,`
` Rosa couldn't help but feel uncomfortable about what would happen if this banquet continued.`
`"That is a forked‐tongued salad made from vegetables in season.`
` ...On your ninth birthday, you wished you could bite it off someday—so here is that salad you desired, made from Eva's tongue."`
`"........................!!!"`
`When Rosa heard the true nature of the pink‐colored meat piled up in the salad,`
` she had a sudden impulse to vomit her guts out.`
`...Furthermore, the goat servants stuck a fork in it, and carried it to Rosa's mouth.`
`"How does your sister's forked tongue taste?`
` It must be quite soft and enchanting, right?`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`How sweet, soft and enchanting it must have tasted in her mouth.`
`After all, Eva's lies were always sweet, and young Rosa had always listened to them.`
`...So you could say that the taste of the stimulating pepper seasoning that had been added expressed the details of those lies well.`
`"......mnnnnnnnnnnn!!`
` mnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!!"`
`Rosa spat out the tongue salad that kept being pushed into her mouth, covering it with saliva.`
`But the goat‐head servants carefully returned it to the plate and carried it to Rosa's mouth over and over again.`
`"It goes without saying, but I made this salad generously using five of Eva's tongues.`
` You can't steal more than one tongue out of one person.`
` But I can steal it over and over.`
` *cackle*cackle*!!"`
`".........nnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!!`
` nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!!"`
`As Rosa's tears dripped down, she resisted, half‐crazed.`
`{n}However, the only way she could resist was by refusing to swallow.`
`Even if she didn't swallow it,`
` the taste of the french dressing increasingly violated Rosa's mouth...`
`"Is it not to your satisfaction...?`
` There's still much more food.`
` Sea bass pie wrapped in the skin of Rudolf's face.`
` Soup with boiled brains, liver pate.`
` And look forward to dessert, *cackle*cackle*!!"`
`"It's not just your siblings, see?`
` I have lavishly arranged all of those who you have trusted and yet betrayed you.`
` Why don't we continue this banquet for all eternity, until your heart is satisfied.`
` For all eternity."`
`"......You're happy, riiiight, Ushiromiya Rosaaaa?`
` Don't pretend that you hate it I know that you're really happy alriiight?`
` If you want to laugh, then laugh,`
` if you won't feel better until you've heard a live performance of your annoying elder siblings' screams, then I'll let you hear them as often as you want."`
`"It's alright that you are so unwilling.`
` That's your personality, isn't it?`
` You're actually so happy that your skin is crawling all over.`
` And yet, on the outside, you're just pretending to act like you're in pain, aren't youuu?"`
`"It's alright, there is no need to worry about honor or your public image or anything here,`
` so laugh as much as you want and chew it to bits.`
` Isn't this the bessst banquet, Ushiromiya Rosaaaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aaaaa???"`
`".........st‐`
` .........please,`
` ......stop......`
`...*cough*, *hack*!!`
` uweghhh..."`
`"Oh, I'm sorry, I was keeping the dessert a secret to surprise you, but let me reveal it anyways.`
` If I reveal it, maybe that will be enough incentive for you to eat up the full course."`
`"The dessert is that beloved daughter that you had to keep pretending to love,`
` oven‐baked Maria and apples.`
` Doesn't that sound yummyyyy?"`
`"If you eat this, you will be released from everything.`
` Freedom, you see, freedom!`
` Finally Rosa will gain freedom as an individual person, aren't you happyyyy{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}yyyyyy?`
` Of course you are, drool is hanging from your mouth, just try looking in a mirroooo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}ooooor, hyaha{0}haaa{0}haa{0}haa{0}haha!!"`
`Suddenly, a muscular goat‐head cook was holding Maria under his arm.`
`And Maria gazed at Rosa with a face that was just slightly sad.`
`"............Mama...`
` ......Was I......a burden......?"`
`"...nnnnnnn!`
` You aren't a burden!!`
` nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!!"`
`As Rosa spat out the food that was continually being carried to her mouth,`
` as she was covered with mess and saliva and blood, she resisted filthily and screamed.`
`"......If you...`
`think I'm a burden, Mama,`
` ......I'm fine being eaten."`
`".........After all, I always do horrible things to you, Mama.`
` Even when you brought a man over, I couldn't stay quiet.`
` When you stayed over with a man, I got lonely and unruly and made a mess of the room."`
`"When I went to search by myself, I got lost, the police had to pick me up and I brought shame on you, Mama.`
` When you didn't come home for days, I cried and had to be cheered up by the neighbors, and brought shame on you again, Mama."`
`"Because I'm like this, I cause trouble for you, Mama.`
` I'm sorry for being born.`
` So I'll become delicious oven‐baked apples for you, Mama."`
`"And then, maybe I can make you happy I exist for the first time.`
` Maybe, if you eat me and you think I'm delicious."`
`"She will be, riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight?`
` Be choked up with tears of gratitude your daughter is saying this much for you seeeeeee?`
` Oven‐baked apples and your beloved daughter make for the best dessert!`
` You've managed to raise such delicious ingredients,`
` aren't you the best mother, Ushiromiya Rosaaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aaaaaa???"`
`".........Mama, thanks for everything.`
` Bye bye."`
`"Wait!!`
` Wait, Maria, that's wrong!!`
` Stop it already, stop it already,`
` noooo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}ooooo!!`
` I didn't want something like this!"`
`"Please stop, please let me go!!`
` No,`
` stop it already,`
` don't put it...in my mouth...`
` uuuuulg,`
` gweeeeeeeeeeeeehh!!"`
`"Have you found my hospitality to your satisfaction...?`
` Then I'll have you accept it.`
` That I am a witch.`
` Proclaim it.`
` Proclaim that "Ushiromiya Rosa accepts that {f:5:Beatrice} is a witch"!!"`
`"......I accept it!!`
` U‐Ushiromiya Rosa...`
`...accepts that B‐{f:5:Beatrice}...`
`...is a witch!!`
` So give Maria back!!`
` Release meeeeeee{-}e{-}e{-}eeeee!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*, hahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐ha!!`
` I finally made you accept it!!`
` That smart‐alecky Battler has already submitted, and now I've made even Rosa accept it, the fool who denied me after being invited to the Golden Land!!`
` Perfect!!`
` <It's perfect!!>"`
`"I've accomplished my perfect victory!!`
` *cackle*, haha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hakya‐HAH‐HAH‐HAH‐HAH‐HAH‐HA!!`
` Now, take Maria away, prepare a delicious oven roast for Rosa!!"`
`"Nooooooooooooooooooooooo, Mariaaaaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aaaaaa!!"`
`"Looks delicious.`
` Slice up your cow tits and make me a sandwich."`
`"Wha‐......th‐that voice!!`
` Ooof?!"`
`An arm grabbed the back of the witch's head and smashed her face into the table.`
`As it did, the witch broke to pieces, turned into a group of gold butterflies, and reformed into her body a short distance away.`
`"Ba‐.........Battler?!?!`
` Y‐......you cursed man,`
` ...I, I thought you became furniture, that you submitted down to your very soul!!"`
`"I thought I did too.`
` ...But while I was listening to your gross recipes, I started to get a little hungry."`
`"Now I feel like eating a whole roast witch!!"`
`"And Maria.`
` It's ten years too early for you to talk about having someone eat you.`
` But in ten years, you have to say that to me. Promise."`
`"......Uu.`
` Promise."`
`"Ba‐...Battler‐kun...!"`
`"Sorry to keep you waiting, Auntie Rosa.`
` I had forgotten.`
` This was a one‐on‐one fight between me and this woman.`
` I was never supposed to give in.`
` ......Thanks to your persistence, I've regained my will to fight!!"`
`......Th‐...this man, he was broken to the depths of his soul, and capitulated to me...`
`......I see, he doesn't know when to give up, just what I'd expect from Ushiromiya Kinzo's grandson...!`
` So the chick of a phoenix is a phoenix after all...!`
`"Fu...fuhahahahahahahahaha, how vigorous, I like it!`
` I wouldn't have it any other way!!"`
`"That is exactly what I expect from you, Ushiromiya Battler!!`
` Try to deny me, I'll completely and thoroughly smash you to bits!`
` I will break you over and over again, and I'll teach you, one who has licked my shoes, the taste of defeat over and over!!"`
`"No problem, I'll teach you that I, Ushiromiya Battler, am a man who'll stand back up even after crawling in the mud!!"`
`"I've never had the experience of being invincible in a fight.`
` I've lost many times."`
`"But I always crawl through the mud and stand up again.`
` And I always finish what I started!!`
` In a man's fight, you don't lose until you accept defeat, no matter how much you get beat up!!"`
`"Don't think I'm out just because you took a shot at me.`
` Entertain me, {f:5:Beatriceeeeeeeeeeeee}!!"`
`"I'll accept your challenge, Ushiromiya Battler!!`
` Furniture, begin preparations for the next game!!"`
`"And while we're waiting, I have much I want to hear from you!`
` There were many locked rooms in this game.`
` Using red, I've smashed to bits most of the methods by which you tried to talk yourself out.`
` What other evasive quibbles will you show me now?!!"`
`"The lock to the chapel, the lock to Jessica's room, the lock to the servant room, the lock to Natsuhi's room, the lock to the parlor!!`
` Use all those things you humans are so good at pulling out of the blue,`
` your delusions, rantings, daydreams, bluffs,`
` all slanted with ridiculous, incredible turns of events, and show how you can thoroughly deny meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!"`
`"Aaah, it's no good,`
` it's no goddamn good at aaaaaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aaaaaaallllll!!!"``"Well then.`
` ...Did you enjoy it?`
` Our game just now."`
`"......A game that one‐sided goes beyond captivating and becomes boring."`
`"*cackle*cackle*. My, my, a harsh critic as always.`
` ......And I was so certain that even Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}, who has no love for boredom,`
` would surely be satisfied by this compelling development... How remorseless."`
`"...Well, I'll accept that it was compelling.`
` ...However, it was horrible as a fair game.`
` You need the conditions to be a little more even, or—"`
`"......Am I about to be told there's no way to win?`
` By Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}?`
` ......*cackle*cackle*."`
`"..................I wonder what you mean by that, Beato."`
`"There's no need to play ignorant.`
` I already know.`
` ...That you {i:aren't a bystander}."`
`"................................."`
`"You thought you were hiding it?`
` How insolent, to travel all that way, and come into territory that isn't yours, just to bet against me.`
` You came here planning to watch my game from the sidelines, while having a large stake placed in my defeat.`
` I've guessed right, haven't I...?"`
`"...........................`
` And if so?"`
`"......*cackle*cackle*!`
` Truly interesting!"`
`"That I should be granted a chance to fight against Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}, the strongest of witches who defeated Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}, is truly a pleasure!!"`
`"......Yes.`
` It is pleasing me too.`
` After all, I came all this way just because I wanted to see you brimming with that confidence, only to fall apart and lose."`
`"What an honest person.`
` *cackle*cackle*!!"`
`"Incidentally, if the contest between me and the great Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}...`
`were not to have at least one observer, what a tremendous shame that would be."`
`".................................`
` ...You called her, didn't you.`
` That child."`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho!`
` I found you, I finally found you, {f:5:Bernkastel}!!"`
`"............How are you, Lambda?`
` Looks like you also have time to kill.`
` ...I wonder if it's fate that we who share no love for boredom should run into each other again...?"`
`"Such a dumb kid.`
` Why can't you realize that the only reason you won against me was because of a little luck and a not‐so‐great matchup?`
` That made you so snobby, and now you're even picking a fight with {f:5:Beatrice}? Shouldn't you learn your place?"`
`"*giggle*, {f:5:Beatrice} is strong, you know.`
` And she's more brutal than I am.`
` Just a teensy bit!"`
`"Oh and also, don't just shorten someone's name to Lambda!"`
`".........You're a fool too, Beato.`
` This kid won't make exceptions for your game, she'll turn everything into a preposterous farce."`
`"I didn't bring Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} here solely to watch from the sidelines."`
`"After I informed her that you were betting against me, she said that she would bet against you."`
`"..............................You're still holding a grudge, aren't you."`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho!!`
` 'Cause I'm the strongest witch in the universe.`
` But I lost to you so I'm not the strongest!"`
`"So I'm taking the side of anyone who's against youuuu!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` There you have it.`
` With the great Lady {f:5:Bernkastel} as our opponent, this may not even count as a handicap, but it will be suitable for entertainment."`
`"...............Do as you like.`
` ...Now that the cat's out of the bag, I'm going to get serious."`
`"That would be suitable.`
` "Leniency" has never featured in my dictionary.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}, let us enjoy our valuable new relationship."`
`"Yes, I'll be counting on you, Lady {f:5:Beatrice}!`
` This girl really put me through the wringer.`
` I'm not gonna be happy until the two of us have smushed her up and paid her back double!!"`
`"............I look forward to it, Lambda.`
` And Beato.`
` ...No matter who wins or who loses, this will be a very meaningful battle for us."`
`"That's right.`
` Of course, I'm not gonna lose easy, but this is more important than winning and losing."`
`"After all, we have no love for boredom."`
`The three witches giggled, cackled, and guffawed.`
`"......That's right.`
` I should thank you, Beato.`
` It looks like I can finally escape boredom.`
` Do your best to entertain me.`
` Together with {f:5:Lambdadelta}."`
`"I shall do just that.`
` *cackle*cackle*...!!"`
`"That's that, Beato, so let's start a strategy meeting right now!`
` I know all of this girl's weak points, and I'm gonna teach you all of them!"`
`"And yet, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}, you were defeated by her, I note... *cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"Urrrrrrrrgggh, I won't tell you, I won't tell you!`
` Tsuun!"`
`"*cackle*cackle* hahhahahahahahaha!`
` ...She never bores, that Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}."`
`"............She doesn't, does she?`
` Take care of her.`
` She might not look it, but she gets lonely."`
`"I see.`
` So she's one of those newfangled whatchamacallits.`
` *cackle*, as expected from Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}.`
` Quite cutting edge.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*."`
`"Go already.`
` That child's waiting for you to chase after her."`
`"......Then, if you'll excuse me."`
`"See you next game.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"`
`......I'm sorry.`
` A troublesome one came, but don't mind her.`
`More importantly,`
` .........things sure got ugly.`
`I thought I had experienced some particularly gruesome ends in my game with Lambda,`
` .........but this time, ......it's exceptionally horrible.`
`...It isn't as though I don't understand your desire to hug your knees and close your heart.`
`If you meet that end several more times,`
` your heart will be killed within a hundred years.`
`......Beato saw through me, so I'll confess.`
`You are now just like I was in the past, when I was imprisoned inside Lambda's world.`
`Shut inside a labyrinth of cruel fate, tormented at the whims of a witch.`
`...I am a witch who was born from there.`
`......So maybe I'm like an older sister to you.`
` So I decided that I'd lend you my power.`
`However,`
` ............even compared to my fate,`
` ......yours is...truly brutal.`
`Not only do I sympathize with you, I'm almost brought to tears by your tragic fate.`
`But please, don't lose heart.`
`Please don't submit to Beato, no matter what.`
`Certainly, that child's game is quite unfair.`
`I took a glimpse of the game board, and the tricks are so mean and cunning,`
` and the scenic tricks are filthy to a degree that probably far surpasses that of {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s game board.`
`And what's even more frightening is that when that child moves a piece, it's not like she always makes the best possible move.`
`This is where she is very different from Lambda.`
`Lambda always uses an overpowering number of pieces and makes the best possible move, in order to win.`
`But Beato sometimes intentionally eases up when she moves her pieces.`
`This is unfortunate for us, trying to seek out our opponent's strategy by looking at her moves,`
` because it creates a formidable amount of noise in our information.`
`This disorder could be troublesome.`
`......However, as in chess,`
` a player might be able to create some noise for their opponent with a useless move, but they would still miss out on a more valuable move.`
`In other words, it's not like your opportunities to take advantage of it are zero.`
`Although you may not be able to believe it, this game was also like that.`
`......Even though those developments looked so overpowering,`
` ...there actually were weak points.`
`It looks almost as if she wants us to take advantage of them.`
`......Although, I don't know if it's a trap or if she's testing us.`
`Anyway, don't surrender.`
`Don't stop thinking.`
`Don't deny any possibility.`
`As long as you continue to hold the will to fight, Beato will not win.`
`Defense is crucial during a witch's battle, you know?`
`Rather than trying to win, try not to lose.`
`...If you lose when you accept her, then you definitely must not accept her.`
`......Making you accept witches.`
`There is no longer any doubt that this is one of {f:5:Beatrice}'s victory conditions.`
`Now that I have announced that I am your ally, I too will make an effort to lend you as much of my power as I can.`
`Make an effort yourself as well.`
`If you're still hugging your knees, quickly stand back up.`
`......Umm, in times like this, what did I use to say again?`
`.........Umm, uh,`
` .........Fi‐`
`...fight,`
` yea~h.`
` Mii,`
` nipah~{p:0:☆}`
`..................It's so embarrassing, doing this.`
`......I've done this much for you, so hurry and stand back up.`
`"...Ah, there you are.`
` Did Bern shrink off somewhere?`
` *giggle*, could she be any more lame?"`
`Anywho.`
`The pieces Bern chooses are crummy as usual, huh.`
`It's the same with chess, right?`
`If all your pieces were pawns, you'd have zero chance to win, right?`
`If all your pieces were rooks and bishops, no way you'd lose.`
`......W‐well, last time, I felt just a little pity and said that she could start her pieces anywhere she wants,`
` and then that idiot Bern totally didn't pick up on my compassion and started with aaall of her pawns promoted on the eighth rank!!`
`What's up with that, that wasn't a loss or anything!!`
` Aaah, just remembering that makes me queasy.`
`So, see, I'm gonna be ruffled until I see Bern's stupid speechless face.`
`So it's like, seeing you in this state as Bern's piece, that makes me feel just awesome!`
`Plus, believe it or not, that girl really hates to lose,`
` so I bet she's definitely grinding her teeth in frustration right about now, crying like a baby,`
` she's so lame, *giggle*, hohhh‐hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho!`
`C'mon, laugh with me, oh‐hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho!`
`............Wait a sec.`
`Are you still hugging your knees?`
`You're already like this just because Beato got a little serious?`
`Could you be any more pathetic?`
`You're so pathetic, I'll help you just a little bit.`
`I, the great Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}, the Witch of Certainty and the strongest in the universe,`
` will bring your hopeless chances of winning just a teensy bit closer to certainty.`
` You better thank me.`
`You know, {f:5:Beatrice} may really be a cruel and powerful witch, but she's no match for me.`
`Why?`
` 'Cause she's soft.`
`That kid will make the board so she can win with just a few more moves, but she deliberately won't finish you off.`
`She'll do stuff like take worthless pieces, or put way too many pieces on the board to make things even more one‐sided.`
`The point is, she's got this bad habit of playing around when she thinks she's going to win.`
`Almost all the various attacks that are painful for you and Bern...`
`look like a total waste and overkill to me.`
`...Basically, that's her weakness, and it's also your chance.`
` See?`
` She isn't an opponent to be afraid of, right?`
`She sometimes mistakes the means for the end.`
`And she has too much bad fun.`
`As a result, she makes and even exposes her own weak points.`
`It's impossible for a strongest‐ever witch like me to understand why she acts so relaxed.`
`Lowering her own chances of winning.`
`.........But, well.`
`That's why the type of witch like Bern who reads her opponent and dodges their moves has a really bad matchup with her.`
` 'Cause reading her doesn't work.`
`...It's probably really easy for Bern to read and handle an obedient and honest type like me.`
` That makes me so mad!`
`...Well, still, a super‐firepower type like me can easily go head‐on against a light, wide‐range barrage type like {f:5:Beatrice},`
` so I guess it's kinda like rock‐paper‐scissors.`
`If I'm paper, Beato's rock.`
`I guess Bern would be scissors.`
`Weeelll, maybe none of that matters anyway.`
`Sure, my paper loses to Bern's scissors,`
` but if it was the way more awesome super‐paper, which is as thick as wood, it could even beat scissors, right?!`
`In other words, I, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta},`
` am super‐paper, and super‐thick!`
` Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho!`
`It looks like the color's come back to your face a little.`
`That Beato, she's having fun torturing some piece called Rosa.`
`At a glance, you'd think she has really nasty hobbies, right?`
` Wrong, though!`
`......She's just killing time, hoping you'll get up and come back.`
`It's a move to fire up your righteous indignation by doing something to make you hate her on purpose.`
`Ah man, I hate kids like that!`
`Well then, I'll go back.`
`Ah!`
` Don't you tell anyone that I helped you out just a teensy bit!`
`I mean, it's not like I helped you because I wanted to save you, okay?!`
`I, the strongest witch in the universe, had my seat as the strongest stolen when I lost to Bern!`
`So it's like, I have to take that seat back from Bern,`
` but if Bern loses to Beato here, then the position of the strongest will be moved to Beato this time, right?!`
`...Well, it'd be easier to steal it back from Beato, so who cares really, but that won't satisfy me, you know what I mean?!`
`I'm gonna be the one to defeat Bern!`
`And I'll take back my position as the strongest!`
`It's not like I'm really helping you, okay?!`
`I won't forgive you if you make Bern cry!`
