`{m:-5:—}—Witness to your final dream,`
`{e:080:{f:5:Publius Virgilia Maro}}}`
`The suspects were gathered in a room, and several Inquisitors were reporting on the results of their investigation.`
`Their uniforms closely resembled those of Eiserne Jungfrau, but they were slightly different.`
` Also different were the badges signifying their department.`
`Then came the sound of someone clapping their hands once.`
`{n}It was the lead female Inquisitor.`
`It was her signal that all reasoning had been completed.`
`"For your attention: it is now beyond doubt.`
` The preceding logic has proven the nonexistence of your alibi."`
`At the other end of her pointing finger was a quivering maid with frightened eyes.`
`Her name was—`
`no, that wasn't important.`
`All that mattered now was that she could have freely entered the locked‐room study where the victim was found,`
` and furthermore, that it had been proven that her claimed alibi for the time of the crime was contradictory.`
`Shaking, the maid tried to continue her illogical pleading, but all her arguments had already been destroyed.`
`"With this, we have found sufficient proof for the whodunit and the howdunit.`
` Know that your position as the culprit is now an unshakable fact."`
`"Y‐you must be joking...!`
` Wh‐wh‐why would I kill the Master I loved and respected so...?!`
` I, I have no motive, no reason...!"`
`"......Who did it and how.`
` Know that these are all that need to be established.`
` For your attention: I beg to inform you of the following.`
` Know that motives are unnecessary in mysteries."`
`The Inquisitor spoke coldly.`
`After finishing her witch's prayer, {f:5:Virgilia} stepped back from the casket, which lay on an altar bedecked with many beautiful roses.`
`In her place, Battler moved to the front of the casket, wearing his territory lord's cape......`
`Though the cape was supposed to represent dignity and majesty,`
` it somehow made Battler look smaller.`
`Battler held a book with a majestic binding in his hand.`
`It was......a game record that had just been written.`
`Or, perhaps it was a tale.`
` A game.`
` Or else a fragment.`
`Written in it......`
`was the "dream" that would be more enjoyable for her than any other......`
`Battler pressed it against his forehead and contemplated for some time.`
`"................................."`
`Then, he kissed it, .....and laid it gently in the casket.`
`It was placed upon her chest.`
`It made her look like a little girl clutching her favorite stuffed animal as she drifted off to sleep......`
`"......This story is my gift to you.`
` ......The only one there will ever be."`
`This tale will be shut up with you in your casket for all eternity.`
`So, no one will be able to read it except for you in your casket.`
`"Shut away in that cat box,`
` the only...`
`unchanging,`
` inviolable,`
` ......eternal tale."`
`"This way,`
` ......no one will be able to defile her tale.`
` ...No one can deny it,`
` and no one can argue against it.`
` ......Belonging to just me and her,`
` ......just the two of us,`
` this is the one and only...`
`certain truth."`
`Those bastards......`
`A man dashed through a town wrapped in twilight.`
`The daytime hustle and bustle of this charming old‐fashioned village, which combined tradition with stylistic beauty in the classic style of the last century, now seemed like a mere dream.`
`The orange setting sun was already hidden behind the clock tower, and the narrow alleyways were rapidly descending into darkness.`
`As the gas lights began to turn on, they only made the darkness of the twilight stand out all the more.`
`The man sprinted.`
` There was no time.`
` He had to hurry.`
`He'd had several experiments to do and things he had to check, and it had all taken longer than he'd expected.`
`"Yes, there's no mistake there.`
` The whodunit and howdunit are all you need in mysteries."`
`In the mystery genre, the motive, or the whydunit, is given the least precedence.`
`The only thing needed for a murder to exist is for a culprit to commit it.`
`No part of that requires a motive.`
` So, it's usually the most ignored element.`
`In fact, these days, there are even some who call it an unnecessary element in mystery stories.`
`"If you determine the culprit with nothing but the whydunit, that's no mystery.`
` That's propaganda.`
` However..."`
`That doesn't mean you can ignore the motive.`
`It doesn't make it okay to ignore the heart.`
`"......We both know how enjoyable her final rest will be.`
` So, I doubt there is anyone who could disturb it.`
` ......After all, who could possibly disturb the sleep of a child dreaming with a smile on their face?"`
`".............................."`
`"Come.`
` ......It is time for us to leave.`
` If we're too noisy, we'll wake her from her dream."`
`"......You're right.`
` What else should you do with a sleeping kid except put a blanket on them,`
` ......turn off the lights, and walk away quietly..."`
`After looking at the casket one last time, {f:5:Virgilia} turned around quietly.`
`Battler did the same, .........but he then stopped and turned to face the rose‐covered altar...`
`".............................."`
`Battler said his final words with his heart.`
`As long as those words didn't leave his mouth, no one would ever know what they were.`
`......However, those words of the heart caused Battler's expression to change several times.`
`At first, he frowned sadly, ......then, his face clouded with remorse, and then changed to a resigned, bittersweet smile.`
` ......It flashed through several varied expressions.`
`Then, ......the final expression that crossed his face, was, surprisingly,`
` ......a gentle smile.`
`".....................`
` ............"`
`Something rose to Battler's lips.`
` However, he bit it back down.`
`There could certainly be no words...`
`...to express the many feelings he kept in his chest.`
`So, ...saying anything aloud would probably be crude.`
`Battler understood this, and stopped himself from speaking once more with a resigned smile.`
`"..........................."`
`"......Thank you."`
`"Oh, I have done nothing deserving of your gratitude..."`
`"......I'll leave the rest to you."`
`After seeing {f:5:Virgilia} nod back at him, Battler turned away from the altar one more time...`
`......and left the chapel.`
`{f:5:Virgilia} also disappeared,`
` ......and all disturbances that might have interrupted her blissful sleep were gone...`
`The Inquisitors listened with calm—no, scornful gazes.`
`They listened to the frantic babbling of the maid accused of murdering her master.`
`However, nothing she said could bury the fault in her own alibi.`
`They were all mere emotional arguments.`
`{n}"I loved and respected my master so much. I had no motive for killing him."`
`No matter how much she spoke,`
` it only made her look more and more like the floundering true culprit struggling pathetically.`
`The whodunit and howdunit had been satisfied.`
`{n}As for the whydunit, the motive, the heart—who would care?`
`......No matter how much she spoke of her gratitude for her master, who had graciously fed her and given her a job when she had been left to starve on the streets after various misfortunes,`
` that didn't help her case in the slightest in the mystery genre.`
`Therefore, her motive didn't matter.`
`{n}All of that could just be {i:squeezed out} of the culprit afterwards.`
`An Inquisitor took out a roll of parchment and held it forth, cutting off the maid's sobs and protests.`
`"This is how you committed the crime.`
` Know that this indictment has been received by the Great Court and that your arrest has been approved.`
` Here is the warrant for your arrest.`
` The motive is unnecessary.`
` Know that such a thing is completely extraneous in the matter of pinpointing the culprit.`
` With that in mind, I beg to inform you of the following.`
` Know that we of the SSVD possess methods of forcing unrepentant criminals to reveal the truth."`
`"Be advised that with these interrogation tools blessed by the powers of justice, we Inquisitors will strap up your limbs, burn them, crush them, hang you by them,`
` and thereby wring the red truth out of you.`
` ......It isn't even necessary for you to confess!`
` Aides, arrest that maid!"`
`"It wasn't me! I didn't kill the master...!!`
` N‐no, nooo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}oo!!"`
`"Hold it right there.`
` You've got the wrong culprit."`
`A man kicked the door open, and the Inquisitors were all shocked at the sight of him.`
`"Wh‐......why are you here?`
` Know that you are no longer in charge of this case...!"`
`"Quiet.`
` You find one person without an alibi and just assume that she's the culprit?`
` Do you really think there's no need for a motive, for a heart, in crime?`
` Crimes are committed by people.`
` There are no crimes without a heart.`
` I'll never accept any theory that ignores the heart."`
`"Kn‐know that your focus on the whydunit is simply embarrassing...!`
` The whydunit is unnecessary!`
` Such a thing can be easily extracted through interrogation!`
` Even the Great Court has already acknowledged that this woman is the culprit...!!"`
`"The Great Court has heard your argument that the maid must be guilty because everyone besides her has an alibi,`
` and they've mistaken your overconfidence and conceit for wisdom.`
` If any one of the other suspects loses their alibi, your evidence so far proves nothing.`
` ......Just look at how pathetic some of these other alibis are.`
` Did the clock in the reception hall chime midnight at exactly the right time?`
` Did the dog by the back door bark at everyone?"`
`"So, you managed to prove the maid's alibi false.`
` Congratulations.`
` But does it end there?"`
`"It may've been possible for her to do it, but does she have any motive at all?`
` Are the alibis for the others absolutely perfect?`
` This maid wasn't the only one with a false alibi.`
` You have to keep on searching if you want to find the others."`
`"Was there some sort of grudge against the victim? Or some money‐related problem?`
` Don't abandon motive, don't abandon the heart.`
` Dry mysteries where the motive can just be figured out later aren't worth anyone's time."`
`"I‐if the maid isn't the culprit, then why did she fake an alibi?!`
` Even asking such a question is a waste of time!`
` Know that we just have to interrogate her, wring out the red truth, and have her sign in red blood to everything that happened at the time of the crime!"`
`"Yeah, you probably can do that.`
` You can just use that torture of yours to squeeze out everything frankly and objectively, as seen from the eyes of God.`
` But you know what?`
` ......I'll never accept mysteries and theories that lack heart."`
`"I, I have already taken over responsibility for this case!!`
` I even have a decree right here!`
` Come now, Aides, know that there is no reason to hesitate!`
` I order you to arrest this maid!!"`
`When she gave this order, her subordinates hesitated, looking back and forth between their superior and that man...`
`"I won't let you.`
` The real culprit's a different person.`
` It's possible to use motive to find them,`
` and the alibi trick's an old one.`
` You can't forget the heart."`
`"Th‐there's no need for that...!!`
` We just have to find the suspicious ones who could have committed the crime, interrogate them, and squeeze out the red truth!!`
` On the off‐chance that they are not the culprit,`
` then we just have to interrogate the next suspect...!!"`
`"You call that reasoning?"`
`"Stand back!!`
` We will arrest that woman!!`
` Know that this maid is the culprit!!"`
`"{p:1:It is forbidden for a servant to be the culprit}!!"`
`"Wh‐`
`what...`
`......did you say.........?!?!"`
`The words of power blasted away the Aides who were trying to arrest the maid.`
`"{p:1:......Van Dine's Twenty Rules, Rule #11}.`
` ......If you want to torture this maid, make sure you double check the alibis for the second wife and her lover first."`
`"Th‐those two already have a clear alibi for the time of the crime...!!"`
`"That, an alibi?`
` Dammit, a fool like you couldn't understand no matter how easy I make it for you.`
` If you want to call yourself a Chief Inquisitor, try and figure out at least that much for yourself.`
` Until then, I'll be taking that maid's arrest warrant."`
`"Th‐then what about you?!`
` Can you prove that this maid didn't commit the crime?!`
` Know that she was clearly away from the kitchen at the time of the crime!`
` What was she doing then, and where?!`
` She can't prove it, I can't prove it, and you can't prove it! No one can!`
` That's why we have no choice but to use these torture devices to interrogate her until the red truth is squeezed out!!"`
`"You can squeeze as much blood and truth from the true culprit as you damn well please.`
` But know this.`
` I won't let you interrogate or torture anyone who isn't that culprit."`
`"Th‐this is why everyone says you're too soft...!`
` All the suspicious must be interrogated!`
` That is how we Inquisitors conduct our witch trials!!"`
`"That's right, we are Inquisitors.`
` Felling evil witches is our job.`
` However, we must not risk hurting the innocent.`
` We must not suspect them...!`
` All humans have their own personal truths.`
` Those should only be exposed when they commit crimes.`
` We've been given the right to expose them.`
` But there's one thing we can't do."`
`"......Wh‐...what......?!"`
`"No one, not even God, has the right to expose the innocent truths of those who have not sinned!!"`
`The maid finally realized that he was trying to protect her.`
`"......I, I don't know who you are, but......`
` Th‐`
`......thank you...`
`...very much...!`
` I'm......really not......the culprit!"`
`"Yeah, I know.`
` ......Your boyfriend said he'd be willing to give up everything to prove your alibi.`
` You should thank him.`
` That kid said that honor and reputation are worth nothing compared to you."`
`"B‐......but, if he does that, he'll......"`
`"It won't come to that.`
` Exposing the secrets between lovers is a job for third‐rate magazines.`
` That's not mystery.`
` ......I'll never allow for heartless reasoning."`
`Then, for the first time, the man's sullen expression relaxed, and he patted the maid's head unreservedly.`
`"......I'm sure you two will be happy together.`
` Still, meeting together in secret while on the job is hardly praiseworthy.`
` Try to keep that to a minimum."`
`"Th‐......thank you so much......`
` Thank you so much......"`
`These words were heard only by the two of them.`
`The man had learned of her innocence, which could only be proven by exposing the secrets of a pair of young lovers, and he had rushed about in search of a solution, resentful of the arrogance of those trying to expose this by forcible means.`
`"The point of theory‐making is not to create a culprit, nor is it to trample the truth in the hearts of the innocent in the process.`
` Heart matters.`
` ......If you want to play the detective, don't forget the heart.`
` Forget that, and we're just intellectual rapists.`
` Don't forget it!!"`
`"Uu......ggh......ggggghhhhh......!!"`
`The Inquisitors couldn't argue back any longer after the man's forceful words.`
`The man's name was Will.`
` But everyone used to call him by a different title.`
`Chief Inquisitor in SSVD, the Eighth District Repentance Enforcement Agency of the Great Court of Heaven—`
`Wizard‐hunting Wright.`
`"That's the last thing I'm leaving behind for you all.`
` If you want to be the next "Wizard‐hunting Wright", remember it.`
` Never forget!!"``Quietly, quietly,`
` ......the rain fell down.`
`The rain of sadness dripped down the outer walls of the chapel, quietly washing away the dust of the world of the living.`
`The chapel doors were open.`
`For a wedding, only those with invitations would be allowed in.`
`However, for a funeral, the doors would be open for all those who remembered the deceased.`
`......So, this must be a funeral.`
`A figure holding an umbrella approached the chapel.`
`It was......Will.`
`"..........................."`
`A reception desk had been set up in the entrance to the chapel.`
`As the figure approached, Kanon, who had been sitting at this desk, stood up and welcomed him with a bow.`
`"......This is the reception desk.`
` We are collecting the names of all mourners.`
` If you would sign in here..."`
`"Sorry,`
` but I'm not here to mourn.`
` ......I'm here to meet with someone."`
`You came to a funeral to meet someone...?`
` A dubious expression rose to Kanon's face.`
`Will pulled an envelope from his pocket and showed him the sender's name.`
`".........My apologies.`
` Please, enter."`
`"Thanks.`
` ......Could I at least have one of those?"`
`"......Thank you very much.`
` ......I am sure she will be pleased."`
`Kanon handed him one of the golden roses being handed out to all the mourners.`
`Will took it,`
` ......silently bowed his head, and entered the chapel.`
`Inside the chapel, several people who appeared to be the family of the deceased were gathered together,`
` and they all seemed to be recalling memories of the departed.`
`"Oooooooohhh...`
` Beatriceeeee...`
` Why,`
` whyy{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}yy...`
` Ooo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}oohhhhh......"`
`"Father, you must compose yourself......`
` Why don't you rest in the waiting room for a bit..."`
`"........................"`
`"I killed her...`
` I did it......!"`
`"Absurd...!`
` How could that be, Rosa‐sama...?"`
`"Father was really bawling."`
`"......Yeah. "Beatriceeee"."`
`"I'm sure he didn't cry this much when Mother passed away."`
`"Hey.`
` Now's not the time to say things like that."`
`Some sobbed, unable to conceal their tears,`
` and some spoke softly of old memories.`
`......They were all remembering the departed in their own ways......it seemed.`
`When Will approached the altar, several people turned around.`
`{n}Of course, none of them knew who Will was.`
`Paying this no mind, Will walked in front of the casket on the altar, which seemed to be buried in golden roses.`
`......Inside the casket, there was no corpse.`
`Instead, as though it lay there in place of a body,`
` ......there was a single, thick book with an extravagant binding.`
`The space all around it was filled with countless golden roses.`
`There were words printed on the book's cover.`
`"To my beloved Beatrice.`
` October 5th, 1986."`
`"......Miss Beatrice.`
` If it was "Mrs", then forgive me.`
` ......I've never met you.`
` However, allow me to express my condolences."`
`He took the rose he had received from the reception area and placed it in the casket.`
`......He had absolutely no connection with the woman called Beatrice.`
`{n}However, since he had come to visit a funeral, he had to follow this minimum display of respect for the dead.`
`As part of this, Will prayed for the passage of the departed to the next world......`
`"Pardon me,`
` ......but who might you be?`
` I am Ushiromiya Krauss.`
` I am acting in the stead of the chief mourner.`
` This is my child, Lion."`
`"Pleased to meet you.`
` I'm Ushiromiya Lion."`
`"......Lion?`
` .........Just who are you?"`
`"It's written as "{p:0:理御}", but pronounced "Lee‐on".`
` ......Sounds a bit strange for a Japanese name, doesn't it?"`
`"..........................."`
`Will stared at Lion's face, wearing a confused expression.`
`He hadn't seemed to be particularly interested in Krauss, but apparently Lion had drawn some sort of reaction from him.`
`Rather than interest, it was more as though he felt like something was out of place.`
`"......Krauss‐sama.`
` Madam says that it is about time......"`
`"Ah, I see.`
` ......Ladies and gentlemen.`
` If we're too noisy in here, it may disturb the dead.`
` I've been told that the waiting room has been readied.`
` Shall we move over there?"`
`When Krauss called out to everyone, they began to move towards the chapel waiting room.`
`"My apologies.`
` Lion, could you entertain our guest for now?`
` I will guide the others to the waiting room."`
`"Yes, Father."`
`It looked like a natural conversation, with no awkwardness for either father or child.`
`"Father and child, is it?"`
`"Yes, but why do you ask...?"`
`"Ushiromiya Krauss's child is supposed to be Jessica."`
`"Jessica's my little sister.`
` Do you need me to call for her...?"`
`"..................`
` ...No, that won't be necessary."`
`Apparently, ......some sort of game was already being played right off the bat.`
`Scratching at his head with an irritated look on his face, Will glanced around.`
`"......Pardon me, but what sort of relation did you have with the deceased?"`
`"None at all.`
` ......It's a real pain."`
`"............Then why did you come to this funeral?"`
`Since Lion was a fairly mild person, Will's behavior was met with nothing more than a blank expression.`
`{n}......A normal person would probably have put on a dubious look long before this.`
`Will scratched his head again, and yelled angrily at someone other than Lion.`
`"I'm here.`
` Isn't it about time you showed your face?"`
`The members of the Ushiromiya family had already followed Krauss's instructions and moved to the waiting room.`
`By now, this cold, vast chapel decorated with gold roses...`
`was empty except for Will and Lion.`
`"......So, you've come.`
` ......Inquisitor, Wizard‐hunting Wright."`
`The girl's voice came suddenly from behind the pair.`
`When Lion turned around in surprise, a girl had appeared out of nowhere and drifted down on top of the altar.`
`She landed softly on the sacred funeral altar as though this was perfectly normal,`
` crushing the golden roses under her shoes...`
`Of course, Lion did not know this girl.`
`......Just why on Earth were all of these people unrelated to the funeral...`
`popping up one after another?`
`"I'm already retired.`
` If you have a job you need doing, go ask the new Wright."`
`"No.`
` You're the one I want to ask.`
` I'm giving this case to you.`
` ......Did you read the "tale" I sent you...?"`
`"......Skimmed it."`
`"I, I don't know who you are, but please get down from there.`
` That's a sacred altar."`
`Snapping out of a daze, Lion told the girl to get down off the altar, but the girl ignored this completely.`
`On top of that, Will kept on talking to the girl as though Lion wasn't even there.`
`"Lion, was it?`
` Who is this person?"`
`"You've already heard who."`
`Ushiromiya...Lion.`
`There's no case of a person with that name appearing in any of the previous games.`
`"Is this your piece?"`
`"No.`
` It's a true and proper piece of this game board.`
` One of the appearing characters."`
`"You're the Game Master.`
` That means it's your piece."`
`"*giggle*......`
` ......I've just enclosed Beato's cat box in a larger cat box.`
` Lion is one of the pieces who has a possibility of appearing inside it."`
`".........Ah, I see.`
` ......In other words, it's your piece."`
`"It's a piece I've placed...would be the correct way to say it."`
`"So you're saying this piece isn't your subordinate as Erika was."`
`"......Erika? Who's that?`
` ......*giggle*giggle*."`
`"....................."`
`"......Erika...san?`
` ????"`
`"Don't try to understand.`
` You'll just get a headache."`
`Lion didn't have a clue what they were talking about.`
`However, it seemed clear that, though neither of them were familiar, they both knew a lot about the Ushiromiya family.`
`"I, I don't know what you two are talking about...`
` At any rate, you there, Miss.`
` Please, get down off the altar.`
` I ask this as the successor to the Ushiromiya family headship."`
`Even Lion was finally forced to speak in a raised voice at this girl, who continued to chat while casually standing on the altar.`
`However, the girl ignored this completely.`
`{n}On the other hand, Will did show a reaction.`
`".........The successor to the headship is supposed to be Krauss."`
`"My father, Krauss, will be the acting head until I turn twenty.`
` When I turn twenty, I am to succeed the headship."`
`"First I've heard of this.`
` Can you prove it?"`
`It seemed that even Lion was starting to get ticked off by now.`
`{n}That calm expression seemed to twitch slightly.`
`"This is the successor's silver ring of the One‐winged Eagle.`
` Is that proof enough for you?"`
`".........A silver ring?`
` The gold ring of the head has appeared several times, but I've never heard anything about a silver ring for the successor.`
` ......I don't remember Krauss or Jessica ever wearing one of those."`
`"*giggle*......`
` I'm glad.`
` It seems you've read it pretty well for skimming."`
`"When a witch hands you a story, you never know when something absurd will pop up.`
` Especially when it's a Great Witch from the Senate."`
`"Wh‐`
`......who in the world...`
`...are you two?!`
` Sorry, but I don't have a clue what you're talking about.`
` If you've finished offering flowers for the departed, please make your exit.`
` It seems you two are not worthy of our family's hospitality."`
`Lion finally ran out of patience.`
`{n}These were the strictest words that this gentle kid could unleash.`
`However, Will and the girl seemed not to care at all...`
`"I didn't come here because I wanted to."`
`"We're wasting time, so let's move onwards.`
` ......Wright.`
` Try and beat this game.`
` As the Game Master, {f:5:Bernkastel}, I invite you to join this game."`
`"I refuse."`
`"Why?"`
`"I'm retired now.`
` ......Reasoning and mysteries aren't my business anymore."`
`"How do you intend to spend the rest of your life?`
` Is Wizard‐hunting Wright going to give up witch hunting?"`
`"......Oh, there's fox hunting and clam hunting.`
` I didn't come here to discuss the rest of my life with you."`
`"So, you came here to refuse?"`
`"Know that your powers of deduction are truly a sight to behold......"`
`"Then do as you will.`
` Go wherever you please.`
` ......That is, assuming that you can leave the place."`
`"........................Tch.`
` ......So?`
` What are the terms and payment?"`
`In truth, Will had already given up from the beginning.`
`He knew that he was incapable of refusing an invitation from the great Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}.`
`"‘Who killed {f:5:Beatrice}?’`
` That's my game.`
` In payment, I'll forgive you for your insolence and let you leave this chapel."`
`"I heard that witches who have no love for boredom are very fond of insolent speech."`
`"That's only for hags who've tired of life after a thousand years.`
` I'm still plenty young, so what I love to do to rude men like yourself...`
`is dream up horrible fates in which to trap you......"`
`"......Tch.`
` So?`
` Who's the enemy?"`
`"There is none.`
` There's no one to stand in your way.`
` We just want to sit back and watch you make your beautiful checkmate in this game......`
` I've even found you an ally.`
` That's what this Lion is for."`
`"......?"`
`After hearing that name spoken out of the blue, Lion frowned once more.`
`Apparently, they were moving things along without Lion's knowledge or understanding, which was truly irritating.`
`"Lion is a member of the Ushiromiya family.`
` Since no one in that family knows you, Lion should prove to be a useful ally."`
`"......I fail to understand what you are talking about, but I can't help you with anything unless I know the details."`
`"There, see?`
` ......With help like this, it'll be a piece of cake."`
`"Entertain me......and my master, Wizard‐hunting Wright.`
` ......Auau may be a polite theatergoer,`
` but I might throw popcorn at you if I get bored, got that...?"`
`".............................."`
`Will scratched at his head with a displeased look on his face.`
`He wasn't at all interested in getting involved,`
` ......but by now, he realized that he couldn't disobey {f:5:Bernkastel}'s orders.`
`Then, he approached the casket...`
`and pointed at its rose‐filled insides.`
`"You ask me to solve the case of {f:5:Beatrice}'s murder, but...`
` {p:1:Van Dine's Twenty Rules, Rule #7.`
` It is forbidden to have a crime without a corpse}."`
`"{p:2:That's a Devil's Proof.`
` Maybe it just isn't inside the casket?`
` Unless you can prove that no corpse exists, this is mystery}."`
`"{p:1:Rule #1. It is forbidden to have a crime without all clues presented}."`
`"{p:1:Don't worry.`
` Everything is gathered here}."`
`".............................."`
`There was no change to Will's unsatisfied expression,`
` ......but he seemed to have understood that everything was at least in order.`
`......From the moment he was summoned by an uninhibited, fickle, cruel Great Witch of the Senate,`
` a mere Inquisitor like him was bound to be treated as no more than an underling.`
` He had never possessed a way to refuse her...`
`".........So, you want me to find out who killed the owner of this empty casket.`
` ......Fine, I accept.`
` However, you'll let me do things my way."`
`"As you like."`
`"First off, .........I need to make you understand what's going on."`
`"......Yes, that would be a great relief."`
`Lion's face was a goulash of displeased expressions,`
` seeming nonplussed, angry, and confused all at the same time.`
`"Over here.`
` ......It'll be faster to see it for yourself."`
`"......Wonderful.`
` Please, lead the way."`
`Will signaled with his chin for Lion to follow him and spun around.`
`After snorting once in an unsatisfied manner,`
` Lion followed Will while looking deeply sceptical of the latter's ability to explain any of this in a way that would make sense.`
`......As she watched the pair leave the chapel,`
` ......{f:5:Bernkastel} sneered silently at them, with a cold smile on her face.`
`".........As the miko of the great Witch of Theatergoing, Drama, and Spectating,`
` {f:5:Featherine} Something {f:5:Auaurora}, and the Witch of Miracles,`
` I, {f:5:Bernkastel}, announce the start of this game."`
`"......The tale's title is "Requiem of the Golden Witch".`
` ......Spin a tale fitting for Beato's funeral.`
` ......*giggle*giggle*.`
` Well now, let's see just how you drag out the guts."`
`After watching the pair leave the chapel...`
`...{f:5:Bernkastel}'s form evaporated into the empty air, just as she had arrived.`
`All that remained was her unpleasant cackling......`
`Outside, it was still raining.`
`When Kanon saw the guest and the head's successor approaching the reception desk, he bowed deeply.`
`"......Good work.`
` You can take a break now, so would you mind leaving?`
` Umm,`
` ............"`
`"...............It's Kanon.`
` Yes, as you wish."`
`Kanon bowed deeply, then disappeared.`
`"You don't bother to remember the names of your servants?"`
`"......Our family has many young servants coming in and out, and they are usually replaced quite frequently.`
` Anyway.`
` What's going on, and how are you going to explain it to me?`
` Who are you, and what business do you have with this family?`
` Of course, I'm not really in need of a satisfying explanation.`
` I'd be just as happy for you to head on home."`
`"There is no going home.`
` Not for me,`
` ......not for anyone."`
`"Could you please give that a rest?`
` Stop speaking in confusing riddles like that all the time.`
` Even I have limits to my patience.`
` If you don't want me to see you off, should I call Genji or Gohda?"`
`"Stop talking.`
` .........Look at this."`
`"Yes, I can see what it is.`
` It's one of the memorial roses.`
` Are you going to show me some kind of magic trick?"`
`Will took one of the flower offerings,`
` then showed it to Lion, as if to demonstrate that there were no mechanisms or tricks.`
`Then, he slowly lifted it upwards.`
`"......Watch."`
`"Yes, I'm watching.`
` Is a dove going to fly out of it?`
` Or is it going to be flags and fireworks?`
` .........Huh?"`
`Will threw the rose.`
`Anyone would have expected it to fly in an arc...`
`and land in some puddle amid the wind and rain.`
`The betrayal of that expectation struck Lion dumb.`
`Initially, the rose Will had thrown had certainly flown in an arc.`
`It swished rapidly through the air.`
`However, as soon as it was about to pass from the shade of the eaves into the rain,`
` ......it stopped right in midair,`
` as though the air surrounding it had turned into syrup.`
`That wasn't all.`
`As it hung in midair, the rose's beautiful golden petals began to darken one after another,`
` ......and it became a black husk, like burnt charcoal.`
`And, even after this happened, it remained suspended there in the air......`
`"......What sort of trick is this?`
` .........Ah—"`
`"Don't move."`
`Lion had moved closer to try and touch the remains of the rose, which still hung in the air.`
`Will had roughly blocked the way with his arm.`
`It was as though he was telling Lion that leaving this place meant certain death.`
`"......This chapel has been cut off from the fragment.`
` We're currently locked within a maelstrom of compressed time."`
`"What...`
`...do you mean by that...?!"`
`".........Explaining's a pain, so I'll give you the short version.`
` Basically, unless we play along with that witch's game, no one can leave this place."`
`"Wh‐......what are you talking about...?!`
` The funeral is already over!`
` I'm sure some people will want to return to the mansion or the guesthouse.`
` We can't be locked up in here!"`
`"If you've got a problem, that witch is the one to hate.`
` Being stuck in a place like this isn't any more pleasant for me."`
`"That girl's your friend, right?!`
` Make her stop all this weirdness."`
`"She's probably sitting in a spectator's seat with a bucket of popcorn about now.`
` Even if I call her, she won't come."`
`"Wh‐what on Earth is going on?!!"`
`That short sentence described all of Lion's feelings at that moment.`
`However, Lion had seen the rose Will threw wither in an instant in the rainy darkness.`
`......Lion tried doing the same thing with another rose, but the effect was exactly the same.`
`No one would want to use their own body to test this fearsome something that could make roses crumble instantly......`
`"There's only one way for us to be released from here.`
` ......We have to play along with {f:5:Bernkastel}'s game."`
`"......You mean the one about who killed Beatrice?"`
`"That's what she's telling us to investigate.`
` If you could tell me about it, it'd make things go more quickly.`
` ......That fickle witch will be totally satisfied.`
` You'll be able to get rid of the two of us, and I get to go home in time for my date with Diana.`
` ......If I keep her waiting too long, she'll start tearing up the sofa again."`
`"Who killed Beatrice, you say......`
` That's hardly something to go barging into a funeral and start asking the family about."`
`"Questioning the family of the deceased is one of the basics of the mystery genre.`
` Just give up and accept it.`
` ......I do know that Beatrice is the mistress of Kinzo, the family head."`
`".....................`
` You really are a strange person.`
` ......How do you know so much about this family?`
` ......Are you sure you have no connections with us...?"`
`Will knew so much about the Ushiromiya family because {f:5:Bernkastel} had shown him all of the fragments so far.`
`Of course, he had no sort of connection with the Ushiromiya family himself.`
`{n}The very plane of his existence was on a different level.`
`"However, Beatrice died a long, long time ago.`
` According to Genji, she passed away before the mansion was completed,`
` but the reason for her death is unclear.`
` .........To be honest, this is the first I've heard that she was "killed".`
` ......Tell me about it."`
`".........My name is Ushiromiya Lion."`
`"Willard.`
` Call me Will."`
`For the first time, Will introduced himself.`
`The mutual introduction was finally completed, and Lion was finally able to talk with him on an even footing.`
`......However, Lion took a deep breath, and looked up at the sky, wearing a vague smile.`
`"Will‐san."`
`"Call me Will.`
` I'll call you Lion."`
`"......Will.`
` To be honest, ......even I don't know much about this person called Beatrice."`
`"...............I see.`
` I guess it's called a game for a reason."`
`If only Lion could've told him everything, revealing the truth without any effort from Will......`
`Apparently, things wouldn't be so easy after all.`
`"Everyone who enters the Ushiromiya family knows the name and image of Beatrice."`
`"That's because of the massive portrait hanging in the entrance hall, isn't it?`
` That portrait was first displayed in April of 1984."`
`"Really, ......how is it that you know so much?`
` ......Ah, well.`
` It's about time I stopped finding that odd.`
` I'm sure you'll just start speaking in riddles again."`
`Lion was the successor to the head and lived with the main family.`
`{n}Kinzo frequently chose to speak with his successor.`
`Because of this, Lion must have been used to chatting with people who were moody or hard to follow.`
`Deciding once and for all that getting hung up on trivialities would be nothing but a waste of time,`
` Lion was able to converse naturally with this unknown man called Will, as though the two of them had been friends for a long time......`
`"Everyone knows Beatrice.`
` And yet, no one knows her.`
` Kinzo's the only one who's ever met her."`
`"......The head seems to be particularly upset today.`
` I'll find a good time to introduce you to him, so I ask that you adopt an appropriately reserved and polite attitude, Will‐san."`
`"That makes things easy.`
` ......I thought you'd resist a bit more than that."`
`"I'm used to speaking with the family head.`
` I've learned to accept most unreasonable situations and just go with the flow."`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} had set up a "barrier" cutting the chapel off from the rest of the world.`
`To destroy that, they would have to find out "who killed {f:5:Beatrice}".`
`For Lion, who had been made to go along with Kinzo on many an occasion, understanding this much was all that was necessary......``The Ushiromiya family members were relaxing here and there around the waiting room.`
`A light buffet‐style meal had been set up, but it looked a bit stale and not particularly appetizing.`
`Even so, those voracious kids seemed to find it intensely appealing.`
`The cousins had set up camp around it, with Maria at the center.`
`{n}The adult siblings had also formed a group in a different corner.`
`Perhaps because of Kinzo's absence, everyone seemed to be a little more relaxed.`
`"......Lion.`
` Where did you go?`
` ......And who is that?"`
`"Mother,`
` I was entertaining this guest of ours.`
` Will, this is my mother, Natsuhi."`
`"No introductions needed.`
` I just need to hear what she has to say."`
`"Huh? Did you say something?"`
`"No, he said nothing.`
` This is Will‐san.`
` It seems he knew the deceased."`
`With a smile, Lion casually smoothed over Will's words.`
`"He wants to know more about Beatrice.`
` ......Do you know anything about her, Mother?"`
`"........................`
` ......Lion. The deceased is a woman to whom the head once owed a great debt.`
` Nothing more, nothing less.`
` This funeral is a ceremony for the head to repay the debts he made to her while she was alive.`
` That is what I have heard, and there is nothing more to it than that."`
`"......Thanks, Mother.`
` Will, that's all my mother knows."`
`Natsuhi was very resistant to the scandalous rumors that Kinzo, a man she greatly respected, had once had a concubine called Beatrice.`
`However, she also understood that the scandal was probably the truth.`
`Picking up that Natsuhi was in a bad mood and didn't want to talk about this anymore,`
` Lion brought an end to that conversation before Will could say something rude again.`
`"Will.`
` This chapel is the property of our family."`
`"So you're telling me to follow the family's rules?"`
`"You'll speak in a manner appropriate for a guest of the family.`
` And you'll conduct all of your conversations through me.`
` I must ask that you follow those two rules."`
`"I'll work on that."`
`"......The actions of this "{f:5:Bernkastel}" witch have caused us all a great deal of inconvenience.`
` Because of that, I am willing to help you.`
` However, both of us stand on an even footing, so make sure you don't forget it."`
`"And I thought you were just some pampered rich kid.`
` You've got guts."`
`"I must be prepared to shoulder the Ushiromiya family's future, after all."`
`".........Got it.`
` Let's solve this crime together, Watson."`
`"I'm glad to have your cooperation.`
` I wouldn't want to keep your dear cat Diana waiting.`
` Don't you need to feed her soon?"`
`"I gave her extra food today,`
` so she should be good for a while.`
` .........I'm surprised you realized Diana was a cat."`
`"I figured a woman who scratches the sofas when you keep her waiting would be a bit too eccentric."`
`"......Hm."`
`"So?`
` Who will you talk to first?"`
`"Anyone.`
` Everyone.`
` ......Those ones over there are Krauss's siblings, right?"`
`"From right to left, there's Aunt Eva,`
` Uncle Hideyoshi."`
`"Over there is Uncle Rudolf,`
` Aunt Kyrie."`
`"And over there is—"`
`"Ushiromiya Rosa.`
` ......When she was a girl, she once got lost in the forest and bumped into a woman calling herself Beatrice in a hidden mansion."`
`"......I know I shouldn't be surprised anymore,`
` but you really do know everything, don't you?"`
`"So, you know about that story too?"`
`"I managed to overhear her saying that today.`
` ......It looked as though it was bothering her, so I pretended not to hear."`
`"Real model student, you are.`
` ......Introduce me.`
` I want to ask about it."`
`"You're asking this of the model student who pretended not to hear because it just might be a painful topic?"`
`Even this outrageous arrogance is nothing compared to Kinzo.`
`After muttering this several times mentally, Lion shrugged and nodded at Will.`
`"Oh, it's our great successor.`
` And who is this......?"`
`"Oh, Aunt Eva.`
` This is Will‐san.`
` He came to offer flowers for the departed."`
`"But who cares about that.`
` Tell me everything you know about—`
`......nng—"`
`"He says he wants to know about the deceased's connection to the Ushiromiya family."`
`Lion spoke with a bright smile while pinching Will's butt.`
`Will silently protested, as though saying "even for a gag, that hurts",`
` but Lion just played dumb and smiled at Eva like a model student.`
`"Her connection to the Ushiromiya family?`
` ......Well, what is there to say...?"`
`"It's probably more accurate to say "her connection to Father"."`
`"We can be honest here.`
` She was Dad's mistress."`
`"If you call her that, Natsuhi nee‐san will yell at you again.`
` He's "indebted" to her, right?`
` *giggle*."`
`"Yes, of course.`
` Wahahahaha."`
`"......Well, there you have it."`
`"I have no interest in anyone but Rosa—`
`gghh—"`
`"I do believe......that you said you met with Beatrice, Aunt Rosa."`
`"........................"`
`This whole time, Rosa had been hanging her head.`
`{n}Lion's words made her shoulders quiver.`
`"She just suddenly came out with it today.`
` It's a bit hard to believe."`
`"It's the truth...!`
` I killed Beatrice!"`
`"Great, our work here is finished."`
`"Don't get ahead of yourself."`
`Rosa broke down crying and laid her head on the table.`
` Kyrie and Hideyoshi tried to console her......`
`"Rokkenjima is covered by a dense forest.`
` We only know about one tiny portion of it.`
` Just the mansion, the rose garden,`
` and the little path that leads to the harbor."`
`"Since ages ago, there've been stories about how Dad built a hidden mansion somewhere in the vast forest that no one knew about,`
` and that he had his mistress living there."`
`"Rosa‐san probably came upon that hidden mansion by chance......"`
`"But Aunt Rosa, why would you say you killed Beatrice...?"`
`"If I hadn't taken her out, she never would have died...!`
` She was so innocent, like a chick.`
` I took her out, so she just followed along obediently!`
` She stayed right behind me, trusting me completely...!`
` And because I made her take such a dangerous path...!!"`
`"Did you make her walk that way because you were hoping she'd slip and fall from the cliff?"`
`"I never meant to do that!`
` I just thought she'd like to see the ocean...!`
` No,`
` it just looked like the path would be hard to walk,`
` and I thought it would be easier going if we went down the cliff first...!!"`
`"That's not what killing someone means.`
` It was an accident."`
`"It's an accident she never would have had if I hadn't brought her with me, right?!`
` It's my fault!!`
` And then, I abandoned her when she was covered in blood and ran home!!"`
`"It isn't your fault.`
` Beatrice had never seen the ocean before.`
` ......You showed it to her for the first time ever.`
` She was probably so excited that she just happened to take a bad step."`
`"......H‐how can you...?"`
`"Beatrice is grateful to you for what you did. Of course she doesn't hate you for it."`
`"........................`
` Really?`
` ......Is that...`
`really true...?"`
`"She was the one who begged to see the world outside the fence, right?`
` Though it was only for a short while, you made that dream of hers come true.`
` If I were Beatrice, I would thank you for that short bit of time.`
` If she knew that you've been suffering all this time for it, she'd probably feel bad herself."`
`"......Beatrice is grateful for what you did.`
` You're the one who taught her that the sea is blue."`
`".........Is that...`
`...true.........?"`
`"I guarantee it."`
`Will made that statement openly and boldly.`
`No one could tell how Rosa took those words.`
`However, ......they had apparently been enough to remind her to take a handkerchief out of her pocket and wipe her eyes.`
`"......Thank you."`
`"Even now, Beatrice is whispering those words to you."`
`"...............Thank you......"`
`Rosa wiped her eyes with the handkerchief one more time and hung her head.`
`It no longer looked like a fit of sobbing, but more as though she was speaking with the Beatrice of that day within her heart...`
`one last time.`
`"......That was a lot of confidence you put behind a claim you can't back up."`
`"Back up?`
` Is that really necessary to comfort a woman?"`
`"........................`
` I misjudged you a little."`
`For how many years had this tormented Rosa?`
`Now, for the first time,`
` ......Rosa would probably be able to face that innocently smiling Beatrice, who had seen the ocean for the first time in her life.`
`She was the only one who could forgive Rosa.`
`Now, the two of them could finally speak together......`
`"......I don't know who you are, but thank you.`
` ......I wonder if she forgives me."`
`"You've beat yourself up about it for nearly twenty years.`
` That's far too long.`
` She's telling you to knock it off."`
`"......That's right, Aunt Rosa.`
` The more you grieve, the sadder Beatrice would be."`
`"............You too...`
` Thank you.`
` ......I don't know if I will be forgiven,`
` ......but I'll keep on speaking to my heart to see whether she'll forgive me or not.`
` ......Thanks, you two.`
` Sorry for showing you such an embarrassing side of me."`
`"And I'm sorry to say this right after saying something so pretty,`
` ......but I want you to talk to me.`
` Tell me what happened back then."`
`".........Will‐san!"`
`"Thanks, but it's alright.`
` ......I'll talk.`
` Hiding this and keeping quiet about it for so long might have been my greatest sin."`
`"Exactly when was it that you met Beatrice?"`
`Upon hearing this question, ......Rosa closed her eyes lightly, reaching back to a past she didn't want to remember...`
`"......It was about twenty years ago.`
` .........Twenty.........or, wait, it might have been nineteen or eighteen years ago.`
` .........I'm sorry.`
` I've tried to force myself to forget it for so long that I've nearly forgotten that part completely."`
`"It should have been 1967."`
`Ronove had guaranteed that with the red truth in the third game.`
`"Th‐that's right......`
` It was probably about 1967.`
` I can remember what happened as clearly as a picture......`
` I'll never forget......"`
`"If it's tough for you, don't feel like you have to tell us."`
`"Yes, clear as a picture, if you don't mind.`
` ............Ngah!`
` ......Dammit, that hurts, Lion."`
`"What does?"`
`"I took it very hard when I found out that my tutor had told Mother about something I'd shared in confidence.`
` I lost control of myself and ran deep into the forest."`
`This tale had also been told in a previous fragment.`
`Back when Rosa was just a kid, she had gone deep into the forest,`
` ......found a hidden mansion, and met with a mysterious woman who called herself Beatrice......`
`"......But that forest is so thick it's hard just to move around in it."`
`"I even surprised myself......`
` To think that I made it so far into such a dense forest.`
` ......I was tormented by twigs and sharp leaves over and over again."`
`"However, that wasn't enough to bother me on that day.`
` ......After all, I wanted to disappear into the forest and vanish forever.`
` ......If, by some chance, there really was a witch's mansion in the depths of the forest,`
` ......I hoped that she might take me to the land of happiness, or else turn me into a frog and make me a resident of the forest."`
`"So, you then reached the hidden mansion, Kuwadorian,`
` and met a woman who called herself Beatrice."`
`".........Yes.`
` I did."`
`"Was that Beatrice the same as the one in the portrait?"`
`"........................`
` ......Yes.`
` They were the same person."`
`"Beautiful blue eyes.`
` Golden hair.`
` A black dress.`
` It truly was the subject of that portrait.`
` ......When Father first had it hung,`
` ......I realized that the twenty years I had spent trying to forget must have seemed just as long for Father,`
` if not even longer, and I was wracked by even greater guilt..."`
`"Stop there.`
` ......Are we sure that this is the same Beatrice that Rosa‐san met?"`
`Immediately, Kyrie spoke the question that Will had been thinking of.`
`It would be too rash to assume that the Beatrice Kinzo met...`
`was the same person as the one Rosa met.`
`The time and generation were different for each.`
`"Beatrice is supposed to be that lady of leisure who lent Dad all that gold shortly after the war, right?"`
`"Usin' Beatrice's gold as a foundation, Father revived the Ushiromiya family and got super rich.`
` Then he bought Rokkenjima and moved over.`
` Rosa‐san's meetin' must have been at least ten years after that."`
`"A woman with free control over ten tons of gold could hardly be some little girl.`
` And ten more years passed after that before she met Rosa.`
` ...Rosa,`
` about how old did the Beatrice you met look?"`
`"......She looked older than I was at the time,`
` ......but even so, it looked as though she might just be on the cusp of adulthood.`
` Yes, exactly the sort of age of the Beatrice in the portrait."`
`"Did she look middle‐aged or past her prime?"`
`"If I had to call her an adult or a child, she was clearly closer to being a child.`
` There's no way she was middle‐aged."`
`"And isn't that strange?`
` We have the Beatrice you met, and the Beatrice who gave Father the gold,`
` but their ages don't match."`
`"In other words, they're different people."`
`"Different people...who look very similar and have the same name......"`
`"It might have been her daughter.`
` It makes sense for them to look alike if they were mother and child."`
`"His mistress's daughter......`
` It is possible.`
` Perhaps Father had an illegitimate child with the Beatrice who gave him the gold."`
`"So, the one Rosa bumped into was Beatrice II.`
` ......Makes those ages work out nicely."`
`"................................."`
`"I see......`
` In other words, there are two people called Beatrice."`
`Kinzo secretly raised his mistress's child in a hidden mansion.`
`That would make logical sense.`
` Everyone nodded, agreeing.`
`......However, Will's expression was slightly unsatisfied, and he scratched at his head...`
`"So, it would seem that this funeral...`
`exists for the two Beatrices he couldn't hold a ceremony for because he'd kept them secret......"`
`"Rosa.`
` I know you probably don't want to remember, but tell me about that accident.`
` After Beatrice fell, was she still breathing?"`
`"No.`
` ......Her eyes were open wide.`
` She fell upside down, head first, and knocked her head against a sharp crag on the rocky beach.`
` And she fell from such a height......`
` ............Her skull had split and caved inwards.`
` ......That beautiful golden hair was stained red with blood almost instantly......"`
`"Was it the sort of wound that showed at a glance that she was undoubtedly dead?"`
`"Yes.`
` I saw the insides of her cracked head!`
` It had caved in deep enough to fit your fist inside it...!`
` No one could be naive enough to see that and still hope she was alive!"`
`"......Will.`
` Do you really need to ask anything more?"`
`"That's enough for the time of the accident.`
` What did you do afterwards?"`
`"I dashed away at full speed.`
` ......I wasn't even thinking about calling for help."`
`".........I wanted to escape from that place as fast as I could.`
` Half‐crazed, sobbing, and out of breath, I kept on running about at random.`
` ......Eventually, I came across a familiar lion statue."`
`"Oh, the one in front of the chapel?"`
`"No, the one behind it.`
` ......Anyway, I made it back to the mansion.`
` I couldn't tell anyone, and I didn't want to.`
` I stayed quiet until nightfall.`
` It was so horrible of me.`
` If I had hurried and told someone, they might have brought her a first aid kit, and she might have been saved......"`
`"How is a first aid kit going to help with a crushed cranium?`
` ......You didn't kill her.`
` Don't worry about that anymore."`
`"..........................."`
`"Then, ......what did you do next?"`
`"......That night, I turned over in my bed so many times.`
` I couldn't sleep.`
` ......Late that night, I quietly...`
`......called Genji‐san on the phone and told him..."`
`"......What did he say?"`
`"He told me to let him handle everything, and to speak of this to no one.`
` ......I spent the next several days terrified that Father would call for me and scold me brutally."`
`"But......he didn't.`
` Genji‐san kept on doing his job quietly, just like normal.`
` ......Father stayed locked up in his study, not knowing any of it......"`
`"At the very least, none of us ever heard about it."`
`"......Genji‐san probably managed to clean everything up nicely."`
`"After all, I expect they couldn't let knowledge of that child go public......"`
`"Hmmmmm......`
` Even if she was an illegitimate child, she was his own flesh and blood.`
` It must have been tough for Father, not bein' able to hold a real funeral for her......"`
`".........I guess that's why we're having this funeral."`
`"And then?"`
`"That's all I know."`
`".....................`
` And that's all I know too."`
`"I'm not hiding anything else.`
` I've told you everything.`
` ......I swear it."`
`".............................."`
`Will scratched at his head, letting his gaze wander.`
`It had taken Rosa a lot of determination to make this confession, but it was nothing particularly special for Will.`
`It had been little more than a review of information he already knew......`
`"Thanks, Aunt Rosa.`
` .........Is that enough for you, Will?`
` Are you satisfied?"`
`"That's enough.`
` It was a nice review."`
`To Will, Rosa's memories gave only information that was already known.`
`This was the first time he'd heard all that about her running back to the mansion after Beatrice fell to her death,`
` but none of it was particularly surprising.`
`Apparently, Rosa really didn't know any more than this......`
`If he wanted to learn something beyond the fragments given to him by {f:5:Bernkastel}, he would need to find new testimony.`
`"Lion.`
` Tell Kinzo that I want to talk to him.`
` It looks like we won't get anywhere without asking the man himself."`
`"Where are you going?"`
`"......Off to cool my head and organize my thoughts.`
` Don't follow me."`
`"Well, pardon me for asking.`
` Please take your time."`
`After giving an elegant bow, Lion made a face, tongue sticking out.`
`Unless Will had eyes on the back of his head, he couldn't have seen this last bit......`
`Will returned to the chapel by himself.`
`{n}The cold air and the monotonous sound of the rain were comforting.`
`{a:c:`
`"......So, how's the game?"}`
`And he had come here for a little peace and quiet...`
`No sooner had he let out a sigh of relief than that voice rang out.`
`"That's one for you to answer."`
`It was as though she had been sitting there all along.`
` ......{f:5:Bernkastel} appeared on top of the altar once more.`
`Apparently, she found this particular altar extremely comfortable.`
`"......Battler annoyed me over and over with his incompetence.`
` You're very competent compared to him, so it's a lot easier to relax."`
`"Unlike Ushiromiya Battler's games, I have nothing standing in my way.`
` It's easy."`
`"That sort of game has already ended.`
` Tales can be enjoyed twice.`
` First you love them.`
` Then you tear out their guts.`
` ......*giggle*giggle*."`
`"Tch. You think I'm a butcher?"`
`"Well?`
` Do you think you know who killed {f:5:Beatrice}...?"`
`"Rosa's confession is something I already know from a previous fragment.`
` There was no brand new information.`
` ......We're still at square one."`
`"*giggle*giggle*......"`
`"Unless Ushiromiya Kinzo tells us what really happened, we won't get any further than this.`
` Don't tell me that sweet‐talking Kinzo into spilling the beans...`
`is all part and parcel of this game."`
`"If it were, I'd die of boredom.`
` ......Kinzo refuses to speak of the truth and is himself the king protected by his castle,`
` but it wouldn't be any fun to have that stand in the way of your game..."`
`"......I won't torture.`
` It's not my style."`
`"I know that.`
` As the Game Master, I will grant you power.`
` So that you can get the truth from Kinzo, of course."`
`Still wearing shoes, {f:5:Bernkastel} stepped into the casket, picked up one of the flowers that had been set as offerings,`
` ......and blew hard, as though scattering fluff from a dandelion.`
`When she did, a single petal broke off and drifted down towards Will,`
` no longer gold, but with the shine of a transparent crystal......`
`"The "detective's authority"?"`
`"Heh, what's {i:that} pathetic ability?`
` ......No.`
` This is your invitation to the auditorium."`
`"......The "theatergoing authority"?`
` .........Granting that is supposed to be forbidden without authorization from the Senate."`
`"I'm granting it. On my game board.`
` Who's going to stop me......?"`
`"............Hmph."`
`Though the crystal flower petal danced in the wind, it wouldn't fly away anywhere until Will accepted it.`
`Will remembered how useless it was to argue with witches, and he snatched it up.`
`When he did, the petal flashed brightly for an instant, melted into Will's palm, and disappeared...`
`"Entertain me if you can.`
` And try and enjoy yourself.`
` ......You must also be interested in seeing what the guts of {f:5:Beatrice}'s game board look like, right?"`
`"Not really."`
`After Will's rude answer,`
` {f:5:Bernkastel} vanished into thin air, leaving behind an obnoxious laugh......`
`".........Tch."`
`After clicking his tongue, Will turned around, visibly annoyed.`
`......When he did, it felt as though his gaze crossed that of a shadowy figure standing by the door in front of him that led outside.`
`"Who's there?"`
`"Ah, ......p‐pardon me...`
` I heard a voice, s‐...so I wondered who it was......"`
`"Ah, Shannon.`
` So you're running the reception desk this time...?"`
`"Yes.`
` I've been taking it in turns with Kanon‐kun to run the reception desk..."`
`"And where is Kanon?"`
`"A short while ago, he was ordered by......umm,`
` ......L‐Lion‐sama to take a break, so he's resting now."`
`".........So, you don't know Lion either?"`
`"Huh?`
` ......Of...course I..............."`
`"Ushiromiya Lion is the successor to the head and the only one permitted the silver ring.`
` ......Why are you stumbling over that name when you've worked here for ten years?"`
`"Th‐...that's............"`
`"Don't worry.`
` I don't recognize Lion either.`
` ......Krauss is supposed to be the successor to the head.`
` Jessica is supposed to be his only child.`
` There hasn't been a single fragment with anyone named Lion in the Ushiromiya family."`
`Upon hearing that Will didn't recognize Lion either, Shannon looked back up at him in surprise.`
`Apparently, she was a bit relieved to find that she wasn't going crazy by herself.`
`......However, her expression quickly grew uncertain once more.`
`"Wh‐where......is this place...?`
` I think it's the Ushiromiya family chapel.`
` ......However, something feels different about it."`
`"Also, I never knew that someone named L‐......Lion‐sama existed.`
` ......And yet, Madam, Krauss‐sama, ......the Master, Milady, and all the relatives all talk as though it's perfectly natural......`
` I just......don't understand what's happening......"`
`"......Lion is a piece placed by {f:5:Bernkastel}.`
` She also said that she'd switched to a larger cat box to place that piece.`
` ......On top of that, it seems this world isn't a proper world, but one made out of several different fragments sewn together."`
`It's as though......this is a special stage set up specifically for this game.`
`......I'm sure she's nodding at my thoughts right now, laughing and chomping down popcorn.`
`"How long have you worked here in this world?"`
`"T‐......ten years."`
`I see.`
` So it really is a special stage.`
`After all, right when I entered the chapel, I spotted Kinzo.`
`If Shannon has worked here for ten years, then this is 1986, the stage of Beato's game.`
`In that case, Kinzo shouldn't exist.`
`{n}However, he definitely was here a few minutes ago.`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} promised that all of the information needed for reasoning was gathered here.`
`She must have crammed all manner of stuff in here to make that true...`
`I see, so it really is a special stage.`
`"You have served the Ushiromiya family for many years.`
` So, just how much do you know about Beatrice?"`
`"......I know the Master loved her deeply, but other than that..."`
`"Is that all?"`
`"A‐and, umm,`
` .........they say that she's the master of Rokkenjima's night...`
`...umm..."`
`"That's right.`
` The name of the ghost rumored to wander the mansion night after night is also {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`That brings the number of Beatrices to three.`
`The first is the "Beatrice" from more than thirty years ago, who is said to have given Kinzo the gold.`
`The second is the "Beatrice" from twenty years ago, who met Rosa.`
`The third is the "{f:5:Beatrice}" of the ghost stories, who is rumored to be the master of the night on Rokkenjima.`
`"......Furudo Erika's reasoning was probably correct.`
` It started out as the legend of the evil spirits on Rokkenjima.`
` Later on, elements such as Kinzo's occult hobbies, the name and portrait of the mysterious woman "Beatrice",`
` and the epitaph got mixed in, and it all fused into the legend of the Golden Witch."`
`"......And so the darkness of the night gained the personality of a witch.`
` That's the third {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` This is the veil the serial killer hides behind."`
`"......Uh, umm..............."`
`Apparently, she didn't understand a word of Will's sudden monologue.`
`Shannon tried to follow along, but she seemed to be having difficulty.`
`"Don't waste your time trying to understand.`
` You'll just get a headache."`
`"M‐my apologies......"`
`"Kanon doesn't know Lion either, right?"`
`"............Yes.`
` Kanon‐kun was the same as me."`
`Shannon...and Kanon, huh.........`
`".....................`
` ......Call Kanon over here. I want to talk to the pair of you about something."`
`When Will said these words, Shannon's face went blank and her eyes went wide.`
`"My apologies.`
` We aren't allowed to leave the reception desk unmanned, so I can't leave to go get him."`
`"Then find a replacement and have them take over the reception desk until you get back.`
` You, me, and Kanon.`
` ......We, the three people who don't know Lion, need to talk."`
`"......................................."`
`"................................."`
`"......We've been told that one person is enough to run the reception desk."`
`"But no one told you there was anything wrong with two people manning it, right?"`
`"We are low on helpers today, so we were told that the reception desk does not require two people manning it."`
`"Who gave you that order?`
` Kinzo? Krauss?`
` Or was it Lion?`
` I will ask about it."`
`"It was...the one who orders me.`
` I cannot disobey or{f:5:ders}."`
`"Who is this person?`
` I'll negotiate with them."`
`"You cannot {f:5:negotiate}.`
` It i{f:5:s} the o{f:5:ne} who or{f:5:ders us}."`
`"Call Kanon over here.`
` ......I hate theatergoing just as much as I hate torture."`
`Slowly, ......Will pulled his right hand out of his pocket.`
`When he slowly opened his fist,`
` .........a small, bright glow emanated from it.`
`The flower petal {f:5:Bernkastel} had given him had become a glowing birthmark, which sparkled......`
`He held that hand out towards Shannon......and slowly approached her.`
`"Call Kanon.`
` I want to check something with you two."`
`"{f:5:I ca  nnot call him. Do you sti  ll wish for me to do so}......?"`
`"If you don't call him, I'm going to "watch your play"."`
`"{f:5:If you insi  st, ......I can c al   l him especi ally}..."`
`".............................."`
`"                                                            ."`
`There was some kind of incomprehensible tension between the two.`
`Will stood there, his left hand still in his pocket and his right palm glowing and stretched out towards her.`
`Shannon just stood there, her hands still folded politely in front of her,`
` ......her posture beautiful.`
`And yet, ......it felt oddly as though raindrops were sparking and crackling in midair......`
`"{o:0:{e:85:{f:0:{g:0:{m:6:I WI}{m:15:LLNO}{m:31:WCA}{m:0:LL KAN}{m:21:ON‐K}{m:22:UN.}}}}}"`
`"{o:0:{e:85:{f:0:{g:0:{m:13:DO YO}{m:26:U WI}{m:4:SH T}{m:41:O PRO}{m:71:CEED?}}}}}"`
`"................................."`
`Will's expression had remained unchanged the whole time.`
`{n}Shannon's face was still kind and gentle.`
`And yet, the tension was as icy as a frozen lake...`
`......Beginners in chess will sometimes move their king into check without noticing.`
`One might mercilessly capture the king in such a situation, ......but high‐level players are supposed to calmly warn beginners about their mistake.`
`"If you take one more step,`
` ......you'll get captured."`
`This was......similar to that.........`
`"................................."`
` ......I see.`
` So, after all......`
`"I get it.`
` That's enough.`
` .........You guys can take it in turns to run the reception desk."`
`Slowly, ......Will lowered his hand.`
`"Thank you for understanding."`
`The glow slowly vanished from Will's palm.`
`That completely incomprehensible tension melted away...`
`...like a sugar cube in water.`
`However, nothing had changed since the beginning.`
`Will's expression and Shannon's expression......were the same as they always had been.`
`"Oh, are you leaving?"`
`Footsteps approached them.`
` It was Lion.`
`"I'm just standing here, talking.`
` I wanted to ask her something."`
`"......What could that be?`
` Did you find what you were looking for?"`
`".....................`
` Yeah."`
`"I'm honored to have been of service."`
`"........................"`
`"That's a shame.`
` If you were looking for an umbrella, I could have gotten you one right away."`
`"Did you convince Kinzo?"`
`"......I told him that a rare guest wanted to greet him.`
` He says he'll meet with you."`
`"Did you tell him that I wanted to ask about Beatrice?"`
`"Isn't that your job?"`
`With a slightly mischievous look, Lion turned away.`
`Will scratched his head and shrugged, looking annoyed.`
`".........Ah, well.`
` Guess I'll get a chance to try this out."`
`Will opened his right hand and showed it to Lion.`
`It was just a hand, without anything remotely remarkable about it.`
`Lion's head tilted to the side in bafflement at this strange gesture.`
`"Good work.`
` ......Umm,`
` ......your name was......"`
`"It's Shannon."`
`"That's right, Shannon.`
` Please continue manning the reception desk.`
` Make sure you keep warm."`
`"Thank you very much, Lion‐sama."`
`Shannon bowed deeply in response to Lion's kind words.`
`There was not even a trace of tension in her manner...`
`"Let's go, Will.`
` You won't want to miss your chance.`
` ......The head's mood changes quicker than the autumn sky."`
`"Good luck."`
`".........Let's go."``"I've brought Willard‐san."`
`"........................"`
`Kinzo and Genji could be seen in the VIP room.`
`Kinzo was sitting back in a chair, his eyes closed as though in a troubled sleep.`
`"......My lord.`
` The guest has come to see you."`
`"..............................nn."`
`Kinzo slowly opened his eyes.`
`{n}......Those eyes were red from crying.`
`They regained their focus and slowly fell on Will.`
`"......I am...Ushiromiya Kinzo."`
`"......Will."`
`"I'm Willard.`
` Allow me to express my condolences."`
`"......So, you've come to visit Beatrice's funeral.`
` ......Just who are you?"`
`"I'm no one. I have no connections with anyone.`
` Don't think too deeply about it.`
` You'll just get a headache.`
` .........Ow."`
`"I ask that you choose your words a little more carefully."`
`"......Hmph, what a strange guest.`
` So?`
` What business do you have with me?"`
`"I want to ask about Beatrice."`
`"What..................?"`
`Kinzo's gaze grew sharp.`
`Lion felt a bit lightheaded and wondered why this guy had to be so direct.`
`"Why do you ask?`
` I thought you were no one.`
` Why do you want to know about Beatrice?`
` What purpose could it serve?"`
`"Because I am no one,`
` I can listen to your tale without bias and record it.`
` You will probably leave this world before too long.`
` If you die without telling anything about Beatrice,`
` your children will adorn her with their own fanciful tales and write them into history."`
`"Pft, hahahahahahahahahaha!`
` You entertain me, boy.`
` You think yourself a testament taker?!"`
`"But that is wholly unnecessary.`
` Beatrice is mine alone.`
` No matter what anyone says,`
` no one can defile our story. What they say is of no consequence!`
` No matter how Krauss and the others misconstrue it, it matters nothing to me!"`
`"......Willard‐sama.`
` The Master does not like wills.`
` He is not one to abandon anything while he still lives."`
`"......Probably true.`
` I thought it sounded a bit unlike him."`
`"The spirit to struggle onward to our dying breaths is what makes us human!`
` The idea that I would give up before my time and leave behind a will is laughably absurd!"`
`"Yes, that does sound a bit more like you.`
` ......It's not your style to ask someone to write about the past just because you feel you might die soon."`
`"......We know how deeply you loved Beatrice‐sama.`
` You are the model most worthy of respect that any of us know, and an example for us to follow in every aspect of our lives."`
`"Please, for the sake of us wandering souls,`
` may we learn of how you loved her to the last, how your love for her guided you through life,`
` ......and the strength of your love for her, so that your story might guide us through our own lives...?"`
`"You're pretty good at this."`
`"It's your fault for being so tactless."`
`"Boy.`
` What do you know of Beatrice?`
` A truly ignorant person would not hold any interest at all.`
` The mere fact that you know her name shows that you are neither ignorant nor unconnected."`
`"Good point.`
` ......The Beatrice I know of...`
`is the woman you loved, the one you met before the mansion on Rokkenjima was even built.`
` However, she probably departed from this world, leaving behind a daughter.`
` That is the girl who was raised in Kuwadorian."`
`".........Oho."`
`"Willard‐sama.`
` There is no building known as Kuwadorian on Rokkenjima."`
`"......That name, Kuwadorian...`
` ...You mentioned it when we were talking with Aunt Rosa too.`
` ......What in the world does it mean?"`
`"You should have an idea by now.`
` It's the name of the hidden mansion deep in the forest where his mistress's daughter lived."`
`"Interesting.`
` ......So, you actually know the name of Kuwadorian.`
` ......Continue. You have sparked my interest."`
`Kinzo shrugged and grinned......`
`"The one living in Kuwadorian was probably Beatrice's daughter.`
` However, it seems that you didn't think of her that way."`
`"Oho.`
` ......Then how did I think of her?"`
`"When Ushiromiya Rosa went to Kuwadorian, Beatrice told her a little about herself.`
` ......In that conversation, she referred to you as Kinzo.`
` It was the same when she spoke to you directly."`
`"Though she said that she thought of you as a father, she didn't call you Father.`
` ......She either didn't call you that, or she wasn't allowed to call you that.`
` That can only mean one thing."`
`"And what might that be......?"`
`"Reincarnation.`
` You didn't think of your daughter as a child Beatrice left behind.`
` You believed that the dead Beatrice had revived into a new body.`
` ......Genji.`
` Once in the past, you spoke in front of Natsuhi and several other family members,`
` stating that there had never been a child between Kinzo and Beatrice."`
`".........I have no memory of saying this."`
`Of course, "this game's" Genji probably wouldn't remember that.`
`However, near the end of the first game, when the survivors all gathered in Kinzo's study...`
`...Genji was asked whether Kinzo and Beatrice ever had a child together,`
` and he denied it, saying "I have not heard of anything like that".`
`"‘I have not heard that’... In a way, it was a perfect sort of answer for one of Kinzo's confidants.`
` ......After all, in Kinzo's eyes, she wasn't a daughter,`
` but {i:Beatrice} reborn."`
`"Will...!`
` I don't know what you're talking about, but I will not let you slander the family head!"`
`"This isn't slander.`
` It's reasoning.`
` ......However, I understand the heart.`
` Beatrice was the woman you loved most.`
` She remained that way even after death, for all eternity, and without fading in the slightest."`
`"However, given the child's blue eyes, beautiful blonde hair, and facial features which resembled Beatrice from a young age,`
` if you had gradually begun to think that she might actually be Beatrice reborn,`
` that wouldn't be surprising."`
`"...............My lord.`
` Shall I...?"`
`Shall I throw this insolent man out?`
` Genji asked Kinzo.`
`For a while, Kinzo hung his head in silence, as though remembering something from his own past.`
`"Your daughter grew to be beautiful and nearly identical to her mother.`
` You must have been ecstatic.`
` However, it's doubtful that you were fully satisfied by this.`
` ......After all, though she was Beatrice reborn to you,`
` she didn't feel that way herself."`
`"......How can you know that?"`
`"She couldn't shake the feeling that there was something out of place about her being called Beatrice.`
` ......People never feel anything out of place about the name they were given at the time of their birth.`
` However, she did have that feeling.`
` That must mean that she was aware that the name "Beatrice" was not hers."`
`In Kuwadorian, she asked both Kinzo and Rosa about who she was.`
`— Who am I?`
` ......Everyone calls me {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` ...And that does certainly seem to be the name of a great witch, as you say.`
`— ......But that is not me.`
` I cannot use any magic.`
` ......I simply have the soul of that witch sealed inside my body.`
`"........................Her memory...`
`would have returned.`
` ......She was without a doubt Beatrice reborn.`
` ......Her memory was coming back bit by bit.`
` My magical rituals were helping her regain her memories one little bit at a time......"`
`"G‐......Grandfather......"`
`"There's no need to be surprised.`
` If you line up the information in all the games so far, this is the answer it leads you to.`
` ......The {f:5:Beatrice} on the higher plane talked about this in metaphor, saying that Kinzo refused to let the witch's soul escape even after death, and instead caught it and locked it up in a body of flesh.`
` She also said that her power and memory had been sealed.`
` If you match that interpretation of hers to this theory, it all makes sense."`
`"............Willard‐sama.`
` Thanks to a powerful magical ritual, the Master gained a reborn child of the late Beatrice‐sama.`
` That cannot be denied."`
`"I won't contradict the stork.`
` And I don't intend to doubt the depths of Kinzo's love for this woman called Beatrice.`
` .........It's no one's business how a person chooses to show their affection towards their only living reminder of the departed.`
` If she grew to look more and more like Beatrice, and Kinzo's love gave rise to a new, special emotion,`
` I find that a very human reaction."`
`".........You think...`
`...you can understand my love.........?"`
`"I'm not qualified to understand it.`
` However, I'm also not qualified to deny it."`
`"..................Oooh,`
` ......Beatrice......`
` ......Please,`
` .........forgive me........."`
`Kinzo sobbed quietly for a while, wiping away his tears...`
`Because of love,`
` he believed she was Beatrice reborn,`
` and raised her that way.`
`However, somewhere in his heart,`
` ......he might have felt...`
`...pangs of conscience,`
` telling him that he might be forcing his emotions on someone who wasn't really Beatrice.`
`Then, the Beatrice of Kuwadorian had an unexpected guest, Rosa.`
`Unable to believe that she was the Beatrice that Kinzo desired,`
` and suffering from her inability to understand who she was, she expressed a desire to escape to the outside world.`
`Then, ............she fell from the cliff...and died.`
`"Genji handled that death, which couldn't become public knowledge, very quietly."`
`"...................................."`
`"Funerals aren't for the dead.`
` ......They exist so that those who are alive can sever their ties with the dead.`
` ......You could never do that.`
` That's why it festered within you."`
`"......Beatrice......`
`...ooooooooohhhh......"`
`"G‐......Grandfather........."`
`"You lost your mistress's—`
`no, you lost Beatrice twice.`
` Unable to let that sorrow show on the outside, you kept it locked up in your heart,`
` ......and it eventually festered and turned to madness.`
` That's what spurred on your abnormally strong interest in the occult in your later years."`
`"Oooooooooohhhh!!`
` Beatriceeeeee, Beatriceeeeee!!`
` Why?!!`
` Why did you leave me twice?!`
` Your smile,`
` that beautiful hair,`
` those eyes...`
` ......Why did you die in my arms not once,`
` ......but twice?!"`
`"Is that how much...`
`...how much you...`
`......ooo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}ohhhh,`
` oo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}oohhhh...oohhh..."`
`By now, Kinzo wasn't even trying to suppress his sobs.`
`Sometimes, he scratched at his head in anguish;`
` other times, he faced the heavens like an opera singer.`
`Kinzo yelled over and over again, repeating Beatrice's name......`
`At that moment, there was a quiet sound of a door closing.`
`......When they turned around, she was already there.`
`{n}Kumasawa had appeared.`
`".........If they already know that much,`
` perhaps we can tell them the rest...?"`
`"......Though, if they know that much,`
` I don't believe there is anything more to tell..."`
`"No, we should tell them.`
` As a woman,`
` ......I've always thought that the heart of Kuwadorian's Beatrice is a story that should be told.`
` And now, someone has appeared who is worthy to hear it.`
` I believe that now is the time to tell all, without holding back."`
`".............................."`
`"Kumasawa‐san, do you know something?`
` About Beatrice......?"`
`"Of course she does.`
` ......In the fourth game, we have testimony from the ferryboat captain saying that Kumasawa went in and out of Kuwadorian.`
` I'd be willing to bet that Kumasawa had different work shifts at the mansion and Kuwadorian.`
` There was a young girl to be taken care of.`
` Kumasawa, with her long experience in taking care of children, must have been of immense value."`
`".........That is correct.`
` You might even call me her wet nurse."`
`"No way......`
` ......I can't believe it.`
` ......So, ......everything Will‐san is saying is the truth."`
`".........Yes.`
` It is a fact.`
` ......There was a secret mansion constructed on the opposite side of the island for Beatrice‐sama.`
` The existence of Kuwadorian is the truth."`
`"I don't know when Kinzo married his official wife,`
` but back when Kinzo already had an enormous store of wealth and had bought Rokkenjima whole,`
` he built two mansions and set up two separate lives."`
`Kinzo's children had also been aware of Kinzo's clandestine eccentricities at the time.`
`It probably hadn't been easy to set up two lives.`
`{n}Moreover, Kinzo's wife had been suspicious and had sniffed around all the time...`
`"The Master stayed in Kuwadorian as much as time allowed.`
` He would sometimes pretend to go on a business trip and stay there for several days,`
` treasuring the time he spent with Beatrice‐sama.`
` ......It was not simply a father‐daughter relationship.`
` You could sometimes catch a glimpse of his great love for the late Beatrice‐sama, and it was a heart‐warming thing."`
`"The way you say it makes it sound like he sometimes treated her...`
`...as a substitute for Beatrice."`
`"Oho.`
` If it sounded that way, my apologies.`
` ......Beatrice‐sama probably accepted her father's love.`
` However, I will not deny...`
`that she was sometimes forced to bear a love she didn't understand."`
`Kumasawa's tone made it sound as though she was scolding Kinzo.`
`As a mother who had raised many kids, Kumasawa had probably spotted that Kinzo's love was often of a mistaken sort.`
`However, the more the girl grew to look like her mother,`
` the more distorted and twisted Kinzo's heart became......`
`Because of his deep love,`
` it grew very,`
` very...`
`...twisted......`
`".........You are right to scold me, my friend.`
` ............I understand.`
` My love is eternal and undying.`
` ......However, there were times when I directed it at the wrong person, and...`
`...I...`
`...must acknowledge that......"`
`"......Grandfather...`
` .........Wait, ......you don't mean......"`
`"Lion‐sama.`
` All humans in this world are tied to each other.`
` Even if they do not notice, there is always some sort of tie.`
` Those ties......wrap themselves around people and bring them together."`
`"No way...............`
` ............Grandfather..............."`
`Just as Kinzo had done, Lion also wiped away tears and stared down at the floor.`
`Apparently, the truth had been too much of a shock for the young successor to handle...`
`"......My lord.`
` Perhaps the time has come to speak of it."`
`"..............................`
` ......I see.`
` So, that time has come, ......my friend."`
`"Unless you tell us,`
` none of the truth will become clear."`
`".........My lord.`
` ......I believe they may have the qualifications and the right to know."`
`"I know.`
` Perhaps on this day of my fickle funeral, Beatrice in heaven has given me a chance to atone...`
` .........Forgive me for not telling you this before now."`
`After taking a deep breath, Kinzo finally lowered the hands that had been covering his face,`
` ......and looked at Will and Lion with those red eyes.`
`"..........................."`
`"..................Grandfather..."`
`"You listen too, Lion.`
` ......Guest.`
` Willard, was it?"`
`"Yeah."`
`".........I thank you for giving me a chance to speak of the truth while I still am able.`
` ......You must surely be a messenger from heaven sent by Beatrice...`
` ......You have my gratitude........."`
`"Beatrice isn't the one you have to thank.`
` It was some witch.`
` ......Well, I guess they're both witches..."`
`"Hmph, ......I do not care who it was.`
` I have been given a chance.`
` That is enough.`
` ......Thank you, Willard."`
`Kinzo slowly stood up and held out his right hand.`
`{n}He was offering to shake hands.`
`It must have been Kinzo's way of expressing his gratitude...`
`Will responded.`
`{n}Then, the two hands gripped each other tightly in silence.`
`When they did, ......a bright light poured out from the gap between the two hands.`
`"..................nn—"`
`Will felt as though something the size of a grain had burned itself into his palm.`
`......It was that power that {f:5:Bernkastel} had given him.`
`The light grew brighter and brighter.`
`However, it seemed that Kinzo and the others could not see it.`
`"......Now, I will speak.`
` I met Beatrice—`
`Beatrice Castiglioni—just before the end of the war.`
` She came from across the sea......"`
`"................................."`
`"......So, are you Kinzo?"`
`"It's how Grandfather looked in the past.`
` I've seen photos.`
` ......Just what on Earth......"`
`"It's the theatergoing power that {f:5:Bernkastel} gave me.`
` ......Don't try to understand."`
`"I'll just get a headache?"`
`"You're getting the hang of this."`
`At one time, Genji told Battler that he looked like Kinzo in his youth.`
`Sure enough, though the young Kinzo wasn't exactly the same as Battler, they looked very similar.`
`".........Allow me to introduce myself again.`
` ......I am Ushiromiya Kinzo."`
`"Grandfather........."`
`Even the voice seemed to resemble Battler's somehow.`
`Clearly, Battler had inherited Kinzo's blood more thickly than any other...`
`"I did not want to succeed the Ushiromiya family headship.`
` ......My being chosen as the head was nothing more than a prank of fate."`
`"......In the Great Kanto Earthquake, those in charge passed away, and you were selected from the branch families."`
`"That's correct.`
` After all, Grandfather was wise despite his youth, and he already possessed a dignity fitting for the headship."`
`"Fuhahahahahahahaha......`
` Ridiculous.`
` ......Those greedy elders were so intent on looking out for their own personal interests that they couldn't even decide on a new head.`
` They were like fools arguing about who the new captain should be on a sinking ship."`
`"So, since you had no connections with anyone in the main family, you were selected right out of the blue."`
`"It's all because of my toes.`
` If only I'd had one fewer toe on each foot, my life may have turned out quite differently......"`
`In the Ushiromiya family, polydactyly was seen as a sign of good fortune.`
`{n}This was because it was a common factor among many of the greats in the family's history.`
`"It was all very pathetic.`
` The elders didn't care whom they dragged in as long as it wouldn't favor any of them over the others."`
`"So, they just happened to hear that someone in one of the branch families had six toes,`
` and decided that would do well enough."`
`"Precisely.`
` The elders didn't care what sort of novice became the head,`
` as long as they could make him their puppet.`
` In fact, the more ignorant this person was of how to lead, the better it would be for them."`
`"......Grandfather......"`
`"Lion.`
` It is quite different in your case.`
` ......You will be the one who inherits everything I have.`
` That is the fate you were granted on the day of your birth.`
` That is why I gave you that silver ring and raised you so strictly.`
` ......You are quite different from me.`
` You are already a splendid successor, of whom no one could be ashamed......"`
`"...Y‐......yes, sir......"`
`"A puppet heir, huh...`
` ...I doubt that could've been easy."`
`".........Heh,`
` ......hehahahahahahahahaha..."`
`As he pondered about where to begin, Kinzo laughed bitterly.`
`It would probably bring back nothing but painful memories no matter where he started from...`
`"It......lasted for so long, that span of gray days.`
` That mind‐numbing stretch of time I spent dead passed like moss growing on a rock......"`
`I became the rope in the tug of war between the elders, who thought of nothing but their own profit,`
` .....and I probably could have snapped at any moment.`
`However, people are far more resilient than one would think.`
`Though I spent so many days like a dead man, ......I was not killed.`
`So, I would have to search for death on my own......`
`The next thing I knew, I had reached the age when I could no longer refer to myself as "young" without drawing laughter from those who were.`
`They were long, dreary, gray days without any substance.`
`And they lasted for a full twenty years.`
`In twenty years, a person can be born, find a purpose, and even become their own man with their own place in the world.`
`In short, .....if one truly becomes a human only when they have become a working adult...`
`...then I spent an amount of time long enough to create a human...`
`...doing nothing except playing the part of puppet to those greedy old men.`
`Ironically, though that time aged my body, it did not age my mind.`
`In my heart, I was still young,`
` and I looked back fondly on the fulfilling days before I was summoned to Odawara.`
`Only my body continued to age, and at some point, the gulf between the two had widened to the point that it was hard to comprehend.`
`So, I could hardly believe that the worn‐out man in the mirror was really me.`
`No, it really wasn't me.`
`I was the "head of the Ushiromiya family" in name only.`
`I had no rights,`
` no autonomy.`
` There was no need for me to do anything other than what was asked of me.`
`I was just a doll sitting there on the shelf, gathering dust.`
`I remember nothing but lazily flipping through Western books I liked, locking myself in my own world,`
` ......doing nothing but playing with roses and drinking terrible drinks.`
`And it lasted a full twenty years.`
`Before I knew it...`
`...I had a stranger for a wife.`
` ......It wasn't any wife I had chosen.`
`She was someone that the elders had chosen and forced on me for their own reasons, the daughter of some noble family or something,`
` ......but that hardly mattered to me.`
`I did not love my wife, but neither did I dislike her.`
`......I just didn't care.`
`I fathered a few children, but that wasn't out of love for my wife.`
`They were just born before I knew it.`
` ......That's all there was to it.`
`None of it mattered.`
` No, that's not quite right.`
`......Everything was decided by someone other than me, and I simply obeyed.`
`That was the job...`
`......of the "Ushiromiya family head"......`
`"On some level, I felt as though my life was being slowly and quietly snuffed out."`
`"I can't believe it.`
` You have always been praised for being such a bold and wise ruler, and yet you lived like that for so long......"`
`"......Lion.`
` There is nothing so long and insubstantial as a life you do not live for yourself.`
` And yet, it passes in a blink.`
` ......Take this to heart."`
`"A life...you live for yourself......"`
`"Living means having your own will.`
` ......You probably {i:were} dead during that time."`
`"Precisely.`
` I wanted to live.`
` No, I wanted to die.`
` ......What must a puppet do to die?"`
`".....................`
` ......Cut...the strings."`
`"Correct.`
` That would be death, it would be life, and it would be...`
`...release."`
`Before I realized it, the world had grown troubled.`
`World War II.`
` The Pacific War.`
`Japan had extended their war fronts too far to the East and West, and the tide of war was changing.`
`Thanks to the influence of the elders, I was able to avoid conscription.`
`......Of course, this was not out of compassion for me.`
` It was because I was their precious puppet.`
`So, the war never really felt that close to me.`
`{n}However, when I personally decided to abandon their protection, it was very easy.`
`At that time, the Ushiromiya family had almost completely collapsed,`
` and since the elders had apparently pilfered enough of the scraps to last them the rest of their lives,`
` they seemed to care little for what I did, now that they no longer had any use for me.`
`So, I realized that I had finally found my time to die.`
`One by one,`
` I cut the threads I was hanging from,`
` ......and began to search...`
`...for a place to end my life.`
`"So, you searched for death on the battlefield?"`
`"......I thought that if I was going to die anyway, I should try to be of some use to someone.`
` ......No, that's a lie.`
` I probably just lacked the willpower to end my own life.`
` War was a suitable excuse for death."`
`"I heard that your knowledge in public works and construction...`
`led to you being tasked with setting up facilities for the Navy construction team."`
`"Hmph, and what a miscalculation that was.`
` If I had just said that I had no useful skills, I would have been sent to the front lines where I could die at a moment's notice..."`
`"So, you ended up not having to go to the front lines?"`
`"Some of the others were overjoyed at their luck.`
` It was the opposite for me.`
` My only desire was to get my hands on the intoxicating liquor of battle and drink myself to death.`
` ......The US planes did nothing but cut across the skies of that forsaken island.`
` ......They didn't have even a bullet to spare for me, much less a bomb."`
`"Is this the time you met Beatrice, Grandfather......?"`
`"Correct.`
` She came to me from the sea......"`
`"Where did you meet her?`
` You mentioned an island."`
`"It was here.`
` She came to this island."`
`"......So, you met here, on Rokkenjima?"`
`"What's going on...?`
` ......I heard that Rokkenjima was uninhabited until you bought it, Grandfather.`
` I never knew there was a Japanese military base here."`
`"Pft, hahahahahahahaha......`
` Ah, yes, you could hardly call that a military base.`
` It was just a cave.`
` I was one of the guards of that cave."`
`{a:c:1944.}`
`Due to the honorable defeats at Saipan and Guam, Japan's Absolute National Defense Zone strategy was in shambles.`
`Where had the gallantry of the start of the war gone?`
`{n}The old attackers were now the ones on the defensive.`
`At that time, it was said that the final trump cards for the Japanese military were the so‐called "special attack weapons".`
`It was said that these ultimate weapons were packed with 1.55 tons of explosives...`
`and capable of sinking any kind of warship with a single blast.`
`To strengthen homeland defense,`
` the Navy drafted a plan to build a string of hidden bases from Hachijojima to Yokosuka, all to house submarines loaded with special attack weapons.`
`"I knew that there was a base constructed on Hachijojima.`
` To think there was one on Rokkenjima too......"`
`"Just what sort of fool decided it would be a good idea to plant a base on this desolate island, I have no idea.`
` ......To better preserve its secrecy?`
` Hmph, ridiculous.`
` ......I could never understand what the higher‐ups were thinking, and I didn't particularly care."`
`These truly were ultimate weapons, able to take down large warships in a single strike.`
`It was hoped that the presence of submarines capable of loading these weapons in the waters just off of Japan would allow for a powerful sea ambush as a final line of defense.`
`So, to aid in the establishment of a base with absolute secrecy, the uninhabited island Rokkenjima was raised as a possible candidate.`
`An investigation of the island resulted in the discovery of a large cave in the cliffs,`
` and this was apparently deemed to be a suitable location for a submarine base.`
`"So, you were tasked with aiding in the establishment of that base?"`
`"Establishment?`
` Certainly, if you can call digging out a cave "establishment".`
` Not only that, the base was abandoned before its completion."`
`"Why?"`
`"Wahahahahaha!`
` Because at that time, Japan no longer had any submarines large enough to carry one of those weapons.`
` How truly laughable.`
` What's the point in having a submarine base if there aren't any submarines left?`
` If there's one thing that never changes, it's politicians and their meaningless projects."`
`The base on Hachijojima was actually outfitted with those weapons and became a base for direct attacks,`
` but Rokkenjima was never supplied with any.`
`Not only that, they cancelled the construction work entirely,`
` leaving only a crew of minimal size stationed on the island, waiting for orders from above that never came.`
`Could it be the fact that it was a hidden base sealed our fate?`
`The higher‐ups had already completely forgotten about this useless and pointless cavern.`
`We were nothing more than guards for a mere cave.`
`We spent our days farming, fishing, and playing with the dirt,`
` all the while gazing up at the American formations flying past.`
`......Some of our group were relieved at the prospect of the war ending before anyone remembered we were here...`
`and before any of us had to face a real battle.`
`Of course, it was the opposite for me.`
`I hoped beyond hope for the American troops to advance and kill me as soon as possible.`
`And then, on one of those hollow days...`
`Let us go back there now.`
`......Back to the turning point in my life and my fate,`
` ......when Ushiromiya Kinzo finally became alive......``"Step it up!!`
` What are you doing, slacking off when the fighting's so close?!"`
`Stars seemed to spin around inside my head.`
`I could just lie down on the floor, but that'd only make him more angry.`
`I've no intention of being obedient.`
`......Still, it'd be stupid to get myself punched for no reason, so I got up and stood at attention...`
`"................................."`
`The fighting's close, is it?`
` You really think the American troops are likely to show up on this forgotten island?`
`Then let them come right now.`
`{n}That's what I've been waiting for all this time.`
`"What's this cowardly look you're wearing?!`
` Is this how afraid you are of death?!`
` Are you so scared of those Americans?!`
` You won't be killin' any of them with an attitude like that!!"`
`".............................."`
`They hit me again.`
`......Could you please quit your whining already?`
` Filthy cowards.`
`They give themselves over to this inexplicable anger because it's the only way to distract themselves from their own fear.`
`Heart and spirit aren't any use when the battle becomes hopeless.`
`When trapped by an insurmountable hopelessness, humans rely on several other emotions to escape their fear.`
`These young, inexperienced soldiers found anger to be a very convenient emotion to fall back upon.`
`They did "drills" by shouting in loud voices and swinging their bamboo spears around.`
` Drinking the wine called anger was simply what they needed to do to numb their fear.`
`The more one drinks wine, the more one needs to drink to get drunk.`
`Their useless anger continued to pile up, day after day, without pause.`
`As for me, I did not fear death.`
`So, I had no need of the wine called anger.`
`This made their cowardice all the more apparent to me.`
`"There you go again, that look in your eyes!`
` Ushiromiya, your spirit is rotten to the core!!`
` You're a fish, that's what you are.`
` You've got the eyes of a dead fish!!"`
`However, it went both ways.`
`Just as I was able to spot their cowardice...`
`{n}They were able to pick up on my lethargy.`
`"Is Ushiromiya Kinzo here?!`
` The lieutenant's looking for you!"`
`"Stand up!`
` No slouching about!`
` Double tiiiiime!!"`
`First Lieutenant Yamamoto was the commanding officer in charge of the Rokkenjima garrison.`
`He was just another filthy coward trying to forget his fear with violence,`
` and would reprimand his subordinates for slacking off at the drop of a hat.`
`The stories of his life he'd spout off when in a good mood were all about how much of a thug he had been, ignoring the rules of society.`
`On and on about how so‐and‐so was a prick so he taught them a lesson, or how everyone was so scared of him that he got special treatment.`
`......He kept on talking about what a vile human he was as though it was a badge of honor.`
`Normally, I had nothing to do with this disagreeable lieutenant.`
`He would always hang around with his non‐commissioned subordinates,`
` so as long as I treated him with a snappy salute, I could more or less ignore him for the time being.`
`Now that the construction project on this island had been suspended indefinitely, there was no longer any use for an engineer like me.`
`So, why did the lieutenant ask for me specifically?`
`{n}At that moment, I couldn't think of anything......`
`"Ushiromiya!`
` I hear you're good at speaking foreign languages, is that true?!"`
`"I am proficient in both English and Chinese, sir."`
`The lieutenant liked to brag about his education in front of the non‐commissioned officers,`
` but he held a bit of a grudge against me for being even more highly educated than him.`
`He also felt uncomfortable about having me as a subordinate because he was younger than me,`
` so I was definitely not the kind of person he could hit it off with.`
`Just the fact that I knew several languages must have hurt his pride.`
`"What about Italian, do you speak that?"`
`"I'm afraid not."`
`"So, you wouldn't be much help as an Italian interpreter, then."`
`"It should be possible if one of them speaks English as well, sir."`
`"......Ah, yes, very true!`
` Have you ever talked with a foreigner in English?!"`
`"I have, sir."`
`Why on Earth would he need an interpreter in a cave on an uninhabited island that even our superiors have forgotten?`
`His question made it clear that someone who would need an interpreter would be visiting Rokkenjima.`
`"Good!`
` Ushiromiya, you'll be my interpreter, that's an order!"`
`That evening, I found out exactly what he was talking about.`
`That pointless cavern submarine dock that had never been used...`
`.........was now being approached slowly by a submarine of the Italian Navy.`
`Of course, I knew that the Italians had been our allies.`
`{n}However, this was the first time I had seen anything from their military with my own eyes.`
`"What was the Italian Navy doing here......?`
` Didn't Italy surrender in 1943?`
` What's going on...?"`
`"It was the Kingdom of Italy that surrendered.`
` ......However, the ones who couldn't accept that surrender formed a pro‐German government called the RSI so that they could continue fighting."`
`"The RSI?"`
`"The Italian Social Republic.`
` Also known as the Salò Republic."`
`"You know your history.`
` ......The ignorant often call the Italians cowards, saying that they surrendered first of the Axis powers in 1943.`
` That's not true.`
` The military of the Italian Social Republic fought bravely from the outbreak of war until April 29th, 1945."`
`"And Berlin fell just three days after that.`
` Far from being cowards, they gave one hell of a fight.`
` ......Still, I'm surprised the RSI Navy even had possession of a submarine that could travel all the way to Japan."`
`"......Even if they did, it's a surprise that they'd come out this far at all.`
` ......Why would they come to Japan?`
` To Rokkenjima?"`
`The submarine was both weather‐worn and massive.`
`This dock had never even been used by one of our own country's submarines.`
`I doubt anyone here imagined that it would end up welcoming in one from a far‐off nation.`
`All of the guards of Rokkenjima, of which there were only about thirty, stood at attention as the submarine docked.`
`"......Never seen the Italian military before......"`
`"I heard a mine or some kinda accident trashed their sub."`
`"From what I heard, their ventilation system was hit and they couldn't stop the cabin filling up with chlorine gas."`
`"The lieutenant was hinting about there being something very important in there......"`
`"You mean like a code machine or the blueprints for some new kind of engine?"`
`"I couldn't care less what they're carrying, I'm more surprised that the higher‐ups still remember we exist..."`
`"Move it, Ushiromiya!!`
` How're you supposed to interpret from over there?!!"`
`"Yes, sir......"`
`On top of the hatch was a young Italian saluting us.`
`......Normally, this should have been the job of a commissioned officer, but his clothes looked like those of a sailor,`
` and it really didn't look like he had the dignity and composure of a ship's captain.`
`That probably meant that all of the commissioned officers in charge had died in the accident that had befallen this sub.`
`Crew members crawled out of the hatch one by one, but they all looked pale and entirely worn out.`
`I wasn't sure how long ago the accident had happened,`
` but being crammed together in a tiny sub filled with chlorine gas for any amount of time can't be good for your health.`
`Adding to the problem of the broken ventilation system was the fact that they couldn't afford to travel about carelessly on the surface of the waters around Japan right now.`
`......They had essentially traveled here inside a can of poison gas.`
`Almost all of them were unable to walk without leaning on someone else—it looked like a bunch of people staggering out of a hospital boat.`
`"Ushiromiya!`
` Ask them who the captain is!`
` Tell them that I'm in charge of this island!"`
`"<......Welcome to Japan.`
` Do any of you speak English?>"`
`The crew members seemed to understand that I was speaking English, but it looked as though none of them could speak it.`
`Eventually, someone who seemed to be dressed as an officer saluted.`
`"<Welcome to Japan.`
` Are you the captain?>"`
`"<I cannot speak English>......`
` <Please, wait.>"`
`The officer answered in slow, laborious English.`
`......After asking us to wait, he shouted something to his subordinates in rapid Italian.`
`It looked as though he was telling them to get someone among them who could speak English.`
`"Ushiromiya, what're they talking about?!"`
`"They've asked us to wait.`
` They might be looking for someone there who can speak English."`
`At that moment, I heard a high‐pitched cough.`
`{n}It wasn't a man's cough.`
` ......It was a woman's.`
`"<I speak English.>"`
`As she came down from the hatch, .........a woman with beautiful golden hair said this in English.`
`In this filthy cavern,`
` the appearance of one as beautiful as she was seemed like an angel descending upon us......`
`"<Welcome to Japan.`
` Is the captain there?>"`
`"<The captain is dead.`
` That man over there is the only officer left.>"`
`"<My condolences.`
` Can we do anything to assist you?>"`
`"<Well, we would like some fresh air and water.`
` Some of us are still having trouble breathing.`
` We'd like a place to rest.>"`
`"<We would be happy to help.`
` Do any of the others understand English?>"`
`"<There were some who did, but they're all dead.`
` I'm the only one now.>"`
`"Ushiromiya! What's that woman talking about?!`
` Who's the captain? That man from a second ago?!`
` Who is that woman?! Let's see some translating, dammit!!"`
`The lieutenant wouldn't shut up.`
`......He must have been surprised to see such a beautiful woman appear from the submarine...`
`and more than a little annoyed to see all of her attention focused on me alone.`
`It was a mark......of how divinely beautiful she was.`
`"Sir,`
` it seems that she's the only one who understands English.`
` She will act as their interpreter.`
` Their captain is dead.`
` That officer seems to be acting in his place."`
`"<Who's that loud man who keeps yelling at you?`
` Don't tell me he's your superior.>"`
`"<Yes, unfortunately.`
` He probably doesn't like seeing me have such a beautiful lady all to myself.>"`
`"<Oho.`
` I didn't expect such flattery from an Asian.`
` Your English is superb.`
` I imagine you've been brought up very well.`
` Unlike that rude man who keeps on shouting.`
` They should have made you the officer in charge around here.>"`
`"<Oh?`
` I didn't expect such flattery from a Westerner.>"`
`"<*giggle*!`
` You're an interesting man.`
` What's your name?>"`
`"<Ushiromiya...Kinzo.`
` If you don't mind, may I ask for your name as well?>"`
`"<Beatrice Castiglioni.>"`
`"<Welcome, Beatrice.`
` Welcome to Japan.>"`
`That was when I first met Beatrice, the woman who would capture my heart for the rest of my life......`
`"......So, Beatrice was an Italian."`
`"Yes.`
` She was the daughter of a high‐ranking RSI official.`
` Apparently, their most important cargo was her father himself.`
` ......Sadly, he had already died by the time they reached Rokkenjima."`
`"Why would a high official like that come to Japan?`
` You're saying he went through the Suez Canal and crossed the Indian Ocean to come all the way here?"`
`"That's a good point.`
` If they wanted to reach one of their allies, Germany should have been much closer.`
` ......So, why would they make the long trip to Japan?"`
`".........It may have been part of some grand, outrageous strategy.`
` ......I don't know all the details,`
` but shortly after, I learned that this submarine's mission was far from a minor one..."`
`They said that there had been about sixty of them at the time of their departure.`
`However, only about ten of them, including Beatrice, had survived.`
`Their submarine had apparently hit a mine or something in the nearby waters and sustained a great deal of damage.`
`They told us that it had flooded rapidly with water, which had taken out the batteries and released a large amount of chlorine gas.`
`Their sub had become completely incapable of continuing further,`
` nothing but a massive lump of metal floating in the dock.`
`Since the sub seemed to be carrying "something of immense value",`
` the higher‐ups ordered us to investigate.`
`After questioning the Italians, with Beatrice and me acting as double interpreters,`
` we concluded that this thing of immense value must have been her father himself.`
`Apparently, Beatrice's father was extremely high up in the RSI hierarchy,`
` and it was thought that he might have worked alongside the Italian Prime Minister himself.`
`Though their massive voyage had apparently been part of some top‐secret mission, now that the man himself and all of the commissioned officers had died,`
` their reason for coming to Japan remained a mystery.`
`And, since the higher‐ups were telling us to investigate, that meant that even they didn't know what it was.`
`Their ship had broken down, their mission was unknown, and the high official they had been carrying was dead.`
`{n}And even the Japanese government didn't know why they were here.`
`......The Italians' great and perilous voyage...`
`...had come to a meaningless and utterly fruitless end...`
`"<That's a relief.`
` I always assumed the Japanese ocean air would smell like soy sauce.>"`
`"<What a coincidence.`
` I've always thought Italians had hair made of pasta.>"`
`"<Of course we do.`
` You don't know how hard it is to get that perfect al dente texture.`
` I imagine you Japanese all wear spaghetti al nero?>"`
`"<Oh, you know quite a lot, I see.`
` In Japan, we like to use squid ink instead of shampoo.>"`
`"<*giggle*!`
` You really are amazing, Kinzo.`
` It seems you know everything!`
` Have you ever been to Italy?>"`
`"<Never.`
` I have read a lot of your books, though.>"`
`"<An Asian man reading Italian books?!`
` Wow, what kinds of books?>"`
`"<Niccolò Machiavelli.`
` And Dante Alighieri.`
` So, I know of course that you are the eternal lady.>"`
`"<Oh, what a surprise...`
` You must be quite the bookworm.`
` Does this mean you came from some Japanese noble family?>"`
`"<.........Who knows?>"`
`"<You're completely different from those other savage‐looking Japanese soldiers.`
` I can tell!`
` You must've come from a noble family.`
` Are the Ushiromiyas some sort of Japanese aristocrats?>"`
`"<......Of course not.`
` They just managed to strike it rich in the spinning industry in recent generations.`
` I didn't study to prepare myself for nobility or anything like that.`
` ......I just wasn't allowed to do anything else.`
` Reading books, playing around with roses,`
` and getting myself drunk were the only ways I had to occupy myself.>"`
`Beatrice hadn't asked that question out of malice.`
`{n}It had just been a curious question asked to a friend from a faraway country.`
`However, ......Beatrice was from a noble family herself, so she could tell.`
`......She could see the faint gloomy look on Kinzo's face.`
`"<Forgive me, Kinzo.`
` I was so surprised that a high‐class person like you would be a simple soldier in a place like this...`
`...that I didn't stop to think about why.>"`
`"<I don't really care about my family line.`
` The name Ushiromiya will mean nothing when I'm dead.`
` And that will be what finally sets me free.>"`
`"<.........So, you joined the army because you wanted to die?`
` You mustn't do that.`
` Your family would be so sad.>"`
`"<Family?`
` ......I have no family.>"`
`I have a wife for the sake of public appearances...and children.`
`{n}However, I've never wanted any of them.`
`......Everything, everything......is a fleeting daydream created by selfish, greedy old men.`
`......So, at least being stuck on this island, I can forget about all of that......and find some peace.`
`Peace.........?`
`But haven't I spent each and every day complaining that I wasn't sent to the front and haven't managed to die yet......?`
`"<......I can't understand the pain you're going through, but I do realize that my thoughtless words have hurt you.`
` Forgive me, Kinzo.>"`
`Forgive me, Kinzo.`
`Ohh, those words...I think...they set me free.`
`All of the Japanese people call me Ushiromiya.`
`......Every time I hear it, it's a constant reminder that I'm the property of the Ushiromiya family.`
`But she is different.`
`{n}She calls me...Kinzo.`
` Not Ushiromiya.`
`So maybe.........just for the time I chat with her like this,`
` ......I can forget that cursed family.`
`"<............Kinzo.>"`
`I hadn't meant to make Beatrice feel guilty,`
` but she seemed certain that her thoughtless words had hurt me.`
`"<Thank you.>"`
`"<Huh?>"`
`"<You calling me "Kinzo" makes me feel like I can finally be my own man.`
` ......I think...that I've finally met a person who truly sees me for who I am.>"`
`"<Kinzo.`
` You may be a foreigner I met in a distant land,`
` ......but I know your heart is very sensitive and beautiful.`
` If we had grown up in the same neighborhood, I'm sure we'd have become quick friends.>"`
`"<......I'm happy too.`
` You always call me Beatrice.`
` Not "the daughter of the Castiglioni family".>"`
`We were both in the same position.`
`Her Castiglioni family must have been a rigid place as well.`
`......Though we came from different countries, we had finally found something we could truly understand about each other.`
`"<Do you have a nickname that people close to you use?>"`
`"<No.`
` They would just call me Kinzo.>"`
`"<Well then, you should stop calling me Beatrice.`
` All of my close friends used to call me Bice.`
` I'd like you to call me that too.>"`
`"<Very well.`
` From this point onwards, I will call you Bice as a sign of our friendship.>"`
`"<Ah, come on.`
` You can't talk all stiff like that.`
` We're friends now, okay?>"`
`A bright smile stretched across Beatrice's face......`
`"No matter how many decades pass,`
` ......that smile will never fade from my memory......"`
`"......So, by meeting Beatrice, you managed to regain your sense of self."`
`"Or, as most people would put it, he cheated on his wife.`
` .........Nggyaahh, ggrrrrkkk......"`
`"If you plan to continue being rude, I suggest you get in the habit of covering your butt."`
`After having his butt pinched once more, Will hopped around in pathetic agony...`
`"So, in your eyes, Grandfather, Rokkenjima was...`
`always special for being the place you first met Beatrice."`
`".........Mm.`
` ...If I had never come to this island, I would never have met her... It truly is an island of miracles..."`
`"Is there anything left of that submarine base today?"`
`"Yes, it's still there, close to Kuwadorian.`
` It's in the shadows of a cove that can't be seen from the outside.`
` After all, fishermen never approach this supposedly ill‐omened island.`
` It is unlikely that anyone besides me still knows of its existence."`
`"Is the two‐kilometer‐long underground passage between Kuwadorian and the mansion a remnant of that base?"`
`"That is correct.`
` There was some nonsense about carving a network of tunnels out of the limestone caverns...`
`which would connect a number of bunkers across the island.`
` I made use of those tunnels and had two mansions built, one at each end of the island."`
`"Two mansions, two families.`
` ......The Ushiromiya family mansion, ......and the mansion for "Kinzo", released from the shackles of the Ushiromiya family."`
`"............Correct.`
` ......It was something I needed.`
` ......A place for me to escape from the cursed name of Ushiromiya."`
`"...................................."`
`"<Still, I do feel bad for you.`
` It must be awful to have come all the way out here and been unable to fulfill your mission.>"`
`"<I don't really know what Papa's plan was.`
` He said that we needed to run far away to hide "it" until the time came.>"`
`"<And what is "it"?>"`
`"<I don't know.`
` ......‘It’ was something very important,`
` and he planned to hide it for many years until the right moment.`
` Oh, and he planned for us to remain hidden along with it.`
` I know because he apologized to me that I might be spending a very long time on foreign soil.>"`
`"<Didn't Ensign Angelo say that you had no cargo in particular,`
` and that you were transporting your father instead?>"`
`"<The ensign doesn't trust you or the others.`
` Even I know a few things he's kept hidden from you.`
` ......He might even know what Papa's goal was...and what the cargo is.>"`
`"<Whatever it is, that's a mission for the Italian military.`
` It has nothing to do with us.`
` In fact, given that we're allies,`
` we'd be willing to help if only they asked.>"`
`"<I have no doubts that you're a good person, Kinzo.`
` I've even told Ensign Angelo that you're a man we can trust, but...`
` ......Why is it that men always get so rigid and uptight when they're in a strange land?>"`
`"<Normally, they're all very bright and cheery people.`
` Ever since we came here, there's been this strange feeling of tension.`
` ......Ensign Angelo has ordered that his subordinates be armed at all times.`
` It's almost as though we're in enemy territory.>"`
`That was true.`
`The Italians were clearly the very opposite of relaxed.`
`The Japanese soldiers, watching this, began to suspect that the Italians didn't really trust them at all.`
`"<That's normal for a soldier.`
` This is precisely the time for them to straighten up their guard, so they don't embarrass themselves in front of a friendly army.>"`
`"<They have a person stand watch every time they sleep,`
` and they're still keeping a lookout to make sure none of you approach the submarine, even though it's nothing more than an unusable scrap heap now.`
` It almost feels as though they're acting openly hostile towards the Japanese, and that bothers me.>"`
`True, they had set up a constant sentry by the submarine and had refused to let any of the Japanese soldiers come near.`
`This hadn't made the Japanese particularly happy.`
`......However, submarines are treated as classified in all countries.`
`Maybe it was just natural for them to stop foreigners from approaching it without reason.`
`"<They're probably uncomfortable with being made to live in a way they aren't used to.`
` ......That boat which is supposed to take you back to the mainland is still being delayed by weather and problems up the command chain.`
` Just how long will it take before they can send you there...>"`
`We had been told that a boat was being sent for them directly from the mainland,`
` but apparently, thanks to the weather, problems up the command chain, and the recent air raids,`
` there were no ships to spare for a forgotten island like this.`
`There might have been some sort of diplomatic problem.`
`......After all, their homeland had already surrendered to the Allies.`
`......I didn't know the details.`
`The only thing I knew for sure...`
`was that they'd been stuck on Rokkenjima for two whole weeks and no one had come to get them.`
`Of course, we had some small boats on Rokkenjima.`
`{n}There was nothing physically stopping us from taking them to a nearby island.`
`Still, Rokkenjima was technically a top‐secret base, and contact with the outside world had been strictly forbidden...`
`"<Well, nothing we can do about it, and it isn't all that bad, really.`
` After all, if a boat did come for us, I'd probably never see you again, Kinzo.>"`
`"<.........True.>"`
`To me, those two weeks......were the first I'd ever truly {i:lived}.`
`The faint twenty years before all seemed to vanish in the sparkle of those two weeks.`
`......I realized that she would have to leave this place eventually.`
`And yet, this one moment felt so rich and dazzling...`
`...that I felt myself wishing it could last forever......`
`Then, I heard a voice calling for Beatrice in Italian.`
`"<......It's Ensign Angelo.`
` Looks like he wants you for something.>"`
`"<Probably to scold me.`
` These days, he keeps yapping on about how I shouldn't get too friendly with the Japanese soldiers.>"`
`The ensign approached, saluting Kinzo,`
` and after glancing at Beatrice as though asking her to translate something, he began to speak in Italian.`
`Judging by his tone, it sounded like something serious.`
`"<......Ensign Angelo has something very important to say, so he wants to talk with your commanding officer.`
` ......He seeks assistance with something.`
` I don't know what.>"`
`"<Something important...?`
` Got it.`
` I'll go find Lieutenant Yamamoto.>"`
`Ensign Angelo had two of his subordinates with him and wore a stern expression on his face.`
`They didn't have to say anything for us to realize that this must be something very serious......`
`"That's it!!`
` Lift it up!!"`
`The winch creaked and the thick chains rang out with a dull clang.`
`Very, very slowly, ......{i:it} was lifted up out of the submarine's cargo hold.`
`"......Now I get it!`
` ......So this is why those Italians didn't want us near their sub...!"`
`The lieutenant and the others looked up at what the winch was slowly lifting up,`
` ......all of them wearing unpleasant, forced smiles......`
`"<.........Unbelievable...`
` ......So this is what Papa brought all this way...?>"`
`"<I‐......incredible......`
` ......I've never seen anything like this......>"`
`It was...a mountain of gold ingots.`
`Those carefully piled bars were being slowly lifted out of the cargo hold, one group after another......`
`This gold had been their true cargo.`
`I don't know where they were planning to take it.`
`They might have been trying to sneak it into Japan, one of their allies,`
` ......or they might have been on their way to hide it in some remote area.`
`Was it some sort of strategy?`
` A conspiracy? Embezzlement?`
` Top‐secret transportation of wealth?`
`This incomprehensible amount of gold led to all sorts of dark suspicions, but we didn't know anything about the truth.`
`All told, the gold weighed an incredible ten tons.`
`{n}That was the only truth we could wrap our minds around at the moment......`
`They had strongly resisted showing this to us.`
`{n}However, the submarine could no longer make sea, and it was apparently continuing to take in water bit by bit.`
`Rokkenjima had been outfitted in an extremely slipshod way, so we had no means of repairing it.`
`Also, while we could unload the sub, there was no way we could lift it up again once it had filled with water and sunk to the bottom.`
`It was clear that unless action was taken, the gold would soon become completely impossible to transport.`
` ............And so, they had made the decision to unload it.`
`Of course, they made no effort to explain the reason for all this gold.`
`{n}They just asked us to help them take it out......`
`"<Why would they take so much gold out of the country...?`
` Couldn't they have changed the course of the war with this much wealth...?>"`
`"<......Weapons change the course of war,`
` but after the war, they aren't useful for anything.`
` ......Money may also change the course,`
` but it remains just as valuable after the war.>"`
`There was no longer any way to change the course of this war.`
`{n}The Axis powers would probably all surrender, leading to an Allied victory.`
`Anyone could tell this simply by looking at the American planes flying across the sky day after day.`
`However, gold would still be valuable after the war was over.`
`Everyone stared upwards,`
` dumbfounded...`
`...as the winch slowly lifted the dully sparkling gold......``"Lieutenant Yamamoto.`
` The Italians don't want us to tell the mainland about this gold."`
`".........Aha.`
` So, they don't want our country to take possession of it."`
`"<What did he say?>"`
`"<He's saying your group probably doesn't want it reported because you fear that Japan will take possession of the gold.>"`
`"<Ensign Angelo is actually more afraid of Italy itself finding out.`
` To us, our homeland's current government is a mere puppet set up by the Allied Forces.`
` If they find out, the gold will be returned to them.`
` However, that would be the same as handing the gold over to our enemies.>"`
`They had come all this way to make sure that the gold didn't fall into enemy hands.`
`They needed to hide this gold from the puppet government...`
`...until their homeland could be truly restored...`
`"Ushiromiya.`
` Make a proposal to the Italians.`
` Tell them that we wish to offer our assistance."`
`"What sort of assistance...?"`
`"I understand what the Italians are trying to say.`
` They want that gold to be hidden so that their homeland doesn't find out about it.`
` However, they would need to obtain at least a transport ship if they plan to take it from this island.`
` If they tried that, however, the mainland would hear about it, which means that the Italian government would too."`
`"That's right.`
` ......In other words, there's no longer any way to take that gold off Rokkenjima."`
`Their mission must have been to hide that gold in absolute secrecy until the day of their homeland's restoration.`
`Later on, several plausible rumors would circulate...`
`about how Germany also moved much of its secret wealth to certain hidden areas in South America just prior to its surrender.`
` It was a very natural conclusion to reach.`
`That submarine was their only method of transporting the gold in secrecy, and it's become completely useless.`
` They can't fully stop the water from seeping in, and it'll probably sink completely before much longer.`
`There's no longer any way for them to transport the gold in secrecy.`
`In other words, their mission has ended in failure here in the Far East.`
`So, just how is Lieutenant Yamamoto proposing that we assist them......?`
`"The Rokkenjima base is top‐secret, and no one knows about it.`
` The islanders in the surrounding area believe this island to be ill‐omened and deserted, so they never come near it.`
` ......Do you get my meaning, Ushiromiya?"`
`"<What did he say?>"`
`"<As we told you earlier, no one knows about this base.`
` And, as you can see, it's of no use strategically, so the higher‐ups have already forgotten about it.`
` ......Sounds like Lieutenant Yamamoto's suggesting that you hide the gold on this island.>"`
`Beatrice quickly translated this and told Ensign Angelo.`
`The ensign began discussing rapidly with his subordinates.`
`They didn't look happy.`
`Japan may have been their ally, but they probably didn't want the gold for reconstructing their motherland to be entrusted to Asians.`
`Still, it's hard to imagine any other option for them.`
`"<......It's a fierce debate.`
` Some say that there's no other option, while others think we should remain loyal to our homeland no matter the cost.`
` ......Ensign Angelo is stuck between a rock and a hard place.>"`
`Hiding this gold was the final order given to them by their fallen homeland.`
`{n}However, by now, there was no way for that order to be carried out successfully.`
`If the mainland or their own homeland found out, the gold would probably be confiscated by the wrong people, from their point of view.`
`If they really wanted to carry out their homeland's orders faithfully,`
` .........Lieutenant Yamamoto's proposal was extremely reasonable...`
`Though the lieutenant couldn't understand their words, it seemed he realized how divided they were.`
`"Heheheh, if we help out, we'll be able to hide the gold in the utmost secrecy.`
` Fortunately, there's an abandoned tunnel that stretches all the way across this island."`
`"<......He's saying that, if you hide the gold underground and bury it on this island, no one will be able to find it.>"`
`"<Our side is saying that it sounds like a realistic proposal.`
` ......However, there seems to be some resistance against accepting Japanese assistance.>"`
`"......It seems they're having difficulty coming to a decision."`
`"Heheh.`
` Do you really have a choice, Italians?`
` You don't think you can hide that gold without our help, do you?`
` And I doubt you want to leave it lying around on the beach for much longer."`
`"<Ensign Angelo wants to minimize the number of people who know about the gold.`
` ......He doesn't trust the Japanese, but it looks like he's decided that Lieutenant Yamamoto's plan is the best possible option.`
` But...he seems suspicious.>"`
`"<About what?>"`
`"<He's wondering whether they really intend to move a full ten tons of gold and swear themselves to secrecy...without any sort of compensation......>"`
`"Fifty‐fifty."`
`"......Sir, you can't be—"`
`"Hand over half of the gold to us.`
` With that as our work wages, we'll hide the other half nice and safe for them."`
`"<......H‐he's telling you to give us half of it.>"`
`The instant Beatrice translated that sentence, Ensign Angelo slammed his hands on the desk and stood up.`
`Instead of flinching, Lieutenant Yamamoto, true to his boasts of once being a thug that everyone feared,`
` actually looked even more relaxed and confident than he had previously.`
`"After all, they really don't have the option of refusing.`
` I could demand eighty percent if I wanted.`
` I've lowered that to an even split as a sign of good faith."`
`"......Of course, we aren't the only ones with leverage here.`
` If the Italians decide to leak this to the outside, all of the gold will probably be taken by Japan or Italy.`
` We won't get even a single yen out of it.`
` This can only work if we're both partners in crime here."`
`"<He's saying we should all be partners in the crime of embezzlement.`
` ......By now, he's already moved on to speaking as an individual, not as a soldier...>"`
`"<Insane......`
` So, he's been blinded by greed...>"`
`Lieutenant Yamamoto was grinning.`
`It really did look as though he had been blinded by greed, just as Beatrice said...`
`"If they leave it just piled up where it is, you can be sure that it'll be noticed when the boat comes for them from the mainland.`
` If that happens, none of us will profit.`
` They ought to accept our proposal and hide the gold as soon as possible."`
`"<......It sounds like Ensign Angelo is dead set on the Japanese and Italian governments not finding out about this.`
` He wants to carry out his duty until the end.>"`
`"<So, what exactly does that mean?>"`
`"<He wants the gold buried deep within the island, even if he has to pay some percentage to buy your silence.`
` ......Of course, some of his subordinates object strongly.`
` They're saying that fifty percent is out of the question.>"`
`"Ushiromiya.`
` How is it going over?"`
`".........They also don't want any more people laying eyes on the gold.`
` ......However, they seem to object to the portions."`
`"<Ensign Angelo says that they'll consider 10%.`
` ......Though he's also saying that he's fairly sure Lieutenant Yamamoto won't accept that.>"`
`"Ushiromiya.`
` What is the Italians' answer?"`
`"......They'll consider handing over ten percent."`
`This time, it was Lieutenant Yamamoto who slammed down on the desk.`
`But the Italians didn't flinch either.`
`......An incredible tension filled the small room...`
`However, despite his violent outburst a second ago, Lieutenant Yamamoto's expression still looked smug and in control.`
`He was probably confident that he now had the initiative.`
`"Ten percent!`
` Now there's a modest proposal.`
` ......Very well, I'll give up ten percent.`
` Forty‐sixty.`
` Tell them I won't go any further than that!"`
`Forty percent for the Japanese.`
` Sixty for the Italians.`
`The lieutenant made it sound like he was willing to stand firm on that, but in truth, these negotiations were not being made on an equal footing.`
`If the Italians just wanted the gold for themselves, there wouldn't be much of a problem.`
`But what if...`
`what if they really were true patriots, ......and decided that they ought to return the gold,`
` even to the defeated puppet government of their homeland, for the purpose of reconstruction?`
`If so, they would probably report the existence of the gold to the Italian embassy.`
`Eventually, the Italian government would petition the Allied nations for the retrieval of their gold.`
`......It probably wouldn't all make it back to Italy, but it might be used effectively to repair and rebuild the battered towns.`
`If that happened, Lieutenant Yamamoto and his friends would only be able to sneak out a few ingots at most.`
`He was greedily planning to make this his own treasure island, so that he and his subordinates could have an enormous fortune all to themselves.`
`......If he wanted those ambitions to bear out, the Italians would have to conceal the presence of the gold.`
`"<But there's one thing I don't get.`
` .........If Ensign Angelo doesn't want to let anyone have the gold, he could have just let the submarine sink.`
` Why did he have it unloaded?>"`
`"<......I'd rather not think about it,`
` ......but Ensign Angelo might have started planning to embezzle the gold as soon as he found out that their mission would be impossible to complete.`
` Right now, he's asking his subordinates for their opinions both as soldiers...`
`and as individuals with families waiting for them back home.`
` ......The more straight‐laced soldiers are furious.>"`
`The discussion between the Italians was becoming fierce and emotional.`
`Though their homeland had fallen, they had come all this way in accordance with its orders.`
`They had probably been given this mission because they were particularly faithful and duty‐minded troops.`
`It seemed they couldn't just agree to a foreigner's proposal to embezzle and split up the gold......`
`Ensign Angelo looked like he was doing all he could to calm the unexpectedly fervent rage of his subordinates.`
`......Looks like the gold is blinding them too.`
`It seems no one can sort out their own personal feelings and the way they want to be perceived......`
`"How's their answer coming?!`
` Ushiromiya!!"`
`"<......Bice.`
` Lieutenant Yamamoto's asking for an answer.>"`
`"<.........They're saying they want some time to think.`
` I had you to talk to, so I could let off some tension, but that wasn't true for the rest of them.>"`
`"<......They lost a lot of comrades at the end of a very long journey, and now they're here in a tight spot.`
` They've even lost their mission, the one thing they could depend upon to guide them.`
` They don't know what to do...>"`
`"Sir.`
` ......They say they'd like some time."`
`"Heheh, sure, let 'em talk it over all they want.`
` But there isn't much time.`
` If we're going to hide it, that'll take time and effort.`
` ......Make your decision before noon tomorrow.`
` That's all, Italians!"`
`"<......He's giving you until noon tomorrow.`
` ......That bastard, it's like he's trying to threaten you.>"`
`"<Ensign Angelo is saying he'll ask everyone's opinions...>"`
`"<How does it look?>"`
`"<It'll probably be tough going.`
` ......It seems the ensign is willing to consider splitting it,`
` but his subordinates and the others will probably oppose that.`
` ......All of them have lost close friends on their voyage to the Far East.`
` They're firm in their desire to do their duty for our homeland.>"`
`"<......Will they refuse the lieutenant's proposal?>"`
`"<Even if they do, the gold will just fall into someone else's hands.`
` ......If nothing is going to be left anyway, Ensign Angelo suggests that they each sneak at least one ingot back with them, and some of the others seem to agree, but......`
` Men always get carried away at times like this.`
` Even I can't guess what they'll do...>"`
`"......I imagine the Italians had some complicated feelings about all this."`
`"In their eyes, Italy after the surrender was probably like an enemy country.`
` Letting the gold go back to that Italy would erase the meaning of their entire voyage."`
`"However,`
` embezzling and splitting the gold would also erase the meaning of their journey..."`
`"The country they felt obligated to serve had already fallen.`
` That alone destroyed the significance of their journey.`
` Not a happy story for them."`
`"......If it's bound to be meaningless anyway,`
` wouldn't keeping hold of even just a few ingots be better than nothing?"`
`"Sure, if you want to calculate straight‐up profit and loss.`
` ............But men aren't like that."`
`The Italians were gathered in a cramped room, arguing fiercely.`
`«I don't like it!`
` We must remain true to our soldier spirit until the end, for the sake of our fallen comrades!»`
`«And how do you define "remaining true"?`
` By hiding the gold on this island?`
` By accepting the proposal of those Asians?!»`
`«We can't trust them!`
` Especially that Yamamoto person!`
` We must not let our guards down!»`
`«Unloading the gold and letting the Japanese see it was a huge mistake!`
` We should have let it sink with the sub!»`
`«Oh, wonderful idea, let's just sink it right inside a Japanese base!`
` It would have been pulled up eventually.`
` That wouldn't hide anything!»`
`«There's no way to get the gold off this island without anyone knowing in any case.»`
`«If we had just taken the honorable path and scuttled the sub, none of this would have happened...!!»`
`«If we had known back then that the sub was already broken beyond repair......»`
`«Why did you ask the Japanese military for help, Ensign?`
` How were you planning to carry out the mission if they found out about the gold?»`
`«Our mission was a failure from the moment you asked them for help!»`
`«All of us have families waiting for us back home.`
` And we've more than done our part, I'd say, voyaging all the way to this island country in the Far East.`
` You could call this a fair and just payment for our services.»`
`«*chatter*chatter*!`
` *chatter*chatter*chatter*!!»`
`«Ensign Angelo.`
` ......If the Japanese prove to be less than amicable, we need to be prepared to take extreme measures.»`
`«......And what do you mean by extreme measures, Corporal?»`
`Someone gulped.`
`A stiff tension hung over the room...`
`«The Japanese here are pushovers.`
` They're all cowards with no battle experience.»`
`«And we are elites.`
` We know the layout of almost the entire base, along with the number of Japanese troops and how they are arranged.`
` If Ensign Angelo gives the order, we should be able to subdue them quickly.»`
`«Only a few of them, Yamamoto included, look like fighters.`
` The rest are just laborers attached to the military.`
` It may look like they have the advantage of numbers, but we have the greater military force.»`
`«If we kill the Japanese, how are we going to explain it when the boat comes for us?`
` You really think that'll work?!»`
`«There should be plenty of ways, as long as the corpses aren't found.»`
`«Ensign Angelo.`
` ......It will be easy to subdue this base.`
` If we kill Yamamoto and the few strong fighters, the laborers will probably surrender easily.»`
`«Let's have them carry the gold and bury it.`
` ......Of course, we'll have to silence them afterwards.»`
`«Are you suggesting we massacre all of them......?»`
`«Let's do it.`
` If we kill them all, no one will have to know about the gold.»`
`At that moment, the door, which had supposedly been locked, opened slightly, and a metal object was thrown in.`
`{a:c:`
`{e:120:«{ruby:Grenade:Granata}!!!»}}`
`As the yell rang out, the table was kicked over to be used as a shield, and they all dropped to the floor.`
`However, in this cramped room, it probably wouldn't do them any good.`
` The Italians were all prepared for death.`
`«...............?»`
`«A dud! It's a dud!!»`
`Fortunately, the shoddy grenade was a dud.`
`The door was slammed open, and three Japanese soldiers wielding pistols jumped in.`
`"Dammit, it's a dud!!`
` Kill the Italians, kill the Italians!!"`
`«Return fire!! Fire at will!!»`
`In this small room, no matter who shot where, it was bound to hit someone.`
`The exchange of bullets instantly caused a rain of blood, with casualties on both sides.`
`The three who had jumped in were covered with bullet holes and fell over, moaning and thrashing...`
`«Gggghgggghghgh...`
`gghh...`
`.........!`
` *cough*...`
`*cough*......»`
`«Gino!! Gino!!`
` Damn, they got his lung, we can't save him!!»`
`«We should consider ourselves lucky!`
` If that grenade had gone off, we'd all be dead!»`
`The grenade was still rolling about on the floor...`
`It had been a surprise attack.`
` ......Lieutenant Yamamoto had probably judged that the negotiations would not go his way and had decided to make the first move.`
`Or else, maybe he had been planning from the beginning to put them in the position of having to take a vote...`
`in order to gather them all in one place.`
`Rokkenjima belonged to the Japanese.`
` If they killed all of the Italians, then not half, but all of the gold would go to them.`
`There was still a chance the grenade might go off late.`
`{n}The Italians rushed out into the corridor.`
`They heard gunfire from down the hallway.`
` It was coming from the direction of the submarine dock.`
` Clearly, the troops guarding the pile of gold were being attacked.`
`«Ensign Angelo!! What are your orders?!!»`
`«We have no choice!!`
` Kill the Japanese!!»`
`"L‐Lieutenant!`
` These guys are good.`
` Those Italians aren't your ordinary sailors!"`
`"Heheh, I see, they needed men good enough to guard that gold.`
` We have the numbers.`
` Keep your cool, surround them, and kill them!! Let's hunt some Italians!!"`
`As soon as I heard the sound of repeated gunfire, I knew.`
`I knew that whatever it was that had been smoldering since the time the gold was unloaded......had finally burst into flame.`
`The eyes of our soldiers when looking at the gold had not been normal.`
` Yes, those eyes had been entranced by demons.`
`The Italians had also been at breaking point due to the heavy burden they bore.`
`Who wouldn't have snapped after becoming trapped in a distant land where you can't understand the language or the writing?`
`Thinking I had to do something, I ran towards the sound of gunfire.`
`......Looking back on it, that was an extremely foolish thing to do.`
`That sound meant that there were people shooting at each other.`
` People killing each other.`
`And yet, unarmed as I was, I dashed towards the sound, as though I was trying to mediate some schoolyard fight.`
` ......It didn't take long before I learned how foolish and naive such a thing was in the heat of battle.`
`"......H‐Hiraoka?!"`
`Warrant Officer Hiraoka was lying face down, his entire body drenched in blood.`
`Judging by the trail of blood behind him, it was clear that he had somehow managed to crawl here from a different room before dying.`
`No, he was still twitching.`
` He might not be dead yet.`
`......But, on this island without a doctor—`
`no, even if we had a doctor...`
`how could anyone possibly...`
`...save a man who had been shot this many times in the chest...`
`When I looked into the room he must have crawled out of,`
` I saw two more blood‐stained Japanese corpses.`
`"Ah, aaah......aaaah......`
` Th‐......they're d......"`
`I fell backwards pathetically on my butt, my mouth hanging open in shock......`
`......Come to think of it, that was the first time I had ever faced death in my life.`
`The entire world was at war.`
` Even though millions were dying both East and West,`
` ......this was the first time I met with a person's death directly.`
`Ridiculous.`
` ......Didn't I join the army hoping to die?`
`Didn't I whine about not being sent to the front lines?`
`Yeah, so rejoice, Kinzo.`
` Isn't this the death you were looking for...?!`
`Why not spread your hands and yell out loud?`
` "Come for me, magnificent death!!"`
`Someone came running towards me.`
` It was a colleague of mine, a Japanese man. Tajima‐kun.`
`"R‐ru—ru—r—...!!"`
`He dashed towards me, pale‐faced and out of breath.`
`His face seemed horribly contorted with terror.`
` Mine probably looked the same.`
`"Tajima‐kun... Wh‐what happened......?"`
`"R‐run away...`
` W‐we'll...we'll all be killed!!"`
`Someone yelled in Italian, and at the same time, Tajima‐kun let out a scream...`
`Then, he grabbed onto me as he fell to the floor.`
`A red stain was spreading across his back before my eyes...`
`"Tajima‐ku...n......"`
`"R‐`
`......run...`
`......`
`*cough*...`
`......"`
`As he spat bubbles of blood, .........he said that one word......and died.`
`But the shocking event of seeing someone die right in front of me did not capture my attention.`
`......No living thing is concerned with the deaths of others at a fundamental level.`
` The one thing that matters is whether they themselves die or not.`
`My attention was fully occupied by the barrel of the gun the Italian soldier was pointing......`
`Tajima‐kun's back burst once more as he leaned against me.`
` Flesh tore, blood splattered.`
` The warm splash of it covered my face.`
`Was the Italian still trying to finish him off, even though he had stopped moving for good?`
`How foolish I've been......`
` Can I still not understand the scene in front of me?!`
`Rejoice, Kinzo!!`
` Now you'll finally get what you've wanted all this time...!!`
`The Italian hadn't fired to finish off Tajima‐kun.`
` He had been aiming at the man Tajima‐kun had fallen on: me, Ushiromiya Kinzo.`
`"Uu......uuu....uwaah......!!!"`
`I pushed his corpse aside, scrabbled against the floor, and dashed away, tumbling over myself.`
`My hands had pushed off against the floor hard enough to tear off the ring finger fingernail on my left hand.`
`{n}When faced with death, humans truly can resist with all they've got.`
`I tumbled over and over as I ran, scraping up parts of my body.`
` It was painful, hot.`
` But that didn't matter at all!`
`I heard the yelling in Italian come from behind me over and over again.`
` It felt like they were running, chasing after me.`
`I didn't want to look back.`
` So I kept on running and running, as though the Italians were right behind me.`
`This......is death......!!`
`{n}Didn't you want to die?`
`No, I don't want to die!!`
` Why?`
` Didn't I want to die so badly?`
`{n}But now, I know.`
`{n}I know how wonderful it is to be alive.`
`She taught me.`
` Bice did.`
`I can only be free when I talk with her.`
` No!`
`{n}By talking with her, I was finally alive for the first time.`
` I was finally born!!`
`I want to live.`
` I want to live, I want to live, I want to live!!`
` I don't want to die!`
`I want to live and see her, right now!!`
` If I don't see her, I'll die! I'll be killed!!`
`.........Stay cool, Kinzo.`
` ......She might be killed too...!`
`If you live and she dies, you might as well be dead......!!`
`Before I knew it, my face was covered in tears, snot, and drool.`
`When I stumbled over something and fell, I was finally able to come to my senses a little.`
`"..................Haah......haah...`
` .................."`
`I could still hear intermittent gunfire.`
`The gunfight was still going on.`
` And it had spread throughout the entire base.`
`......Bice.`
` ......Are you...okay......?`
`I'll find her and take her to a safe place.`
` ......The lieutenant will probably kill all of the Italians to steal the gold.`
` Bice probably won't be an exception.`
`"Bice......`
` .........Bice...!"`
`Meeting you was the first time I ever lived,`
` the first time I was ever born.`
` So if you die, I'll die again.`
`I could feel every cell in my body being reborn, not as Ushiromiya Kinzo, ......but as a completely different Kinzo.`
`......Of course, I was terrified that I might really be shot if I went back.`
`But I no longer wanted to die,`
` in the truest possible sense.`
` So, I was able to overcome my fear.`
`"......Biiiiceeeeeeee!!"`
`«Rubens!`
` What on Earth is going on?!`
` What is all this?!»`
`«There's no need for you to know.`
` Just stay hidden there.`
` Don't come out until one of your fellow countrymen calls for you!»`
`"I heard an Italian voice!!`
` He's over there!!"`
`«Goddamn Asians!!»`
`Rubens stood with Beatrice behind his back and neatly shot the two men rushing at him with two 9mm bullets from his Beretta M1934.`
`However, one of the 8mm bullets from their Type 94 semi‐auto pistols went straight into Rubens's chest.`
`All three of the shooters were struck in the chest and fell down in a heap.`
`«N‐no!!`
` Rubens!!»`
`«......Go up to the surface...`
` Hide in the forest......`
`......*cough*cough*!!`
` Ggh.....»`
`«Rubens!!!»`
`"......Heheheh. My, my.`
` Aren't we chatty?"`
`The next person to appear......was the commanding officer of the Japanese soldiers, Yamamoto.`
`The blast of three guns had just sounded.`
`Adding on Beatrice's screams, it was hardly surprising that he had noticed the encounter.`
`"If it had to come to this anyway, we should've taken this woman as a hostage in the first place.`
` Damn annoying, that's what they are!"`
`Yamamoto spat.`
` Beatrice used that moment to snatch up Rubens's gun.`
`«Aahh......!!!»`
`"Oh, picking up a gun without hesitation!`
` Italian women sure are scary!`
` Dammit, you both managed to screw up...!!"`
`He spat this last part at the two dying men who lay moaning at his feet.`
`However, it wasn't particularly surprising.`
` And this wasn't the only place it was happening.`
`Nearly everyone met head on in these tiny, cramped tunnels.`
` When both sides shot recklessly in a situation like that, the result was two corpses.`
`So the way to be fastest was to pull the trigger immediately the moment you sensed another person.`
` That was the only way to make it through this battle without ending up with a bullet in your chest.`
`Because of this, both Japanese and Italians killed each other without hesitation, and they sometimes even pulled the trigger on their own countrymen when they unexpectedly ran into each other.`
`And in the midst of all this, large numbers of Japanese men who had no idea what was going on ran towards the noise and became victims one after another.`
`It didn't matter whether the other person was holding a gun or not.`
`Everyone reflexively pulled the trigger at the sight of anyone other than themselves, trying to stay alive.`
`The slaughter engulfed the entire base......`
`There was a fierce gun battle taking place in the submarine dock.`
` And a massacre resembling a hunt was taking place inside the base.`
`Most of the non‐combatants assigned to this base were killed before they knew what was going on.`
`The Italians were indeed quite seasoned troops, but their numbers began to drop bit by bit.`
`Blood‐stained corpses lay scattered all across the base......`
`At first, it had probably been a proper gunfight.`
`However, as they gradually became desensitized,`
` it devolved into that most basic cause of wars throughout humanity, the desire to kill all foreigners you don't understand...`
`Whenever they heard words they didn't understand, they pulled the trigger.`
` By that point, the screams of foreigners sounded no different from those of man‐shaped beasts.`
` After all, they couldn't understand pleading in another language.`
`So, it had long ago turned into a mere massacre......`
`As the number of dead surpassed the number of living, ......silence began to return to the base.`
`Just when it felt as though everyone had died and the desolate sound of the wind blew through the caves,`
` there would be a sudden scream, the crisp sound of a gun, and one would remember that the massacre still wasn't over.`
`This happened...over and over again...`
`......until eventually, true silence fell.`
`......It marked the pitiful end for those led astray by gold.`
`The leader of the Italian soldiers, Angelo, had managed to survive somehow.`
`He encountered......nothing but the corpses of friend and foe.`
`All was quiet once more in the base.`
`If he was careless enough to call out, he might be shot from the shadows somewhere.`
`......So, he snuck about like a panther, breathing quietly and searching for the remaining enemies...`
`There was no sign or trace of any living person.`
`......Maybe all of the people in this base had died.`
`«......Damn Japanese......»`
`The Japanese struck first, but at that time, we were also talking about killing them.`
`They simply made the first move as military men.`
`{n}So, perhaps I should be grateful for today.`
`Even if the boat had come to take us away, there would have been no honor for us.`
`We would have been mere failures in our mission, unfit to face our dead comrades.`
`Perhaps dying here in the Far East alongside my gun......is a more fitting end for a soldier.`
`From around the corner, I noticed the sound of a leg being dragged along the ground, and I strained to hear.`
`.........Is someone seriously wounded and shuffling with a limp?`
` Noticing them before they notice me greatly helps my chances.`
`At this stage, there's no point in taking prisoners.`
`{n}We must dispose of all the Japanese.`
`I'll dash around the corner, quickly check to see who they are, ......and shoot if it's a Japanese person.`
` Nothing more.`
`I've been hiding my footsteps the whole time.`
` They probably don't know I'm here.`
`Once the shuffling footsteps had come close enough, Angelo leaned around the corner and raised his gun.`
`The voice that reached him...spoke Italian.`
`«R‐run......»`
`«......?!`
` Y‐you......!!»`
`"Heheheh, I've been looking for you, Ensign Angelo...`
` That makes all of you.`
` I've been counting Italian corpses, you see...!!"`
`«No, don't die!!`
` Ensign Angelo!»`
`Blood poured from Angelo's chest,`
` ......his gun fell to the floor,`
` then his knees,`
` and then the rest of his body crumpled...`
`...and stopped moving.`
`Yamamoto's accuracy with a gun wasn't particularly stellar.`
`However, Angelo had waited until they were fairly close before jumping out, so Yamamoto had been able to hit his target.`
`And he had managed it with a short‐barreled handgun in one hand......and a woman as a hostage in the other.`
`"Really, though, our Rokkenjima garrison was pathetic!`
` Am I the only one who's not dead?!`
` Trash, all of them!"`
`«Can't you fight without using a woman as a shield, you brute?!!`
` Let go!»`
`"Quiet!`
` Noisy, these Italian girls.`
` If you'd just be cooperative, I'd at least spare your life. Heheheh!"`
`It was such an obvious lie that even he wore a bitter smile.`
`"The Italians were spies working for the enemy, and they all died along with the garrison in a gunfight".`
`That was the story Yamamoto wanted to tell, and so he couldn't afford to have any Italian survivors.`
`At this point, he wouldn't be able to keep the entire pile of gold,`
` but he could at least grab as many ingots as he could carry.`
` Even that would be worth a huge amount of money.`
`Beatrice suddenly swung her head,`
` smashing Yamamoto's nose hard.`
`«Someone, help! Someoooooone!!!`
` ......Aaah!!»`
`"Y‐......you...bitch......`
` Ngaaah......"`
`She almost managed to escape.`
` However, Yamamoto quickly grabbed her leg and tripped her.`
`She fell onto her back, and Yamamoto mercilessly stomped his foot down on her stomach and pointed his gun at her.`
`"Heheheh, I don't make a hobby of taming tomboys...!`
` Die!!"`
`"Lieutenant Yamamoto, she had nothing to do with this!`
` Let go of her!"`
`Kinzo had jumped out from the shadows.`
`{n}He was holding a gun he had stolen from one of the corpses.`
`"Hmmm? Ushiromiya?`
` Ah, so you're alive!"`
`"Let her go! You're hurting her...!!"`
`"......It was you, wasn't it?`
` You tipped the Italians off."`
`"What are you talking about...?!"`
`Yamamoto didn't know that the grenade had been a dud.`
`The surprise attack, which he had been certain would work, had failed,`
` so he had decided that Kinzo must have tipped them off.`
`"It's your fault the surprise attack failed, and now look what's happened!`
` You turncoat...`
` I know you've been working with them through this woman!"`
`"Can't you see that you caused all this because you were blinded by gold?!"`
`"<Run, Kinzo!`
` This man has shot people begging for their lives!`
` He'll shoot you too!>"`
`"Don't talk, Italian!`
` If you open your mouth again, I won't hesitate to shoot."`
`"<I‐......it hurts......ggaahhh...>"`
`Yamamoto ground his heel into Beatrice's gut.`
`"Stop it, stop it!!`
` She has nothing to do with this!!"`
`"Oho?`
` Are you pointing a gun at a superior officer?`
` ......Stop and think a bit, fool.`
` If we agree to keep to the same story, we can have that pile of gold all to ourselves, right?`
` ......I could only grab a few for myself, but if we work together, we can sneak off with even more.`
` ......I don't mean this as your superior officer.`
` Let's split it between us as men."`
`"Haven't you already killed the last people you said you'd split the gold with?!"`
`"Tch.`
` Ushiromiya,`
` looks like you prefer lead to gold!!"`
`Without any hesitation, Yamamoto raised the barrel of his gun towards Kinzo and pulled the trigger.`
`It grazed Kinzo's right ear.`
`If Yamamoto's aim had been just a bit better, the bullet would undoubtedly have slammed into Kinzo's face.`
`"<Kinzo?!`
` H‐how could you?!!>"`
`"You.....gyah?!?!"`
`Not letting Yamamoto's momentary distraction go to waste, Beatrice lashed out and planted her right foot in Yamamoto's crotch.`
`After moaning in pain, a demonic expression flashed across Yamamoto's face, and he stomped on her chest.`
`"<Bice!!>"`
`"You biiiiitch!! Diii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}ie!!"`
`Beatrice shut her eyes tightly, hoping that she could withstand the coming pain.`
`No one would want to have their eyes open at the moment they were shot......`
`"Gy‐`
`......y...`
`you...`
`..............."`
`Thick...`
`...spurts of blood...`
`...squirted out of Yamamoto's chest.`
`"Just as you took many lives for your own sake,`
` ......I take your life...`
`...for mine."`
`Was Yamamoto able to hear the last of Kinzo's words to him?`
`In his last moments, Yamamoto seemed to grin.`
`Then, slowly, he fell over backwards,`
` ......a river of blood trailing from his body.`
`"<Kinzo!`
` Are you okay?!`
` I was sure you'd been shot...!`
` Uggh...ggh......>"`
`Beatrice tried to stand up, but then doubled over and started coughing.`
`"<Bice!`
` Are you hurt...?!>"`
`"<......My ribs are hurting.`
` That brute really was stomping them hard.>"`
`"<Will you be alright...?`
` I hope they aren't broken......>"`
`"<Italian women don't break so easily.`
` ......But...thanks.`
` I owe you my life.`
` If you hadn't come, it'd have all ended there.`
` ......Ggh......>"`
`Yamamoto had shown no mercy.`
` ......Her ribs were probably cracked.`
`......We didn't have the option of waiting, possibly for several days, for the ship that was coming.`
`I made the decision to ferry her off this island.`
`The man who kept yelling about preserving the secrecy of the base is lying there dead.`
`......The next island over, Niijima, is close.`
` A small boat should be able to take us there.`
`"<I need to take you to a hospital.`
` ......The wound might be more serious than you realize.>"`
`"<......That's interesting.`
` Never knew there was a hospital on this island.>"`
`"<There isn't.`
` I'll use a boat to take you to the next island.`
` ......I'll take you to a hospital,`
` but I need to return here and clean up the mess on this island, ......or it'll mean a court‐martial.>"`
`"<I have a request.`
` ......Please, don't take me to a hospital.>"`
`"<Why...?>"`
`"<If we go to a hospital and the embassy is contacted, I'll eventually be sent back to Italy.`
` ......If that happens, I'll be interrogated about all kinds of things.`
` I won't acknowledge those people, who let Mama die.>"`
`"<........................>"`
`"<There's no homeland for me to return to now.`
` This is the end for me.`
` So, there's nowhere I want to go anymore.`
` ......The people who were so kind to me—Ensign Angelo,`
` Rubens,`
` and everyone else,`
` ......they're all dead.>"`
`"<And because of that, you want to die here too?`
` I thought you said Italian women weren't weak.`
` Live.>"`
`"<Hey, Kinzo?`
` What does it mean...to live?`
` You're the one who taught me, aren't you?`
` Living is more than just breathing.`
` .........I don't want to go back to Italy.>"`
`"<......Bice.>"`
`"<You've said that you were dead before you met me.`
` But it's the same for me.`
` ......I died in that submarine.`
` My homeland fell, Mama died.`
` Even Papa died.>"`
`"<......I prayed that our sub would just sink to the bottom of the ocean.`
` So, when we reached this place, I was actually disappointed that we'd survived.`
` .........Then, right after that,`
` Ensign Angelo started asking whether anyone could speak English.>"`
`When Kinzo met Beatrice, he finally forgot about dying.`
`And when Beatrice met Kinzo, ......she also forgot about dying.`
`"<I...`
` ......Now that I've lost my homeland, my family, and my friends,`
` ............I wish you would whisk me away.>"`
`"<.........Bice......>"`
`"<But, ......I know that's a wish that couldn't come true.`
` ......So, at the very least,`
` ......I want to be with you until the boat comes for us.`
` I don't care about the pain in my chest.`
` After all, when the boat comes and takes me away, ......I'll die.>"`
`Beatrice spoke this, smiling softly.`
` ......She did her best to hide the pain in her chest.`
`"<Please, Kinzo.`
` ......Just for the few days until the boat comes,`
` ......steal me away.>"`
`"<.........That's a wish...`
`...I cannot grant.>"`
`Looking apologetic, Kinzo lifted Beato up and gently sat her in the boat.`
`"<......Coward.`
` ......So, Japanese men are weak after all.>"`
`"<You're right.`
` ......I am a coward.`
` So, I can only grant you half of your wish.>"`
`With a clunk, he placed the object wrapped in a jacket into the boat.`
`"<What do you mean......?>"`
`"<The part about "until the boat comes for you".`
` ......I can't make that a reality.>"`
`"<......Huh?`
` What do you mean?>"`
`"<Stealing you away.`
` ......That wish, I will make come true.>"`
`"<......K‐......Kinzo.........>"`
`There has to be a doctor on Niijima.`
`I'm wearing a Navy uniform.`
`I should be able to pass myself off as a survivor of a boat carrying a VIP that was sunk by enemy ships.`
`If the doctor happens to be of the greedy sort, all the better.`
`......After all, I have right here the golden magic to make people do what I say.`
`She came from a distant country, took my lifeless body, and gave me a soul.`
`The witch......who came bearing gold......revived me with her magic.`
`"<You...are a witch.`
` ......The Golden Witch.>"`
`"<*giggle*.`
` Yes, the Golden Witch.`
` Even though I use the same recipe as everyone else, only my alchemy can turn pasta into a smoking black heap.>"`
`"<Haha, haha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha.>"`
`"<......Just like you, I'm nothing but a corpse that's only allowed to live while you're there beside me.`
` ......If you disappear, I'll die within moments.>"`
`"<I won't let you die.>"`
`"<Really?>"`
`"<No matter what.>"`
`"<Take some responsibility.`
` .........After all, you're the one......who's spirited me away.>"`
`"......I see.`
` So, Kinzo‐san told you that much."`
`"Then, ......wait, it was you?!`
` You're the Niijima doctor that Grandfather took Beatrice to...?"`
`"Why so shocked?`
` He should've leapt to mind at the moment the words "Niijima doctor" showed up."`
`"All of a sudden, a soldier of the Navy appeared along with a foreign woman.`
` Of course, I was astounded.`
` ......What's more, he told me to treat her wounds confidentially, since their presence was a military secret."`
`"Was that the first time you met Grandfather...?"`
`"......Yes.`
` That was when we first met."`
`"So, you're the greedy doctor who followed orders for the sake of the gold?"`
`"That's a bit harsh......`
` He suddenly brought in a foreign woman patient, told me it was a military secret,`
` promised that he'd pay the medical fees later, and handed me a gold ingot as collateral.`
` I didn't want to get involved with any funny business.`
` I was reluctant to say the least."`
`"I see your point.`
` ......But in the end, you did conceal Beatrice, didn't you?"`
`"I may not be as skilled as Kinzo‐san, but I do have some familiarity with English.`
` I managed to overhear part of their conversation, and that was enough to convince me that they were not troublesome people."`
`"*cough*...`
` ......Of course, if I were to say that the ingot didn't tempt me, that would be a lie.`
` I was much younger then, you see."`
`"What happened to her next?"`
`"I treated her for some time before someone came to me on behalf of the Ushiromiya family and said that she would be moved to Odawara.`
` They took her away."`
`"So Grandfather didn't come to get her himself?"`
`"Regardless of how Kinzo explained away the incident on Rokkenjima,`
` he probably wouldn't have been able to move about freely for some time afterwards."`
`"Precisely.`
` Kinzo‐san has said that deceiving the military was the greatest challenge of his life."`
`"So, Beatrice went to Odawara, and then what...?"`
`"I have heard that she hid in one of their unused villas.`
` ......After all, Kinzo‐san already had a family at that time.`
` It must have been tricky to manage."`
`"So, Kinzo was a master of the double life before Kuwadorian even existed.`
` .........Whoosh."`
`"What are you doing...?`
` Is your butt itching?"`
`"......Tch."`
`"And later on?`
` Beatrice and Grandfather continued their happy relationship in the villa from then on...?"`
`"I have heard that it was a modest, peaceful life.`
` ......Several years later, they had a child."`
`"And so Kuwadorian's Beatrice was born."`
`"The birth...didn't go well......`
` Truly a sad tale."`
`"You don't mean...she died?!"`
`"Don't be surprised.`
` Kinzo believed his daughter was Beatrice reborn.`
` ...Don't ignore the heart. It's possible to reason it out."`
`"Y‐......you're right.`
` ......My apologies."`
`"I don't know how many years Kinzo‐san spent with her in Odawara.`
` .........However, judging by Kinzo‐san as we know him afterwards...`
` Even if it was only a few years, one can tell how deeply he loved her."`
`"...........................`
` ......I see."`
`"So then, he made Kuwadorian for his daughter......"`
`"Kinzo‐san cleverly made use of the submarine's gold to build up a fortune in a flash.`
` Then, he made use of his considerable skills in English to make connections with the GHQ, becoming immensely wealthy in a short span of time.`
` I'm sure there's no need to explain this part to you, Lion‐san."`
`"......Yes.`
` He used that vast wealth, ......bought Rokkenjima, and built the mansion.`
` The remaining relatives in Odawara scoffed at Grandfather, thinking he was crazy to buy an entire deserted island."`
`"If you could carry ten tons of gold around in your pocket, Kinzo probably wouldn't have bought Rokkenjima."`
`He hid the gold somewhere in Rokkenjima,`
` built up a fortune with the ingots he'd taken out of it, ......and then bought up the whole treasure island...`
`"Exactly.`
` .........And that started the legend of the Ushiromiya gold."`
`"......What about the mark of the One‐winged Eagle that was supposedly pressed into the ingots?"`
`"It was less a one‐winged eagle......than an eagle that appeared to have only one wing."`
`"What do you mean?"`
`"You see it often in Europe, do you not?`
` A crest or coat of arms with an eagle spreading its wings on it.`
` ......The flag of the Salò Republic also had an eagle—or was it a hawk?—`
`emblazoned on it."`
`"So, the imprint was made too lightly......or else it was poorly done."`
`"Correct.`
` .........It was a hasty, wartime stamping.`
` It was probably supposed to look like the crest of an eagle spreading its wings.`
` But half of it, cut off at a diagonal, was too faded to see."`
`"So half of the eagle spreading its wings disappeared, ......making it look like a One‐winged Eagle?"`
`"Kinzo thought the seal on the gold of Beatrice, the woman who had changed his fate, looked like a one‐winged eagle.`
` That must be why he decided to make that his own crest."`
`"......If the imprint had been made correctly, it would have been the eagle of the Salò Republic's flag,`
` ......or could it have been the two‐headed......"`
`"......No, no, that would be ridiculous.`
` At any rate, passing the night away with Kinzo‐san in front of that massive pile of gold, drinking and dreaming, was truly an enjoyable experience."`
`"However, Kinzo‐san didn't want anyone using that stamp to figure out where the gold had come from.`
` The gold he took outside was all re‐pressed with the One‐winged Eagle design he had created."`
`"And all he did was show you the gold?`
` What a cheapskate."`
`"Of course, after he became immensely rich, Kinzo‐san came to me once more and paid me in full for the overdue medical expenses.`
` The amount he came with was a bit much for medical fees.`
` Though I did make sure to give him his change."`
`"And you've been friends ever since......?"`
`"Yes.`
` Kinzo‐san was extremely grateful to me for keeping his secret and concealing Beatrice."`
`"......Grandfather always says that the old relatives in Odawara were a bunch of greedy liars.`
` ......I'm sure he appreciated your strong sense of duty, Doctor Nanjo.`
` I think I understand why a person like Grandfather came to trust you."`
`"I also had some interest in foreign countries, as well as a hobby of playing chess.`
` Kinzo‐san and I have gotten along well ever since.`
` It was a friendship that built up gradually, but grew strong before we knew it.`
` Yes, we have been friends a very long time......"`
`"People who deal with large amounts of money are quite mindful of small amounts as well.`
` ......When you refused to accept anything more than the medical fees, that must have earned you his admiration."`
`"You think too highly of me.`
` No, I was just frightened by the large quantity of money.`
` I began to regret it later, ......wahahahaha.`
` It seems I've never had real guts."`
`"No need to worry there.`
` Guts are one thing you've got no shortage of."`
`"You think so?`
` Well, I appreciate the flattery."`
`"That wasn't flattery."`
`".........?"`
`......After Kinzo dies, Nanjo is complicit in keeping his death a secret for at least a whole year.`
`Of course, Natsuhi must have given him a fairly hefty sum of hush money.`
`All the same, he's at least gutsy enough to withstand the pressure from Kinzo's children for that amount of time without slipping up once......`
`"You're plenty gutsy, if you ask me.`
` That sense of duty must be part of your character."`
`"......Hahahah.`
` Perhaps that is my only redeeming quality..."`
`"I think Grandfather was blessed with a good friend."``"......I think...`
`I now understand just how much the woman called Beatrice influenced Grandfather's life."`
`"We haven't learned anything.`
` "Who killed {f:5:Beatrice}?"`
` That's what we've got to figure out, or we'll never be able to get out of here."`
`"......You're right.`
` We need to finish this quickly.`
` The funeral is already over, after all."`
`"...........................`
` You've got it all wrong.`
` ......This {i:is}...`
`...the funeral."`
`"You mean, what she's making us do...?"`
`"None of the Beatrices we've heard about so far were {i:killed}.`
` ......We need to change that.`
` That's the real funeral, as far as {f:5:Bernkastel}'s concerned."`
`"............No one knows about the "killed" factor.`
` And that's the truth we're trying to expose?"`
`"Hmm, ......you are perceptive.`
` It hardly feels like I'm talking to a piece from the lower plane.`
` It must be because you were given to me as my Watson.`
` ............Ouch!"`
`"Don't call your partner a piece.`
` ......So, what next,`
` Willard Holmes?"`
`"The basis of investigation is asking questions.`
` There's still a {f:5:Beatrice} we need to ask about."`
`To indicate who they should talk to next, Will nodded in the direction of George, Jessica, and Maria.`
`Maria seemed to be lecturing the others about something.`
`"Wow.`
` {f:5:Beatrice} sounds pretty incredible."`
`"Yeah!`
` And then, inside the upside‐down cup,`
` she made tons of candies appear out of nowhere!"`
`"Inside the overturned cup?`
` That's wild.`
` Sounds like magic to me."`
`"......Maria‐chan really does love witches and magic."`
`"Can't pass up the chance to talk to the authority on witches, can we?"`
`If looking for someone to ask about {f:5:Beatrice}, Maria would rise to the top of the list.`
`The {f:5:Beatrice} she spoke of wasn't the real Beatrice spoken of by Kinzo and the others.`
`However, on the Rokkenjima of 1986, the being that the name {f:5:Beatrice} referred to was probably the {f:5:Beatrice} that Maria always talked about.`
`".........I don't see Battler anywhere."`
`Ushiromiya Battler.`
` ......The one who was made to fight as {f:5:Beatrice}'s opponent in many games, and the most important person in this game and this tale.`
`A Battler in this world would probably be the piece version, but even so, it should be possible to get some vital information out of him.`
`......Will probably wanted to talk with Battler too, but he was nowhere to be seen in the cousins' group.`
`"Battler‐kun isn't present at the funeral today.`
` It's a shame, seeing as he's the cousin closest in age to me."`
`"Are you two on good terms?"`
`"Yes, of course."`
`".........And you pinch his butt every time he says something perverted."`
`"Oh, how did you know?`
` Did your detective instincts tell you that?"`
`"Poor guy."`
`......{f:5:Bernkastel} said that everything was gathered here.`
`Since Battler isn't here, that probably means it's possible to find out everything without asking for his side of the story.`
`Or, maybe she's intentionally hiding the core elements and making us take the long way around, as part of some fickle witch's game.`
`"Since he isn't here, ......that probably means there's no need to hear his story for the time being.`
` ......Let's talk to Maria and the others.`
` ......I won't say anything perverted, so keep your hands off my ass."`
`"Then why not try choosing your words a bit more carefully?"`
`With a roguish smile, Lion pinched the air, index finger against middle.`
`"Ah, it's the {i:future heir}.`
` Are you done babysitting the old geezer?`
` .........Gyaah!"`
`At least Lion is impartial.`
` No mercy, even for Jessica.`
` Will felt a bit gratified.`
`"......I see.`
` Since you're both the successor and Krauss's child, ......that makes Jessica your little sister."`
`He was so used to Jessica being an only child that, though the scuffle between the two looked perfectly natural,`
` something didn't feel quite right about it.`
`"Jessica.`
` Can't you talk a bit more like a little sister's supposed to?`
` And while we're at it, why not try talking more like a girl your age.`
` Also, how many times do I have to tell you to stop calling me "future heir"?"`
`"C‐cram it!`
` I'll live the way I want to!`
` I'd suffocate if I had to act all refined like you, {i:future heir}...!"`
`"Yeek!`
` Ouch!`
` Owowowowow!!`
` Stop it, don't pinch me!`
` This is sister bullying—`
`pervert—`
`stop it—`
`owow!"`
`"Jessica!`
` Why are you talking like that in front of a guest...?!`
` Do you want me to get Mother involved again?!"`
`".........Looks like those two are close, in their own special way."`
`"Well, Lion is a person of impeccable character, perfectly suited to being the next head.`
` ......I guess I understand how Jessica‐chan feels... Lion might be a bit {i:too} perfect sometimes."`
`"She gets compared to Lion no matter what she does.`
` So you think that made her rebel?"`
`"If Jessica‐chan had been born an only child, I'm sure she'd have become a composed, quiet young lady.`
` ......Ahaha, that's an interesting thought."`
`"Don't worry.`
` Only child or not, her personality wouldn't change a bit."`
`"George onii‐chan,`
` ......who's this?"`
`"This is the first time I've met you, correct?`
` But it sounds as though you know a lot about our family.`
` I'm George,`
` and this here is Maria.`
` Pleased to meet you."`
`"Call me Will.`
` I'm investigating {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` I want you to tell me what you know."`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}?! Uu!!`
` See?!`
` {f:5:Beatrice} exists!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`Though Maria had looked hostile towards this unfamiliar man,`
` as soon as she heard the name of the witch she loved pass his lips, her eyes began to sparkle.`
`"Hey, Maria‐chan.`
` You've got to greet our guest properly."`
`"Hello!`
` My name is Ushiromiya Maria, uu!`
` I'm glad to meet someone who knows {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` Handshake, uu!"`
`"Nn."`
`Maria suddenly stuck out her small hand, and Will reached out for it reflexively.`
`As soon as he did, ......he felt a bright light seeping out from the gap between their hands.`
`The theatergoing power that {f:5:Bernkastel} had given him had affected Maria.`
`"{f:5:Beatrice} is the witch of Rokkenjima...!`
` She plays with me every time I come to Rokkenjima!`
` She's my best friend, and a fellow member of Mariage Sorcière! Uu!!"`
`The light grew brighter and brighter......`
`This time, he could feel himself being drawn into Maria's world...`
`I'm Ushiromiya Maria.`
` My mama is Rosa.`
` My papa......... I don't have a papa.`
`I think I remember Mama showing me a picture long ago and saying "this is your papa".`
`It was a picture of a man with a dark suntan, on a beach, wearing a swimsuit.`
`......Later on, when I learned what "Papa" meant,`
` I asked Mama to show me that picture again, but she said there wasn't any photo like that.`
`But there was.`
` I drew a picture of it and showed it to Mama.`
` When I did, she got really mad and said that photo didn't exist, or that, if it did, she had already thrown it away.`
`Ever since then,`
` ......she kept saying that I didn't have a papa.`
`"......Did you know?`
` People say you need a papa and a mama to have a baby, but that's a lie."`
`"The virgin birth..."`
`"‘Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son,`
` and they shall call his name Emmanuel.’`
` ......If I was a boy, that might have been my name."`
`"Book of Matthew, chapter 1, verse 20."`
`"No, verse 23.`
` Verse 20 is "But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream,`
` saying, Joseph, thou son of David,`
` fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife:`
` for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.""`
`"......So you think your father is the Holy Ghost."`
`"Everyone said that everyone has a papa.`
` They said it was strange to not have a papa, that I was weird, that they felt sorry for me."`
`"But when I asked Mama, she said I didn't have a papa, that he didn't exist.`
` She got mad and hit me even though all I did was ask.`
` So......I didn't really understand who gave birth to me."`
`"......I was...not right as a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}, an immature and irregular creature.`
` I realized I was a strange, pitiful girl, different from everyone else."`
`"It doesn't matter who your parents are or what other people say.`
` You are who you are."`
`"It must have been hard to teach that to a young, immature girl.`
` My kindergarten teacher might have said that to me when I cried after being bullied.`
` ......But even those words of encouragement couldn't fill the blank space...`
`...no, the questions.`
` Nothing anyone said could answer the questions in my mind."`
`"And the Book is what gave you the answers?"`
`"A priest came to see us."`
`I think his sermon was part of a class to enrich our minds.`
`To most of us kids, it was no different from an ordinary fairy tale a teacher could have told us.`
` ......No, it was harder to understand, and I think that made us bored.`
`Then, at the end, the priest said something important.`
`"That God knows everything?"`
`"Yep.`
` So I asked him.`
` ......I only have a mama.`
` I don't have a papa.`
` Mama gave birth to me without a papa.`
` Is that strange and sad? ...I asked."`
`The priest taught me.`
`{n}He said there was nothing strange about a child having no papa.`
`After all, Jesus Christ was born of a virgin.`
`And the one who gave birth to him...`
`was the Blessed Virgin...{i:Maria}...?`
`I was surprised!`
`Maria, the name I was given, was the answer all along.`
`"I was so surprised, I asked the priest to say it again.`
` ......He said that the Virgin Maria gave birth to a baby by herself!`
` So, I asked him if that meant I could give birth to a baby all by myself too."`
`"And how'd he answer that?"`
`"He said the Virgin Maria was with child because of the Holy Ghost.`
` Book of Matthew, chapter 1, verse 20, last part.`
` "For that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost".`
` ......That surprised me again!`
` What do you think that means?!"`
`"......You interpreted this to mean that...`
`Ushiromiya Maria had no {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} father.`
` ......That your real father was the Holy Ghost."`
`Regardless of what the Bible actually meant,`
` ......the young, sad girl, who had lost her sense of identity because of her lack of a father,`
` had finally created a way to understand herself.`
`"Once I realized that, I knew why I was different from all the other kids!`
` The ones who made fun of me were all children of Joseph.`
` But I alone was different!`
` I wasn't worse than everyone else...!`
` I was a child of God, a child of the Holy Ghost!!`
` When I got back, I told Mama.`
` I had no papa after all.`
` Mama gave birth to me all on her own thanks to the power of God."`
`It was probably painful for Rosa whenever Maria asked about her father.`
`"Why do I have no papa, when everyone else has a papa and a mama?"`
`Every time she was asked this, Rosa flew into a rage and changed the subject.`
`......And now, somehow or other, Maria had independently found an explanation that satisfied her.`
`She had no papa;`
` she was the child of Mama and God.`
`It isn't too difficult to imagine that Rosa, after hearing the explanation the young girl had found in the Bible, might have gone along with it as though it were true......`
`"Beato said that the minimum number of people needed to create a world was two.`
` I thought she meant that you need two parents to create a child.`
` ......That was when I came to a new thought.`
` Beato may be a witch, but she's a witch born of a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.`
` Beato isn't a child of the Holy Ghost."`
`"But I'm different.`
` I was born from Mama alone.`
` I was born of the Holy Ghost!`
` .........Beato can't create a universe without me.`
` But I have...`
`‘{i:God with us}.’`
` I can make a universe all by myself, along with the Holy Ghost!"`
`"Beato called me the Witch of Origins.`
` And she also said that eventually, I might become a Creator, who can create anything alone.`
` All by myself, I can create something out of nothing!`
` Beato can take that and make it expand infinitely!`
` Ange was the witches' apostle, who would spread the word far and wide!"`
`"And that was Mariage Sorcière."`
`"There's a huge difference between one and infinity.`
` That's why Beato is so great.`
` But compared to the difference between something and nothing, one and infinity are both just "something".`
` I'm the child destined to become the best witch—no!`
` The greatest Creator in the world...!"`
`"Mariage Sorcière was the nest to warm up my egg!`
` I am Ushiromiya Maria!!`
` Maria, who stands by God's side!!"`
`......If we liken Maria's sense of identity to a universe,`
` ......then this endless stream of words coming from her might be like the Big Bang.`
`She spent so long tormented over how to interpret her lack of a father.`
` ......Then, by chance, she saw a line in the Bible that seemed to affirm her existence, and she finally formed an understanding of herself.`
`The sad girl, who had hated herself for being different from all of her classmates, finally found her own meaning.`
`At that moment, Maria's universe, which had once been nothingness, was born as a clump of ultra‐hot, ultra‐high‐pressured energy.`
`.........Then, later on, she went to Rokkenjima, met the Endless Witch who called herself {f:5:Beatrice},`
` ......and the clump of energy exploded in a Big Bang, giving birth to their joint system of magic.`
`......That was the universe known as Mariage Sorcière.`
`"...........................`
` ......We're jumping ahead a bit too fast.`
` Let's take things one at a time."`
`"Sure.`
` Where do you want to start?"`
`"After you decided that you were the child of the Holy Ghost, it's easy to imagine that you gradually became more and more interested in the occult.`
` .........And then what?`
` Once you reached that state, where did you meet {f:5:Beatrice}, and how did the two of you interact?"`
`"It really did happen all of a sudden, one day.`
` .........I had wanted to meet the witch called {f:5:Beatrice}, who lived on Rokkenjima.`
` As a fellow witch."`
`"At that time, you already thought that you were a witch?"`
`"I did.`
` I already knew more about the Bible and the occult than most adults.`
` So, even though I couldn't use magic, I believed that I was a witch.`
` ......Kihihi, it's a bit funny, isn't it?`
` That's why I'm only a witch apprentice."`
`"When did you meet {f:5:Beatrice}?"`
`"I don't really remember when.`
` But I do remember what it was like.`
` It was really, really sudden."`
`"............Huh?"`
`"So, you are.........Ushiromiya Maria, I presume?"`
`It was such a very, very...`
`...abrupt encounter.`
`I had just been drinking some milk tea, all alone in the rose garden arbor.`
` Mama said that she had to talk about something important with Uncle Krauss,`
` ......so she told me to go outside and play.`
`Suddenly, ......she was sitting right there.`
`{n}I didn't know anyone who spoke that way.`
`I quickly realized that she was someone I didn't know at all......`
`"......Who...are you?"`
`"You were the one who first said that you wished to see me.`
` Here I am, welcoming the witch who came to visit my island, and yet you ask my name?`
` *cackle*cackle*."`
`"..................`
` {f:5:Beat}...`
`...{f:5:rice}...`
`...?"`
`"Precisely.`
` I am {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"Yeah, that is pretty sudden."`
`"Yep. Really, really sudden.`
` .........Witches and spirits always exist right beside us.`
` They just choose not to show themselves.`
` And, when they do show themselves, ......it's always sudden, as though they've been there the whole time.`
` ......That's what I learned that day."`
`"And then, you and {f:5:Beatrice} became friends?"`
`"Yeah.`
` She stayed and chatted with me the whole time, until Mama was done with her business.`
` We talked about magic...and witches.`
` And about how I was a child of the Holy Ghost."`
`"......And what was your impression of {f:5:Beatrice} then?"`
`"I don't like saying it,`
` but I knew more than she did back then.`
` At first, I thought she wasn't a very good witch."`
`"......Well, that was just my conceit.`
` There are many different systems of magic.`
` Also, mine was based on self‐study.`
` I probably only viewed Beato that way because her system of magic was different from mine.`
` It wasn't long before I came to regret that and apologized."`
`"Apologized?`
` .........Did {f:5:Beatrice} do something to win your respect?`
` .........I see.`
` So, she showed you magic."`
`We moved to the beach and talked lots, sitting at a table under an umbrella.`
`"Very interesting.`
` ......Maria.`
` I see you have been quite diligent in your studies.`
` At your age, to be capable of teaching a thousand year old witch such as myself is truly an accomplishment worthy of admiration.`
` .........And what sort of magic can you use?"`
`"......Magic?"`
`"If you call yourself a witch, you must be able to show me some sort of magic, correct?"`
`I was stunned for a second.`
`{n}Of course, it should have been obvious.`
`I was a child of the Holy Ghost, and since I'd studied so much of the occult, I was also a witch, not a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.`
` Until that day, I had been so sure of both of those things.`
`So, when I was asked what sort of magic I could use, it left me in a daze...`
`"When one knows of magic and can speak of it, they finally reach the rank of apprentice.`
` ......One is only a witch if they can put such knowledge into practice and use magic, correct?"`
`"......So, .........I'm not a witch yet......?"`
`"You have studied well.`
` And I can sense a very rare talent within you.`
` One day, you may become a witch so great that even I could not compare,`
` ......or perhaps even a Creator as you have told me.`
` However, you are still young and immature.`
` .........You are...yes.`
` You are an apprentice.`
` A witch apprentice, you might call it."`
`"So, does that mean you can use magic, Beato?"`
`"Of course.`
` I could not call myself a witch otherwise."`
`"Incredible......`
` ......Show me!`
` I wanna see your magic!!"`
`Until this day, Maria had never doubted the magic‐related concept that she was the child of the Holy Ghost.`
`......However, no one had ever proven to her that occult phenomena actually existed.`
`Maria could create a universe all by herself.`
` ......However, she wanted to share it with a second person, so that she could believe in it even more strongly.`
`"In the past, I could have drawn a rainbow in the sky,`
` transformed it into seven colors of candy, and eaten them at my leisure.`
` However, my power has weakened so much that I cannot even preserve my form as well as I would like."`
`"I just heard about that.`
` You can't use your full power because of the shrine."`
`"It will take quite some time before my power returns.`
` At this moment, I cannot turn rainbows to candy.`
` ......However, perhaps I can show you a bit of that power with some simpler magic."`
`"I wanna see...!`
` I wanna see your magic...!!"`
`"Very well.`
` However, I must ask you for your assistance.`
` As I have already told you,`
` no matter how pure your soul might be, all {y:0:Humans}{n:0:humans} are tainted and filled with the toxin that resists magic."`
`"Yeah, I remember.`
` You told me about the anti‐magic toxin.`
` It wasn't in any of the books I've read.`
` You must really be incredible to know so much."`
`{f:5:Beatrice} lifted up an empty teacup,`
` then turned it around in front of Maria to show that there weren't any tricks or strings.`
`"Right, the magic to make candy appear inside an overturned cup."`
`"How did you know?!`
` You're incredible, Will! You even know about witch magic!"`
`"............That's because......it's one of the most basic types of magic a witch can use."`
`"It was just a normal cup, without any tricks in it.`
` I wanted to see. I wanted to see true magic."`
`Maria had a desire.`
`She had a desire to discover the occult in others......to help her believe that there was an occult side to herself.`
`That was why she agreed to help {f:5:Beatrice} with her magic.`
`She didn't want her own toxin to ruin her chance of knowing the miracles of magic.`
`"Good.`
` ......Now, try looking inside that cup."`
`"............Ah.`
` ......There's candy.`
` ......There's candy...!!"`
`"As a gift to mark my meeting with a new witch, and as a sign of our friendship, I offer this to you."`
`This...was a true miracle of magic.`
`{n}For the first time, I felt shame and embarrassment at my conceit.`
`I could feel that sense of omnipotence disappear,`
` the idea that I was the child of the Holy Ghost and the most important and special person in the world.`
`......Instead of a child of the Holy Ghost who can't do anything,`
` I'd rather be a witch who can use magic...!`
`I, Ushiromiya Maria, wanted to become a witch...!!`
`{n}Starting off as a witch apprentice!!`
`Already, I was obsessed with Beato.`
`"I want to become a real witch too!`
` I want to be your disciple!!"`
`"How modest.`
` You already have an abundance of talent and diligence.`
` Also, though it may have been different when I was at my full power, I cannot take on a disciple in my current state."`
`"......So I can't become a witch's disciple......?"`
`"Mm.`
` You cannot become my disciple.`
` ......However, you can become my friend."`
`"Really...?!"`
`"Yes.`
` From this point forth, we shall be friends.`
` Let us continue to talk of the deep and profound world of witches."`
`"Uu!!!`
` Thank you, Beato!!`
` Can I eat this candy?!"`
`"No, let that be a souvenir.`
` Instead of eating it, keep it in that lovely bag of yours."`
`"Right.`
` I'll eat it at home...!!`
` Uu, uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`"Maria.`
` That candy was brought into being by magic.`
` Therefore, it is fragile.`
` If you deny my existence with that toxin of yours, it will melt and fade away."`
`"Uu......`
` No.`
` I don't want your precious magic to disappear."`
`"Then be sure that you do not forget your meeting with me.`
` ......And if you will keep some simple promises to me,`
` I will greet you the next time you come to this island."`
`"Uu! I'll keep them.`
` What are the promises?!"`
`"Well, to start...`
` Each time you arrive home, wash your hands.`
` Then, rinse out your mouth.`
` You must not complain about this, for it is an important part of a witch apprentice's training."`
`"I'll do it!`
` Every day, when I come home, I'll wash my hands!`
` I'll rinse out my mouth!`
` If I do that, will I see you again?!"`
`"I promise it.`
` If you keep your end of the promise,`
` your body will be cleansed, and I will regain even more of my magical power.`
` ......Then, the next time you come, I will show you magic of even greater splendor."`
`"Uu!`
` I'll keep my promise! No matter what!!`
` I'll do it!`
` I'll become your friend and a witch apprentice!"`
`"Your resolve is heartening, Ushiromiya Maria.`
` I hope that you will quickly grow to become a full witch and my close friend."`
`"I think that was the first time I met {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"And was that candy still there when you got home...?"`
`"Yep.`
` ......But I doubted a little, so it was half‐melted.`
` I regretted almost doubting her."`
`"If I had doubted her more, I'm sure the candy would have been completely gone.`
` I almost lost the proof of the magical miracle that had happened before my eyes."`
`"A hard piece of candy melted?"`
`"It wasn't hard, it was......caramel, I think.`
` It was half‐melted and squishy."`
`"About what time of the year did this happen?"`
`"I'm not too sure.`
` But I remember that the milk tea had ice in it.`
` ......Why does that matter?"`
`"Never mind.`
` ......Did you tell Rosa about your meeting with {f:5:Beatrice}?"`
`"Yep.`
` I told everyone about it at dinner that day.`
` Uncle Krauss laughed at me.`
` Then, Mama, who was sitting next to me, got mad and told me to stop talking about it.`
` ...Uu."`
`"Next to you...?`
` By your family's ranking system, your seat shouldn't be next to Rosa's."`
`"It wasn't a family conference.`
` It was when just Mama and I came to visit.`
` So, there was only Uncle Krauss's family, Mama, and me.`
` And we didn't leave gaps, so we weren't sitting in the same spots as a family conference."`
`"...........................`
` .........And Rosa was sitting in the seat next to you?"`
`"Yeah.`
` ......Why does that matter?"`
`".........It doesn't.`
` ......Have you ever met with {f:5:Beatrice} outside Rokkenjima?"`
`"No.`
` After all, Beato's body is fragile, so she can't go wherever she wants.`
` I told her she could just possess me if she wanted,`
` but she said that she couldn't leave the island."`
`"And after that, you met her every time you came to Rokkenjima."`
`"Yeah.`
` We became really good friends.`
` The more I talked to Beato, the more I realized what an amazing witch she was.`
` She showed me wonderful magic every time I saw her.`
` Then, she told me about a system of magic that was different from mine, and we both talked together about the mysteries of magic."`
`"I wanted to reach her level as soon as I could.`
` I wanted to become the kind of witch Beato was."`
`"Did you ever introduce {f:5:Beatrice} to your mother?"`
`"Nope.`
` She said Mama's toxin was too strong, so they couldn't meet each other yet.`
` ......Almost all adults are no good when it comes to the toxin.`
` They're all tainted.`
` Kihihihihi."`
`"Was anyone other than you able to see {f:5:Beatrice}?"`
`"They couldn't at first.`
` She said her magical power was weak, so her body would crumble if even a little bit of the toxin reached her.`
` ......But she gathered magical power bit by bit, and eventually, she could appear in front of other people who had small amounts of toxin."`
`"And who was that?"`
`"Hmmmmmmm......`
` ......There weren't many of them.`
` Just a few of the servants."`
`"Specifically?"`
`"All of the servants here today.`
` ......Uu?`
` But not Gohda‐san, I think."`
`"So, there were four of them: Genji, Shannon, Kanon, and Kumasawa."`
`"And Doctor Nanjo too."`
`Apparently, they would sometimes come to visit Maria and {f:5:Beatrice}'s witch tea parties.`
`Of course, it was only for small things, like bringing them extra tea.`
`However, they were certainly aware of {f:5:Beatrice}, and even talked with her.`
`"......How did the servants react to {f:5:Beatrice}?`
` She was a guest who shouldn't have existed.`
` Weren't they surprised?"`
`"No...`
` After all, {f:5:Beatrice} is the other master of the mansion."`
`She said that the servants treated {f:5:Beatrice} as an honored guest.`
`And, sometimes, they were permitted to witness the new miracle of magic along with Maria.`
`"So, on the Rokkenjima of 1986, the ones who could actually meet with {f:5:Beatrice} were...`
`you, Nanjo, and the four servants excluding Gohda, for a total of six?"`
`"Yeah.`
` Beato said that she'd need to store up much more magical power before she could appear in front of anyone else."`
`"So, she intended to show herself in front of more people sometime in the future?"`
`"Yep.`
` She said that the day she made all of the {y:0:Humans}{n:0:humans} acknowledge her would be the day of her resurrection."`
`"...................................."`
`Maria, the servants, and Nanjo had acknowledged her.`
`She had probably chosen those {y:0:Humans}{n:0:humans} whose anti‐magic toxin was weakest and appeared before them first.`
`{f:5:Beatrice}'s game must have been to steadily increase the number of {y:0:Humans}{n:0:humans} who could recognize her,`
` until she could make everyone on the island acknowledge her.`
`In that case, the last person for {f:5:Beatrice} to appear in front of...`
`would be Battler, the one said to have the strongest anti‐magical power.`
`......Does this mean {f:5:Beatrice} thought that Battler would be the hardest one to convince......?`
`It seems true that Battler was one of {f:5:Beatrice}'s goals.`
`......However, if we go with Battler's chessboard thinking...`
`...we might say that {f:5:Beatrice}, who wanted others to acknowledge her existence, was someone who could not exist {i:unless} she was acknowledged.`
`Battler reached this thought himself back in the first game.`
`Yes, there is something different about the {f:5:Beatrice} of 1986.`
`She's different from the Italian Beatrice or the Kuwadorian Beatrice, both of whom certainly did exist.`
`The {f:5:Beatrice} of 1986, the one whom we are so familiar with in a mysterious way, yet who has no existence.`
`What does it mean to "kill" the {f:5:Beatrice} who has no existence?`
`......The minimum number of people required to create a universe is two.`
`However, Maria had said that even a single person could give birth to a universe.`
`And yet, Maria had desired a second person.`
` A second person to nurture the world she had given birth to alone.`
`Because if it was born and not nurtured, it would die and disappear?`
`.........Let's replace the word "universe" with "{f:5:Beatrice}".`
`The minimum number of people required to create {f:5:Beatrice} is two.`
`However, even a single person could give birth to her.`
`And yet, that single person desired a second person.`
` A second person to acknowledge the {f:5:Beatrice} created by the first person.`
`That meeting with a second person is the scene that Maria has just described.`
`The single person who created {f:5:Beatrice} had looked for a second person to acknowledge {f:5:Beatrice}...`
`and selected Maria.`
`We don't need Furudo Erika's heartless reasoning to know that the tea cup magic was a sleight of hand.`
`Maria, believing in the story about the anti‐magic toxin, would close her eyes whenever magic happened.`
`Any sleight of hand would be possible while she had her eyes closed.`
`......The caramel Maria had been given as proof of her meeting with a witch had melted a little because Maria had doubted.`
`In a season where one was likely to put ice in their tea, it was only natural for a caramel left in a bag to melt.`
`Ushiromiya Maria, the girl who's too trusting and will accept a story easily.`
`{f:5:Beatrice} appeared first in front of this girl, who had, in the language of witches,`
` very little of the anti‐magic toxin......`
`If we liken the creation of {f:5:Beatrice} to the laying of an egg,`
` then when a single person creates her, it is no more than a delusion.`
` Like a chick inside the egg.`
`If, and only if, a second person acknowledges her, the shell cracks, and she appears.`
`{n}She only appears when a second person comes to warm the egg.`
`When Maria acknowledged {f:5:Beatrice}, she finally hatched, and the chick was born.`
`In that case, Mariage Sorcière, which nurtured {f:5:Beatrice} and her system of magic, was like a nest.`
`{f:5:Beatrice} had a dignified presence, called herself the witch of Rokkenjima, and claimed to have lived a thousand years.`
`......Thinking about the {f:5:Beatrice}s who appeared in the previous game, this sounds less like the chick Beato, and more like Beato the Elder.`
`So, does this mean that the meeting Maria has just spoken of marks the birth of Beato the Elder...?`
`The egg itself had already been created by "the first person".`
`During the time before the meeting with Maria, it matured fully inside its shell, becoming the "character" with the dignified presence of a thousand years.`
`Then, when Maria acknowledged it, it hatched,`
` .........and the witch of Rokkenjima finally gained a form.`
`Perhaps, ......that moment marks the birth of the {f:5:Beatrice} of 1986.`
`......The younger, chick Beato was born out of love for Battler.`
`Since that birth has not yet occurred at this point in time,`
` then the birth of Beato the Elder and the existence of {f:5:Beatrice} at this time must have nothing to do with Battler.`
`..............................`
`Are you enjoying this reasoning,`
` {f:5:Bernkastel}......?`
`If you are, let's at least have some applause from the audience.`
`............Great, thanks a bunch.`
`"I have a lot of things I want to ask Beato to grant for me with magic.`
` So, I'm helping Beato with her resurrection."`
`"......What kinds of things?"`
`"Lots and lots.`
` Kihihihihihi. Not telling."`
`"You want to protect your mama from the black witch, right?"`
`"How do you know so much?`
` You're incredible. Uu!"`
`"......And your happy world will never return without a witch's help...`
` That's what you...think now?"`
`"Yep.`
` I love Mama.`
` She's so nice.`
` I want to be with her forever.`
` For all eternity."`
`"...........................`
` ......Now I'd like to hear about Mariage Sorcière."`
`"................................."`
`"...............`
` ......What's wrong?"`
`"Don't wanna."`
`"............Huh?"`
`"I'm thirsty, so I'm gonna go get something to drink.`
` See you later."`
`Maria suddenly started acting distant, bowed her head, and left without waiting for a reply.`
`......It was a very un‐Maria‐like thing to do.`
`"................................."`
`I see.`
` So, the Game Master has moved the piece.`
`......Apparently, she's telling me to ask about something different for now.`
`At some point, Lion had started chatting with the other family members.`
`Jessica seemed to be getting irritated at having her butt pinched so much, and George was trying to calm her down.`
`......Jessica and George.`
` Guess I'll hear their stories next.`
`Compared to Maria, the anti‐magic toxin is very strong in these two.`
`At least at the beginning of the other games, they didn't acknowledge {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`Maria showed me the point of view of one who believes.`
`{n}Now to hear from those who don't.``"So...heheh...about earlier,`
` sorry you had to see me acting like that... I blame the {i:future heir}......"`
`"It's not going to leave a mark, is it?`
` Talk about merciless."`
`".........Did you say something, Jessica?"`
`"O‐of course not...!`
` I've already, uh, learned my lesson, okay?!"`
`Lion, who had apparently been chatting with the adult siblings, spun around with a smile and stared at Jessica.`
` ......Looks like the older sibling's firmly in control around here.`
`"......Those are some sharp ears.`
` I think I finally get this Lion person."`
`"Yeah, yeah, yeah!`
` The future heir's always been annoyingly sharp!`
` Not to mention the favorite of all the adults!`
` I'm always compared against this kid, at home and at school!"`
`"Come to think of it, Lion was the student council president for both middle school and high school.`
` And the head of the badminton team too."`
`"So everywhere you go, you get compared to Lion, and it doesn't work out too well for you."`
`"I said it as soon as I got into middle school.`
` The future heir was already the vice‐president of the student council.`
` I said "if you're planning to become council president next year, that'll just put more pressure on me, so stop it!""`
`"But the next year rolls around, and guess who signs up as a candidate and wins in a landslide?!`
` Same thing happened when I started high school!`
` I said "please, just give it a rest this time", but by that point, the future heir was {i:already} the vice‐president!`
` Then, senior year? Immediately president of the student council!"`
`"Dad was oh so proud!`
` Mom kept saying "now you make sure you do your best as the little sister", over and over and over again!!`
` Nngyaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}ahhhh!"`
`"But even so, you're still proud to be Lion's little sister, aren't you?"`
`"I‐i‐it's not like I ever thought about that!`
` Nope, never! Not even once...!"`
`"It can be tough to be compared against perfection.`
` Still, other people are other people, and you are you.`
` There's no need to feel dwarfed.`
` You should live the way you want to with all you've got."`
`"Of course!`
` But Mom and the others are always going on about how I need to follow in the footsteps of Ushiromiya Lion as the younger sibling.`
` ......They keep telling me to go join the student council, go play badminton......"`
`"Don't you play in a band?"`
`"Wh‐......wha?!`
` Sh‐shhhhhhh!`
` That's a secret! No one knows...!"`
`Apparently, she's keeping it a secret from her family.`
`Interesting.`
` ......People often like to blame their family for what they've grown up to be like,`
` but even in a different world with a different family, the interests of the girl called Jessica are the same as ever.`
`It's admirable that she has such a true and constant interest in something.`
`"I love that kind of stuff.`
` "Pettan, pettan".`
` "Sweets, sweets"."`
`"Wah, wah, wah!!`
` Shh, shh, shh!!"`
`Nothing wrong with the extraordinarily accomplished sort, like Lion, but kids who act their age do have their charms.`
`"That's the best way to go through life.`
` Enjoy your youth to the fullest."`
`"W‐well, uh......thanks."`
`Apparently, no one had ever told Jessica that they approved of how she lived,`
` and the direct way Will had put it made her turn red and hang her head in embarrassment.`
`"I want to ask you two now."`
`"The same thing you just asked Maria‐chan?"`
`"Yeah.`
` Please tell me everything you know about {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"......Well, you can see how much Maria‐chan likes witches and the occult.`
` For her, {f:5:Beatrice} is a symbol to be admired, like an anime heroine.`
` She believes every little thing is some sort of prank caused by a witch's magic."`
`"You are an adult.`
` And the fact that you never say this to Maria is also very adult of you."`
`"Of course.`
` Childhood dreams only happen when you're a kid.`
` I think respecting that precious experience is an adult's responsibility."`
`"Looks like the two of us will get along well."`
`George's position was that {f:5:Beatrice} was nothing more than a fairy tale.`
`However, that phrase—“respecting a child's dreams is the adult thing to do”—that might be worthy of further scrutiny.`
`When she got a candy from {f:5:Beatrice} by magic, Maria probably got excited and told George and the others.`
`Then, the adults followed his lead and positively went along with her story "as adults should".`
`However, there could be other ways this sort of reaction could occur, other than as an adult's response to a child's claims.`
`For example, it could be an inferior's response to the claims of their superior.`
`......If Kinzo, tyrant of the Ushiromiya family, claimed that {f:5:Beatrice} existed and had revived,`
` perhaps the other members of the family would positively go along with his story "as his inferiors should".`
`Though {f:5:Beatrice} only appeared directly in front of a limited number of people,`
`......it's probably safe to say that the concept of her existence penetrated deeply within the Ushiromiya family, even among those who had never seen her.`
`However, no matter how deeply that concept penetrated, she was only viewed as a sort of fairy tale character.`
`It would be necessary to transform the concept of that character from an imaginary fairy tale into reality.`
`So, a person attempting to do this would need to perform something that could only conceivably be done by magic.`
`And that something......was the series of witch incidents that started with the nighttime window‐opening pranks played by Beato the Elder...`
`...and ultimately escalated to locked‐room murders.`
`......Beato the Elder referred to this, saying that the anti‐magic power filling the mansion would be weakened bit by bit the more she made her existence known.`
`{f:5:Beatrice}.`
`Why did you desire so greatly to make all others accept your existence?`
`Because the imaginary becomes the truth if everyone accepts it?`
`Because at that moment, the being called {f:5:Beatrice} will be acknowledged and will become {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}?`
`In that case, before {f:5:Beatrice} is acknowledged by all people, she's less than {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.`
` She's furniture.`
`Why would furniture want to become {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}?`
`It feels like this was the theme of the previous game.`
`Because they want to gain the right.`
`Furniture cannot ____.`
`{n}So, they try to become {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} for the right to ____.`
`...........................`
`It really is quite simple.`
`......It's directly connected to the reason the chick Beato was born in the first place.`
`".....................`
` ......I see.`
` ......I do understand, but it's complicated."`
`I can't......ignore the heart.`
`"I feel bad for saying this at {f:5:Beatrice}'s funeral,`
` ......but, truth be told, I don't know enough about {f:5:Beatrice} to explain her.`
` My apologies."`
`"As far as that goes, Jessica‐chan does live here, so she might know a little more than I do.`
` ......Speaking of which, have you introduced yourself to this gentleman yet, Jessica‐chan?"`
`"Nah, not yet.`
` ......There's this idiot going around pinching people's butts, so I didn't really have the chance yet...ehehe..."`
`A bit late, Jessica looked embarrassed for acting rudely in front of an unfamiliar guest.`
`She cleared her throat and made a beautiful bow that didn't fit well with her normal attitude.`
` She even lifted the corners of her skirt in a curtsy.`
`"P‐pleased to meet you.`
` ......My name is Jessica.`
` Allow me to welcome you to the Ushiromiya family on this splendid day......`
`umm, I mean, please enjoy our hospitality...and......."`
`"......Willard.`
` Call me Will."`
`"Huh?`
` .........Huh?`
` ...............Wah—"`
`Jessica's greeting had been of the old‐fashioned sort,`
` so Will also treated her like an old‐fashioned lady.`
` He bent down on one knee, took Jessica's right hand, and kissed the back of it.`
`"Wah, wah......waah........."`
`Not expecting her greeting to be returned in such an old‐fashioned and formal way, Jessica turned red and was unable to speak.`
`......However, Will had returned the greeting in what he thought was a perfectly serious way,`
` so he didn't understand what was making Jessica's face glow.`
`"Have I done something strange?"`
`"No, no, I just didn't...ah, ahahaha..."`
`"I want to hear what you know about {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` ...............nn."`
`A glow leaked from Will's right hand, which was grasping Jessica's.`
`Looks like the theatergoing power is having its effect on Jessica.`
`......Didn't mean for that to happen.`
` Oh well...`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}, is it...?`
` W‐well, I can tell you, .........but will you promise me something?`
` Promise you won't laugh.`
` Thinking about it now, ......it sounds more than a little crazy."`
`"What is it you know?`
` I won't laugh.`
` Tell me."`
`"S‐sure...`
` .........Umm, where should I start......."`
`To me, the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice} is...`
`...sort of like one of the "seven mysteries" of the Ushiromiya family.`
`You've heard of those, right? Almost all schools have a set of tall tales or ghost stories that get passed down.`
`Like "on some days, the piano in the music room will start playing by itself", or "the skeleton in the science room dances around at night".`
`Everyone's heard of them.`
` But of course, that doesn't mean they believe in them.`
`The stories about {f:5:Beatrice} were the same.`
`It was just one of those strange tales about our way‐too‐big mansion.`
`The servants would sometimes talk about seeing things or whatever during their night patrols.`
`Sometimes, I felt a bit annoyed about them turning my home into a place for ghost stories, but I didn't pay it any more attention than that.`
` That's how little it mattered to me.`
`So, during my normal, everyday life, I would completely forget about the name "{f:5:Beatrice}".`
`Of course, when that huge portrait was first hung, I was definitely creeped out.`
`Even I tried not to meet her eyes after dark,`
` so yeah, I don't blame the servants for finding it eerie.`
`But that only lasted for a short while.`
`{n}I mean, I walked by that portrait every day.`
`I gradually got used to it, and eventually bored of it.`
`It was just a portrait that Grandfather blew a bunch of money on, showing the mistress from his delusions... I was past caring.`
`"I get that.`
` I'll bet it was different for the other relatives, who only came a few times a year."`
`"Exactly.`
` That's why every time the family came for a family conference, they'd always stand in front of that portrait and talk about {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` So, I was reminded of it every year."`
`"Uu, {f:5:Beatrice}!!`
` I've come to play again...!`
` I've drawn another new spell.`
` Take a look at it later, okay?! Uu!"`
`"You really do like {f:5:Beatrice}, don't you?`
` You've been in such high spirits ever since Grandfather had this portrait hung."`
`"Huh?`
` Where's Ange?"`
`"She went back with Aunt Kyrie to take some medicine."`
`"Ange gets sick so easy.`
` ......Totally the opposite of Battler."`
`"She's the sort that gets sick whenever she's stressed.`
` I also used to get sick on big holidays or days when we were going to the movies."`
`"Maria's really tough by comparison.`
` ......She's been talking about {f:5:Beatrice} non‐stop since we left Niijima.`
` ......Don't you think she's taking this a bit too far?"`
`"It's not so bad, right?`
` It's normal for kids to have an active imagination.`
` If a kid told you that she'd met Santa Claus,`
` would you tell her she's a liar?"`
`"......Well, of course I wouldn't go that far."`
`Maria kept talking to the portrait as though it was an old friend.`
`She promised to play with it later, as if she was talking to a living human.`
`George, a man, seemed to think that this behavior from a younger member of the opposite sex was cute.`
`......But, to be perfectly frank...`
`...Jessica, who was the same sex as Maria,`
` found this behavior a bit unpleasant regardless of Maria's age.`
`At one time, even I was fascinated by anime heroines and other fictional characters.`
`However, ......Maria's behavior seems to signify something more direct than mere fascination.`
` ......It's something much more definite,`
` ......more vivid.`
`Am I the only one who notices something odd about her?`
`......I'll bet the others all notice too, but try to ignore it because of that adult dignity George nii‐san is always talking about.`
`"......My apologies, everyone.`
` The head is quite busy with his noble research.`
` He wishes to eat lunch in his study today."`
`Until a second ago, Kinzo's children were complaining that eating lunch with their father would give them indigestion.`
`But now that they knew he wasn't coming, they started grumbling about how he should at least spare the time to come down during the annual family conferences.`
`"Then let us begin lunch, everyone.`
` I, Gohda, have made use of all my talent and experience to make sure that all of you,`
` who have come from so far away, will be entirely satisfied with your meal..."`
`No one's stomach would fail to rumble after hearing that from the great Chef Gohda.`
`By the time the splendid dishes were laid out, everyone had stopped talking about Kinzo's absence...`
`It was now Ange's absence that was being discussed.`
`Apparently, her stomachache had gotten so bad that neither she nor Kyrie could make it to lunch.`
`"Poor thing.`
` ......Gohda.`
` Make sure you talk to Kyrie‐san later and have some porridge made."`
`"Thanks a bunch for the concern.`
` ......Really sorry about this.`
` Seems she just can't handle much stress."`
`"That's how it is when they're young.`
` They're cute, at least when they're not regurgitatin'."`
`"George used to do that all the time.`
` He really was frail, way back then.`
` Right?"`
`"Let's not talk about the past...`
` It's not exactly a mealtime topic."`
`"Uu.`
` Poor Ange.`
` She doesn't get to eat this yummy food?"`
`"Yeah, poor girl.`
` Let's make sure we play with her a lot when she gets better."`
`"Uu, can't.`
` She can't play with me."`
`"Wh‐what are you talking about?`
` Why?"`
`"Because I'm gonna play with {f:5:Beatrice}, of course.`
` So I can't play with Ange."`
`"Play with {f:5:Beatrice}...`
` ......You mean you're gonna go off on your own again to mumble to yourself and read some book?"`
`Jessica slightly regretted that she hadn't been more tactful.`
`However, she couldn't wipe away that uncomfortable feeling she got every time Maria talked about {f:5:Beatrice},`
` and that feeling slipped out through her words...`
`"Uu!!`
` I don't do it on my own!`
` Beato is there too!!"`
`Maria may have been young, but she already knew how to read a person's tone.`
`She immediately burst out in anger, drawing the attention of everyone in the room...`
`Normally, Rosa would have stopped her at this point.`
`However, Rosa happened to have gone to the bathroom.`
` So, there was no one to calm Maria down...`
`"Kihihihihi!!`
` Poor Jessica, you're just a clump of the toxin!`
` With Beato's weak magical power now, she'd burn to a crisp if she ever appeared in front of you!`
` But she will appear before you eventually.`
` Yes, in front of everyone else too!!"`
`"Kihihihi, and then the door to the Golden Land will open!!`
` But who knows if you'll be invited in?`
` Of course, she will take me there, to the Golden Land!`
` But not Jessica, not Jessica!!`
` Not someone who makes fun of {f:5:Beatrice}, not an unenlightened, stupid, confused, filthy, toxin‐stained {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}!!`
` Kihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hhi{0}hhi{0}hhi{0}hhi!!"`
`".........When someone makes fun of {f:5:Beatrice}, it's like Maria becomes a totally different person."`
`"There was a theory about Maria having multiple personalities, wasn't there?"`
`"Multiple personalities!`
` Yeah, that probably describes it perfectly.`
` Maybe that was Maria's idea of her ideal personality."`
`"You mean that thing about "creating another self", the way you want to be...?"`
`"Huh? ...How'd you know my motto?"`
`"Don't think too hard on it.`
` You'll just get a headache."`
`That was something Jessica had once told Kanon.`
`She had been talking about how anyone can create another self that they can really grow to like.`
`......I think we heard those words somewhere near the beginning of the second game.`
`Now that I think about it, some very interesting topics have been talked about since very early on...`
`"Everyone has something they really want to become.`
` But they never do it.`
` ......The restrictions on their everyday life are what made them who they are today,`
` so they have no way of changing themselves."`
`"True.`
` Changing yourself means changing your environment.`
` ......That's not easy to do."`
`"So, my idea was to leave "who I am now" unchanged...`
`...and create another "self" to be the person I want to be."`
`"You felt suffocated, forced to live the life of a rich family's daughter,`
` and you thought up a "self" that you wanted to be."`
`"But I couldn't do anything outlandish at home, of course.`
` Nothing fun about having Mom yell at me all the time.`
` ......So, I made my plan.`
` At home, I would obediently do as my parents said,`
` ......but I would also create a second "self" to do what I wanted."`
`"At home, you do everything your parents tell you, and outside, you do what you want.`
` That's a good way to live.`
` You should be proud."`
`"Heheh, thanks...`
` And, well, ......if there's something you really want to be, and you really work for it, it's easier to do than you'd think.`
` I figured Maria was pretty much the same."`
`"You think Maria's doing the same thing when she gets excited and starts talking and talking?"`
`"That's the person Maria really wants to be,`
` is how I think about it sometimes."`
`"......As the youngest member of the family, she is adored, but not respected."`
`"Every time she learns something, there's always someone in the family who already knows it.`
` She doesn't get to show off her knowledge about anything.`
` ......Whenever she does learn something new, we try to smile and praise her,`
` ......but that might actually have hurt her."`
`"So, Maria wanted to become an authority on something?"`
`It's something that all young boys and girls, who want to shake off their childhood, think.`
`It's not a bad feeling when you learn something new and your parents praise you.`
` ......But when you realize that your parents already knew that thing, it sometimes feels like they're talking down to you.`
`When a kid learns their one‐digit times table, their parents will probably praise them.`
`However, inconsiderate parents will sometimes ask mean questions, like "then what is 11 times 11?"`
` or "what is 16 times 16?"`
` or something similar.`
`If that happens, the kid will lose his feeling of accomplishment and start to feel as though he could never surpass his parents...`
`"So, it's easy to guess why Maria got interested in the occult, something no one else knew about,`
` and started learning more and more about it.`
` ......I think the person Maria wants to be...`
`is an authority on the occult who is respected by everyone."`
`"And if she talked about the occult all the time during her everyday life, Rosa'd smack her.`
` ......So, like you, she's been hiding this other "self" most of the time."`
`"That's what I think she's doing at times like this.`
` ......Maybe I should say that this is her real self slipping through the cracks to cover up her normal self."`
`"Actually, I've had some experience with that myself.`
` ......I used to admire the image of a delicate, sheltered lady and wanted to seem more frail......so I'd pretend to cough a lot, and it sort of became a bad habit."`
`"Because everyone would be nice to you if you started having coughing fits?"`
`"Haha, no...... Whenever the conversation turned to something I didn't like, or something that made me feel uncomfortable, I could do that to change the subject."`
`"I see.`
` And that's another "self" you wanted to become."`
`"Haha, I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell anyone about that."`
`Then, ......just what is...`
`...the "other self" in Maria's case?`
`An authority on the occult who can out‐argue even adults?`
`{n}Or else, ......someone who converses and mingles with witches?`
`......Either way, denying {f:5:Beatrice} in front of Maria is clearly taboo.`
`.........In her search for something more than her everyday life,`
` Maria had found it in {f:5:Beatrice} and inside herself.`
`Then, is going to the Golden Land with {f:5:Beatrice}...`
`...Maria's...wish?`
`....................................`
`"Looks like we've gone off track.`
` Anyway, Maria kept up that tantrum until Auntie Rosa got back.`
` ......It was my fault too, arguing back when I should've let her be."`
`"And you said there was no way {f:5:Beatrice} could exist?"`
`"Something like that.`
` "If she exists, then just let me see her".`
` ......Of course, once Maria started crying, I realized I'd gone too far."`
`"And then?"`
`"At the end of the family conference, I was the only one still upset.`
` ......Maria acted as though nothing had happened.`
` Instead, she went off somewhere on her own, and came back talking happily about how she had played with {f:5:Beatrice} again."`
`"Everyone, me included, decided not to contradict her.`
` By that time, it was best to just accept it and ignore it."`
`"Is that all you have to say about the family conference?"`
`"About the conference, yes.`
` What I wanted to talk about was what happened after the conference was over and everyone left."`
`Even after the conference ended, I still felt a bit uncomfortable.`
`If Maria had just stayed mad,`
` we'd have made up with each other and I could've put it all behind me.`
`But since Maria got over it, it felt like I was the only one unsatisfied...`
`"Oh, Milady.`
` Why the gloomy face?"`
`"......Oh, it's you.`
` It's nothing important.`
` ......Did everyone make it back okay?"`
`"If they're still on schedule, they should have reached the Niijima airport by now.`
` ......You've done your part well, Milady."`
`"I haven't done anything.`
` It's you servants who've done a great job."`
`".....................`
` Is the argument you had with Maria‐sama yesterday still playing on your mind?"`
`"Nn, .........sorta."`
`"Come now, she's just a child.`
` It's not something you need to worry about, all grown up and in high school."`
`"That stuff Maria was talking about, do you think it's all just a kid's nonsense?"`
`"......About {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama,`
` ......you mean?"`
`"See, even you call her {i:sama}."`
`{f:5:Beatrice} is the name of Grandfather's mistress, the person he's still infatuated with.`
` ......I realize that, as a servant, Kumasawa‐san can't speak of her indiscreetly.`
`Still, ......that's now become the name of the fictitious witch who lives in the mansion,`
` .........and it's almost normal for people to call her "sama".`
`"{f:5:Beatrice} is just a ghost story created by the adults to stop us from wandering into the forest.`
` ......Maria just thought it was interesting one day and decided to pretend it was true."`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho...`
` You'll end up cursed if you say such things.`
` After all, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama "exists"."`
`"Come on, we both know that isn't true.`
` I don't need George nii‐san to tell me not to make a fuss about Santa not existing.`
` But that doesn't mean Santa actually exists."`
`"......You'll find you're wrong there, Milady."`
`"Wrong...?"`
`"Oh yes.`
` The gods do dwell in all things.`
` ......In the same way, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama dwells on this island, in this mansion.`
` Like the gods, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama will do you no harm if you respect her."`
`"As you say, it is as though she doesn't exist...`
` However, if you ever fail to show proper respect, it will most certainly come back to haunt you.`
` ......Of course, that can be said of more than {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama."`
`"Heh, if there's a curse, let's see it.`
` I'd just love to meet her."`
`"M‐Milady...!`
` You mustn't say such things...!"`
`"Ah, Milady..."`
`"You were splendid today..."`
`"Shannon, Gohda‐san.`
` You guys know about {f:5:Beatrice}, right?"`
`"......Huh?"`
`"W‐well, I do know of her, of course.`
` ......Why do you ask?"`
`The two looked at each other.`
`They looked like a pair who had just heard a clueless person suddenly utter a forbidden word...`
`"Let's have it straight.`
` Does she exist?`
` That ghost?!"`
`"......If it's a question of whether she exists or not,`
` ......I would have to say she doesn't...`
`probably."`
`"I,`
` ......I really do think...`
`...she does exist."`
`"And why do you say she "exists"?!`
` Have you ever met her?"`
`"I, ......I've never met her directly, ......but..."`
`Shannon talked in detail about how she would sometimes feel a strange presence...`
`or see a silhouette while doing the midnight rounds.`
` Jessica dismissed each example as it was given, saying Shannon must have seen it wrong or been mistaken.`
`"You haven't met her either, right, Gohda‐san?!"`
`"O‐......of course...`
` ......However,`
` .........well......"`
`He was being very evasive.`
`Even a man as big as Gohda was apparently unable to deny the existence of someone he'd never met.`
`.........This really didn't sit well with Jessica.`
`She was herself a resident of this mansion.`
`They were acting as though someone else, someone she didn't know, was living here.`
` ......Of course she didn't like it.`
`"Nn, wait a sec.`
` Tell that one again."`
`"Huh?`
` Y‐you mean...?"`
`"Th‐the story about the VIP room...?"`
`Gohda and Shannon had been recounting several ghost stories about {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`One of those drew a reaction from Jessica...`
`"Yeah, that one.`
` Sounds pretty cool...!"`
`Gohda and Shannon glanced at each other.`
` They hadn't been trying to talk about anything "cool".`
`"The VIP room...`
`...is never to be entered at two in the morning—`
`is that the one you mean?"`
`"The one about how {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama returns to the VIP room at two o'clock every morning,`
` ......so you mustn't go near it?"`
`"Yeah, that's it.`
` Pretty cool.`
` All the other stories are about people saying they heard or saw something they thought was {f:5:Beatrice}, but this one isn't.`
` This one says that, if you go to the VIP room at two in the morning, you can actually meet {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama...!"`
`"W‐well, ......I, I wonder......"`
`"Milady...`
` They say that servants who speak ill of {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama will be cursed.`
` Furthermore, the VIP room is {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama's room..."`
`"......Even you, Milady, ......should probably reconsider......"`
`"The VIP room is locked now, right?`
` Where's the key?"`
`"Was that key......in the key box...?"`
`"I, I think Genji‐sama keeps that key by his own chair."`
`"The master key can open it, right?`
` Let me borrow yours."`
`"I, I cannot do such a thing...!"`
`"Milady, you mustn't approach an ill‐omened place without reason..."`
`"Hold it, don't you go calling my house ill‐omened.`
` Anyway, I've made up my mind.`
` If you can't give me your master key, there's still that key for the VIP room, right?`
` Let me borrow it."`
`"............M‐...Milady......"`
`To Jessica, it was their two expressions that felt more like an ill omen than anything else did.`
`It wasn't the witch or the VIP room that felt foreboding to Jessica.`
` It was {i:them}, Maria and the others who believed in witches.`
`In the end, Jessica forced them to agree, and she made them bring her the key to the VIP room...`
`"A classic test of courage, to see if {f:5:Beatrice} would really appear in the VIP room or not."`
`"Pretty much.`
` ......Still, I wonder why I was so stubborn about it.`
` It must have been because of my fight with such a little girl."`
`......Of course, the weather just had to be terrible on that particular night.`
`To be honest, I slightly regretted sticking my nose into something so pointless.`
`But I'd already said so much, and even borrowed the key from them.`
`I couldn't just go to Shannon the next day, let her ask me how it went,`
` and answer "well, I got scared so I gave up,`
` tehehe......"`
` That'd just be pathetic.`
`Normally, I go to sleep long before {nobr:2 a.m}.`
`If Mom found me wandering the corridors at that time of night, she'd definitely yell at me.`
`So, I waited in my room, staring at the hands of my clock as it ticked closer to {nobr:2 a.m}.`
`Outside, the rain was incredible, and the wind strong.`
`{n}The swaying, rustling trees were particularly creepy.`
`I'd complained to Shannon and Gohda about making up ghost stories for my house,`
` ......but I was starting to feel as though they had a bit of a place after all.`
`......The Ushiromiya mansion is huge.`
`Honestly, I can't think of the entire mansion as my own house.`
`As Mom says, the hallways of the Ushiromiya mansion should be treated like public roads.`
`In other words, my own room is part of my home, ......but the hallways and the rooms I don't usually enter are "outside".`
`So, while part of me felt that this VIP room ghost story was ridiculous,`
` ......the other part of me was so creeped out that it kept trying to convince itself that the first part of me was right.`
`Ten to two.`
`If I want to greet {nobr:2 a.m.} inside the VIP room, I need to have already gone in there before then.`
`"......Guess it's time.`
` ......Sorry, but I'm not giving up that easy."`
`Nothing's going to happen.`
` I know that.`
`{n}It'll just be a stupid waste of time for a few minutes.`
`I touched the doorknob to the door of my room...`
`...and was startled by how unpleasantly cold it was.`
`As long as I stayed in this room, I could laugh off anything.`
`After all, this was {i:my} room.`
`But it wouldn't be like that in the hallway.`
` ......That's...outside my territory.`
`And the doorknob, the barrier between the two, was ice‐cold...`
`......Idiot...`
` What are you so scared of, me?`
`You aren't taking Shannon's, Gohda‐san's, ...or maybe Kumasawa‐san's gossip seriously, are you...?`
`I'll prove it! There's nothing strange in the VIP room...!!`
`The corridor was only dimly lit.`
`The hallways were brighter before "lights out".`
`But to avoid wasting energy or something like that, we kept the lights to a minimum at night.`
`So, even though I was inside my own house,`
` ......it was very obviously the middle of the night here.`
`......If Mom found out that I was wandering around at a time like this to do a test of courage in the VIP room, which I'm not supposed to go in,`
` I'd get in a lot of trouble.`
`To make sure she didn't find out, I tried to hide my breathing and my footsteps.`
`{n}......So, the silence felt unbelievably loud.`
`Even though it was so quiet, ......the eerie sound of the wind was loud in my ears.`
`The sound of twigs rustling.`
` The sound of some pillar in this old mansion creaking.`
`What's that sound like a beak tapping against glass?`
`Though it was so quiet, ......all of the little, suspicious sounds felt obnoxiously loud.`
`Damn, I'm an idiot.`
` Why couldn't I have brought a flashlight, at least?`
`A flashlight to use inside my own home?`
`{n}......Hah, that's even more idiotic...`
`I mumbled this to myself, hoping it would drown out the sound of the wind just a little...`
`.........Then, ......I saw it.`
` The door to the VIP room.`
`......The VIP room was supposedly reserved for important guests.`
`However, as far as I knew, it had never been used.`
`None of the guests who came to this mansion......had ever been given the right to use this room.`
`Though I'd been clutching the key all this time, it didn't feel warm at all.`
`{n}The icy metal tormented me ruthlessly.`
`Maybe that was a warning.`
` ......“If you go back to your comfortable room and hide in your bed, this night will pass like any other...”`
`"......Like hell I'm doing that.`
` I can't give up after coming this far."`
`The key had been freezing in my hand, urging me to turn back.`
`{n}......But the keyhole made no further attempt to stop me.`
`All that's left...`
`......is to turn the knob,`
` open the door,`
` ......and I'll be inside the VIP room.`
`......It's not like I've {i:never} been in the VIP room.`
`Long ago, when I would often play hide‐and‐seek or go exploring,`
` this room that I rarely entered had seemed unusual and exciting.`
`However, I got in trouble for going in, and was told that this room was important, so one mustn't enter without reason.`
` After that, they made a rule of locking up unused rooms, and I couldn't go in anymore.`
`......So, ...it's probably been several years since I last went into the VIP room.`
` In fact, ......it might be more than a decade.`
`The inside of the room is probably different from how it was when I knew of it.`
`......Come to think of it, even then, I felt that there was something unsettling about this room...`
`Slowly, I pushed the door open.`
`It was light, ......and even after I let go of it, it kept opening by itself, as though beckoning me in...`
`Beyond it......was a darkness as thick and heavy as ink...`
`Even the dim light that seeped in from the corridor seemed bright in contrast.`
`......Swallowing hard,`
` ......I stuck my head in, feeling about for the light switch next to the doorway.`
`This was a horribly unnatural and awkward way to do it.`
`{n}......All I really had to do was step inside and search for the switch from there.`
`Unwilling to take even a single step into the room,`
` ......I timidly stuck just my arm into the darkness and felt along the wall...`
`"............There..."`
`Click.`
`The switch, which was hardly ever used, felt stiff and lifeless.`
`However, once the light turned on, the darkness vanished in an instant.`
`And there,`
` ......exactly as it had been,`
` ......as though not a thing had changed in all these years,`
` ...was the VIP room.`
`......The curtain and bed cover might have been slightly different, and maybe the chairs and the like had changed too.`
`Still, .........if I had to put it in words, I'd call it the feel.`
`{n}......The stiff, lifeless feel of this room hadn't changed.`
`If I hang around here, someone might find me.`
` ......I'd rather not have Mom find me here.`
`I readied myself,`
` ......and though I hadn't even been able to bring myself to enter this room with the lights out,`
` .........I finally entered.`
`As soon as I closed the door, I felt an oppressive, suffocating sensation.`
`Alright, ......I've shut myself in the VIP room.`
` Come out, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`"......What time is it now...?"`
`I looked around the room, but I couldn't see any clock.`
`I'm not in the habit of wearing a watch around the house.`
` ......Damn.`
` Now I'm not sure what time it is.`
`Still, I know it's only a few minutes at most.`
`I tried to suppress my desire to use "going to get a clock" as an excuse to run away from this place...`
`......Even so, just standing around like this was boring.`
`When I looked around again, searching for something to sit on, ......I found something strange.`
`"............What's this?"`
`It had been placed on the side table next to the bed.`
`......If this room had been used often by someone, I'd have thought it was just one of their personal belongings.`
`But there was no one living in this room.`
`{n}So, ......it was impossible for this to belong to the room's owner.`
`"......What is this, an offering or something?`
` ......Creepy..."`
`It did look like an offering.`
`A small French doll was sitting on the side table.`
`The doll's hair...was gold.`
` ......It was wearing a black dress.`
`Just who managed to find this doll, and where?`
`There's no doubt that someone placed the doll here to symbolize {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`Does that mean...this doll is supposed to be the owner of this room, or something...?`
`And, as though it was an offering to that owner,`
` ......there sat a small plate with several cookies and wrapped chocolates.`
`It was all set out neatly, and there was no dust piled up on the doll.`
`......In other words, both the doll and the offering were being taken care of on a regular basis by the servants,`
` and kept in good condition along with the rest of the room.`
`Taken care of?`
` ......No, it was more than that.`
`It looked like an offering...no, like some sort of worship,`
` a prayer saying "please don't curse us"...`
`......So, while the doll was eerie enough by itself,`
` ......psychologically, it was even more unnerving to think about how it must have been kept safe and worshiped in a place like this.`
`"Stupid.`
` ......Am I supposed to clap my hands together and say "please don't curse me"?"`
`Jessica forced herself to look away from the bizarre doll.`
`......She couldn't bring herself to sit on a bed that wasn't hers.`
`{n}Then again, she didn't really feel like sitting down on a chair either.`
`She had lost any desire to sit on anything in this room.`
`Wandering about aimlessly,`
` ......I peeked out the window through the gaps in the curtains to stare at the dark, rainy night.`
`......What the hell am I doing?`
`Hanging about in the VIP room this late just because that fight with Maria is still eating at me...`
` ......This is beyond stupid... I'm disappointed in myself.`
` {f:5:Beatrice}, huh...`
`Just when did that strange witch start living in this mansion...?`
`......Grandfather's always yelling about {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`Since it's apparently the name of his dead mistress, people started talking about how her ghost must haunt this mansion.`
`There's that kids' horror story about the witch in the forest,`
` which might be a ghost story made by the adults to stop the kids from going in there.`
`The portrait Grandfather had hung in April was really striking.`
`And there was also that weird epitaph.`
` ......The creepy words on that, which sounded like some sort of ritual with human sacrifices, made the name of {f:5:Beatrice} seem all the more unnerving.`
`At some point, those stories mixed together, and they now say that the witch {f:5:Beatrice} exists.`
`......I don't believe in {f:5:Beatrice}...`
`because I know she's just a fictional person made by the fusion of a few horror stories.`
`The "Beatrice" who was Grandfather's mistress probably did exist.`
`But she wasn't a witch.`
`The story of the witch of the forest was made up by the adults to prevent their kids from getting lost in the woods.`
` But that was just a made‐up story, not reality.`
`In fact, I've heard that kids were once threatened about wolves living in the forest.`
` Apparently, the kids realized that wolves couldn't exist on the island, so it was changed to the witch.`
`When the portrait was hung,`
` ......that once‐vague character suddenly had a face,`
` and people acted as though she'd been around since long ago.`
`......That's right, it's all a ghost story someone made, a fiction.`
`And Maria calls {f:5:Beatrice} her best friend, and the servants worship her like a household shrine.`
`I just don't get it, and it creeps me out......`
`".........! ..........................."`
`The sudden ring of the phone made me jump so hard I thought my heart would explode.`
`There was a phone on the bedside table across from the one with the doll,`
` and it was ringing noisily.`
`However, I was only surprised by the first ring.`
`By the time it had rung three times, I'd regained my cool enough to grumble about this being a prank done by someone trying to scare me.`
`......If I rush to pick it up, I'll probably hear someone laughing at me, saying "were you scared?"`
`I thought about ignoring it instead, .........but it kept on ringing incessantly.`
`It's a pretty loud sound to have going on and on this late at night.`
` If Mom somehow manages to hear it from her room, I'm screwed.`
`"......Okay, okay, I've got it, I've got it.`
` Might as well say "ya scared me" or whatever..."`
`I decided to pick up the receiver.`
`I'll just say "that surprised me, wahahaha",`
` and maybe follow that up with "looks like {f:5:Beatrice} didn't show up after all".`
`After all, this is my victory, in a sense.`
`".........Hello?"`
`‘Uu!`
` Hi, {f:5:Beatrice}...!’`
`"Huh?`
` M‐......Maria...?!"`
`I don't get it.`
`Did I hear that wrong...?`
` Why would Maria be calling here...?!`
`"H‐hello...?!"`
`‘Thanks for teaching me that fun song last time.`
` In return, I'm gonna sing you a song, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` I just learned this one!`
` Uu!’`
`The voice, the intonation, the manner of speech—all of it clearly belonged to Maria.`
`{n}But......what's she talking about, all by herself...?`
`Maria just kept on talking happily as I stood there, stunned and unable to interrupt.`
`Eventually, Maria started singing an old, familiar kids' song that even I knew.`
`I don't...get it.`
`"......Maria? Hello...?`
` Wait a sec, stop singing...!`
` What's going on?`
` I don't get it...!`
` Hello?!`
` Ah—"`
`The voice, the lights—everything disappeared.`
`{n}In the pitch‐black, I couldn't see anything, couldn't tell what was happening.`
`{n}I don't get it, what's going on?!`
`"What...`
`.........the hell...`
`.........was that......?"`
`Does being in darkness really slow us humans down so much...?`
`I know it's dark, ......but I really do have absolutely no idea what just happened.`
`......What was that shuffling sound just now?`
` I, I'm not sure... I can't explain it.`
`It was a loud sound like someone crawling out of bed.`
`I wouldn't say something as non‐committal as I "felt like" I heard it.`
` I wouldn't say something as vague as I "sensed a presence".`
` I definitely heard it, right next to me, clearly.`
`However, there was no change to the bed.`
`{n}No one had been sleeping there in the first place, and the sheets were still perfectly straight.`
`Someone had crawled out of the bed,`
` .........and had laughed in a creepy voice before leaving the room......`
` ............That's...`
`...what it felt like.`
`Felt like?`
` I'm here, and the bed's right there.`
`I'm not only in the same room, I'm right next to it.`
` ......So, why am I so unsure about what happened just a few seconds ago?!`
`I gripped the receiver, which had gone completely silent,`
` .........and waited there alone, unable to move, in a quiet room that seemed exactly identical to the one I had first entered...`
`............Huh?`
` ............What............?`
`If nothing had changed since the beginning, ......I could just pretend that the last minute or so didn't happen.`
`However,`
` ......if something had changed,`
` ......that would be proof that something really did happen...`
`"......The hell?`
` ......Where'd...`
`......it go......?"`
`Did it fall to the floor...?`
` No, it's not there.`
` ......No matter where I look, from whatever angle, ......it's not there.`
`Though the offering plate with the cookies and chocolate is still here,`
` .........the thing they were being offered to,`
` the doll, is gone.`
`"......No way.................."`
`Then, ......what just happened......?`
`Is the {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama doll supposed to have cackled out loud and left the room...?`
`No, that crawling sound was too loud to have been made by a doll.`
`It was a noisy sort of sound, like a kid playing with a blanket and using it as a cape.`
`Then, what......?`
`Is that {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama doll...`
`supposed to have turned into a human...`
`......and then run cackling from the room...?`
`"No......way....................."`
`After that, nothing happened.`
`{n}The doll alone disappeared, .........and nothing else changed.`
`In a VIP room that had remained completely unchanged and was filled only with the sound of wind and rain,`
` ......I stood there, too shocked to move......`
`"Did you ever find that doll?"`
`"......I looked everywhere, even under the bed.`
` I literally crawled in there looking for it.`
` ......But I didn't find it."`
`"Just what do you think happened in that room?"`
`"I don't think it was actually "{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama's curse".`
` ......It might have been a prank done by the servants."`
`"A prank?"`
`"Maybe they recorded Maria's voice on a cassette tape or something ahead of time.`
` They then called at exactly {nobr:2 a.m.} and pushed the play button.`
` They could've cut the power at the breaker or something."`
`"......Then, someone who had been hiding in the VIP room beforehand would make a creepy laugh, take the doll, and leave.`
` .........If that was how it happened, everything does fit."`
`"Doesn't sound like you're really convinced it happened that way."`
`"Can you blame me?`
` ......I mean, if that was just a prank to scare me, it was way too elaborate."`
`They made Maria sing beforehand and recorded it.`
`Then, someone called the VIP room and replayed that recording.`
`Then, someone waited until exactly the right time and tripped the breaker for the VIP room.`
`To turn off the power to the VIP room, you'd have to go down to the basement.`
` ......There's a breaker box down in the boiler room.`
`There's no phone line down there, so you'd need a different person to play back Maria's tape.`
`And you'd need another person to hide in the VIP room and cackle before leaving.`
`And......just how long would this last person have to hide in the VIP room beforehand...?`
`How long would they have to hide in the pitch‐black VIP room—under the bed, for example—`
`waiting to scare Jessica, who might or might not come...?`
`"......There's no way it could be a witch's curse.`
` ......But still.`
` Imagining that so many people planned everything down to the slightest detail...`
`and waited for several hours in the darkness just to scare me...?`
` To me, that's even creepier......"`
`"I agree.`
` I'd much prefer a curse.`
` ......Did you ask the servants about that later on?"`
`"What's the point? They'd just play dumb, of course.`
` ......And there had to have been at least three of them...`
` On that day, only Genji‐san, Gohda‐san, Kumasawa‐san, and Shannon stayed the night.`
` So three of those four helped out with that creepy prank?`
` It doesn't make sense...!`
` That's why......I couldn't ask about it."`
`".............................."`
`True, it had been a strange experience for her, but it wasn't something completely impossible for humans to do.`
`......Even so, it really must have been more unnerving to imagine a large number of people planning so carefully just to scare Jessica.`
`......It's no surprise that she found this scarier than {f:5:Beatrice}'s curse.`
`"Do you still believe the servants pulled a fast one on you?"`
`".........No.`
` I probably......just freaked out and mistook what I saw and heard.`
` The doll probably just fell somewhere, and I just had trouble finding it."`
`"Are you trying to say you imagined the whole thing...?"`
`"Other than the doll disappearing, there was no other proof that anything had changed.`
` ......Later on, I talked to Maria, and she said she didn't know anything about that song or the phone call.`
` I don't know if she was lying or not, of course.`
` ......Anyway, what happened that night...`
`...is just something I thought happened...`
`...and there's no proof of any kind."`
`"That's ironic.`
` Even if you had met {f:5:Beatrice} directly, you wouldn't have been able to prove that either."`
`"For a while, I was pretty rattled about it, ......but as time went on,`
` I began to think that lightning or something had shut off the power for a second and spooked me,`
` ......and maybe one of the trees in the garden fell while making rustling sounds, which I mistook for someone crawling out of bed because I was already scared."`
`"And the laugh?"`
`"Maybe some strange bird.`
` ......Anyway, I might have misheard something to get that sound..."`
`".........I act tough, but it turns out I'm actually an unbelievable coward.`
` ...That's why I let my imagination get ahold of me.`
` ......I decided to think about it that way......and kept firmly repeating it to myself to help me forget everything that happened that night."`
`"So it all remains in darkness..."`
`".........People are actually pretty good at forgetting things if they try.`
` ......Ever since that night, I feel uncomfortable every time I hear the word "{f:5:Beatrice}".`
` But I try hard to not let it show on my face."`
`"...................................."`
`"............That's all.`
` I can't tell you any more than that."`
`"It's really embarrassing, so please don't tell anyone.`
` .........I don't want them knowing what a huge chicken I was."`
`"You got it.`
` ......I have one last question."`
`"About the VIP room?"`
`"No.`
` About the dining hall."`
`"The dining hall?"`
`"On the day of the family conference, just before your ghost story, all of the relatives were gathered in the dining hall, right?"`
`"Yeah.`
` Except Battler hadn't come back to the family yet.`
` Everyone else was there.`
` ......Everyone except Grandfather, of course."`
`"And Ange wasn't in the room because of her stomachache.`
` ......Her seat was next to yours, wasn't it?"`
`"Yep."`
`"Was that the seat to your right?"`
`"Yeah, the seat to my right.`
` Why does it matter?`
` ...............?`
` ......Hm?`
` Wait...`
` ......That's strange, why to the......?"`
`"That's enough.`
` ......Try not to think. You'll just get a headache."`
`"What's up, Jessica?`
` Why the confused look...?"`
`"......Well, uh...`
`......right...`
`...left...`
` .........???"`
`"Hahah, you're so weird.`
` How is it going, Will?`
` Have George nii‐san and Jessica told you anything useful?"`
`"A bit.`
` That ghost story about {f:5:Beatrice} was pretty fun."`
`"Ghost story?`
` What are you talking about?"`
`"The one about {f:5:Beatrice}'s ghost appearing in the VIP room at two in the morning.`
` Pretty scary story."`
`"I've never heard of that.`
` ......I don't know who put that out there, but that'd be really rude, making up ghost stories about the woman our head is indebted to."`
`"A model answer.`
` ........................"`
`".........?`
` What?"`
`"Do you know about the epitaph, Lion?"`
`"Epitaph?`
` What epitaph?"`
`"That epitaph by {f:5:Beatrice}'s portrait."`
`".........My apologies,`
` but I have no idea what you mean."`
`"‘Behold the sweetfish river, running through my beloved home of old’."`
`".........Just what...`
`are you talking about?"`
`"So, in your world, ......no, in this world,`
` the portrait exists, but not the epitaph?"`
`"Of course, I know about the large portrait of Beatrice hanging in the entrance hall.`
` ......But I haven't heard of this epitaph.`
` What is it?"`
`"........................`
` ......That's a very interesting difference.`
` .........You've lived on Rokkenjima all your life, right?"`
`"Of course.`
` What's your point?"`
`"When you were a little kid, you were warned not to go near the woods."`
`"Yes.`
` They always said to stay away, since it would be dangerous if we got lost."`
`"Because a witch lives in the forest?"`
`"A witch?`
` What witch?"`
`"The Golden Witch, ruler of Rokkenjima's night.`
` {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"......Beatrice is a woman to whom Grandfather owes a great debt.`
` Don't you think it's a bit rude to treat her like a witch or a ghost?"`
`"...............You don't know about the witch {f:5:Beatrice}?"`
`"I know about the Beatrice who came here in a submarine along with the gold, and about her daughter, who was raised in the hidden mansion.`
` We just learned about those two together a short while ago, right?`
` Where does a witch come in?"`
`"...........................`
` I see, so that's it.`
` ......Then how did they scare you...to keep you from going into the woods?"`
`"They said that wolves lived in the forest."`
`".........Not a witch,`
` ...but wolves.`
` ......Of course.`
` Very interesting."`
`"It isn't interesting to me.`
` What are you talking about?`
` What is this witch?"`
`"I'm just talking to myself.`
` I have one more question."`
`"Please, go ahead."`
`"During the family conference, who sits to your right at the dining table?"`
`"My little sister, Jessica, sits across from me.`
` The next in rank is Aunt Eva's son.`
` So, George nii‐san is the one on my right... What's your point?"`
`"I get it.`
` ......It's all mashed together in a confusing mess.`
` But it is interesting."`
`"Well, I don't have a clue."``"So, did you figure out...`
`...who killed Beatrice?"`
`"Yeah.`
` More or less."`
`"I hope you're not going to suggest...`
`...that the head killed her..."`
`"{f:5:Bernkastel} isn't asking about the two Beatrices involved with Kinzo.`
` She's talking about who killed the 1986 {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"......I'm not really sure what you mean by "this year's {f:5:Beatrice}".`
` What's all this about a witch called {f:5:Beatrice}?`
` You've mentioned a ghost story, you've mentioned an epitaph...`
` Isn't it about time you explained all this to me?"`
`"Alright.`
` No point stringing you along."`
`"Let's start from the beginning.`
` ......Who is this witch {f:5:Beatrice}?"`
`"Strictly speaking, it isn't a person.`
` "{f:5:Beatrice}, the Golden Witch" is the name of a concept."`
`"You mean the ghost stories themselves?"`
`"To be more specific, even the ghost stories are only one of the elements that create the concept."`
`"You've lost me."`
`"Ghost stories are normally told in the third person or second person.`
` However, someone started telling those in the first person."`
`"You mean someone started saying that they were {f:5:Beatrice} themselves...?"`
`"The legend of Rokkenjima's evil spirits, and the made‐up story for keeping kids out of the forest...`
` These were combined with Kinzo's constant cries of "Beatrice, Beatrice" and gradually became the legend of the witch.`
` Ushiromiya Maria became entranced by that fictional witch and begged for a chance to meet her.`
` And then, someone...`
`{i:granted her wish}."`
`".........I'm still not following, but I'll just nod and tell you to keep going.`
` ......What do you mean by "granted her wish"?"`
`"Because of the unfortunate way in which Ushiromiya Maria was brought up, she became obsessed with the occult.`
` ......Someone felt sympathy for her, acted the part of {f:5:Beatrice}, and played with her."`
`Maria tends to recognize people by their behavior instead of their physical appearance.`
`When Rosa becomes violent, Maria calls her "the black witch", and at these times, Maria views her as a different person, not her mother.`
`So,`
` this means that she tends to think of the same person as different people depending on their behavior.`
`We can use this to see the scene where Maria first met {f:5:Beatrice} in a new light.`
`After being chased out of the mansion by the adults, Maria decided to drink some tea in the rose garden.`
`At that time, someone probably started talking to Maria.`
`Then, ......when they heard this occult‐loving girl talking happily about how she wanted to meet the witch {f:5:Beatrice},`
` .........this person acted as though {f:5:Beatrice} was possessing them.`
`On the outside, they didn't look like {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`However, when their manner of speech and behavior changed abruptly, Maria would recognize them as a different person.`
`That's why "her" appearance was so sudden.`
`"We can probably view Maria's love of witches and the occult as a form of escapism.`
` ......She believed the power of witches could change her unfulfilling and incomplete life.`
` So, she {i:wanted} to believe in them.`
` Because if she believed in witches, she could also believe in her own happiness."`
`"......It's true that Aunt Rosa is bringing up Maria by herself, and that she's always busy with work.`
` I do feel sorry for Maria, but still..."`
`"Don't ignore the heart.`
` ......So, Maria believed {i:for the sake of believing}.`
` She believed in {f:5:Beatrice}'s simple conjuring trick from the bottom of her heart.`
` That probably comforted her a lot.`
` ......And at that moment, the witch {f:5:Beatrice} was born."`
`"Someone saw that Maria‐chan wanted to meet a witch, so they decided to play witches with her...?"`
`"That's right."`
`This marks the birth of Beato the Elder.`
`All of that about living a thousand years and being bound to Rokkenjima.`
`That was all the result of mixing the legend of Rokkenjima's evil spirits with the story of a ghost wandering the mansion at night.`
`As Furudo Erika guessed, the two ghost stories fused.`
`Someone fused the two stories together and acted the part.`
`So, {f:5:Beatrice} held traits from both ghost stories: she was the master of the mansion's night, while also fearing spiderwebs.`
`"So, when {f:5:Bernkastel} asks us who killed {f:5:Beatrice},`
` she means who killed the kind person who pretended to be {f:5:Beatrice}?"`
`"That's close, but not quite.`
` It's not the one who pretended.`
` We're talking about two different people.`
` ......In Maria's eyes, just like how her mother and the black witch are different people,`
` {f:5:Beatrice} and the person who played that part are also different people."`
`It's just like Mariage Sorcière.`
`That was where one person would be the creator, and the other person would acknowledge those creations, thereby nurturing the illusion.`
`The Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice} was also created by one person, and then nurtured when Maria acknowledged her.`
`"You mean, even if you kill the acted character, that doesn't mean you've killed the kind person who was playing the part?"`
`"Even if {f:5:Beatrice}'s vessel is lost, that isn't the same as {f:5:Beatrice} being killed."`
`"......It's easier to understand if we use a telephone as an example.`
` Let's say I call you on the phone.`
` From my perspective during the call, the phone is you, in the sense that it is what I talk to."`
`"But what if I destroy the phone?"`
`"......I see.`
` If you kill the phone, you won't be able to talk to me, but that doesn't mean you've killed me."`
`"We know Maria once offered to let {f:5:Beatrice} possess her, early on in their relationship.`
` That clearly shows that {f:5:Beatrice} did not look like the portrait at that time."`
`"So, if the person acting the part and the witch character they play are different people, ......we're talking about killing just the witch character itself.`
` ......Is that even possible?"`
`"Only the actor can kill the character.`
` In other words, the person who killed {f:5:Beatrice} is the person who played the part of {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"You mean that the person who played witches with Maria‐chan is the culprit {f:5:Bernkastel}'s talking about?"`
`"That's it.`
` .........But, as if this wasn't confusing enough, this chapel is now a world inside a cat box.`
` The culprit is the cat, and there are now two cats existing at the same time—one alive, and one dead."`
`"......Confusing is right.`
` I'm still lost, but keep going.`
` You're saying that there are two culprits?"`
`"Right.`
` ......The person who can create and kill {f:5:Beatrice}...`
`...and the person who never gave birth to {f:5:Beatrice} in the first place, who can kill the entire concept of {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` Both of those people are here."`
`"Then let me ask.`
` In this {f:5:Beatrice} murder case,`
` who are the two culprits?"`
`"Let's start with...`
`...the dead cat."`
`"Who is it?"`
`"You."`
`"Wha`
`......`
`......?"`
`"The logic is extremely simple.`
` Your world is the only one where the witch {f:5:Beatrice} doesn't exist."`
`"I don't understand."`
`"Both Maria and Jessica told me stories about the witch {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` However, when they talked about the ranking system at the dining table, you weren't there."`
`"I...wasn't there...?"`
`"Maria came to visit Rokkenjima with Rosa.`
` And Rosa was sitting next to her.`
` That's impossible.`
` .........If you exist, then after Rosa comes you, then Jessica, then Maria."`
`There should be two people between Rosa and Maria in rank.`
`In that case, they should be across the table from each other and separated by one seat.`
`......In other words, in the world where Lion exists, it's impossible for Maria to be sitting next to Rosa.`
`"It was the same in Jessica's story.`
` If you're included in the ranking, then when looking down the table towards Kinzo's seat, you should be on the left side and Jessica should be on the right.`
` After that comes George on the left side and Ange on the right.`
` ......Jessica and Ange will be sitting next to each other whether you're there or not.`
` However, which side of the table they're sitting on changes."`
`In the world where Lion exists, Ange's seat is on Jessica's left.`
`{n}However, if Lion doesn't exist, then Ange's seat is on Jessica's right.`
`"Every time someone talked about the witch {f:5:Beatrice} of 1986, they were all talking about a world where you don't exist.`
` And, in your world, there are no ghost stories about a witch.`
` To you, "Beatrice" is either Kinzo's mistress or his benefactor, not a wandering ghost."`
`"The head loved Beatrice deeply, did he not?`
` I can't imagine why she would be made into a ghost story."`
`"Exactly.`
` If you exist, the witch {f:5:Beatrice} doesn't.`
` Your existence...`
`...{i:kills {f:7:Beatrice}}."`
`"Are you saying I'm the culprit who killed {f:5:Beatrice}......?`
` That's......just crazy.`
` How can I be the culprit if I don't even understand her and have never met her?"`
`"Flip it around.`
` ......If you don't exist, {f:5:Beatrice} will be born."`
`"Flip it?`
` Are you trying to say {f:5:Beatrice} and I are two sides of a coin?"`
`"That's a good way to put it.`
` That's it exactly.`
` You're a coin, and {f:5:Beatrice} is on the other side."`
`"I don't get it at all."`
`"At first, I didn't get your existence either.`
` ......But, I have formed a theory about you, after hearing all this.`
` The important fact is that you're 19 years old."`
`"......I don't remember telling you my age, but you got it right.`
` ......How?"`
`"Jessica said you were already the student council vice‐president when she started, and that you became the president the next year.`
` That means you're one year older than Jessica."`
`Jessica is 18 years old, .........so Lion must be 19.`
`"I see...`
` And what sort of theory can you make, now that you know I'm 19?"`
`"You aren't Ushiromiya Natsuhi's child, that's the theory."`
`"...........................`
` ......How rude.`
` I don't know what game you're playing, but I demand that you take back that slanderous insult to both me and my mother."`
`"Why are you the successor to the headship, instead of Krauss?"`
`"I will succeed the headship when I come of age.`
` When I have a kid, I'll probably pass the title down to them when they come of age."`
`"Then why didn't Kinzo give the headship to Krauss when he came of age?"`
`".........You heard what our head said.`
` He was used by the cunning elders of the Ushiromiya family and suffered much.`
` That's why he decided that only young people should inherit the headship from now—"`
`"In the world without you in it, the silver ring for the successor to the headship doesn't even exist.`
` ......That silver ring on your finger proves that Kinzo has a strong desire to see that you become the next head,`
` a desire which does not manifest in any other world."`
`"......I can't deny that you may have a point there.`
` The head always seemed to adore me particularly.`
` I was told from a young age that I would succeed the headship at once when I became an adult, and that it was very important for me to keep up with my studies in preparation for that day."`
`"......But I don't think my father was any less talented.`
` Why did Grandfather skip over him and make me the successor?`
` .........I've thought it strange from time to time, but since it's always been that way, I never said so aloud."`
`"Do you know why Kinzo wanted you and not Krauss to become the next head?"`
`"How could I know?`
` .........Are you trying to tell me to stop ignoring the heart again?`
` Tell me, what deduction can you make about how the head's heart works?"`
`"It's because you're the child of Kinzo and Beatrice."`
`"......Well done.`
` ...*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*."`
`There was a crisp applause and a mocking laugh.`
`"{f:5:Bernkastel}."`
`"......That was faster than I expected.`
` I thought you'd let me play a bit longer."`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} appeared sitting on the altar,`
` ......almost as though it had become her own personal chair.`
`"When did you realize that Lion shared Beatrice's blood?"`
`"As soon as I realized that Lion was 19.`
` ......It was the same number as "the baby from 19 years ago", that hint which appeared in the fifth game."`
`"......Didn't that baby fall off a cliff?"`
`"Lion is the baby who was accepted by Natsuhi and didn't fall off the cliff.`
` In other words, if Natsuhi rejects the baby, Lion doesn't exist."`
`"You're saying......I'm not Mom's child...?!`
` That's insane......`
` ....................."`
`"You say that, but you don't look too sure.`
` ......*giggle*.`
` That's right.`
` Ushiromiya Lion is not Natsuhi's child.`
` This is the grown‐up version of the baby Kinzo got from somewhere 19 years ago."`
`"Not "somewhere".`
` ......Lion clearly shares Beatrice's blood.`
` The proof is the silver ring, which is only ever given to Lion across all of the many worlds."`
`"Why does the ring prove that I share Beatrice's blood?"`
`"In all of the many worlds, you are the only one who is given it.`
` That means that, in all worlds, you are the most important person to Kinzo, second only to Beatrice.`
` And his love for you is far greater than it is for his son, Krauss, or his granddaughter, Jessica.`
` And you are 19 years old.`
` ......In other words, if we look back to see what happened 19 years ago, we are led to one theory."`
`"19 years ago?`
` What's supposed to have happened at the time I was born?"`
`".........You heard it too, didn't you?`
` Today, even.`
` Will was with you."`
`"........................`
` ......You don't mean...Aunt Rosa's story?!"`
`"That's right.`
` Rosa's story came out in the third game, and when the age of the baby in the fifth game matched that date, a certain theory became possible.`
` The fact that Kinzo brought a baby from somewhere and tried to add it to his family...`
`proves that the baby was somehow important to him."`
`"I'm...`
`...the Kuwadorian Beatrice's...`
`...child......"`
`"The Kuwadorian Beatrice was the daughter of the Beatrice who came in the submarine.`
` ......But Kinzo didn't think of her as a daughter.`
` He believed she was the same person, Beatrice reborn.`
` ......When that "reincarnation" reached the same age as the first Beatrice, and truly looked like Beatrice's double,`
` ......Kinzo made a terrible mistake."`
`".........I...I don't want to hear it!"`
`"That's how it is.`
` Kinzo got Beatrice pregnant with Beatrice,`
` and then he got that Beatrice pregnant with you.`
` ......So, you're both Kinzo's child and Beatrice's grandchild."`
`"...........................!"`
`"If we consider Kinzo's heart, this is the inevitable theory we reach for explaining why he treated you so specially.`
` He regretted his mistake so badly that he attempted to have you formally accepted into the Ushiromiya family as a descendant."`
`"......In almost all cases, Natsuhi's pride is brutally hurt, and she refuses to raise you.`
` Because of that, you almost always fall from the cliff and disappear."`
`".........I, I was told that after their marriage,`
` ......I was born after much hardship,`
` ......and Jessica was born the next year..."`
`"If you really never suspected that Natsuhi wasn't your mother,`
` ......then you should thank her in this world.`
` The reason you never realized the truth is because she's shown as much affection for you as she did for Jessica."`
`".........There's no need to thank her.`
` ......After all, it took a staggering amount of effort just to find a fragment with you in it."`
`"Mathematically speaking,`
` there's actually a {nobr:2,578,916/2,578,917} chance of her refusing to raise you.`
` You should probably be thanking me for creating this miracle, not Natsuhi.`
` ......*giggle*giggle*."`
`"Enough with your stupid probability games."`
`"Oh, I'm sorry."`
`"...................................."`
`"No matter whose blood you bear, that doesn't change the debt you owe to the family that raised you."`
`"I realize that.`
` ......Still, I would like some time to calm down and think things through.`
` ...That is, if you'll do me the kindness of not ignoring my heart."`
`".........Sure."`
`Lion took a deep breath and looked upwards.`
`......Anyone would be shocked...`
`to find that their parents weren't who they believed them to be.`
`But all the same, Lion, ...you're allowed to feel grateful.`
` Grateful to the family who raised you and met your every need...`
`"It is pretty interesting.`
` ......Hard to believe that the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice} might've lived such an ordinary life,`
` even at absurdly low probabilities."`
`"Isn't it?`
` I think moments like this are hilarious......"`
`Will had said it plainly.`
`Ushiromiya Lion......is how the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice} appears in a different world.`
`The baby Natsuhi rejected 19 years previous.`
`If she accepts that child, this is the future that results...`
`However, if she does not accept it, ......a witch is born.`
`The baby whose birth was not celebrated becomes a witch...`
`"Lion is the dead cat.`
` ......However, Lion's existence has nothing to do with what you're interested in, the Rokkenjima Serial Murders.`
` ......In other words, Lion is the cat that disappears when you open the cat box."`
`".........*giggle*, exactly.`
` Lion is just a disappearing cat.`
` But this was a pretty entertaining diversion, don't you think?"`
`"You're the only one who finds it entertaining.`
` ......If I wasn't trapped in here, I wouldn't have bothered to reason this out."`
`".....................`
` ......I think I know why I was chosen to be your partner in this strange detective game.`
` ......It seems this {f:5:Bernkastel} witch...`
`enjoys toying with people's fates and making a mockery of them."`
`"Wow, incredible.`
` ......It's rare for someone to understand me the same day they meet me.`
` ......*giggle*."`
`"Apparently, ......I become something that's called a witch in another world.`
` And, apparently, I'm the cause of some sort of crime.`
` Is that my sin to bear?"`
`"Of course it isn't.`
` You are you.`
` How things would be if the coin were flipped the other way shouldn't matter a bit."`
`"Thank you.`
` Even so, to be told that I caused some sort of trouble in a world of a different fate...`
` I don't think anyone would be pleased to hear that.`
` ......Please, tell me.`
` What do I do in that other world?"`
`"............{f:5:Bernkastel}?"`
`"You have the fragments... Why not show them?"`
`"..............."`
`Will opened his hand...`
`and something that looked like a pale‐blue, glowing shard of crystal appeared there.`
`It contained the memories—no, the records—of all the games so far.`
`"......Touch this.`
` You'll be able to see your fate in other worlds."`
`"...............I'll be happier not touching it,`
` ...is what your face is telling me."`
`"Of course.`
` ......I'm sure you guessed this, ...but it isn't pretty."`
`"Even so......`
` ......Even if it is another world, ......it's still about me."`
`"......You have both the right to know and the right not to know.`
` If you can convince yourself that what you're seeing is a person similar to yet different from you—that it is not you but someone else—then go ahead and touch it."`
`"You want to know, don't you...?`
` About the path that fate could have chosen for you..."`
`"............I ask this as your partner.`
` Would you show that to me?"`
`"As your partner, I'd say "look".`
` ......But as a friend, I'd say "don't"."`
`"Unfortunately,`
` I'm not your friend."`
`"Then, as a partner, I have one last question."`
`"What?"`
`"Are you............`
`.........a man or a woman?"`
`"..................Well, that came out of nowhere."`
`"I could see you as a fairly slender boy.`
` But then again, I could also see you as a no‐nonsense sort of girl.`
` ......Even {f:5:Bernkastel} has been intentionally keeping it a secret.`
` She made Jessica call you "the future heir" all the time, instead of "big brother" or "big sister"."`
`"......*giggle*.`
` You are quick."`
`"People often ask me about my gender.`
` It's become quite frustrating, so I always give the same response.`
` ......‘Which do you think I look like?’"`
`".........In the fifth game, you're treated as a man.`
` But in countless other games, you're thought of as a woman."`
`"......In the sixth game, when Ushiromiya Battler was the Master, two demons of different sexes appeared, but we didn't know which was which, referencing this again.`
` ......In fact, strictly speaking, it started all the way back in the very first game.`
` .........Your gender is one of the hidden mysteries that exists outside the games themselves."`
`"Having to say it straight out frustrates me, so I won't give you an answer.`
` We're partners, right?`
` Does it really matter if I'm not the gender you'd prefer?"`
`"........................`
` ......You're right.`
` If we're working together on this, I don't care what your gender is."`
`"Thank you.`
` ......I've formed a bit of a complex about it, so your words are very gratifying."`
`"I'm all for gender equality.`
` .........If someone's a waste of space, I'll smack 'em no matter who they are."`
`"And of course, I'll pinch rude people no matter which gender they are."`
`Slowly, ......Lion reached out and touched the fragment.`
`A moment later, Lion seemed to undergo a violent bout of dizziness...and silently slumped over like a puppet with its strings cut.`
`It was no surprise.`
` When people who don't understand parallel universes have many different fates jammed into their heads,`
` they tend to feel like their heads are swelling and their sense of self is melting away.`
`......Lion seemed to have lost consciousness.`
`"So, ......Lion had what it took to learn everything."`
`"A perfect piece to be your partner, wouldn't you say?"`
`"I'll continue my reasoning.`
` ......I've talked about the dead cat."`
`"Very true.`
` Next up is the living cat."`
`"The only one who can kill the {f:5:Beatrice} of 1986 is the one who created her."`
`"There were tons of hints.`
` If you think about it, they've been coming since back when {f:5:Beatrice} was running the games."`
`"That's true.`
` ......In the fourth game between {f:5:Beatrice} and Battler, {f:5:Beatrice}'s origin became clear.`
` And, at that point, I learned who {f:5:Beatrice} was, and I understood that person's heart."`
`"What do you mean by heart?"`
`"......The reason for committing the crime.`
` ......The reason that {f:5:Beatrice} had to gamble her own fate in the commission of a game‐like crime on October 5th, 1986—`
`the motive."`
`"Impressive.`
` So, you'd figured out the whodunit and the whydunit by the end of the fourth game.`
` ......Then what about the howdunit?"`
`"Once you know who the culprit is, theorizing about the howdunit isn't impossible.`
` ......Those linked locked rooms in the third game were so skillfully done, I felt like clapping."`
`"And what about the riddle at the end of the fourth game,`
` "who am I"......?"`
`"The "culprit" who can kill you for certain at the stroke of midnight on October 5th no matter where you are.`
` It was possible to form a certain kind of hypothesis at the moment the question was asked.`
` ......You might call that the other treasure of the Golden Land."`
`"......Oh?`
` So, you say that by the fourth game,`
` ......in other words, with just {f:5:Beatrice}'s games, you managed to reach all of the answers?"`
`"It's possible.`
` ......{f:5:Lambdadelta}'s and Battler's games after that were just an extra helping of hints.`
` ......As is this game of yours."`
`"*giggle*giggle*......`
` ......In that case, why don't you stop beating around the bush, and just tell me?`
` .........Who is...`
`the culprit......?"`
`At that moment, .........though there hadn't been anyone but them in the chapel, quiet footsteps rang out.`
`That silhouetted figure slowly walked up to Will and {f:5:Bernkastel}...and gave a small bow.`
`".........So, you've come."`
`"Did you call this person here?"`
`"Yeah.`
` ......Whodunit.`
` Howdunit.`
` And...whydunit.`
` ......I understand this person's motive."`
`"......And {i:you}, are you going to give up just because he's found out your motive...?`
` There's no concrete evidence, right?`
` You could make a flashy fight of it, with red and blue."`
`"That's not what they want anymore."`
`The person nodded slightly.`
`Their wish......was for someone to realize.`
`Now that this had happened, they had no intention of engaging in trivial excuses or pointless word games...`
`"I believe that I understand your motive,`
` ......your heart.`
` ......I am going to talk about it now.`
` I called you here...`
`to listen...`
`...and correct me if I've gotten anything wrong."`
`"...................................."`
`The two of them nodded to each other once more.`
`"I found the message you put into your four games.`
` ......And through three games with different Masters, I pictured the strange sort of fate that must have toyed with your life.`
` ......I was left speechless.`
` ......In every game, you die without revealing that truth to anyone."`
`Having you confess in this empty chapel might be pointless.`
`However, even so, .........I believe it will bring you some measure of salvation.`
`People are only saved when someone understands them.`
`It's time someone forgave this pitiable witch, who went years after her death without being understood,`
` ............and whose life ended before the one man she wanted to understand her could do so.`
`At the end of the fifth game, Battler finally understood.`
`......However,`
` .........it took him so long...`
`...that he didn't make it in time.`
`So, even though she is alive here and now, Battler cannot save her.`
`That's why he's absent from {f:5:Beatrice}'s funeral. He won't come.`
` ......He won't make it in time.`
`"......This is {f:5:Beatrice}'s funeral.`
` You will confess,`
` ......the divine Master will hear,`
` .........and I will forgive you.`
` .........That's supposed to be Battler's job, but he didn't make it in time.`
` So, you'll have to settle for me."`
`"......Beato gave out so many hints, too.`
` Lambda also gave that bonehead Battler a ton of hints.`
` ......And his response, that game of repentance, that was hilarious as well.`
` ......But I won't be making anyone laugh.`
` I'll just indifferently carry out your funeral."`
`"No more talking from you.`
` That's my job."`
`"............*giggle*."`
`"If you're ready, let's begin.`
` ......No one will rush you.`
` .........{f:5:Bernkastel} has closed off time for eternity until your funeral ends.`
` You have endless time to prepare yourself emotionally..."`
`The shadowy figure slowly shook its head.`
`It had come here because it was already ready.`
`Will nodded to show he understood.`
`......Then, the two of them looked into {f:5:Bernkastel}'s eyes,`
` ......and Will spoke out clearly.`
`{a:c:`
`"Here's the culprit."}``".........Let it be heard.`
` I am one yet many.`
` What I speak is our tale.`
` However, this is a small world, sealed by glass and cork, with no one to hear.`
` None shall lay eyes upon it, and my entire tale shall be sealed away,`
` set adrift in the sea of my heart until it disappears along with the seaweed......"`
`"Ah, where is this place?!`
` And who am I?!"`
`"Then let me ask!`
` Where would you like it to be? Who do you want to be?!"`
`"Any place, so long as it will blanket me gently!`
` Anyone, so long as I am treated kindly!"`
`"Yes, for us—"`
`"For us—"`
`""Where and who we are hardly matters!!""`
`"Indeed,`
` to us, that is a very insignificant thing.`
` At least, until that day comes to pass.`
` Why must we be cast into a new fate?`
` The pronouncement of Fate arrives sudden and abrupt."`
`"It is not the fate I wished for."`
`"But it did make the heart pound...!"`
`"Where will the new fate take us?!"`
`"It doesn't matter where!"`
`""So long as that place is kind to us...!!""`
`"The tidings brought to the temporary dwelling where unfortunate children without mother or father gather—`
`do they herald God's salvation, or does the Devil beckon us to be the playthings of a new fate?`
` We have no means of knowing."`
`"And yet, we want to believe.`
` We want to believe that it is gospel, good tidings, salvation offered us by God."`
`"But why would I be chosen?`
` I have no religious beliefs!"`
`"Then this is not gospel; the Devil beckons!"`
`"And yet we have not the means to resist fate.`
` Oh, I am one yet many.`
` I pray that the new fate brings us blessings.`
` The time is April of 1976.`
` A month too cold to speak of spring.`
` There is no change in the strange new land, which ever plagues us with its stale air and ceaseless breezes......"`
`"Those are all of the family rules.`
` They may be strict, but I believe that the discipline you learn in this house will serve you well in the future."`
`"""Yes, Madam."""`
`The servants who would start working this April all called out in unison.`
`The rules of the Ushiromiya family are no more or less strict than those at the Gospel House.`
`However, here, we get paid a lot of money.`
`{n}They also give us a lot of help in finding our next job.`
`We work for the Ushiromiya family, store up money, use their influence to get a job at a good company, and start on a new, happy life.`
`......That was the dream, and it was a very realistic one, held by all of us at the Gospel House.`
`However, not everyone can become an Ushiromiya family servant.`
`{n}Only kids with a record of exemplary conduct and good grades are recommended.`
`So, all of the kids who want to be sure of leaving the Gospel House to live a happy life are feverishly devoted to their studies......`
`"That's enough for today.`
` Tomorrow, you start early.`
` Make sure the lights are all out at the appropriate time.`
` That is all."`
`"""Yes, Madam.`
` Thank you very much."""`
`After bowing until Natsuhi was no longer in sight,`
` the new servants all followed the lead of one of the more experienced servants and raised their heads.`
`"Okay, we're done for the day.`
` Starting tomorrow, you'll be following your shift schedule.`
` Madam is very strict about time.`
` If any of you sleep in, it'll be my responsibility.`
` So if you do, I'll kick you awake.`
` Got it?!"`
`Of course, this experienced servant was one of the older girls from the Gospel House.`
`{n}She's been here for two years, apparently.`
`That's probably why all the other new servants, who are older than me, seem to know her well.`
`They all chatted noisily, saying things like "Madam looks so strict" and "Dang, I'm tired."`
`"......By the way, just who is this?`
` Who chose this kid to be a servant?"`
`The older servant pointed at me and asked the room at large, a dubious look on her face.`
`It's no surprise, really.`
` Most of us become servants when we graduate middle school or high school.`
`But I'm just starting elementary school.`
`The others will be working as servants every day, according to their shifts.`
`However, I was going to go to the elementary school on Niijima with Milady,`
` only working on the weekends and when I had free time.`
`It was an exception among exceptions, something that had never happened before.`
`......It was clear at a glance that the others, who had obtained their positions after a rigorous selection process,`
` didn't like the fact that I was here too.`
`"......Both Madam and Genji‐sama have told me that you are to put your studies first.`
` But you're still getting paid.`
` Doesn't make any sense."`
`If you're going to talk behind someone's back, at least do it behind them.`
` ......She didn't even try to hide her discontent.`
`"Is this kid really that smart?`
` A child prodigy, or something?"`
`"Beats the heck out of me."`
`"I didn't know this kid at all back in the House. They kept this one separate, apparently, something to do with a weak constitution."`
`"......Now that you're here, you're part of the collective responsibility system.`
` If you screw up, it's the same as everyone from the Gospel House screwing up.`
` Make sure you don't, okay?"`
`I nodded weakly.`
` ......I'd never been threatened by someone this much older than me, and I was very frightened.`
`"Don't worry.`
` I'll help you through.`
` Let's give it our all together,`
` okay?"`
`Shannon smiled at me as she spoke...`
`"Don't you find it scary, Shannon?`
` This house looks pretty strict...!"`
`"No, there's nothing scary about it.`
` It's only scary to you because that's what you think."`
`"Then if I think it's fun, will it be fun?!"`
`"Yes, it will.`
` So just like before, let's put on a smile and give it our all."`
`"......Shannon was my only friend in the Gospel House.`
` She was confident and popular.`
` The complete opposite of me.`
` I was embarrassingly dull‐witted, and no one wanted to be my friend."`
`"I would never have made it through those days in the Gospel House had it not been for her encouragement.`
` ......So, I would probably make it through here too, with her by my side."`
`"Well, isn't it about time we got ready for bed?`
` I've got work early tomorrow morning, but you have a different job."`
`"That's right. Unlike everyone else, I have to go to school.`
` When I spend the night on Rokkenjima, I have to get ready for school and wait for Milady at the dock."`
`"Milady looks like an energetic person.`
` I hope you get along well!"`
`"D‐do you think I will...?`
` I'm scared of school, nervous...!"`
`"......I had grown used to life in the Gospel House, so the more relaxed rules at school made life easy.`
` But until I grew used to it, everything was new, and everything made me nervous."`
`My new life on Rokkenjima probably deserves an explanation.`
`It was completely different from the comfortable yet stagnant life I'd lived at the Gospel House.`
`In addition to the time I spent as a servant to the Ushiromiya family on Rokkenjima, I also traveled to the elementary school on Niijima on school days.`
`It was the start of a time that was both rushed and busy, with hardly any time to relax.`
`Unlike at the Gospel House, I didn't get to sleep in the same bed every day here.`
`Half of the week, I slept in the servants' quarters in the Rokkenjima mansion.`
`I would return from school with Milady, go to the mansion, and work there as a servant.`
` I would then stay the night and head to school with Milady again the next morning.`
`On days when I didn't have work, I would return to the dormitory on Niijima, where I could have some time to myself in the room that had been assigned to me.`
`There was an adult dorm mother who strictly controlled mealtimes and lights‐out,`
` but I was already used to that sort of life from the Gospel House, so it wasn't hard for me.`
`The rooms were slightly larger than average and housed three people each.`
`However, either because of the number of people or some lucky chance, I was not given a three‐person room.`
`"Looks like we'll share a room back here in the dorms too."`
`With Shannon by my side, I felt like I'd be able to manage well enough...`
`"Correct.`
` Every year, new servants came from the Gospel House, replacing some of the old ones."`
`"It was something Father organized with them all on his own.`
` The rest of us weren't allowed to meddle."`
`"Our family provided a strict upbringing for these children without relatives and supported them on their path to adulthood.`
` I always viewed this as the wealthy Ushiromiya family's obligation to society."`
`"What sort of kids came to serve the Ushiromiya family?"`
`"I'm sure they were diligent,`
` lovable kids of irreproachable conduct!"`
`"It seemed to me that there were a lot of glaring hyenas among them."`
`"Let us say they had high ambitions.`
` Those poor children without relatives.`
` They were determined to use this rare opportunity to launch their careers, so that they could take control of their lives."`
`"Did all of them have to balance school and servant work?"`
`"That must be tough!`
` You wouldn't be able to get much work done!"`
`"There has been no case of a servant going to school while they worked...except for that child."`
`"To be honest, I was fairly surprised when that child first came to greet me.`
` So obviously young.`
` The others were all around 16 or 18 years old, but that child looked almost ten years younger."`
`"The young servants who come from the Gospel House visit only to gain experience in working in the real world,`
` so I do not expect a high level of skill from them as servants."`
`"Very true.`
` You can't rely on them to the same degree as an adult, seasoned servant."`
`"But this was a child who hadn't even started school.`
` No knowledge of housework, no practical experience, and yet to begin compulsory education.`
` I don't know what Father was thinking, but I always thought there was something clearly odd about it."`
`"I spoke to Father about it.`
` I asked if it might be better to wait for our servants to graduate middle school before having them serve here."`
`"And what did Kinzo say?"`
`"Come on, we all know what he said."`
`""Oooooh, {f:5:Beatrice}~~!!""`
`"Hahaha...`
` By that time, he was already a complete shut‐in inside his study, obsessed with the occult.`
` If you tried to talk to him, he'd yell and tell you to stop interrupting "the journey of his mind"."`
`"And Father's decisions are absolute.`
` ......However, the case with this particular child just didn't make sense."`
`"I even asked the Gospel House about it.`
` They said to ask Genji‐san.`
` I then asked Genji‐san, and he said to ask the Master."`
`"And then you asked the Master, and he said "{f:5:Beatrice}~"!"`
`"Ahahahaha!`
` No one knows the truth!"`
`"Jessica was the only child on the island.`
` The servants would often play with my daughter, but she wanted a friend of her own age.`
` Someone she could play with at home, as well as at school."`
`"......I began to think that Father had employed this servant out of pity for Jessica.`
` ......But if that were the case, why wouldn't he talk to us about it beforehand?`
` We should be the ones to decide which friends are suitable for our daughter."`
`"Scaaaryyy! Ahahahahaha!"`
`"Natsuhi wouldn't cope well with taking her kid to the playground!"`
`"We should probably view this as an arrangement planned by Genji."`
`".........Yes, probably.`
` ......Genji‐san knew that the "me" in this other world carried Grandfather's blood,`
` so he must have made special arrangements for that "me" to be brought to Rokkenjima."`
`"Are you feeling okay now?"`
`"......It was a really big shock, that's all.`
` ......I just feel a bit dizzy now."`
`"In the world we're in now, you're the successor.`
` But if your world had been different, you could have been a servant......or maybe a witch.`
` ......You do have a troubled fate."`
`"Seriously......`
` I don't regret learning about it, but if I could forget it now, I would."`
`"*giggle*, isn't it interesting?`
` Even though you're a servant, you're actually an illegitimate child of the head......`
` Isn't that romantic, like some fairy tale?"`
`"......Romantic?`
` ......Considering how Mother must feel, I'm not sure about that."`
`"Eheheh, true.`
` In Natsuhi's eyes, the Lion of this world is nothing more than the detestable baby she was ordered to raise.`
` And this is also a world in which she refused that order."`
`"......Natsuhi's natural child, Jessica, is hundreds of times more precious to her.`
` A baby that doesn't share your blood is nothing more than a dirty, lukewarm sack of filth."`
`"Have some decency.`
` Next time, I'll be the one pinching your butt."`
`"......Thank you, Will.`
` ......I think I understand, more or less.`
` This makes it all the more important for me to be grateful to Mother.`
` She's raised me fairly all these years."`
`"Though at a probability so low it'd take a miracle to happen.`
` ......You know, animals are always brutal towards children that don't carry their blood.`
` Lions do that too, don't they? ......*giggle*giggle*."`
`"Genji's thinking must have gone something like this.`
` ......‘This is a true member of the Ushiromiya bloodline.`
` I want this child to live on Rokkenjima if at all possible.’`
` However, he couldn't suddenly bring Lion over and tell everyone everything."`
`"......I agree.`
` Maybe he intended to have me live on the island until it became normal, and then reveal everything when the chance presented itself."`
`"However, the Lion of this world was not given special treatment.`
` Notably, the silver ring doesn't exist."`
`"I wonder if that means Grandfather never heard about me."`
`"It might mean that Genji never found a good opportunity...`
`to reveal the truth..."`
`"Genji must have wanted...`
`to someday tell Kinzo the truth that the child of his beloved Beatrice was still alive.`
` However, revealing this truth would not be so easy."`
`"I wonder why it isn't easy?!"`
`"You dummy, what would happen if Natsuhi found out?!"`
`"Oh, right, if Lion suddenly appeared, Jessica wouldn't be the successor anymore!"`
`Strictly speaking, Jessica wasn't the successor to the headship, but since she'd be able to select the successor, it all came to the same thing.`
`"It is a tale that becomes less simple the more one learns of it.`
` Some would celebrate my birth; others would not.`
` ......Genji could only wait in silence for the day of revelation to come."`
`"Was it a tale hidden only within Genji's heart?"`
`"Lion and Kinzo and Natsuhi and Krauss and Jessica and everyone else!`
` None of them knew of this tale!"`
`"Thus, the curtains slowly rise on this curious tale in the year 1976.`
` Oh, I am one yet many.`
` Why must fate proceed so selfishly and freely, leaving us behind......?"`
`People only found the young servant strange for the first month.`
`Natsuhi and Krauss's protests came to naught.`
`After all, there was no harm in it.`
`So why not indulge Kinzo's whim...?`
`Eventually, everyone grew accustomed and began to accept this slightly abnormal everyday life.`
`"However, it was not so for the other servants of the Gospel House, who were always close by and who believed that everyone should be treated equally.`
` As time went on, their little grievances about my special treatment began to accumulate......"`
`"Good job, Sawachi.`
` How'd it go today?"`
`"Madam was in a real shitty mood.`
` She literally ran her finger across the windowsills!"`
`"Tadacchi got chewed out for cleaning too slow.`
` Like, what does she want from us?!"`
`The Gospel House treats all the children under its care as family.`
`Because of this, their original names are not spoken there, and everyone uses new "blessed names" instead.`
`Maybe because the "{ruby:in/on/non/ne:{p:0:音}}" character is in the word "Gospel" ({ruby:Fukuin:{p:0:福音}}),`
` that character is almost always combined with at least one character from the child's original name to make their new name.`
`......Still, just giving a person a new name doesn't mean they'll accept it so easily.`
`The boys and girls of the Gospel House, living without relatives due to all kinds of circumstances,`
` often feel as though their real first and last names are a bond that's worth holding onto.`
`So, many of the Gospel children hate their "{p:0:音}" names and call each other by nicknames based on their original names.`
`Of course, this is only privately.`
` When in the presence of the House Director or other important people, only the blessed names are used.`
`On the job, the blessed names are used.`
` And off the job, the informal nicknames are used.`
`Everyone is very used to living with two names like this, so they're all naturals at switching between the two.`
`"Whoo, you stink.`
` Go take a shower."`
`"Dang, why's it so cramped in here?`
` Can't they get a bigger dorm if they have that huge mansion?"`
`"Hey, Garashi‐sa~n.`
` Why's Yasu the only one who isn't in a three‐person room?"`
`By "Yasu", they probably mean me.`
`I can't remember my parents at all, ......but I was given the family name "Yasuda".`
`And, apparently, my nickname comes from that.`
`"How should I know? Genji‐sama's the one who decides the rooms.`
` I don't like it either."`
`"Yes, seriously!`
` Wouldn't you normally split it two and two?!"`
`"What's the deal with Yasu anyway?"`
`"It's like that kid's job is going to school with Milady or something.`
` ......A school friend position?`
` Doesn't make any sense."`
`......Of course, on days when I am given work,`
` I return to the mansion right after school and work alongside all the others.`
`I help out with caring for the garden and cleaning up the mansion.`
`{n}I can't do any jobs on my own, so I'm always just helping out.`
`......Maybe because I'm young, the adult servants are always kind to me.`
`It seems my fellow Gospel House servants are annoyed by this.`
`"Don't you think Kumasawa‐san's being blatantly soft on Yasu?`
` It's like she's mistaken Yasu for her own grandchild or something!"`
`"And why on Earth does that kid get paid the same as the rest of us?`
` I don't get it!"`
`".........I realize that you have school to worry about,`
` but don't forget that you're a servant too, okay?`
` You need to stop being a helper and learn to do work by yourself like the rest of us.`
` We aren't going to let you have things easy forever, okay?"`
`..............................`
`I have been trying my best.`
`However, I'm not very strong yet, so I can't carry heavy things.`
` I can't carry a lot of things at once, either.`
`I can't fold clothes right, and I'm not good at using a dustpan.`
`I just can't do it as well as everyone else......`
`As my face turned red,`
` ......I spotted Shannon, who was watching from the sidelines and not joining in.`
`......Shannon is my only ally.`
`{n}Unlike me, she can do everything well.`
`However, she'll never pamper me.`
`She'll show me how things are done, but she'll never steal my jobs from me.`
`She really is incredible.`
`I really want to be like Shannon, as soon as I can.`
`......She never talks behind people's backs, and no one talks behind her back.`
` She's kind, and she gets along with everyone.`
`I want to be like her.`
` And she's always kindly watching over my efforts to become like her.`
`"......Why......did I end up here?"`
`"I don't know."`
`Though I'd just been muttering to the ceiling,`
` Shannon gave me an honest answer.`
`"I guess there's no way to say it except that it's part of God's plan."`
`"Is this another test from God...?"`
`"Yep.`
` Think of it as a test to help you grow into a wonderful person.`
` After all, you're a special, chosen person."`
`"......Am I...`
`...special?"`
`"Of course you are.`
` After all, everyone else here is big, but you were the only one special enough to be chosen young."`
`"Why am I the only one who's little?`
` I can't do any jobs by myself."`
`Everyone complains that I'm just there to play with Milady.`
`And yet, Madam made it clear that I'm not to think of Milady as a friend and speak to her in a casual manner.`
`"You may be ten years younger than everyone else,`
` but that means, if you keep it up until you're the same age as the others,`
` you'll be much more experienced than the new people who come later.`
` Even Genji‐sama will acknowledge your talents, and you'll become a leader who can teach the new kids who come from the Gospel House."`
`"And then, I'm sure that everyone will respect you.`
` By that time, even Madam, the Master, and Krauss‐sama will acknowledge your skills.`
` That's your future."`
`"......You mean like the ugly duckling becoming a swan?"`
`"That might be it.`
` After all, it was very unusual for you to be chosen as an Ushiromiya family servant.`
` ......In fact, that rumor might be true,`
` and you might be the secret child of someone in the Ushiromiya family.`
` *giggle*."`
`Shannon laughed, saying "wouldn't that be cool" and "then you'd be super‐rich too".`
`But I felt a bit doubtful.`
`After all, ......if that was the case, why did I have to live all alone in the Gospel House?`
`Shannon and people like the House Director were the only ones who would play with me.`
`I wasn't allowed to play with any other friends, ......and I spent all my time by myself, in my isolated room.`
`Maybe it's because I'm frail and always half‐asleep, .........but it has been lonely.`
`"Hey, Genji!`
` How much of this did you know?"`
`"You never talk about anything, but you've known everything since the beginning, haven't you?"`
`"...................................."`
`"19 years ago,`
` you heard from Natsuhi that a servant had fallen from a cliff holding a baby."`
`"You went to the bottom of that cliff and realized that the baby was still alive, didn't you?"`
`".........The question of whether it was alive or dead...`
`was not one that I was qualified to answer."`
`"Then who was?"`
`"The doctor, of course!"`
`""What do you say, Doctor Nanjo?!!""`
`"..................`
` ......Perhaps it is fitting.`
` ...Shall I speak?"`
`"......If you would be willing,`
` ......then I ask it of you."`
`"..................`
` Very well."`
`......I was contacted by Genji‐san immediately after the accident, and I was asked to conduct an examination in secrecy.`
`"In secrecy?"`
`"Why?"`
`"......Both the Beatrice of Kuwadorian and her child were unregistered people who weren't supposed to exist.`
` It would lead to various problems if it went public..."`
`"I had started the procedures to have the baby registered, but they were not complete at that time.`
` ......It was a very bad time for the baby to "die"."`
`"So, the servant who fell was treated as the only death?"`
`"Natsuhi wouldn't talk to anyone.`
` It would've been easy to set up!"`
`"But that baby was alive, wasn't it?"`
`"Correct.`
` ......Of course, the child was gravely injured.`
` It was a miracle that it survived those injuries.`
` If some angle had been slightly different,`
` or if Genji‐san had been any slower in bringing the baby to me...`
` ......That baby only managed to survive thanks to a series of miracles."`
`".........I had given up.`
` I didn't believe the baby could survive."`
`"But it did."`
`"How strong and resilient is life!"`
`"No, this is fate."`
`"Fate!`
` So the baby was fated to live on and eventually accomplish something great?!"`
`"..................`
` ......Yes,`
` I did think that it was fate.`
` I thought the blood of the Kuwadorian Beatrice‐sama, whose life ended on Rokkenjima,`
` must have imparted something onto this child to make it survive."`
`"However, Genji did not tell his master, Kinzo, that the child had survived.`
` He simply said that it had fallen to its death in an unfortunate accident.`
` Kinzo mourned, but his mourning was more one of madness than of sorrow......"`
`"Ooh, {f:5:Beatrice}, why have you run away from me once more?!"`
`"Why, even though I swore I'd never make the same mistake again, why?!!"`
`"There was one matter for which Genji did not trust the master he so respected.`
` That matter was whether Kinzo would be capable of accepting Beatrice's grandchild as family."`
`"Genji had served the Kuwadorian Beatrice for many years as well.`
` He was very aware of what she had felt.`
` He knew that she accepted Kinzo's affection and respected him as her father."`
`"However, her love was not the same as Kinzo's love.`
` Kinzo thought her to be Beatrice reborn,`
` and tried to use her to satisfy the many feelings he had felt for the late Beatrice.`
` Of course, the Kuwadorian Beatrice could not accept those feelings.`
` In the end, Kinzo himself, the one she respected and thought of as her father...`
`stole away her chastity......"`
`"She thought he was her father, and he thought she was his wife!"`
`"Oh, what unmanageable, forbidden love!"`
`".........I do understand Kinzo‐sama's feelings to some degree.`
` It is not as though Kinzo‐sama saw the late Beatrice‐sama in the girl at the time of her birth,`
` nor did he decide at that moment to make her his plaything."`
`"He......spoke to me about it a few times when we were drinking.`
` I always thought he was just joking."`
`"As she grew up, was he surprised to find that she looked more and more like her mother?"`
`"As she became older, did he suffer from a forbidden emotion he could not suppress?"`
`"......I thought that the tragedy...`
`...might repeat itself.`
` ......That was my view."`
`"................................."`
`"Beatrice‐sama suffered much.`
` And ultimately, she never truly understood the difference between her feelings and Kinzo‐sama's.`
` .........I spoke with Beatrice‐sama many times, listening to her deepest feelings.`
` However, I could not bring myself to tell her the truth."`
`"That would be hard to say!"`
`"Imagine telling her that the one she respects as her father wants to use her as a replacement for her dead mother!"`
`"......Let me say this for the sake of Kinzo‐san's honor.`
` He also suffered greatly.`
` It pained him when he found that he could no longer think of his daughter as a daughter.`
` ......I told him to love her as a father.`
` I think Kinzo‐san listened to reason and his conscience and fought for some time..."`
`"Kinzo loved her.`
` He poured his affection onto the daughter that Beatrice had left behind.`
` He did so as a father.`
` And yet, if so, why did he give the daughter the same name as the mother?"`
`"Yes, Kinzo's sin started from the moment she received life.`
` Beatrice gave birth to her and died as if in exchange.`
` ......He passed the name down from mother to daughter.`
` From the moment of her birth, Kinzo had already decided that she was Beatrice reborn..."`
`"Lion, in other words,`
` is what happens when Kinzo, trying to atone for his sin,`
` succeeds in bringing the child into the Ushiromiya family officially."`
`"......Exactly.`
` I get the feeling I'll get my butt pinched if I talk about other fragments,`
` ......but maybe there's one where Lion is accepted...`
`...and Kinzo commits a tragedy,`
` who knows...?`
` ......Wanna see if we can find it?`
` *giggle*giggle*........."`
`"Who would want to see something like that?`
` .........Is it your job to mix together the worst imaginable possibilities for every part of a person's life and laugh at their horrible fate?!"`
`"Unfortunately, that's the sort of demon she is."`
`"{i:Witch}, thank you.`
` *giggle*......"`
`"......Genji foresaw that worst of all possible futures, and, trying to secure a better future, he intentionally lied about the baby being dead."`
`"Right.`
` Kinzo was a man of such burning desire that he took advantage of his own daughter.`
` Genji, who knew Beatrice's feelings and felt sympathy for her, couldn't trust Kinzo so easily."`
`"Even Genji, Kinzo's most devoted servant?"`
`"Genji is a man who can draw a clear line between the professional and the personal.`
` While he served Kinzo faithfully, he also felt that the mistake Kinzo had made with his daughter was not one to be forgiven easily."`
`"......Probably.`
` And to make sure that Lion wouldn't be found out easily, Genji lied about the kid's age, lowering it by three years."`
`"You're right.`
` In this world, I'm just entering elementary school in 1976.`
` I was actually supposed to become a fourth year then."`
`"If your frailness wasn't the reason, .........then Genji must have been careful to disguise the year of your birth.`
` The "baby from 19 years ago" was unforgettable not just to Kinzo, but to Natsuhi as well.`
` If a suspiciously young servant of that age came to the island, Natsuhi's feminine intuition would definitely have picked up on it."`
`Had the child been too sick to go to school for three years?`
` Or had the age been faked, so that Natsuhi wouldn't figure everything out?`
`"Either way, we know that your age has been lowered by three in this world."`
`".........Correct.`
` The age of this world's Lion has been altered by three.`
` ......This is a small, feeble kid we're talking about.`
` An underdeveloped kid.`
` It seems it was surprisingly easy to fake."`
`"Genji thought he should wait and see.`
` In the end, would Kinzo be able to accept Beatrice's child as his offspring, or not?`
` He had the child live in the Gospel House until a suitable age, and then summoned the child to the island as a young servant.`
` Neither father nor child knew the other.`
` Genji's thinking was as follows.`
` If Kinzo truly did possess the affection of a parent,`
` he would notice traces of the late mother and daughter in this child."`
`"They would surely be able to regain their parent‐child relationship without the truth needing to be revealed to anyone.`
` That was his belief.`
` ......Or, perhaps, the time might come naturally.`
` When that happened, he could tell the truth to both father and child.`
` Believing that this day would eventually come, Genji told nothing of this to anyone.`
` ......He watched over Beatrice's child, waiting for the fated day..."`
`And time continued to pass.`
`Days slid by as he quietly watched over Beatrice's child......``"Yasu.`
` What'd you do with the small broom?"`
`"......Didn't you use it to clean the window frames?"`
`Ah, ............`
`The small broom is a small, thin broom that looks like a large paintbrush.`
`We use it to clear out the dust in small corners, like window frames.`
`It's one of the cleaning tools I was put in charge of...`
`"Come on, that was your responsibility, right?!`
` What're you doing, stupid?!"`
`"Quickly, go and find it...`
` You have to do it before Madam finds out..."`
`"What's up?"`
`"Yasu lost the small broom again.`
` Is this kid some sort of genius at losing things?!"`
`"That's why I'm always telling you, never give things to Yasu.`
` Yasu's always careless and losing things."`
`"Don't say that, can't you see this kid's working hard...?`
` Come on, quickly.`
` I'll wait for you."`
`O‐okay......`
`Not wanting to hear the servants complain even more, I spun around and headed off.`
`If you lose a tool, you get in trouble.`
` If no one knows who did it, we all get yelled at,`
` so one of them will probably tell Madam that it was my fault.`
`Still, it's my fault that I lost it in the first place.`
`I wonder when I lost it.`
`{n}When, when......`
`We did a big clean of the entire chapel today.`
`The chapel is a large building behind the mansion.`
` However, no one ever goes near it, normally.`
`Even so, we're ordered to clean the chapel a few times each year.`
`Kinzo calls it a sacred building, so Natsuhi is very strict about it......`
`We cleaned every little nook and cranny, from top to bottom.`
`It took all day.`
`I'd been put in charge of cleaning the window frames, but I was also given many smaller tasks.`
`While those small jobs kept me busy, I must have completely forgotten about the small broom...`
`...and left it lying around somewhere.`
`......I hate myself for doing this.`
`{n}This isn't the first time this has happened.`
`It happens all the time.`
`Every time I set something down, it always disappears.`
`{n}It goes somewhere else. Vanishes.`
`I've come to think that these might be pranks by the witch {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`The ghost of the witch {f:5:Beatrice} borrowed the power of Rokkenjima's evil spirits to become reborn.`
`Until Kumasawa‐san told me, I never knew the meaning of the shrine on the rocks by the sea.........`
`"Kumasawa told an old, old tale, passed down among the local fishermen.`
` Rokkenjima used to be known as Akujikijima,`
` and terrible evil spirits who ate human souls lived there......"`
`"Hey, Kumasawa!`
` Let us hear too!"`
`"Tell us the scary, scary tale of Rokkenjima's evil spirits!"`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho, very well, very well.`
` Rokkenjima used to be called Azukijima.`
` However, even deeper in the distant past, it was known as Akujikijima.`
` It was rumored that sailors who got too near the island were dragged down to the bottom of the sea and had their souls eaten."`
`"......Those frightening spirits do exist on this island, you know?`
` Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho."`
`"It was Kumasawa's favorite ghost story.`
` Every new servant who came to the island heard about it.`
` .........Normally, such a story would be laughed away; however, on Rokkenjima, an island home to nothing but the Rokkenjima mansion,`
` which rumbled with eerie thunder on stormy nights, people listened to the story with unusual respect."`
`"So the shrine by the coast is there to seal evil spirits away!"`
`"And the Master has that weird occult hobby, too!"`
`"And the mansion is so creepy, something must be lurking around somewhere!"`
`"Hoh‐hohoho.`
` True, true.`
` Sealing up the spirits was all that the traveling ascetic could manage.`
` The seal just manages to hold them, but to this very day, they wander through the mansion, night after night, searching for a victim.`
` Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho......"`
`"Have you seen the Master's study?!"`
`"I have!`
` It's like some kind of demon laboratory!"`
`"There's that rumor about the Master researching demons!"`
`"They also say he's researching how to revive his mistress, Beatrice!"`
`"Didn't they say he was gathering children to be sacrifices for his magic experiments?!"`
`"Waah, scary!`
` What will I do if the Master asks me to come into the study alone?!"`
`"I heard that, long ago, one kid went into the study and never came out!"`
`"She must have been a victim of an experiment to give Beatrice's ghost a new body!"`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho.`
` Yes, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama has become a ghost, and wanders around searching for a body.`
` The VIP room on the second floor is where {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama dwells...`
` You must always be respectful when cleaning that room...`
` Otherwise...`
`.........uhi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hhi{0}hhi~!"`
`"In the eyes of those teenage boys and girls with their fertile imaginations, the ghost story was both terrifying and fascinating.`
` By experiencing and sharing in a story together, a kind of solidarity forms.`
` Then, sharing in that experience becomes obligatory,`
` and accepting the story becomes a rite of passage for joining the group.`
` That process was an old one that had repeated many times as the story was passed down."`
`"That's right.`
` Back when I first started work at Rokkenjima,`
` I heard that story from Kumasawa‐san and the older servants."`
`"I heard about it too, mostly from Nee‐san."`
`"I heard it too.`
` From Kumasawa‐san, mainly."`
`"So, not only the timid‐looking Shannon,`
` but a boy, Kanon, and a big adult, Gohda, believed in the ghost story?"`
`"Well, I didn't really {i:believe}..."`
`"There are tales of ghost stories and jinxes in all jobs.`
` There were several stories of the sort at the hotel I once worked at."`
`"So, you thought it was stupid, and you didn't pay it any mind?"`
`"......I think there was a need to blend with the community."`
`"That's it.`
` Ghost stories and jinxes are all the local rules of your workplace.`
` If a newcomer turns his nose up at them, he can't expect to blend in."`
`"Exactly.`
` ......If I said witches couldn't exist, that it was ridiculous, then I'd get into a fight with Nee‐san.`
` It was easier if I just appeared to go along with it."`
`"Come on. If you look at it that way, you'll be cursed...`
` There was one servant who got seriously injured..."`
`"Hahaha, all workplaces have stories like that.`
` No matter how incredible the ghost stories or the tales about the company founder are, you accept and believe them.`
` That's what it means to blend in with your new workplace."`
`""Wow!`
` Everyone's so mature!""`
`I went to each window around the chapel in the order I had cleaned them, searching carefully in all the places I might have left it.`
`I had been cleaning the windows with it, so I'd probably set it down near one of those.`
`......When did I leave it behind, I wonder?`
`Now that I think about it, I don't think I had it anymore when I reached the last window,`
` so I must have completely forgotten to clean that window frame.`
`"..................Ah."`
`Through the window, I could see the others leaving in groups.`
`{n}Shannon turned around and glanced up in my direction, looking worried.`
`......I don't want to be responsible for making everyone wait, so it's actually a relief that they're leaving without me...`
`Still, ......naive though it may have been, I wanted them to wait......`
`The sun's beginning to set, and the chapel's getting darker and darker.`
`{n}I don't want to hang around in a place like this all by myself.`
`I'd better find the small broom fast.`
`No, that's not all.`
` I also need to clean the window frames I forgot.`
`Madam is strict.`
` She'll probably check all of the windows carefully.`
`If she does, I'll be the one that gets in trouble tomorrow.`
`But really, where did I lose it?`
` Why did I lose it?`
`The darkness grew and grew.`
`......When it became dark enough that I would need a light before long, I began to panic.`
`I dashed around and around the chapel, tears streaming down my face...`
`As I stumbled about pathetically,`
` I could feel the presence of a prankster witch, giggling at me from under the door and up by the ceiling.`
`The ghost of {f:5:Beatrice}, the Master's mistress, wanders about in search of a body to this very day.`
`As she gains the power of Rokkenjima's evil spirits, her strength steadily grows, and she waits for the day of her resurrection.`
`And, ......for some reason, she's singled me out,`
` and if I ever take my eyes off something for a second, she snatches it away and hides it.`
`This isn't the first time this has happened.`
`Whenever I look away, .........keys, handkerchiefs, pencils, erasers...`
`all of them vanish almost right away.`
`I put things down planning to use them later, or because that's obviously the right place to leave them,`
` and still they disappear as soon as I turn around.`
`It isn't someone hiding them as a prank.`
`{n}It's happened many times when I'm the only person around.`
`......Everyone always says I'm too careless and forgetful, and they laugh at me, get mad at me.`
`I do try to be alert,`
` but like some kind of bad joke, I lose things easily when I forget about them for just a short while.`
`So, sometimes, I think "I bet this eraser is going to disappear just like everything else", and I stare at it.`
` That's the only time when it doesn't disappear.`
` Nothing disappears when I'm alert.`
`So then I think I'm safe, but the moment I start to think that and relax just a little bit, a {i:different} thing will disappear instead...!`
` Why is it always me......?!`
`{a:c:`
`*giggle*giggle*,`
` ......ehehehehahahaha......}`
`......Yeah, I hear it.`
`I can hear that witch laughing at me as I lamely run around in circles...`
`{a:c:`
`*giggle*giggle*,`
` ......ehehehehahahaha......`
`Ahahahahahahahahahaha......}`
`Listening to that voiceless laugh, I finally slammed my hands against the wall, crying tears of frustration.`
`"Please, just stop it...!!`
` Why do you always hide my things and get me in trouble?!"`
`The witch answers.`
`Fool.`
` ......Isn't it obvious?`
`Why else, except to entertain myself by watching you wander about pointlessly?`
` *cackle*cackle*, hyah{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hah{0}hah{0}hah{0}ha...!!`
`I felt so frustrated.`
` I knew all along that that was the reason, but the witch being so blatant about it was incredibly annoying.`
`I can tell.`
` That small broom {i:is} somewhere in this chapel.`
`No, that's not quite it.`
` Until the very moment I walked up to this window, I'm sure it was right by this window frame.`
`That's right, I'm sure I put it right here by this window.`
`But the prankster witch {f:5:Beatrice} uses her magic,`
` and just before I reach this spot, she instantly teleports the small broom to the next window over.`
`The instant I approach the next window,`
` a hole appears beneath the small broom, swallowing it up.`
`And it comes out by the next window after that.`
`It lands right there, perfectly still, as though it was there the whole time.`
`And this happens over and over again!`
`As I run up to one window, the small broom falls into a magic hole and goes to the next window.`
` And when I go to that window, it goes to the next window...!`
`That's exactly how she's teasing me, I can tell!`
`So no matter how much I search, it'll be useless.`
`But if I stop searching, it'll be just sitting there by one window or another.`
`So, this isn't a search.`
` It's a test of endurance.`
`I keep chasing after the small broom,`
` and {f:5:Beatrice} keeps making it escape to the next window over, trying to make me give up.`
`This is an eternal chase...that'll end only when one of us gives up...!`
`So, I keep going around in circles searching the windows, even when I know I've already searched them.`
`If it's not by this one, then the next one, and the next one.`
`And the witch keeps moving the small broom to the next window, and the next one...!`
`"Just give it a rest...!!`
` How long are you going to make fun of me?`
` This isn't the only time, you always do this, always!!"`
`{a:c:`
`*giggle*,`
` heh`
`heh`
`hah`
`ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha}...!!`
`The shrill, voiceless{FIXME?} laugh of the formless witch continues to mock my sobbing.`
`The witch is right beside me, laughing at me.`
`As I dash around the chapel, she's following along with me, taunting me.`
`Then...`
`she must be...`
`there.`
`She's right behind me, ......just over my shoulder,`
` cackling away at this very moment.`
`I know that turning around won't help, since she has no form.`
`{n}I can try to look, but I mustn't look with my eyes.`
`Once my eyes tell me there's nothing there, I won't be able to {i:{y:1:‘see’}{n:1:"see"}} anymore.`
`I learned that from the Director of the Gospel House.`
` ......You mustn't try to {y:1:see}{n:1:look} with your real eyes.`
` ......You must {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:{i:see}} with your {i:mind's} eye.`
`The whole world is filled with God's love.`
` In the many blessings of everyday life, one can find God, and angels, and the Holy Ghost.`
`{y:1:If you try to look at them with your eyes, you won't be able to see them {i:or} ‘see’ them.}{n:1:If you look with your eyes, you won't be able to see them.}`
` So you won't be able to feel them or understand them.`
`Instead, you must quietly understand them with the eye of your heart.`
`You don't look and have your eyes reflect their image.`
`{n}You {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:"see"}...{0}and picture them in your mind.`
`In this way, I learned how to recognize beings not of this world at the Gospel House.`
`......This power doesn't only allow you to {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:"see"} God.`
`{n}It allows you to {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:"see"} {i:all} those not of this world.`
`".........Please, stop it now.`
` Stop this prank."`
`"...............Hoh.`
` ......So, you can speak to me?"`
`"I'm clumsy, bad at my job, ......and I do forget where I put things a lot.`
` ......But I know which things were my fault, and which things were because of your pranks."`
`"How amusing...`
` Not only can you perceive me in my formless state, but you even understand my little game.`
` .........It seems you are a more interesting creature than I thought,`
` Yasu."`
`......I'm usually called Yasu when one of the older servants is laughing behind my back at some mistake I've made.`
`So, when I hear that name, it feels bad.`
`She deliberately called me not by the blessed name given to me by the Gospel House, but by that unblessed name.`
`Upsetting the heart is a classic move for evil beings to make.`
`{n}That is their way of attempting to prevent others from perceiving them.`
`To beings like witches, being understood is like shoving them out into the light of day.`
`"......It won't work.`
` In the Gospel House, I learned how to perceive those not of this world.`
` So, I already understand you."`
`"Very interesting.`
` ............I am a being so faint that I would scatter in a gentle breeze, yet you hold me in the grasp of your perception.`
` ......I have taken a liking to you, {i:Yasu}!"`
`"It won't work.`
` I understand you now, and you're in my grasp.`
` No matter how many unpleasant things you say, you'll just expose the ugliness of your heart."`
`Without turning around, ......I slowly let my field of vision fill the entire chapel.`
`It was as though the viewpoint of my soul was floating out from the shell of my head.`
`......See,`
` ............inch by inch,`
` ......my field of vision is floating out of my head...`
`...and drifting upwards.`
`As I looked down at myself, standing there with head hanging and eyes tightly shut...`
`...my mind's eye...`
`...very slowly...`
`......rose up to the ceiling of the chapel.`
`And when I looked down from there...`
`...I looked down at myself, standing in the center of the chapel, .........and the witch standing behind me.`
`......Apparently, the witch realized that she was being {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen}.`
`She turned around...`
`......and raised her eyes to look at my mind's eye, floating by the ceiling...`
`......At last,`
` I could {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} the witch {f:5:Beatrice}...`
`...with my mind's eye......`
`"A mere {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}...`
`...grasped my form......?"`
`The demonic lips......twisted in an ugly curve.`
`{n}It was clearly a challenging, repulsive, ......demon's smile...`
`She wore a blood‐red dress and hat.`
` The design was completely different from anything {y:0:Humans}{n:0:humans} wore.`
`Her hair was blonde.`
` It had countless beautiful curls, like a princess from a picture book,`
` ......but there was no trace of cuteness about her.`
`"......I thought you were a little different from the other {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s,`
` but it seems I was mistaken."`
`"........................"`
`"You are not just a little different......you are {i:entirely} different from other {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s.`
` *cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"You sad witch, who can be seen by no one, heard by no one.`
` ......Have you been pulling these pranks all the time just to catch the attention of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s...?"`
`"I use what little magic I have to interfere when {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s aren't looking, but no matter what I do, none of them think of it as magic.`
` ......They decide that they just made a little mistake,`
` and blow my existence away like the candles on a cake."`
`"If so, then I've just saved you.`
` Because I understand you...and perceive you."`
`"......Saved me?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` To me, this meeting with you is nothing more than a new way to kill time."`
`"It's getting dark.`
` I don't have the time to play with you anymore."`
`"Well, well, so it is.`
` My apologies. When one is engrossed, one hardly notices the time."`
`".........Please give it back.`
` My cleaning tool."`
`"That small broom, or whatever you call it?`
` It's right there, by the next window."`
`"But as soon as I get close, you'll move it to the next window over."`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` My magic is as elusive as my very own form.`
` With no more than a snap of my fingers, everything here is under my total control...!"`
`The witch snapped her fingers, and various things throughout the chapel were sucked into black pitfalls beneath them, disappearing.`
`No, they didn't disappear.`
` The instant they vanished into the dark holes, other dark holes appeared in completely different parts of the chapel, and the vanished objects fell out of those.`
`Chairs, musical scores, clocks, and vases started appearing and disappearing all across the room.`
`I felt as though countless tools were flying about the chapel......`
`"I can perform these acts, but I choose not to.`
` After all, this would be a bit more than a prank, don't you agree...?"`
`I wonder where a witch draws the line between pranks and magic.`
`When she snapped her fingers again, all of the objects flying about so energetically returned to their original spots,`
` and silence fell.`
`"I've taken a liking to you.`
` ......You say you have me in your grasp?`
` *cackle*cackle*!`
` That works in reverse.`
` I have you in mine."`
`".............................."`
`The Gospel Director told me that I mustn't try to {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:"see"} evil beings.`
`If you {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:"see"} them, they will haunt you.`
`Now that I understood this witch, a bond had been formed between us.`
`"That is correct.`
` Now that you have acknowledged my existence, I have formed a bond with you.`
` ......After all the years I have spent in boredom, it will be nice to have someone to talk to, even a child as young as you."`
`"I'll talk to you from time to time.`
` So, will you stop pulling pranks like this?"`
`"No, I won't be here to talk to you, but to play with you!`
` *cackle*cackle*. And if we're playing, pranks are just part of the game, right?"`
`"................................."`
`"Heheh.`
` ......Very well.`
` I've had enough fun for one day.`
` The sun has sunk and the moon is full.`
` I am tired after appearing in front of you for so long.`
` Let us call it a night.`
` That single broom provided me a great deal of entertainment...!"`
`"Please, give it back."`
`"No.`
` I will keep this as a token of our meeting.`
` I assume that you will be fine with this?"`
`"......If I said I'm not, would you give it back to me?"`
`"I never listen to {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s!`
` .........However, I might lend an ear to a friend."`
`"......If you give it back, ......I'll acknowledge you as a friend."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!`
` Foolish {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}, was that your idea of an attractive proposal...?!`
` ......If you want to make a deal with me, try drawing a mysterious magic circle or two!`
` .........And yet, I might be willing to consider your offer."`
`"What do you mean, you might...?"`
`"I shall take my time in deciding whether you are worthy to be my friend.`
` ......After all, witches are like demons!`
` If you ask us for an answer, we will never give one right away.`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`".........Alright.`
` Then, .........I'll leave the small broom with you.`
` Please give it back when you decide to become my friend."`
`"Very well.`
` Will this broom become a bridge of friendship between us, or not?`
` ......I will hang onto it for now, making my decision in my own good time."`
`When the witch snapped her fingers, the broom for which I had searched so long fell out of a hole in the air,`
` landing between the fingers she had just snapped...`
`"This is goodbye.`
` ......This game with you was far from boring.`
` Let us play again sometime."`
`"If you're my friend, that is."`
`"When a cat toys with a mouse, does it try to become friends with it first?`
` *cackle*cackle*, ahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haa!!"`
`The witch faded away......`
`{n}As she did, my mind's eye slowly closed......`
`When I returned to my body, I felt suddenly tired and let out the breath I'd been holding.`
`......Of course, when I turned around, there was no one to be seen.`
`I couldn't feel the witch's presence anywhere anymore.`
`{n}It had gotten very dark by this time.`
`I decided to leave the chapel.`
`{n}There's no point in searching for the small broom any longer.`
`......Not until the witch decides to give it back.`
`I went out of the chapel.`
`The chapel key had been left in the lock.`
`{n}I used it to lock the door.`
`............What am I going to do about the small broom?`
`There's nothing I can do.`
` I can't even blame the witch.`
`I must acknowledge that I'm responsible for giving the witch a chance...`
`"..............................nn—"`
`I happened to glance downwards......and saw a small broom lying there by my feet.`
`It was the broom I had been searching for all this time.`
`......Don't tell me...`
`that it'll be swallowed up by a dark hole the instant I bend over to pick it up...?`
`No.`
` This is...a sign from the witch.`
`A sign that she acknowledges me as a friend.`
`I picked it up.`
`Oh, I am one yet many.`
`"The first friend I made after coming to the island was apparently not a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} at all.`
` However, when I think back on it, it was only natural.`
` What other sort of friend would you expect to make on a witch's island?`
` This was the first meeting between me and {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"......However, as the more perceptive among you may have noticed, this was not a meeting with the real {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` The witch I then called {f:5:Beatrice} would later be known by another name."`
`"......However, the fact remains that she was clearly not human.`
` And being bonded with one who is not human means being bonded with their world.`
` I still had no means of knowing the strange fate that awaited me on Rokkenjima......"``"Yeah, seriously.`
` Not only was Yasu slow‐witted, that kid also lost stuff all the time."`
`"But even so, Yasu always had this look that said "I didn't lose it! I put it down and someone took it away!"`
` It really pissed me off!"`
`"That kid just didn't know how to concentrate.`
` If you do things without thinking, it's no surprise that your actions grow careless."`
`"But it was only like that in the beginning, right...?`
` After some time, that kid started concentrating, and all of that bad stuff stopped happening......"`
`"Hmm, really?`
` Well, it was all stuff that anyone should be able to do anyway."`
`"Learning to do things that everyone can do is part of growing up.`
` I doubt the rest of you were so clever about everything when you first started, yes?"`
`"......Are you kidding?`
` If we weren't clever, we'd never have been selected to work for the Ushiromiya family."`
`"We're supposed to be the elite!!`
` The fact that Yasu was young was no excuse."`
`"That's right.`
` ......If Yasu is supposed to learn cleverness by growing up, then that should be done before coming to work for the Ushiromiya family."`
`"Come on...`
` That kid worked really hard to balance school and work...`
` I think you're all being too harsh..."`
`"We were selected because we made it through a harsh process, right?`
` There's no need for us to pamper Yasu."`
`"I'm sick of this.`
` I don't get why someone as dull‐witted as Yasu was chosen!"`
`"Being selected as an Ushiromiya family servant was an achievement that all Gospel children respected.`
` The older servants had achieved glory by making it through the strict selection process.`
` Yasu was so clumsy that they all wondered why that child had been selected."`
`"......Of course, Yasu was working very hard for a child of that age.`
` However, the older servants were unsatisfied,`
` and before long, they started being mean to Yasu whenever they got the chance.`
` Even after getting used to life on Rokkenjima, Yasu could not make a single friend.`
` At least, not any {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} friends......"`
`"Hoh‐hohohoho.`
` Yes, that can sometimes happen, and always when you're busy.`
` Perhaps a fairy is pulling pranks on you."`
`"......It's a witch pulling pranks on me.`
` I mean, I know I put it right there, and all I did was glance around a bit, ...and it disappeared..."`
`The witch pranked me again.`
`I left my master key behind,`
` Madam found out, and I got in a lot of trouble.`
`......Why, when I always put my master key back in my pocket after I use it...`
` ......Why was it in a place like that......?`
`And this is the third time it's happened.`
`The first two times, I realized that it wasn't in my pocket, and managed to find it before anyone found out.`
`But the third time, Madam found it.`
`I was really mad and frustrated with that witch in the red dress.`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama's pranks can be quite troublesome.`
` But if you're dealing with a witch, shouldn't you be able to use some sort of charm?"`
`"A charm...?"`
`Kumasawa‐san started fishing through the kitchen cupboards, saying "now where did that get to".`
`The thing she finally found and brought to me...was a kite string.`
`She stretched it out for me to see, then used a knife to cut off a 50 cm piece.`
`"Try tying this end to the key,`
` then tie the other end to your pocket button or some other place that doesn't stick out.`
` ......This is the spiderweb charm."`
`"Spiderwebs?`
` Like the ones the evil spirits of Rokkenjima fear?"`
`"Good, I'm glad you remember.`
` It is said that the spiderwebs on this island are imbued with magical power, and that they are very effective at repelling evil.`
` See? If you stretch it out like this, it looks like a spiderweb, doesn't it?`
` Hoh‐hoh‐ho, this way, that spiderweb‐hating {f:5:Beatrice} won't be able to prank you anymore."`
`That......does make sense.`
`It really does look like a spiderweb when pulled tight.`
` .........Since Kumasawa‐san says so, it must have some pretty strong evil‐repelling power.`
`I can just ask her to make several of these kite strings for me, and then I can tie them to everything I don't want to lose.`
`......But, clearly, that won't be very practical.`
`I'd have strings all over me.`
`"What about things I can't keep tied to me,`
` ......like pencils and erasers?"`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho, for times like that, there's a different charm.`
` All you have to do is make a house for {nobr:Mr. Pencil} and {nobr:Mr. Eraser}."`
`Make a house...?`
` ......You mean, build a roof and a bed and stuff??`
`"You aren't actually building a house, you're giving them one.`
` ......For example, take {nobr:Mr. Knife} here, who I cut the string with.`
` "{i:I wanna go ho~me!}" he says.`
` Eheheheh, he gets lonely when he's left alone, so he always wants to go home right away.`
` So, if you leave him anywhere else, he'll be lost and start crying."`
`"......See, I left {nobr:Mr. Knife} lying around, and now he's gotten lonely and started to cry."`
`"......Poor thing.`
` We need to get {nobr:Mr. Knife} home..."`
`"Here is {nobr:Mr. Knife}'s house.`
` See, his whole family of knives is waiting for him.`
` "{i:Mama~, I'm ho~me.}" "{i:Welcome ba~ck.}" See?"`
`Kumasawa‐san returned the knife to the knife‐holder under the sink.`
`Even though she had done something so ordinary, I felt slightly moved, as though the lost little knife had finished his adventure and finally returned home.`
`Once he slid into the spot he was supposed to be in,`
` ......everyone in the knife family was together again, and they all started talking happily...`
`Then, Kumasawa‐san said we should give them their privacy,`
` and shut the door...`
`"The poor things hidden by the witch must get lonely easily.`
` So, when the witch tells them she'll take them somewhere fun, they're just happy to go along with her.`
` How do you think we can stop this from happening?"`
`"Take them home right away......"`
`"Exactly.`
` They're lonely, naughty kids, so they'll go with the witch if they get the chance.`
` So, you must always take them home quickly."`
`"......Look at {nobr:Master Key} there you just tied to a string.`
` He's sitting there all alone, crying and asking you to put him in his home in your pocket."`
`{i:*sob*sob*}......`
` {i:I'm lonely.}`
`The voice of the lonely master key finally reached my ears.`
`I hurried to pick it up,`
` took the other end of the string and tied it to my pocket button, and put the key in my pocket.`
`"See, "{i:I'm ho~me}".`
` {nobr:Master Key} gets lonely so easily, so let's take him home right after we use him, okay?`
` If you keep making little friends like this, even {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama won't be able to prank you much longer..."`
`Jangle, thud.`
`When break time was over and I stood up to see what I should help with next,`
` I felt a tug, and the key ring with the master key fell to the floor.`
`......Once again, I had left the master key on the side of the sofa...`
`and forgotten it was there.`
`The instant I stood up, the string pulled on it and it fell to the floor.`
`Without Kumasawa‐san's spiderweb charm,`
` I would probably have left that master key lying here again.`
`The master key left all alone would have been led away by the witch and disappeared...`
`Whew, that was close...`
`And, once again, I heard the master key, who had almost been left alone, cry and tell me that it wanted to go home...`
`".........I'm sorry.`
` Come on, let's go back home to my pocket..."`
`{i:Yay, I'm home!}`
` {i:Back at last!}`
`..............................`
`......Thank goodness.`
` ...I almost got pranked by the witch again......`
`"Oh, what's this...?!`
` Nice trick, using string like that!"`
`All of a sudden, I heard a wild, shocked voice from over my shoulder.`
`It was a voiceless voice.`
` A witch's voice, the kind you can't hear unless you try.`
`".........{f:5:Beatrice}...?"`
`"That's me, my friend.`
` You forgot about your key again, so I was just about to use it to toy with you...!"`
`"It's a spiderweb charm that Kumasawa‐san showed me.`
` It seems to work very well."`
`"Indeed.`
` I hate to admit it, but it does.`
` I have no desire to touch that.`
` After all, you wouldn't want to put your finger on a razor and slide it across, would you?"`
`"......Uwa, ......that's a scary example...`
` My finger hurts just thinking about it..."`
`"But good for you.`
` You managed to avoid Natsuhi yelling at you for losing your key.`
` *cackle*cackle*, you should be thanking me!"`
`"Why?"`
`"You learned about the charm because I annoyed you, did you not?`
` Thanks to that charm, you have managed to take care of the forgetfulness that made you leave keys lying around.`
` In other words, it is all thanks to me.`
` Wahahahaha, it is only natural that I be thanked, don't you agree?"`
`"Nn, ......nnnnn......"`
`I really don't like it, but she does have a point.`
`Because of all the trouble {f:5:Beatrice} caused me, I told Kumasawa‐san and learned the charm from her.`
`Even without the witch's pranking,`
` ......if I didn't have the charm, I would have gone to my next job and left the master key here.`
`If that happened, ......then surely, I wouldn't have been able to find the key, and it would've been a big mess.`
`"This is what they call punishment to teach someone a lesson.`
` By magnifying your mistakes, I've shown you what they are, as a friend.`
` And you have grown splendidly as a result."`
`"......Nn, nnnn......`
` I get the feeling that Kumasawa‐san's the one I should be thanking, not you."`
`"My, my.`
` What a thankless job we witches have.`
` *cackle*."`
`"Anyway,`
` I win this time.`
` Okay, I need to get back to work now."`
`"Very well, my friend.`
` We'll call this your victory."`
`"However, giving up is not my forte.`
` I shall keep watching you, even more closely now, until I can even the score.`
` Prepare yourself.`
` There are countless small items that a person like you is likely to forget.`
` You can't attach string to all of them.`
` *cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"The spiderweb charm isn't the only one I have.`
` ......I also learned the "take them home" charm.`
` I won't let you have your way anymore."`
`"Hmph.`
` Let us see how well you can actually do.`
` On another matter,`
` that's quite the bright smile you've got there.`
` When a witch comes, that's a time to cry, not laugh.`
` Your break time is over.`
` See if you can manage to do your job today without slowing down the older servants."`
`"Sure. Today is Sunday, and the weather is wonderful.`
` I'd better do my best."`
`"Go do whatever you can.`
` Oh, that's right, Reine ({p:0:玲音})'s been in a bad mood all morning.`
` I suggest you avoid eye contact with her.`
` Also, your fortune for the day is "water hazard".`
` Make sure you take care when standing near buckets of water.`
` ......I am well aware of your weaknesses.`
` I will be waiting for you to knock over a bucket and get scolded just like usual."`
`"*giggle*.`
` ......Thank you, {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`Back when I could not yet {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} her...`
`{n}I simply hated this prank‐loving witch.`
`But now that I could talk with her, ......it seemed to me that she was not all bad.`
`Of course, I felt no need to be grateful to her.`
`The witch {f:5:Beatrice} despises boredom, and subsists on mocking the misfortune of others.`
`{y:0:Human}{n:0:Human}s and witches are different.`
` Incompatible beings.`
`And yet, ......it felt as though we could become friends.`
`Of course, she was still a witch.`
` I could not afford to be careless.`
`However, not being careless is a very good thing.`
`Using charms and tricks to pay attention, so that her pranks would no longer work on me, was not a bad thing by any means.`
`Those techniques would be useful for my job and my life, even without the witch's pranks.`
`Yes, this witch called {f:5:Beatrice} would go to any lengths to make a point.`
`{n}I learned that it was possible to build up a friendship through verbal abuse...`
`"Ever since then, there was an incredible change in that kid."`
`"Because of all the charms?!"`
`"Hoh‐hohoho.`
` That's right.`
` What an assiduous child.`
` All of the charms I taught were followed with great dedication."`
`"With strings attached to everything?`
` Or else that "going ho~me" thing?"`
`"Yes.`
` That kid would sometimes say it out loud.`
` It was really cute, like watching someone play house with a bunch of tools."`
`"Just like a kid!"`
`"The kid {i:was} a kid, silly!"`
`""Ahhahahahahahahahahahaha!!""`
`"With adults, you can say something one way and all of them will understand.`
` However, there really are many different types of kids, and you need many different ways to teach them things.`
` If you can find just the right way, they learn quite easily."`
`"Some kids learn better when they're punished, and some learn better when they're praised."`
`"I used to scare a neighborhood kid and tell him that a fairy would take his things if he didn't put them away after using them.`
` Hoh‐hoh‐ho, this was the same, except the fairy became a witch......"`
`"Still, doesn't that sound like fate?!"`
`"After all, you knew this kid was Beatrice's child, didn't you?"`
`"Yes, I did know."`
`"So you told Beatrice's child that "the witch {f:5:Beatrice} will play pranks on you unless you put your stuff away neatly"...`
` ......That's kind of funny, isn't it?"`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho......`
` I just thought of it after the child came and told me that a witch was stealing things and pulling pranks."`
`"I took it as a sign that the late Beatrice‐sama had become a witch...`
`and was coming to teach her child to keep track of things.`
` ......That's why I thought this the best way to teach that child."`
`"That kid started out with a bad reputation for forgetting and losing things,`
` but got a lot more cheery after overcoming those bad habits."`
`"By overcoming weaknesses, those weaknesses become strengths,`
` and that is how people gain confidence and grow up.`
` ......Those tiny spurts of growth, day by day, were precious to watch over.`
` Yes, it was as though I was watching the growth of my very own grandchild."`
`"""Thank you, Genji‐sama."""`
`"......Good work with the big cleanup today.`
` The guest rooms are rarely used, but we can never predict when an important guest might stay the night.`
` You must not allow yourselves to become complacent when cleaning them."`
`"Of course.`
` All of us are fully aware of this fact."`
`"......I wish that were the case.`
` When I looked around, I found this.`
` Whose is it?"`
`Genji took a master key ring out of his pocket.`
`{n}......Apparently, someone had dropped their master key.`
`All of the servants swung around to look at me, the usual offender.`
`"Come on. Yasu again?"`
`"Y‐you shouldn't be so quick to judge."`
`"I have mine, of course.`
` There's no way I'd drop something that important.`
` And the rest of you?!"`
`"I have mine..."`
`"Got it!"`
`"So, it {i:was} you, Yasu!`
` Do you still not get it, even after that scolding Madam gave you?!`
` You're just so...!"`
`"......Normally,`
` I would cower and apologize under their glares, whether I was guilty or not.`
` However, I had changed.`
` So, I proudly held up the key with the spiderweb string still attached......"`
`".....................Hoh.`
` ......You tied it up to keep yourself from dropping it.`
` A laudable attitude."`
`Genji‐sama's face was as expressionless as ever.`
` However, those were unmistakably words of praise.`
`"*giggle*, that's right.`
` You won't drop them anymore.`
` After all, you have your charm now."`
`......That's right.`
`"I nodded proudly, a huge smile on my face.`
` The proud experience of that day, of that moment,`
` would inscribe an unforgettable page in the memory of my young life......`
` In that case, whose key did Genji find......?"`
`"...............!"`
`There was only one servant who hadn't raised their key.`
`As she muttered "It has to be Yasu's key!`
` Of course it's not mine",`
` and fished in her pocket, her face went pale...`
`"There is no room for complacency in the everyday duties of a servant.`
` Nevertheless, mistakes do happen.`
` I will not criticize you for a single mistake; however, blaming a fellow servant instead of reflecting on your own actions is not an attitude I would consider praiseworthy."`
`"M‐`
`my...`
`...apologies..."`
`The older servant turned red and hung her head.`
`Behind her, ......though no one else could see it, was the witch.`
`"*cackle*!`
` My friend will not make the same mistake again.`
` I am ever on the lookout for signs of weakness, yet even I have not yet been presented a single further opportunity!`
` But this is a shame.`
` If I had known this girl here would lose her key, I could have pranked her this time...!"`
`"Please don't prank people other than me."`
`"Huh?`
` Did you say something?"`
`"N‐no, nothing......"`
`"I tried not to feel schadenfreude,`
` but after being called dull‐witted for so long, I was finally able to hold my head up high.`
` After that day, I was at last able to feel as though I had become accustomed to life as a servant of the Ushiromiya family......"`
`"When people compliment you, you feel like you've been accepted!"`
`"It is very important.`
` People cannot grow without it."`
`"And what happens when people grow?"`
`"Firstly, the mind is freed up.`
` You become able to carry out jobs with confidence, jobs that you initially carried out while worrying that you might be doing them the wrong way."`
`"You're right!`
` Once you become comfortable in your work, that does free up the mind!"`
`"And what happens once the mind is freed up?"`
`"You can then enjoy your days more.`
` To use Genji's words, you might say that it gives you the freedom to be a little bit complacent."`
`"If you're tense all the time, that just wears you out!`
` It's good to relax a bit, if you can!"`
`"You mean, you learn so much that you can start slacking off on the job?"`
`"It sounds bad when you put it that way.`
` However, there is nothing wrong with skillfully carrying out your tasks quickly and using your free time to enjoy yourself.`
` Times like that are what enrich a person's life."`
`"Come to think of it, Gohda plays crosswords a lot between jobs!"`
`"He also invents dishes with leftover ingredients!"`
`"Playing a bit and refreshing yourself can also be good for your efficiency.`
` You might say that inventing dishes combines work and play."`
`"Even Genji slacks off when no one's looking.`
` He'll watch TV or swipe some of his master's drink.`
` And he reads complicated books."`
`""Even Genjiiiiiii?!""`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` In short, it's all about cleverly using the gaps between jobs to play.`
` If it goes too far, it can be called complacency.`
` However, people only become mature when they learn to balance work with pleasure.`
` Simply put, if all you care about is work all the time, you're not fully mature."`
`"So, that kid learned how to play between jobs?"`
`"It's hard to imagine that serious kid slacking off at work!"`
`"It started with interaction.`
` That kid formed a relationship with Kumasawa, the person who was always kind,`
` and started borrowing books from her and talking together about them."`
`"Even I had friends at school, but because of my work, there was no chance to deepen our friendship.`
` Jessica never concerned herself with her status and was always kind to me, but there was Natsuhi's stern order to think of, so we were unable to play together very much."`
`"......So, at that time, it was Kumasawa, the one who was always as kind as a mother to me, who was the person I felt closest to."`
`"The two of them were as distant in age as a grandmother and her grandchild.`
` They did not run around and play together.`
` Instead, the child developed an interest in Kumasawa's hobby."`
`"And what's Kumasawa's hobby?!"`
`"Books.`
` It might be hard to believe, but Kumasawa was a pretty big fan of mystery novels."`
`"The kid wanted to find out what sorts of books they were and started reading them?"`
`"That's right.`
` The nice thing about mystery novels is that you can talk about them while you read them.`
` Even Kumasawa, who already knew the answer, must have enjoyed listening and hearing...`
`what sorts of theories a young intellect could create."`
`"Of course, I didn't start right away with the difficult books Kumasawa read.`
` First, I asked for her recommendations and got books from the school library.`
` I would even bring them into the servant room and read a bit during every break."`
`"Every time a new theory popped into my head, I told Kumasawa about it,`
` and she, who already knew the answer, would give non‐committal responses and grin.`
` ......That was a lot of fun for me."`
`"Are you going to take a bath?`
` Bath time's almost over."`
`"......Yeah, ...just a bit more......`
` Another one of the figures just disappeared..."`
`"*giggle*.`
` You've become a total mystery nut.`
` If you get too excited reading, you won't be able to sleep again."`
`".........According to Kumasawa‐san, the culprit has already appeared...`
` But I don't have a clue who it is..."`
`"What kind of story is it?"`
`"It starts with everyone receiving an invitation to a small island.`
` No boat is coming to pick them up, and one by one, they're being found dead in a way that's connected to the nursery rhyme, and each time, one of the figures disappears......`
` ......It's really interesting.`
` Almost like it's a crime happening on Rokkenjima."`
`"Yes, that's a really famous mystery novel.`
` Wasn't that one a perfect crime, at least until the culprit confesses to the truth in a message bottle at the end?`
` An incredible book."`
`"Shhh,`
` shhh!`
` I'm enjoying myself, so don't spoil me!`
` Go take a bath now, I'll go by myself later...!"`
`"Okay, okay.`
` ......See you later then.`
` Don't forget to take a bath, okay?"`
`Shannon picked up a change of clothes and smiled amusedly as she left the room.`
`I probably won't be able to read the whole thing tonight.`
`Even though I know that, I just keep turning the pages, unable to find a good place to stop.`
`My new joy, the mystery genre.`
`{n}The mental game of thinking and theorizing.`
`And also talking about it with Kumasawa‐san.`
`......All of that left me enraptured.`
`"You've become a complete bookworm.`
` Well, if you do stay up and get sleepy, that just makes my job all the easier."`
`"We can't have that.`
` I'd better find a place to stop soon."`
`"*cackle*.`
` .........In the times of old when I was born, there were no such pleasures as mystery novels.`
` I have been reading over your shoulder, and this really is an interesting book."`
`"Beato, who do you think is the culprit?"`
`"In the book you are reading?"`
`"Yeah.`
` Who is the sender of the message bottle, I wonder..."`
`"The culprit who lured the victims to the island, of course."`
`"There are only ten people on this island.`
` And the sender of the message bottle is "UNKNOWN"......"`
`"No doubt the person who stranded the ten of them there is somewhere far away, waiting patiently for all of them to starve to death."`
`"No, that's not right.`
` He or she is on the island.`
` They're one of the ten.`
` I just don't know who..."`
`"How do you know that there are only ten people on the island?"`
`"......That's just how it is."`
`Since if you don't trust that, what can you trust, or it's just one of the assumptions of the mystery genre, ......or...hmmm...`
`"It is the owner of the island, correct?`
` They might be hiding in some hidden room.`
` Or maybe they're like me!`
` They may be a thousand year old witch!`
` No, no, if they had to go to all this trouble just to kill ten people, they couldn't be a thousand years old.`
` 495 years old at most, I'd say. *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"Locked rooms do appear a lot in mystery novels.`
` And books often use a phrase like "it could only conceivably have been done with magic" to describe them.`
` ......And here I am, with a witch right before my eyes. It's a complicated feeling."`
`"Pft, *cackle*cackle*!`
` Very entertaining, these locked‐room murders.`
` ......Once you read the answer, it becomes a tale about humans, or a mystery novel.`
` But, if you rip out the part that reveals the answer and throw it away,`
` it becomes a tale about witches, or a fantasy novel."`
`".........Hmmm?`
` That's an interesting way to look at it.`
` So, you're saying that there's only a razor‐thin margin between human novels and witch novels when it comes to mysteries?"`
`"If a trick exists, it is a human novel.`
` If not, it is a witch novel.`
` If you just tear out the last few pages of that book you're reading,`
` you might think of that person as {f:5:Unknown}, a witch on the same level as me...!"`
`"......That might be surprisingly wise, coming from you.`
` ......So, the culprit of detective novels without an answer is a witch."`
`"All of the dark places in this world belong to us witches.`
` Therefore, I could reign as the culprit of all detective novels old and new across the world."`
`"Except, if you reason it out right and find the true answer, then the witch is done for."`
`"*cackle*cackle*.`
` Detective novels are quite interesting, it seems.`
` This looks to be a truly entertaining mental game."`
`"That's right.`
` This is a mental game.`
` You fight against the book, make a theory, and then have debates to battle friends who have also read the book."`
`"Not only that. It is also a battle between witch and human.`
` Will you allow my locked‐room murders, my magic, to withstand scrutiny.....or will you deny it?`
` A mystery is a game of chess by another name!"`
`"........................`
` ......So, I'm not reading a book alone, but playing a game against you?"`
`"Indeed!`
` As Shannon said a short while ago,`
` this story apparently has the truth revealed by a message bottle at the end.`
` In other words, if you cannot expose the truth of the tale before that point, you lose."`
`"After all, the message bottle just happened to drift somewhere that it could be seen.`
` If it got smashed and sank before anyone saw it, this would be a perfect crime,`
` a crime impossible for humans to accomplish—a crime committed by a witch."`
`"......That's a fun way to look at it.`
` A battle between me and the witch.`
` ............Yeah.`
` I really like thinking of it that way."`
`"*cackle*!`
` Starting now, and until you finish reading,`
` I am {f:5:Unknown}, the 495‐year‐old witch!`
` Can you see through my deserted island murder tricks?`
` Ahi{0}hhya{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!"`
`"......I have formed one theory.`
` You want to play with me, don't you?`
` I've been reading books so much, you've gotten lonely."`
`"That too!"`
`"Pft—"`
`""Hahahahahahahahahahaha......""`
`......Incidentally...`
`The game Beato and I played with this book ended with my defeat.`
`In the end, I wasn't able to build a satisfying theory, and I had to learn the truth from the message bottle.`
`Luckily, it did manage to drift into human hands.`
` If it had sunk to the bottom of the ocean, as Beato had suggested, I would have had no way of knowing the truth.`
`In other words, I would have been forced to accept that the sender of the message bottle was a witch.`
`Mystery—I once thought it was just a genre for novels.`
`To think that it could so easily become a fight between witches and humans, truth and fantasy.`
`I was instantly enraptured by this new "game".`
`As the months passed by, I read through all of the mystery novels in the school library,`
` and started to read mystery novels for adults.`
`I discussed them with Kumasawa.`
` I discussed them with Shannon.`
`{n}I played my game of theory chess, the fight between witches and the truth.`
`How enjoyable those days were......`
` Oh, I am one yet many.`
`Here's to the fun game of the mind that enraptured me......``The months and years slid by.`
`In my new, more colorful life, I smiled at the spring sunshine peeking through the trees, gazed up at the column of summer clouds,`
` enjoyed the piles of fallen leaves in autumn, and played in the winter snow the few times it did fall.`
`As these days passed one after another, there was a considerable change to my environment.`
`That was a complete rotation in the servants from the Gospel House.`
`There weren't specific grades like in school, so there was no rule saying how long a servant could work before quitting.`
`Each servant made their own decision about when they would "graduate" from Rokkenjima.`
`Some of those who couldn't stand the environment would quit in as little as three days.`
`After all, life on Rokkenjima was strict.`
`It was also strict in the Gospel House, of course, but there were a lot of Rokkenjima‐only rules,`
` and Natsuhi, the one who supervised the servants, was also very authoritarian.`
` It was probably easy to feel constrained.`
`That constrained feeling and the money sat on opposite sides of the scale that they used to decide the time of their graduation.`
`And sometimes, someone from the Ushiromiya family would use their influence to secure someone a new job, encouraging them to spread their wings and start a new life.`
`The cycle usually lasted two or three years.`
`No one decided this, but it was one of the goals most servants shot for, an unspoken rule.`
`However, I was an exception to that rule.`
`I continued to live as a servant while going to school in Niijima......`
`That year, all of the Gospel House servants quit at once.`
`It wasn't at all rare for friends to quit at the same time as each other.`
`All of my fellow servants from the Gospel House graduated from the island at once, leaving only me behind...`
`Of course, I hadn't been on particularly good terms with them.`
`On the contrary, it was annoying to be treated like a kid and called Yasu all the time.`
`Even when new servants had joined,`
` the older ones got them believing that "Yasu loses things all the time",`
` so things had still been unpleasant even then.`
`Those unpleasant older servants, as well as the ones who started at the same time or after I did, all quit at once.`
`The Ushiromiya family had no quarrel with those who left.`
` Adult servants were easier to handle in the first place.`
`The Gospel House servants were only accepted so that they could be trained.`
`So, all of the servants except for me left, and no one tried to stop them......`
`"Later, Yasu.`
` Don't go losing stuff again."`
`"......I don't lose things anymore."`
`"Hmph, later.`
` Make sure you listen to what Madam says.`
` Don't you go troubling the next group of servants."`
`"......You know, it's still a mystery.`
` Why did someone recommend Yasu?"`
`"It's even more surprising that Madam let Yasu stay this long."`
`"Hey, at least the kid's got the guts to not give up and run away.`
` Keep it up, {i:Yasu}."`
`"I, I......hate being called Yasu..."`
`At the very end, ......I finally said the one thing I'd always wanted to say to them.`
`However, they basically ignored me, and just picked up their things and left...`
`"........................"`
`"......Guess you never got a chance to become friends with them."`
`"I wouldn't even want to."`
`"Yep.`
` I'm sure they feel the same way, so you're even.`
` Just forget about those people.`
` They don't have anything to do with you anymore.`
` So, there's no reason to give them any more thought."`
`"............Yeah.`
` ......You're right."`
`I felt just a bit disappointed.`
`I was never able to get them to acknowledge that I'd become a fully‐fledged servant who could take care of myself.`
`"It's hard for people to throw off their first impressions.`
` ......That's just how it is.`
` No matter how wonderful a person you grow into,`
` they would probably always call you Yasu and make fun of you.`
` There's no reason for you to seek their validation."`
`"......Yes.`
` Yeah, you're right, Shannon.`
` I'll completely forget about those people."`
`"Good.`
` You have two great friends, Kumasawa‐san and me.`
` And when the new servants come, you can show them from the start that you can take care of yourself."`
`Shannon was exactly right.`
`I regained a sense of confidence and pride that I hadn't felt since that day when I held the key with the spiderweb charm up high.`
`......I am now the most experienced Fukuin servant.`
`The new servants who come will still probably be older than me,`
` but I need to teach them the ropes as the more experienced servant.`
`Genji‐sama even told me to guide the newer servants...`
`Okay.`
` ......I'll give it my all.`
`"That's the right attitude.`
` Let's give it our all together."`
`"Yeah!"`
`"My name is Asne ({p:0:明日音}).`
` Pleased to meet you."`
`"My name is Belne ({p:0:鐘音}).`
` Pleased to meet you."`
`.....................`
`The newly arrived servants looked......a bit frivolous.`
`When I first joined the Ushiromiya family, I was incredibly nervous.`
`However, I couldn't see any trace of that nervousness on these girls...`
`"Yes.`
` Usually, kids with good grades and behavior were selected."`
`"How are they selected?`
` Who chooses?"`
`"People from the board of directors come and interview them.`
` And other things are considered like their everyday conduct..."`
`"So! As long as they acted like good kids in front of the adults, they could pass?"`
`"......Well,`
` ummm,`
` ......there were times that they passed because the adults thought they looked suitable..."`
`"All of the children who came from the Gospel House were highly individualistic.`
` Their rough edges would be sanded down as they worked as servants,`
` and eventually they would grow to be servants who would not shame the Ushiromiya family."`
`"However, it was the role of the more experienced servants to encourage this model behavior.`
` ......Since I was now the only one with experience, it was my responsibility to guide them."`
`"What were the new kids like?"`
`"Elites, no doubt?!`
` Of irreproachable conduct!"`
`"......I think they were like that when Madam and Genji‐sama were around.`
` However,`
` ......when their superiors weren't around, well,`
` ......they didn't take things quite as seriously..."`
`"Asne‐san...`
` Make sure you put your tools on the cart when you're done using them."`
`"Kyahhahahahaha!`
` ......Huh?`
` Su~re. So~rry."`
`As an experienced servant, I also gave them a warning.`
`"And Belne‐san, you shouldn't set your key down in a place like that.`
` You'll lose it."`
`"I'm not gonna lose it.`
` I never forget where I put things."`
`When I first arrived here, the older servants would often tell me off just as I was doing now.`
`They would probably have been far more mean and obnoxious about it.`
`I had hated that, so I tried to be more gentle when admonishing them, but they wouldn't take me seriously...`
`"L‐listen up.`
` You know there's a witch living in the mansion, don't you...?"`
`"Oooh, {f:5:Beatrice}~!"`
`"Kyahahahaha! That sounded just like him!"`
`"Shannon‐chan,`
` don't tell me you believe in that too?"`
`"Y‐yes, she really exists...`
` If you leave things lying around, the witch will prank you and hide them..."`
`"It's true.`
` It's gotten me into trouble many times..."`
`"A witch hiding things?"`
`"That's totally impossible."`
`"I mean, come on, witches?"`
`"They don't even exist!`
` Kyahhahahahaha!"`
`"They don't exist.`
` ......Witches."`
`"......I thought they were just pranks.`
` No, ......I think it just gave me peace of mind to think of them that way......while I still could."`
`"Do you think the witch {f:5:Beatrice} actually existed...?"`
`"I don't believe it."`
`"......I don't know if it was {f:5:Beatrice},`
` but I do think that something that wasn't human...`
`...really did exist in that mansion."`
`"Do you think there's a chance that this non‐human thing was {f:5:Beatrice}...?"`
`"Ridiculous."`
`"......I wish I could say it was ridiculous."`
`"That must have been a prank of Yasu's. No, not a prank, revenge."`
`"I did think that at first, but......"`
`"Did something happen that couldn't be explained away as a prank...?"`
`"......It was persistent.`
` ......And creepy."`
`"Specifically, what sorts of things happened?"`
`"Things I set down would disappear as soon as I looked away for a second."`
`"Didn't Yasu just hide them?"`
`"I thought so at first.`
` It was only natural to think that.`
` But I started getting this feeling that something wasn't right.`
` I kept thinking...would a timid kid like that really pull such nasty pranks?"`
`"Can you tell us what happened?"`
`"......When my key ring disappeared, it was easy to think that Yasu snatched it when I wasn't looking.`
` ......But when just a single key disappeared off that key ring...`
`and reappeared somewhere impossible, I couldn't think of it that way."`
`"Maybe Yasu just pulled that one key off while you weren't looking...?"`
`"Is that even possible?! Practically speaking?!`
` Quickly hiding the whole ring is one thing,`
` but if you really think about it, taking a single key off a key ring isn't that easy!`
` The keys would jingle and jangle.`
` I was standing right next to them, facing the other way!`
` If someone had taken their time to carefully remove a key when I was that close, even an idiot like me would've noticed!"`
`"But a single key just vanished without a sound.`
` ......At that moment, I finally realized.`
` This wasn't Yasu trying to get back at me,`
` ......it was something...`
`...worse...`
`than that."`
`"And where did you find this disappearing key?"`
`"It was...`
`......in my locker."`
`"Belne, you're such a ditz sometimes...`
` Are you sure you didn't just take that key off yourself and forget that you put it in your locker......?"`
`"Why would I take that one key off the ring?!`
` Have you ever taken a key off your key ring, Asne, or put one on?!`
` I tried doing it myself.`
` It's really stiff!`
` I would never go to all that trouble.`
` There's no point in it!`
` Am I a sleepwalker or something?!`
` How could I not remember something I'd done?!"`
`"I may be stupid, but I'm not that stupid!`
` I don't forget about things I do that easily!!`
` And anyway, I know I had my key with me when I entered the room!`
` Otherwise, how could I have unlocked the door?!"`
`"......Okay then...`
` Being careful not to make any sound,`
` Yasu must have, um,`
` ...slipped the key off,`
` and hid it in your locker..."`
`"That's what I thought at first!`
` I jumped at Yasu, telling that kid not to mess with me!`
` But even as I said it, I realized.`
` Isn't there something completely wrong here?!"`
`"I mean, we were with Yasu the whole time that day as we went around cleaning the rooms, right?!`
` There's no way Yasu had enough time to take a jangly key off the ring!`
` It was impossible for Yasu!`
` In fact, that would have been impossible for anyone, to remove just a single key in that short amount of time without making a sound!!"`
`"M‐maybe the ring was missing a master key when you got it..."`
`"I already told you!!`
` The key really was there in the beginning!`
` I was the one who unlocked that room!`
` So it must have been there!`
` ......And then, I went into the room!`
` I'm an idiot who hates hearing the keys clattering around, so I placed the ring on the bed...!"`
`"Then, when we finished cleaning, I picked up the ring, tried to lock the door, and it was gone!`
` I may have turned my back on the ring, but it was right next to me!`
` So, if someone tried to pull a prank by removing just one key, I'd have heard the clinking!`
` And yet, just the key for that room vanished and appeared again in my locker!!"`
`"......So okay, let's say that Yasu managed to sneak it away.`
` It's less stressful to imagine.`
` ......But still!`
` How could Yasu have put it in my locker, then?!`
` We were together with Yasu the whole time, right?!`
` When I started yelling about it being gone and ran all over the place looking for it, Yasu was with me until the moment I found it in my locker, get it?!"`
`"I'm telling you it's impossible!!`
` Even as I jumped at Yasu, I began to feel it.`
` I mean, Yasu's eyes seemed to be saying it silently.`
` ......According to Yasu, the reason things used to go missing all the time...`
`wasn't because Yasu was forgetful, as everyone said, ......but actually...`
`......because impossible things would suddenly happen, just like they had to me,`
` ......and.........and...!"`
`"......Yasu was with you the whole time, so there was no chance for Yasu to put the key in the locker?"`
`"Did other strange things like that happen?"`
`"Yeah, they did.`
` More stuff went missing, but not just that... Things kept happening, over and over...`
` ......Of course, I started getting nervous and being careful not to just leave stuff lying around, ......but that didn't help."`
`"......At first, I was angry at Yasu,`
` ......but at some point, I began to realize that I was mistaken.`
` One time, a key even disappeared from a ring that was in my pocket!`
` Then, I realized.`
` ......These weren't Yasu's pranks.`
` The same thing that had happened to Yasu was now happening to me...!"`
`"C‐calm down a bit...`
` I think some of those were Yasu's pranks,`
` ...and the others were just you being clumsy.`
` ......It's true that the mansion's always dark and eerie,`
` ......and it does feel like the sort of place you'd find a curse.`
` I'm sure that's what made you scared like that..."`
`"You saw it too, didn't you?!`
` Remember that white shadow we saw vanish into the VIP room that rainy day?!"`
`"......Y‐yes, I saw,`
` but couldn't that just have been Madam or Milady wearing something white...?"`
`"What do you mean, something white?!`
` Have you ever seen either of them wearing something like that?!`
` And besides, that VIP room is always locked!`
` They don't have keys to it!`
` That had to have been some kind of ghost or evil spirit...`
`...no, the silhouette of the witch!"`
`"........................`
` ......Ha...hahaha...`
` So, as you can see, ......Belne started acting like this at one point.`
` Totally scared.`
` ......I've got more street smarts than her,`
` so the more scared she became, the more strongly I felt that this whole thing was stupid and witches couldn't exist."`
`"......Still, I had to be careful about what I said.`
` ......I mean, I was starting to realize that this wasn't something I should talk about carelessly.`
` ......All ghost stories and curses sound stupid to outsiders.`
` ......But to the people who believe in them, it's absolutely not a joking matter.`
` It really was......no joke."`
`"......Asne didn't believe a word of what I said.`
` So, I eventually stopped telling Asne about it......and confessed to Yasu instead.`
` I told Yasu "I thought you were the culprit, but it couldn't have been you".`
` I said that something...`
`...strange...was happening to me...!"`
`"......And what was the reply?"`
`"Yasu said that the same thing had happened many times before, but no one would believe it...!`
` Besides, even though the older servants always made fun of Yasu, I knew that Yasu wasn't as clumsy or stupid as they said."`
`"I hated being bossed around by a younger person, so I always fought back, but Yasu did have the job pretty much down pat.`
` I'd always thought it strange that people made so much fun of Yasu for losing things...!"`
`"I was then sure.`
` It "existed"!`
` Some strange, inhuman thing "existed" in this mansion!"`
`"And that was the witch {f:5:Beatrice}...?"`
`"If {f:5:Beatrice} is what you want to call it, then I believe in {f:5:Beatrice}!`
` Anyway, something that can't be explained away by human actions definitely "existed" there!`
` People who didn't understand kept calling Yasu and me forgetful!`
` They didn't get it... They just didn't get it!!"`
`"......B‐but still,`
` ......you got a little scared, but it spooked you into shaping up, didn't it?`
` And then all that fuss about you losing things went away, right...?`
` So it must have been your imagination all the time......"`
`"You're wrong!!`
` I talked to Yasu, Shannon, and Kumasawa‐san about it!`
` And they said that the witch really did exist...`
` That all the old servants make sure to respect her!"`
`"They said I had been cursed because I'd stupidly gone around saying that {f:5:Beatrice} didn't exist...!`
` So I reformed!`
` Yasu taught me how to give offerings to the doll in the VIP room!`
` I asked Genji‐sama for permission and prayed at the shrine on the reef!`
` And then it all stopped, all at once!!"`
`"You were okay, Asne, since you stopped making fun of the witch,`
` but if you'd cluelessly gone on making fun of her, you would surely have been cursed next!`
` Yes, I guarantee it! You definitely would have been cursed...!!"`
`".........Yeah,`
` .....that kind of stuff makes even me uncomfortable...`
` ......Though I'd never say it to their faces..."`
`"You just don't get it!`
` You really don't!!`
` So, I made sure to teach all the newer servants well!`
` A witch called {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama lives in this mansion...!`
` If you make fun of her, you really will be cursed...!!"`
`".....................Belne..."`
`"When things, you know, ......disappear, that's a sign that the witch is close by and watching us...`
` If you say it's a prank, or that witches aren't real,`
` you'll be cursed even more...!!`
` It was like that for both Yasu and me!`
` Whenever a key vanishes,`
` ......that's a sign that the witch has appeared...!!"`
`Belne‐san carelessly tossed her key ring on the bed again, humming as she started to clean...`
`No matter how much I warn her, she doesn't change her ways.`
` She's always making fun of me and calling me Yasu, so she won't listen to what I tell her......`
`Why won't she listen to what I say...?`
`You mustn't leave things lying carelessly about.`
` If you lower your guard, the witch will prank you......`
`"......Ahyahhyahhya!`
` Look at that delicious key ring lying out there in the open......"`
`"St‐stop it, please...!`
` That's Belne‐san's key!`
` Keep your pranking to me alone.`
` Let the others be......!"`
`"You have become so cautious lately that you are no longer fun.`
` ......*cackle*cackle*, I jest, of course."`
`"Still, how unpleasant these people are, refusing to listen to my friend's kindly advice.`
` Any insult to my friend, I take as an insult to myself...!"`
`"......Are you planning to steal Belne‐san's key...?`
` Please, don't do it...!`
` She'll think I hid it again...!"`
`"She thinks my magic is naught but the work of a child like you...?!`
` *cackle*cackle*, very well, then.`
` I shall simply show her a feat impossible for {y:0:Humans}{n:0:humans} to perform...!"`
`"{i:I shall show her my magic}!!`
` Foolish Belne, if that is your name!`
` You will regret that you did not heed the warnings given you by my friend!`
` This flimsy body of mine will not do the trick! I'm borrowing yours!!`
` It's been too long since I last demonstrated real magic!`
` Let my body return for a spell......to the land of the living!"`
`"Huh?`
` Ah, ..................!"`
`A shiver ran up my whole body like an electric shock.`
`From that moment onwards, ......I couldn't move any part of my body by my own will.`
`Like a moment of shock after a blackout,`
` I could do nothing but accept the fact that I had lost control over my body......`
`All of the cells throughout my body felt tingly.`
` ......It felt as though my body had been transformed into someone else's.`
`......I realized that the witch {f:5:Beatrice} was using my body as a vessel to revive for a short period of time...`
`"......Hmm, very nice.`
` That ticklish feeling of the air on my skin... Having a body is simply wonderful!"`
`Wh‐......what are you trying to do?!`
` Please, don't do anything mean......`
`This time, everything was backwards.`
` My words were spoken inside my heart.`
` And the witch's voice was coming out of my mouth...!`
`"Fear not.`
` I will return your body soon enough.`
` I just need to teach her a lesson with a little prank.`
` However, it will not be one so simple that suspicion could fall on you...!`
` Come, try to remember.`
` Where have you been sleeping?!"`
`Everything went completely white and my mind stopped.`
`Once again, that tingling sensation slid up my body.`
`I could feel it all gather in the fingers of both my hands, ......and come out through my fingertips.`
`It was an incomprehensible,`
` indescribable,`
` ......unknown sensation.`
`My head went blank, and I couldn't think at all.`
`I could do nothing......but abandon my soul to the sensation.`
`I finally understood.`
` This is...`
`......what it's like...`
`to use magic......`
`"Come, try to remember.`
` Where have you been sleeping......?"`
`My fingers moved like a puppet's, and danced around as though I was a conductor—not of music, but of magic.`
`I never knew that having my body move without my control could be so exciting...`
`When Beato lifted my finger as if a string was attached to it,`
` the key ring lying on the bed stood on end.`
`......Belne‐san...didn't notice.`
` ......Neither did Asne‐san.`
`They were fully occupied by their happy chat as they cleaned the room...`
`I doubt that either of them could have dreamed that a witch was right behind them,`
` readying herself to use magic.`
`They could never have imagined...`
`...that the key ring was doing a little dance right behind their backs.`
`It was like an anime fairy tale I'd seen once as a kid.`
`The happy way the keys danced and spun made it look as though they had a will of their own.`
`I could feel the fun of making those keys dance with my fingers wash over me...`
`Yes, this is...pleasure......`
`As I powerlessly watched the witch control me,`
` ......I couldn't help but surrender myself to this new joy called magic......`
`"Whoops, that's no good.`
` If the whole ring disappears, my friend will be suspected again.`
` ......All we need to disappear is...`
`...yes, just the key to this room."`
`Beato controlled my fingers, controlling the magic.`
` ......And thereby controlling the keys.`
`The key ring slumped down on the bed,`
` .........and then just the mansion's master key stood on end.`
`"Well now, what shall I do with this?`
` ......Just erasing it would be terribly dull.`
` So, ............*cackle*cackle*!`
` Why don't I throw it into her locker?!`
` That way, I'll give my friend, who's been working here with her the whole time, a perfect alibi!"`
`"Come, try to remember.`
` Where have you been sleeping?!`
` Yes, it was a warm, dark place..."`
`"The inside of Belne's locker!!`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`When Beato snapped her fingers, the key burst and became a gold butterfly.`
`......A gold butterfly...?`
`I see, it's gold because she's the Golden Witch, who gave the Master all of his gold.`
`And butterflies are scared of spiderwebs.`
` ......So, it's a gold butterfly.`
`The minions of the witch {f:5:Beatrice}...are gold butterflies......`
`After flitting into the air, it burst into a shower of gold sparks and disappeared.`
`Then, the vanished key......went to Belne‐san's locker......`
`Though it was far away, in the locker of a changing room, I had a vivid understanding of its new state.`
`It wasn't by sight or by touch.`
`{n}It was by some other sense inside my heart, which couldn't be explained by the five senses.`
`{n}A completely new sensation that I'd never felt before.`
`It was the completely alien concept...called magic.`
`{n}A completely unknown pleasure that left me in a trance.`
`"......It is done, my friend.`
` I shall return this body to you..."`
`Nn, ..................ah......`
`"..........................."`
`It felt as though I had been spinning through space,`
` and gravity had suddenly come back and thrown me to the ground.`
`Like when you're having a great dream, but you're suddenly woken up,`
` ......and all you can remember about the dream was that it was fun.`
` ......That sort of lonely feeling.`
`Though Beato had been borrowing my body, it was my own body that used magic.`
`I could still feel that sensation in my hands.`
`The key ring over there had danced along with the movements of my fingers.`
`No, that's not quite it.`
` The key ring and my fingers had danced together.`
`That fun, that excitement...`
`...still tingled slightly in my hands......`
`"Whoops, that was close."`
`Saying this, Belne‐san suddenly turned around and picked up the key ring she had thrown down on the bed.`
`She must have realized that I was staring at it.`
`"Almost had Yasu complain that I shouldn't leave keys lying about like this.`
` I'd never put something down and forget about it."`
`With a grin, she put the key back into her pocket.`
`However, she still hadn't noticed.`
`She probably couldn't even imagine that during the few moments her guard was down...`
`...just a single key had vanished from the ring...`
`It's not easy for a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} to do things like that.`
`......But, with magic...`
`With just a little dance of the keys and a butterfly popping, ......it had disappeared.`
`"Alright, fingertip inspection!`
` Bed, okay.`
` Curtains, okay!"`
`"Tools, okay.`
` And keys too!`
` See?`
` Nothing wrong, right?"`
`"Y‐yes, that's good......`
` Then let's go on to the next room.`
` ......Ah, ......Belne‐san.`
` Could you......lock up this room for me?"`
`"Hmm?`
` Su~re."`
`.........Did Belne‐san's key...`
`...really disappear by magic?`
`Was that fun magic just a daydream I had......?`
`I was so scared of that being true......that I tested it.`
`"...........................`
` ...............Huh......?"`
`"What's wrong?`
` Why're you taking so long?"`
`".........Huh?`
` .........Huh? Huh??`
` ......Wait, are you kidding me?"`
`"What's wrong...?"`
`"......It's not this one.`
` ......And it isn't this one.`
` ......Huh?`
` What the...?"`
`"What is it?`
` Do you want me to lock it?"`
`"I, I don't get it?`
` What's going on?`
` ......My master key's gone.`
` Just my master key is gone.`
` Wh‐why...?!`
` This ring's so stiff... There's no way it'd come off......!"`
`I could faintly feel that tingling sensation...`
`in the tips of my fingers......`
`That night.`
`......As I gazed at the ceiling from the bed in my dorm room,`
` ......I looked at my hands.`
` I couldn't sleep.`
`The excitement from the time those keys danced was still there in my fingers...`
`Is this...`
`...how {f:5:Beatrice}...`
`...how witches...`
`...always feel?`
`............I have a witch friend called {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`{n}She always used to pull pranks on me with her strange magic.`
`Because I saw this all the time,`
` .........I thought I knew what magic was.`
`But today...`
`.....she had possessed my body......and used magic with it.`
`The sensation of magic that I finally felt at that time......still held my heart entranced.`
`It was a completely unknown pleasure.`
`After all......`
`With a movement of my fingertips,`
` .........the key had danced on command.`
`{n}It was an mysterious, wondrous miracle of magic—something no {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} could do.`
`I still couldn't let go of that excitement...`
`........................`
`".........Shannon.`
` .........Are you awake...?"`
`".....................`
` ......What's up?"`
`Shannon was still awake.`
`Shannon is always early to bed, early to rise.`
` By getting to bed early, all of her weariness disappears by the next day.`
`......She lives a model life, one that all servants should respect and admire.`
`......If I wanted to become a beloved and respected servant like Shannon,`
` .........I would need to act that way too.`
`However, ......I had no confidence that I could do that anymore.`
`"I guess...`
`.........I can't become like you after all."`
`"......What do you mean?`
` This is a bit abrupt."`
`"You were my ideal.`
` Always."`
`".........Yeah."`
`"At the Gospel House, you were kind to everyone and loved by everyone.`
` ......You would always play with me, and you were my only friend.`
` And at the Ushiromiya mansion, you were a wonderful servant, who could carry out any task flawlessly and gracefully.`
` My idol and goal.`
` ......That's what you were."`
`"Yeah.`
` ......Let's give it our all together.`
` As they say, perseverance prevails.`
` You're gaining recognition from everyone now.`
` So let's aim to become wonderful servants together."`
`"..................`
` ......I'm...done with being a servant."`
`"......Huh?"`
`"Instead of a servant,`
` ......I think it'd be more fun to be a witch."`
`"A, a witch...?`
` ...What do you mean...?"`
`"A servant who everyone loves and relies upon is...`
`...yeah, it's still something I'd love to be.`
` ......But right now,`
` .........I want to be a witch...`
`even more."`
`"Well, that's...`
`...ummm...`
` .........Huh......?"`
`Shannon was confused.`
`It was hardly surprising.`
` ......All this about quitting as a servant was at least understandable.`
`But she didn't know how to answer after hearing that her roommate wanted to become a witch...`
`"A witch.`
` {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` ......You see, today, {f:5:Beatrice} possessed me and used my body to do magic.`
` That unknown world felt so......thrilling.`
` It was far, far more thrilling than even the time I learned that I'd been selected as an Ushiromiya family servant."`
`"It was like learning about a new world.`
` ......As though I'd been living in a world of darkness all my life and thought I knew what the world was like,`
` then finally learned what light was and saw the world for the first time.`
` It was...joy.`
` ......Excitement."`
`At that time, Beato had only used my fingers, made a key ring dance,`
` and turned a key into a butterfly before hiding it in a locker.`
`But I had understood it with my body.`
`If I had moved my fingers a different way, the ring could have flown into the air instead of just dancing,`
` and I could have turned it into a scurrying lizard instead of a butterfly. ......I could have done anything.`
`True, {f:5:Beatrice}'s magical power was still weak.`
`It had all happened in the little world behind the backs of the servants filled with the anti‐magic toxin.`
`However, inside that tiny, short‐lived world, I could have done anything at all.`
`{n}Beato just happened to settle on making the keys dance and turning one into a butterfly.`
`{n}But if she wanted to, she could have done anything else!`
`The endless sensation of that free, unrestricted power...`
`{n}I could still feel it in my fingertips.`
`Could it be that, along with that sensation, a sliver of that magical power might also remain...?`
`I can tell.`
` It's still there.`
` .........There's still just a bit of it there, along with that sensation.`
`I can do it.`
` ......I can still.........do it......`
`"............Ah......"`
`A single spot of golden light suddenly lit up in this dark room.`
`{n}It was right between my clasped hands.`
`When I slowly opened them,`
` ......I could see a single dot that sparkled gold.`
`"What...`
`......is...`
`......?"`
`Shannon didn't know what the light meant.`
`How could light appear from the palms of my hands?`
`And yet, even with this miracle right in front of her,`
` ......she couldn't understand what it was.`
`She just sat there with her mouth open in disbelief.`
`However, to me,`
` ......this was just the return of that bit of sensation in my fingertips.`
`The golden dot...`
`...spread out...`
`...and became a small, gold butterfly.`
`It flapped its wings and scattered gold sparks about like Tinker Bell.`
`To Shannon, it probably just looked as though a gold butterfly was flapping its wings.`
`......Of course, that alone was a miracle that she could hardly grasp.`
`But to me, it was like a remote‐control plane in the shape of a butterfly.`
`{n}I could control that gold butterfly however I wanted.`
`Not clumsily with threads.`
`{n}......I could make it flap, dance, play through the air as I wished.`
`I was taking a walk through the air as that little butterfly.`
`The golden glint of it pierced the darkness of the small room as it danced about freely.`
` ......It was an entrancing pleasure.`
`......However, that sensation in my fingers began to weaken.`
`I could tell that the few magic butterfly scales left in my fingers were going away.`
`Finally, like a sparkler burning out, the gold butterfly gave out one last blink of light,`
` fell down as a single golden dot, and disappeared without a trace......`
`"Wh‐what on Earth just happened......"`
`"This is magic.`
` .........It's really fun."`
`"M‐.........magic............"`
`"Yeah.`
` Magic.`
` ......I was able to use it just now because there was still a little left in my fingers.`
` ......But if I became a real witch, ......I'd be able to use it whenever and however I wanted......to do anything.`
` Now that I've learned how fun this can be,`
` I don't want to go back to being {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.`
` Being a servant is just too boring.`
` So, ......I'm going to become a witch."`
`"B‐become a witch...`
` ............W‐wait......!"`
`"I've already made my decision, Shannon.`
` It's been fun.`
` I'll give you this room.`
` You can use it by yourself.`
` Later.`
` Goodbye."`
`"W‐wait...!!"`
`As Shannon called out repeatedly for me to wait, ......a massive planetarium swallowed me up.`
`In the sea of the pitch‐black starry sky, I was alone.`
` I...we...are alone here.`
`"I'm done acting the part of a servant.`
` .........I'm going to...modify the world."`
`".........Mm.`
` Understood.`
` In that case, how would you like it to be?"`
`"Being a wonderful servant like Shannon wouldn't be bad.`
` ......But now that I know how fun it is to be a witch, that feels like a boring dream.`
` I can't go back anymore."`
`"What will happen to Shannon?"`
`"......Shannon can just be Shannon, and stay as a respected servant.`
` She'll stay the same.`
` But from now on, it won't be the two of us together, but her alone."`
`"Partings can be so sudden.`
` ......Ah, well.`
` Being fickle makes life more entertaining.`
` Then what will you do instead?"`
`"I want to be a witch.`
` I want to be Beato."`
`"But I am already {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"Your backstory that you're a witch and my friend will remain the same,`
` but I'll modify the world so that Beato is me."`
`"Would I then be a witch who is a friend of {f:5:Beatrice}?"`
`"Pretty much.`
` So, from now on, you're a different witch."`
`"Very well.`
` Then, what will be my new name?"`
`".....................`
` I'll put that on hold until I can think of one.`
` You'll be nameless for a while.`
` Sorry about that."`
`"Worry not, worry not.`
` It is to be my name, after all.`
` You had better take your time and think carefully about it.`
` *cackle*."`
`"You'll be {f:5:Beatrice}'s friend that she's had since she was young and couldn't use magic yet.`
` It started with you hiding my things to tease me."`
`"I see.`
` And when {f:5:Beatrice} finally learns magic, I become a friend on an equal footing with her.`
` So, I should act like a big sister sort of friend."`
`"Yeah, like that.`
` ......What should we do about how we talk?"`
`"It seems that "warawa" has become firmly established as the way {f:5:Beatrice} refers to herself.`
` Should I relinquish that to you?"`
`"Yeah.`
` That haughty way of speaking with "warawa" will be mine."`
`"Hmm, very well.`
` Then I shall—no, I can't speak like that any more.`
` ......Then I need to find a good way to sound like {f:5:Beatrice}'s big‐sister‐like witch friend."`
`"Yeah.`
` ......Or should it be...`
`.........very well."`
`"Ahahahaha.`
` Now there's a nice, dignified voice."`
`"What about the way I—let's try that again.`
` And what of my appearance?"`
`"Good point.`
` I've got a sort of blood‐red witch look.`
` Why not choose a different color for yourself?"`
`"......When {f:5:Beatrice} wanders the mansion at night, she is often seen dressed in white."`
`"Of course, ghosts are classically white."`
`"A white dress...`
`...on a witch......`
` .........Let's try putting it all together."`
`I need a different look than the witch in the demon‐red dress.`
`{n}A white, noble witch.`
`......Unlike the time with the red witch, I'm thinking about my own look now,`
` ......so I'd like to make it beautiful and......cute if I can.`
`A white dress.`
` A noble look.`
`{n}Like one of noble blood, but with a dark, sarcastic streak......`
`No, she's like a tomboy princess, so her voice is a mix of formality and rudeness.`
`Then the dress should be the exact opposite, pure and clean, to make a nice contrast......`
`"..............................`
` ......How does this form suit me?"`
`"Is this the form of the new {f:5:Beatrice}?!"`
`"How beautiful!`
` Just like a noble princess!"`
`"Hmmm...`
` ...I've taken a liking to this form.`
` Not bad at all."`
`"......Looking good.`
` That's wonderful, Beato."`
`"Hmm. I like it.`
` I truly do like this form..."`
`"Now, if you can keep this up and give me a wonderful name, that'd be great.`
` If I have to go around nameless for too long, I'll get all sulky."`
`"Fear not, I shall find you a splendid name!`
` But first, there is something I must consider: what shall be the form of my magic?!"`
`"Hiding objects and transporting them instantaneously is your theme.`
` So, I must think of my own particular theme of magic.`
` ......When I use magic, gold butterflies will flit about.`
` I'm not backing down on that part...!"`
`"*giggle*. Splendid.`
` Just perfect for the Golden Witch.`
` ......Then the weaknesses such as spiderwebs and the sacred mirror in the shrine will also go to you?"`
`"Hmm.`
` Even an all‐powerful witch needs a few small weaknesses to keep things interesting.`
` Then let us do it like so.`
` If I touch a spiderweb, it will burn me."`
`Silently, a silvery spider dropped down vertically.`
`Beato, now in her new form, lightly touched the silver spiderweb that trailed out behind it.`
`As she did, ......there was a faint sound of flesh burning, and a thin burn was left across her fingers.`
`{f:5:Beatrice} can't stand spiderwebs.`
`{n}That was one of the weaknesses of the evil spirits Kumasawa‐san spoke of.`
`Since the witch {f:5:Beatrice} had revived thanks to the power of those evil spirits,`
` she also inherited their weaknesses.`
`So, the sacred mirror is also one of her weaknesses.`
`......However, I am unlikely to cross paths with that sacred mirror in the shrine very often.`
`That's not very fun.`
`".........Then, while mirrors with sacred power will obviously be a weakness, let us make mirrors in general a weakness too."`
`"They do often say that mirrors have magical powers.`
` Good idea, I think.`
` Sounds just like a witch."`
`"Let us say that I cannot abide mirrors because when I look at one, it feels as though my magical power is being sucked out.`
` Hmm, that sounds quite entertaining."`
`......Now that I really think about it,`
` I'll be bad with mirrors whether I invent a story for it or not.`
`No matter who I want or strive to be,`
` ......the only face that will ever show in a mirror...`
`is the heartlessly pathetic and realistic face of {i:"Yasu"}.`
`Mirrors, which will always force me to face my shabby reality, are something I always want to avoid.`
`That's right.`
` ......I hate mirrors.`
`......I don't want to look at...`
`my own...`
`pitiful self.`
`"You don't need to decide everything at once.`
` It's fun to build up a world one little bit at a time."`
`"True.`
` I understand.`
` I shall enjoy life as a witch as I slowly expand my world."`
`"That tiny, dark room is no place for you to sleep now."`
`"Indeed.`
` I am the Golden Witch!`
` I am the ruler of Rokkenjima's night, and the nighttime mansion belongs to me.`
` That is where I should be living, is it not?"`
`"A room for {f:5:Beatrice}?`
` Haha, isn't it obvious?!"`
`"Yeah, that's right!`
` That wonderful room on the second floor of the mansion......"`
`"The VIP room of the witch—{i:that} is {f:5:Beatrice}'s room!"`
`"Oh, so it is.`
` From this evening forward, that room in the nighttime mansion shall be my dwelling place...!`
` Why didn't I think of that myself, hahaha, heha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha...!!"`
`"Then let's go, Beato.`
` If we're going to drink tea together, we'll need a much better room than that cramped one."`
`"Indeed.`
` That room is too crude to welcome friends to and serve tea in.`
` We shall change rooms.`
` Let us go, my friend...!"`
`".........So, this is goodbye to Shannon."`
`When I looked at my feet, ......I could see my own dorm room far beneath me.`
`I could see Shannon, who had dashed up to the bed I lay on and had been saying "wait" at the moment time froze.`
` She was as rigid as a doll.`
`Looking down at it from this height, it really did look like a small dollhouse...`
`"Farewell, Shannon.`
` ......The days I spent as a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}, growing our friendship as I attempted to emulate you, were truly fun.`
` ...If I had never learned the joys of magic and awakened as a witch,`
` everything would doubtless have remained as it was."`
` .........I was your only close friend as well, wasn't I?`
`{n}Please forgive me for erasing that friend so suddenly.`
`As a parting gift, ......I will erase "me" from your world.`
`Starting now, this will not be a two‐person room.`
`It will be a single‐person room, with just you in it.`
`Strive to be a kind, reliable servant loved by everyone,`
` and embody that ideal as you always have.`
`Yasu, the stupid, clumsy servant who lost things all the time, no longer exists.`
`Farewell, Shannon.`
`When I mature as the witch {f:5:Beatrice} and wander freely about the nighttime mansion,`
` ......I may bump into you as you do your nighttime rounds.`
`However, when I meet you again,`
` it will not be a reunion.`
`{n}It will be our first meeting.`
`After all, though you have heard the rumors about the witch {f:5:Beatrice}, you have never met her......`
`Farewell, Shannon.`
`Let us meet again sometime and spin up some fun tale.........`
`"Wait......!!`
` Wai...`
`.........t...`
`............`
` ..........................."`
`....................................`
`.........What...`
`...was I doing...?`
`Was I......talking in my sleep......?`
`Apparently, I had gotten out of bed, stretched my hand out towards it,`
` ......and said "wait".`
`This isn't the first time I've woken myself up by saying something strange in my sleep, but...`
`......I don't remember ever waking up to find myself out of bed and standing up.`
`Could this be what they call......sleepwalking...?`
`Am I just tired......?`
`......Gotta sleep.`
` Gotta get back to sleep.`
`I turned around to face my bed.`
`............?`
`My bed wasn't there.`
`{n}There was no bed in this room except the one I had just turned my back on.`
`If I'm the only one in this room, and the only bed is the one behind me,`
` ......that must mean it's my bed.`
`......That feels wrong, for some reason.`
`The bed sheets are all disarranged, as though someone slipped out of them.`
`"Someone"...?`
` This is my own, single‐person room.`
`So, that there is my bed, and the rumpled sheets mean...`
`that I was just sleeping there until a second ago, don't they...?`
`......But, for some reason,`
` .........that bed...`
`...doesn't feel like my bed.`
`But I, Shannon, have a single‐person room—I was the only person to be given one while all the other kids had to share.`
`So, there's only one bed.`
`{n}And it must be mine.`
`...........................`
`".........Am I just...`
`...tired?`
` ......I wonder..."`
`I must just be half‐asleep.`
` I have school again first thing tomorrow.`
`And after school, I'll go to the mansion, help out with some work,`
` and then I want to talk to Kumasawa‐san about the mystery novel I just read.`
`"Time to sleep.`
` I'm probably just so worn out that I'm imagining things.`
` .........Good night, Shannon.`
` Just crawl in bed and close your eyes...`
`...and you won't have to think about anything complicated......"`
`I went back into my bed.`
`It felt a bit uncomfortable to crawl into a bed that wasn't mine.`
`Still, it might just be because I'm getting so sleepy, but it's starting to feel as though this is my bed after all.`
`.........I'm just half‐asleep......`
`I am...Shannon.`
` A lonely servant.`
`I mess up from time to time,`
` ......but I want to become a kind servant whom everyone loves......`
`.........Goodnight,`
` .........me.........`
` Oh, I am one yet many.`
`I have grown tired of playing the servant.`
` I have grown tired of playing the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}!`
`From this moment forth, from this night forth, I am {f:5:Beatrice}!`
`The Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}, who has lived for a thousand years!`
`Praise me, servants.`
` Have fear when you are chosen for the night shift!`
`On the nighttime island, the mansion is my place, and that is my time...!`
`Oh, I am one yet many!`
`Yes, let our world swallow up everything.`
` It is like the raging seas!`
`Well now, let us drink the mysterious moon dry tonight, with this {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} book as a side dish!`
`You call this mystery?`
` You call this a locked room?`
` You call this "a crime impossible for {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s"?`
`Don't make me laugh!`
` With all these holes and weak points, you call this a crime impossible for {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s?!`
`Is there no splendid locked‐room magic capable of astonishing me?`
`Oh, not here, not there, not this, not that, all of them pathetic!`
`It draws out a chuckle, but leaves me unsure which is the side dish, the moon or the book?!`
`If I get tired of mystery, I can change myself into a butterfly!`
` I can flit about the island,`
` the mansion, the vast forest at will!`
` I'll follow those cowardly servants as they do their nighttime rounds,`
` and when they check to see that a window is locked, they'll see me laughing at them in the reflection on the glass!`
`I can be fickle, and do as I please!`
`Pranks at night will probably be a lot of fun.`
`Yes, my mind is made up—I will play like that starting tonight!`
`*cackle*cackle*, how pleasurable!`
` Tonight will truly be pleasurable!`
`In the world of witches, the only limits to your fun are the limits of your imagination!`
`My imagination shall become the source of my magical power!`
`Very well, then—this will be fun!`
` I shall allow my imagination to grow without bound.`
` And with it, I shall swallow up the entire island.`
` All nights on this island belong to me!!`
`Oh, how refined and pleasant are the days of a witch!`
`Oh, I am one yet many!`
` Kiha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hah{0}hha, hyahhaha!!`
`Here's to the wonderful world of witches!!`
`"Did you check the bathroom amenities?"`
`"Yep, went down the whole list."`
`"Did you make sure they were facing the right way when you set them down?"`
`"Yes, of course.`
` Everything's as the list says."`
`"*giggle*, thanks.`
` Genji‐sama, the guest rooms are ready now."`
`"Good work.`
` Make sure you check over everything with your own eyes, Shannon.`
` Also, Madam has ordered us to change the tablecloth in the dining hall again."`
`"My, my. Why again, when we all worked so hard to change it earlier today...?"`
`"The color of that tablecloth simply does not fit.`
` Once I saw it against the backdrop of the room, I could see that it matched terribly.`
` We should use a different tablecloth."`
`"Oh, and you did make sure to clean the chandelier in the parlor, correct?`
` Last time, Eva‐san looked up and said "Oh, is that dust? And even a cobweb?"`
` That incident must never be repeated...!"`
`"Do not worry.`
` It has already been carefully cleaned and checked.`
` I will now perform a final check on everything myself."`
`"Is that so? Very well.`
` I will do the same.`
` Shannon, take the young servants and prepare a new tablecloth.`
` Try to find something white, with a bit more of a clean feeling."`
`"Y‐yes, as you wish."`
`Natsuhi was even more high‐strung than normal and walked about barking orders here and there.`
`Even though the sky was beginning to get dark, the servants moved hurriedly about.`
`Tomorrow would be the annual family conference.`
`It wasn't particularly rare for the siblings' individual families to visit the island, but this was the only time that they would all come together.`
`It was the most important day of the year for both the Ushiromiya family and Rokkenjima.`
`Natsuhi, who was short‐tempered on top of being high‐strung, kept issuing orders one after another,`
` only to later change her mind or ask for the work to be done again, keeping the servants busy until late into the night.`
`Shannon now had many years of experience and Natsuhi had put her in a position of responsibility,`
` which meant that she was frequently called over to be given all kinds of strict orders...`
`So, when Shannon finished her shower and lay down on the bed in the servants' quarters, she fell into a deep sleep almost immediately......`
`......I can hear the sound of wind...coming from somewhere far away.`
`............It's a bit different from the sound wind outside a room would make.`
`It's almost as though......I'm sitting in a deck chair in the rose garden,`
` turning over in my sleep, ......with the feel of the wind in my hair.`
`That's right, the feel.`
` ......This isn't a sound, it's a feeling.`
`Then is this...`
`...a dream......?`
`Just as I was about to accept this theory, ......I thought I heard someone talking to me.`
`{m:-5:—}—My, my.`
` It seems the work of a servant is just as boring as it ever was.`
`Not only boring, but difficult, strict, constraining, joyless...`
`All you get in return for your years of service is some level of respect from the newer servants.`
`And even that is far from sufficient to repay you for all the hard work you've done...`
`{a:c:`
`"Do you not tire...`
`of such a life?"}`
`Huh? ......Who......?`
`She wasn't just imagining someone talking to her.`
` ......She was shocked to find that it was real.`
`When Shannon opened her eyes, ......she gulped.`
`"Th‐`
`......this place..............."`
`She couldn't say any more.`
` .........She was literally stunned silent.`
`Shannon, who had been sleeping on a bed, ......was somehow in a rose garden.`
`However, though this rose garden somehow resembled the rose garden on Rokkenjima, it was also completely different.`
`After all, ......the roses were golden.`
`{n}Not only the flowers, but the dancing butterflies too.`
`It was a golden rose garden of mysterious beauty.`
`Somehow, Shannon was sitting in the chair under the arbor.`
`{n}It was as though she'd taken a nap there and woken up from a dream.`
`......But it felt strange.`
`Is this golden rose garden a dream?`
`For some strange reason, it even felt as though my entire life up to this point had been a dream,`
` and that I had finally awakened here...`
`{a:c:`
`"Welcome, Shannon.`
` Welcome to my golden rose garden......"}`
`There was that voice again.`
` Shannon looked around to find who it was.`
`As she did, a golden butterfly landed on the seat across from her and instantly created a human form...`
`"It has been quite some time, Shannon.`
` Have you been well...?`
` Of course, I know already that you have.`
` After all, I have been watching all of you, every day."`
`This woman laughed as though she was an old friend of Shannon's.`
`However, Shannon obviously didn't remember this strange gold rose garden, and she didn't remember this person's face either...`
`"Indeed.`
` You no longer remember me, do you?"`
`".........Have I forgotten about you...?`
` If so, please forgive me..."`
`"There is no need to apologize.`
` I made you that way, so it is no sin of yours.`
` ......Allow me to introduce myself.`
` I am the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"......B‐Beatrice...sama......?`
` Th‐the benefactor of the Ushiromiya family, whom the Master always speaks of......?"`
`"Not that Beatrice.`
` I am {f:5:Beatrice} the Golden Witch, the one who controls Rokkenjima's night.`
` ......I am the other master of the mansion, the one you always pay homage to."`
`"Y‐`
`......you are...`
`...{f:5:Beatrice}...`
`sama........."`
`"Hahaha...`
` You need not fear.`
` The two of us used to be friends—no, roommates, did we not?`
` At one time, I idolized you and tried to be the best servant I could."`
`".........I've always had a single‐person room, so I couldn't have had a......"`
`"When we last parted, I stole away your memory.`
` However, I have not forgotten that we were once roommates.`
` ......I also remember that I was the one who destroyed our friendship and left."`
`"So as to not leave you alone in sadness,`
` I erased all of your memories and the very world of our days together."`
`"...................................."`
`"You do not need to understand...`
` But believe this.`
` I have not called you here to do you harm."`
`"I‐isn't this inside one of my dreams...?"`
`"You may think of it that way.`
` Strictly speaking, I beckoned your soul to my garden while you were sleeping.`
` To invite you to be a resident of this world."`
`{f:5:Beatrice} snapped her fingers,`
` and a storm of gold butterflies all rose up around the rose garden.`
`As the cloud of butterflies danced over the table, a gorgeous tea set appeared.`
`There were tea cups and a tea pot, more elegant even than those used by the Ushiromiya family.`
`The tea filled the cups to the brim and had a sweet rose scent, one which Shannon had never smelled before.`
`Before there was even time to be amazed by that scent,`
` butterflies started gathering one by one on the table, and a tea stand sprouted right out of it.`
`It was like watching a magical mushroom from a fairy tale kingdom grow out of the ground.`
`The many‐layered tea stand was filled with beautiful cakes that were deserving of being called edible jewels.`
`Of course, there were also several lovely, light‐brown scones.`
` The honey truly was golden honey, with bits of gold leaf dancing through it......`
`"It seems the Ushiromiya family holds tea parties from time to time, but those cannot compare to mine."`
`"......I‐.........incredible......`
` ...I've never seen anything like this..."`
`"*cackle*cackle*.`
` Even if you had, it would only have been as a waitress.`
` You are my friend.`
` I need no waitress.`
` After all, I am a witch.`
` That is more than enough.`
` Come, do not be shy.`
` Stuff yourself to your heart's content."`
`"Th‐`
`......thank you...`
`very much......"`
`That was all Shannon could manage to say.`
` .........It would be hard for anyone to say much more after being suddenly invited to such a beautiful witch tea party.`
`"Let us begin with black tea.`
` The milk is fresh, and the sugar is so delectable that you'd almost want to eat it raw.`
` But I recommend you try your tea straight first.`
` With nothing more than a single rose petal floating on the top,`
` it will surely be so delicious that you'll be unable to drink the black tea of the human world ever again...!"`
`Laughing happily, {f:5:Beatrice} opened, not a sugar pot, but a rose petal pot,`
` picked up a single crimson petal, and floated it on her tea after relishing its scent.`
`Shannon did the same, picking up a single petal and smelling its aroma.`
`"...............It smells so wonderful......`
` ......Is this...really the scent of the roses in this world?"`
`"I am glad you enjoy it.`
` I bred this rose simply for the purpose of using the petals with black tea.`
` If you crush them, they're also splendid for making jam!`
` That goes better with scones than anything else imaginable.`
` Do you want to try?"`
`"Uh, ah......sure, just a bit."`
`Shannon had been invited to this witch tea party suddenly.`
`However, the witch seemed so truly innocent, and her smile as she played the hostess was so happy that it made Shannon want to smile too.`
`The tension in Shannon's heart gradually faded, and she started to enjoy her chat with this witch......`
`"Servant work really is tiring.`
` I remember it well.`
` Particularly cleaning the windowsills in the chapel."`
`"How surprising.`
` So, you worked as a servant once too?"`
`"For a short time.`
` You probably don't remember, but I worked alongside you.`
` I was a clumsy fool who always lost things.`
` You were my idea of a perfect servant and the person I looked up to."`
`"......That makes me even more sorry that I can't remember."`
`"There is no need for apologies.`
` Here, you are not a servant, but my friend and guest.`
` There are no inconveniences here, no trials nor boredom.`
` I can give you anything you desire.`
` That is how much power I currently possess.`
` ......I wanted to let you know that I have now reached that level."`
`".........I can't believe you've given someone as ordinary as me such wonderful treatment...`
` Thank you very much."`
`"*cackle*!`
` Think of it as a reward for all of the painful days you have withstood."`
`"Come, gold butterflies!`
` Do not bore my friend! Show her a little dance!`
` When you have tired of that, allow me to call the band to perform any song you would like.`
` If you tire of that as well, my refined familiars will show you magic without tricks."`
`"Fear not, for time is endless here.`
` And I can grant your wishes endlessly.`
` My tea party has no end...!"`
`In a truly good mood, the witch told Shannon several strange stories.`
`They were all stories Shannon had never heard before.`
` Very interesting stories.`
` And they were all odd, bizarre fairy tales.`
`Shannon felt as though she had become Alice in Wonderland.`
` The time she spent at this tea party was wholly strange, pleasant, and relaxed.`
`No,`
` at this tea party, there were no hands of a clock.`
`So, the time passed like a Sunday morning, when you can wrap yourself in your blanket for as long as you want......`
`"......I can't express how grateful I am to you for this."`
`"There is no need for thanks.`
` In the human world, words of thanks go along with words of farewell, do they not?`
` There will be no end to this tea party.`
` So, there is no need for thanks either."`
`"*giggle*.`
` But I am grateful.`
` Thank you so much, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, for this wonderful tea party.`
` .........But all dreams must end, and so must this one."`
`"Hoh.`
` And why must they end?"`
`"Because......I have to get up early tomorrow.`
` If I stay here talking too long, I'll sleep in,`
` and Madam will give me a good scolding..."`
`"Pft, hah{0}hah{0}ha{0}ha{0}hah{0}haa{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!`
` Why are you so anxious to return to the world of that short‐tempered Natsuhi?`
` Really, now.`
` Are you really saying you want to return to the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} world, where it's all work and no rewards?"`
`"But I am {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.`
` I can't impose myself on you forever."`
`"Shannon.`
` It seems that you do not understand.`
` I invited you here, but I have no desire to chase you away again."`
`"Here, time is eternal.`
` You are not obligated to say farewell.`
` I will never tire of enjoying tea with you.`
` On the contrary, it is quite agreeable to have you to talk to."`
`"I'm grateful for your words, but I am {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.`
` I must return to my own world."`
`"That colorless world where you waste all your time with school and your job, and the family works you to the bone?`
` Why do you want to return there?"`
`"Despite all that, ......it's still my world."`
`"Shannon.`
` Does that sort of world really need to be yours?`
` Let me be honest with you.`
` ......Shannon.`
` I didn't just invite you here.`
` I came to take you home."`
`"Take me home.........?"`
`"Once, I tried to become a good servant like you.`
` ......Then, I became fascinated by witches...`
`and became one myself, learning all the pleasures of magic.`
` ......And now, I have come to take you home."`
`{f:5:Beatrice} spoke quietly and slowly rose from her seat.`
`"Shannon.`
` ......The world of witches truly is more fun than being a servant.`
` This tea party is nothing more than a mere welcoming party for an old friend.`
` We can hold as many fun festivities as we desire.`
` Yes—endlessly, eternally."`
`"......Now that this golden rose garden has been completed, I have reached my goal.`
` This place is paradise.`
` Yes, let us call it the Golden Paradise.`
` Now that it has been completed, I have come to welcome you in.`
` There's no need for any inconveniences, any perseverance or hard work.`
` Here, you and I can enjoy ourselves for all eternity.`
` It will be like a never‐ending fairy tale......"`
`"......I'm truly grateful for your splendid proposal.`
` ......However, I need to go back to my original world."`
`"Why?"`
`"Because this isn't my world."`
`"I acknowledge it.`
` This is not the world you have lived in until now.`
` That's why I have invited you here!"`
`"From this point forth, this will be our world.`
` You are no longer a guest.`
` You are the second master of this world.`
` You need not show any restraint for my sake.`
` We will simply live in this endless world like we once lived as roommates......"`
`"I regret that I have no memory of that time.`
` .........However, I'll have to turn down your invitation."`
`"Why?`
` ......What responsibility do you have to the world of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s?`
` What duty do you have to return there?!"`
`True, the world of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s, or the world of servants, is busy all the time.`
`Madam is strict, high‐strung, and has a short temper.`
`It'd be a lie if I said the everyday chores weren't a pain, and having to balance work with school makes it even harder.`
`{f:5:Beatrice} had watched over those painful days the whole time.`
`She had seen those constantly tired shoulders heave in a sigh many times.`
`That was why she had invited Shannon here.`
` To this Golden Paradise.`
`She had tried to give Shannon a perfect welcome, to truly make her happy.`
`......So why had Shannon selected her original world over this one?`
`{f:5:Beatrice} was overcome with shock, and completely unable to understand.`
`"I have given you the perfect welcome to this paradise.`
` And the days to follow will be even more fun."`
`"......So, if you still choose the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} world after all of that, does it mean that you find something there that is even more fun than the pleasures of witches?"`
`".........That's right.`
` There are things in the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} world that are even more fun than magic."`
`"Absurd...... That can't be...!"`
`".........Yes,`
` it's true."`
`Shannon's expression was soft.`
`However, her words were firm.`
` There was something wonderfully alluring in the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} world.`
`And that something was apparently not in this paradise, which was supposed to have everything just as they wanted it......`
`"..................Absurd...`
` ......I don't understand,`
` ......I don't understand......"`
`As {f:5:Beatrice} muttered, she shifted restlessly several times.`
`However, no matter how often she said it, Shannon's smile didn't falter, and {f:5:Beatrice} couldn't think of an answer...`
`"In that case, .........it's time for me to leave.`
` Your tea really was delicious."`
`"............I don't understand, I don't understand!`
` ......I am the great Golden Witch, the one who can have an infinite quantity of anything I desire.`
` You tell me that there is something I cannot obtain?"`
`".........Yes."`
`"I want to know.`
` I believed I had everything, so tell me what it is I lack...!"`
`"I think......that you already know.`
` Isn't that why you invited me here...?"`
`"............Are you trying to speak in riddles to a witch?`
` ......Heh, ...*cackle*."`
`"That's all for now then......`
` I can't live here, but I would be glad to come over whenever you invite me for tea."`
`"I won't call for you again...`
` Have no fear of that."`
`{f:5:Beatrice} snapped her fingers and Shannon popped out of existence.`
`She had returned Shannon's soul to the dream of her original self.`
`Although people have many dreams in a night, they can remember none of them.`
`The tea party in this paradise would mix in with many other dreams and vanish.`
`The next morning, Shannon would not remember this tea party.`
`However, Shannon's cup remained here.`
`The witch who had lost her guest and was standing alone looked all the more lonely...`
`"...................................."`
`The witch dug her fingernails into the tablecloth.`
`That grimace as she bit her lower lip made it clear...`
`that she still hadn't solved the puzzle Shannon had left behind.`
`"Riiche.`
` There's no need to worry about it."`
`Above Shannon's empty seat, a black hole opened, and the owner of that voice fell out of it.`
`"......I do worry.`
` How could she say it with such certainty..."`
`"Maybe she just wanted to get back to sleep quickly, since dawn is coming soon."`
`"............What pleasure could Shannon know that I do not?!`
` What is this "something" that can be found in the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} world but not in my paradise?!`
` I don't understand!`
` .........I want to know!"`
`"Thinking about complicated stuff will just fuel your headache.`
` I can be of service in Shannon's place.`
` Let's enjoy a tea party together."`
`"I am no longer of the mood.`
` .........I am bored of having tea parties with you."`
`"......Aw, she's cranky."`
`The witch shrugged and laughed, then took a bite out of a scone.`
`She then blew into it, and it swelled up like a balloon before finally popping.`
`Golden ribbons and butterflies flew out, but {f:5:Beatrice} didn't appear to notice......`
`".........Just what is it that I do not possess?`
` ......What......?"`
`"Watch your step there."`
`"Thank you, captain.`
` Make sure you take good care of yourself."`
`"I've got a friend who sells this stuff that's supposed to be great for stiff shoulders.`
` I'll bring you a sample next time...!"`
`"Oh, no need to trouble yourself... But thanks for caring."`
`"Hey, brats!`
` How long are you gonna mess around up there?`
` Let's go."`
`"Hey, Maria.`
` Come down off the boat with Mama..."`
`Maria, who Rosa led by the hand, was still too young for kindergarten.`
`However, she seemed to notice that her cousins, whom she rarely ever saw, were playing all around her, and she was very excited.`
`Battler and George had the energy of middle‐school or nearly middle‐school kids.`
`Those two, along with Jessica who had met up with them on Niijima, were making a lot of noise on the deck.`
`"You okay, Asumu?`
` ......You really don't like riding things, do you..."`
`Rudolf lent an arm to his wife, Asumu...`
`"......Welcome to Rokkenjima.`
` Thank you for making such a long journey."`
`The whole family had gathered for the conference.`
`At this point in time, Rudolf's wife was still Asumu, and Ange hadn't been born.`
`Gohda and Kanon hadn't yet been employed by the Ushiromiya family,`
` and the witch's epitaph, which would toy with the family's fate, hadn't appeared yet.`
`They probably couldn't even imagine...`
`the bizarre crime that awaited them several years in the future......`
`"Krauss‐sama, Madam.`
` The family has arrived."`
`"Good......`
` Then I will call for Father."`
`"Please do.`
` I will go welcome everyone.`
` ......Ah! Shannon...!`
` Who cleaned this window frame?!`
` It still has dust on it...!`
` Quickly, wipe it off!"`
`"A‐as you wish, Madam."`
`.........Oh, come on. Natsuhi is making her work so hard again.`
`Just what good does she find in such a fussy, ulcer‐inducing life?`
`I wanted to know.`
`......Shannon.`
` What is it that you found?`
`And what did you mean when you said I already knew what I was missing?`
`Shannon.`
` Is this something I must learn by learning about you......?`
`"What's different about the day of the family conference on Rokkenjima?!"`
`"It's got to be the noise!`
` There's never this many kids around!"`
`"......It may have been a tension‐filled day for the adults,`
` but to us kids, it was a wonderful day, the only time we got to see all of the cousins we loved."`
`"In the summer, we could play with our cousins on the beach, and there were plenty of games we could play in the winter!`
` The family conferences were tons of fun for us."`
`"Same here.`
` Mom was always yelling about how there must be no mistakes,`
` but to me, it was just the day I got to play with all my cousins.`
` After all, there's usually nothing at all to do on Rokkenjima."`
`"Jessica got to live in this huge mansion with a private beach.`
` I was always jealous of her when I was a brat.`
` But thinking about it from her perspective, it must've been a pretty constricting place to live."`
`"Yes, probably......`
` There's hardly anything on Rokkenjima.`
` No friends' houses, no next door neighbors, no neighborhood.`
` When I consider Jessica‐chan's feelings about that, I feel a little sad for her."`
`"That's why the family conference was so special to me.`
` Jumping around, messing around!`
` It felt like I was at a festival.`
` We spent every last second joking around together."`
`"If the adults always talked about adult things and told you to go play somewhere else—"`
`"And you were three cousins at about the same age,`
` of course you'd horse around!"`
`"No, it wasn't three.`
` There were four of us."`
`"I thought Ange wasn't born yet, and Maria was still too young to play with you?"`
`"You've got it wrong, Furfur.`
` The cousins weren't the only ones at the same age."`
`"Shannon‐chan was the fourth.`
` She was about the same age as the rest of us."`
`"Mom was always going on about not talking with the servant kids,`
` but Shannon and I started to get close.`
` After all, she was the one girl closest to me in age on Rokkenjima."`
`"All four of us played together.`
` We played at every family conference.`
` Right, Shannon?"`
`"......Yes.`
` I knew that Madam would scold me if she found out, but......"`
`"I wouldn't have let her!`
` You were always the one close friend I had who could understand me...!"`
`"Thank you for your words, ......Milady......"`
`I could not hide my shock.`
`How had she formed a relationship with the children of the family, despite being only a servant?`
`Natsuhi had probably been very careful to prevent such a relationship.`
`However, it's no surprise that Jessica, all alone on this island,`
` would want to be friends with a kid of her own age.`
`And Shannon was also alone on this island without any friends her age.`
`Though they both understood their relationship as master and servant, they somehow managed to strike up a friendship...`
`Then, at the family conference, Jessica had introduced Shannon to George and Battler.`
`All of the adults had their hands full with their complicated discussions in the mansion.`
`During that time, Shannon was able to put aside her role as a servant for a little bit,`
` and act her age with Jessica, George, and Battler.`
`I had no idea that Shannon had constructed this new world so quickly.`
`As a butterfly hiding in the shadows,`
` ......I observed this new world of Shannon's.`
`"That day, we ran all around the rose garden and the beach."`
`"Just running around and playing was a blast."`
`"Yep.`
` Those were the only times that Shannon‐chan smiled like a girl her age."`
`"I might have......gotten a bit carried away.`
` It's embarrassing..."`
`"Battler's insanely huge now, but back then, Shannon and I were both taller and stronger than him."`
`"I just grew slowly back then."`
`"*giggle*.`
` They say that those who start late end up the tallest."`
`"Ihihi!`
` Yeah, totally!`
` Back then, your chest was nothing like this, right?"`
`"That's not true...`
` Even back then, Shannon was starting to develop womanly charm. Right?"`
`"Uh...ah...wh‐who knows......"`
`"What the hell do you mean by "womanly charm"? Sounds kinky!"`
`"Well, I was still pretty adorable back then myself.`
` That strap you could see through the shoulder of her summer clothing set off the lightning of youth in me...!`
` I remember whispering with George‐aniki that night about how big her tits were! Ihihi!"`
`"I‐is this true, George‐sama...?!"`
`"*cough*, *cough*cough*!!`
` I believe there has been a great misunderstanding...!`
` A‐all I remember was lecturing him, as the older and more knowledgeable cousin, about the differences between how boys and girls grow, *cough*cough*!!`
` And so, rather than dirty talk between cousins late at night, it was, instead, a sign of healthy growth and, umm..."`
`"......Ye~ah, I remember all of us cousins talking about that kinda stuff until midnight...`
` ......About how apparently, someone in the next class had kissed someone else,`
` or how you held hands with a girl you liked at summer camp...`
` And about so‐and‐so who you thought probably liked you, stuff like that...!`
` ......Dammit, it's so embarrassing it makes me shiver...!"`
`"Isn't that nice!`
` Another sweet page in the book of adolescence!"`
`"The most pure love comes when boys and girls first start noticing each other!"`
`"That simple, pure desire just to be around someone of the opposite sex,`
` the noble first loves."`
`"Just wonderful...`
` A bunch of kids thinking and talking about the world of love...!"`
`"D‐`
`......did that sort of thing...`
`r‐`
`really happen......?"`
`"Ihihi~!`
` Don't play dumb!`
` You were the most absorbed and curious of all of us, sitting there 'til even your ears turned red, ihihi!"`
`"I, I was not curious...!`
` I, I was just...`
`s‐`
`surprised at how much everyone knew...`
`and......`
`um......"`
`"Yeah.`
` Shannon always played dumb the most, even though she was the most interested.`
` She was the biggest pervert the~re. Ihihihi."`
`"Th‐that's not true,`
` that's not true,`
` I hate you, Milady!"`
`"Hahahahahahahahahaha...`
` Yeah, it was always like this.`
` In the day, we'd run around like kids, and at night, we'd hug our pillows and talk about secret stuff.`
` Looking back on all of it now, ......it really brings back some fond memories."`
`"We'd be whispering about something dirty, and whenever we heard the footsteps of the adults coming by, we'd jump under the covers and pretend to be sleeping!"`
`"Yeah, I remember that!`
` Like some school field trip!"`
`"Those times we all dove under the covers at once.`
` It felt like some sort of unspoken rule, like a strange sense of unity.`
` I really liked that feeling."`
`"Well, anyway.`
` That's not all we talked about.`
` There was a lot more than that.`
` We really did enjoy our youth to the fullest."`
`"And what.........is this?"`
`Shannon.`
` ......Is this that "fun thing" of the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} world?`
`Is this incomprehensible messing around the thing that you found?`
`"A bunch of kids gathered together, playing stupid games and talking about trivial things.`
` ......Is this the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} pleasure you found that surpasses the pleasures of witches?"`
`".........Yes.`
` Doesn't it look fun to you?"`
`"I will not call it boring.`
` However, the idea that such a vulgar game could compare to my paradise, where all wishes can be granted,`
` ......is unfathomable to me."`
`"Interacting with people......is a lot of fun.`
` Of course, I also think your world is fun.`
` But even so, ......I choose this world."`
`"............I don't understand.`
` .........I don't understand......"`
`{f:5:Beatrice} held her head as though she was having a headache.`
`{n}But no matter how much she grimaced, she couldn't think of an answer.`
`"......Tell me.`
` .........What is it you found within this vulgar playing?"`
`"..............................`
` Do you want to know...?"`
`"I do!"`
`"Love."`
`"Lo............ve...............?"`
`"Here.`
` It's the mystery novel I promised."`
`"Th‐thank you very much.`
` I'd be happy to borrow it."`
`"That's okay. You can keep it, Shannon‐chan.`
` I've already read it."`
`"B‐but...`
` I can't accept this......`
` It was probably expensive."`
`"It's just something I got for a few hundred yen at a bazaar.`
` Don't worry about it.`
` I'd rather if you read it quickly so we can talk about it.`
` It's fun to talk about this sort of stuff with you, Shannon‐chan."`
`"Yes,`
` it's fun for me too.`
` It's much more fun to read mystery novels with two people instead of alone."`
`"I like discussing it and imagining all kinds of things.`
` With mystery novels, reading's only half the fun.`
` My theory's that you can only really enjoy a mystery novel when you talk with other people who've read it too."`
`It all started when we realized that we both read mystery novels.`
`We were both surprised and very interested to find that the other not only read tons of mystery novels,`
` but read them very thoroughly.`
`Ever since then, it's been like this.`
`Separate from the games we played with all the cousins, the two of us met together for some time alone......`
`At first, it was like a sort of contest to see who knew more than the other.`
`However, eventually, this turned into respect for how much the other had read and how deeply they were able to think about it.`
`Respect.`
` Trust.`
`{n}Those emotions made our friendship even stronger.`
`Of course, all of that had still fallen within the category of "friendship"......`
`......But we were still slightly aware of the fact that the other was of the opposite sex,`
` making for a relationship that was charming, or youthful, .........or maybe you could call it exciting.`
`However, we were still so young that even the word "youth" felt like it might be overstating our age.`
`Of course, we didn't know a thing about love.`
`So, we couldn't understand that tickling feeling in our chests,`
` both bitter and sweet, that we only felt when we were alone together.`
`However, we realized that there was some unknown emotion hidden behind that feeling,`
` ......and as our hearts raced,`
` we had our hands upon the door.`
` ......That was the exciting age we were at.`
`So.`
`At some point, our discussions about mystery novels became just an excuse for us to spend time alone together...`
`"There aren't many mystery novels that care much about the whydunit."`
`"The whydunit?`
` You mean the culprit's motive...?"`
`"Yeah.`
` There are three points you need to figure out in mystery novels: the whodunit, the howdunit, and the whydunit.`
` A lot of mysteries deal with the first two, but surprisingly few worry about the final one."`
`"Well, I know about many works that take great care to have the culprit confess his motive after he's found out..."`
`"But it has to be something that you can reason out before the culprit confesses, or it doesn't count.`
` When the culprit is someone who didn't appear to have a motive, and they commit the crime for reasons that are impossible to deduce,`
` personally, I think that's unfair."`
`"Whodunit".`
` Who's the culprit?`
`{n}"Howdunit".`
` How did they commit the crime?`
`{n}"Whydunit".`
` Why did they commit the crime?`
`"Who the culprit is, and what tricks they used...`
` There are a ton of works that ask you to figure that out.`
` In fact, almost all are like that.`
` However, I don't think there are many novels that ask you to figure out the motive."`
`"Good point.`
` Out of the trio of "who", "how", and "why", "why" might be the most neglected."`
`"Mysteries that don't take the whydunit seriously don't really feel complete to me.`
` ......Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying they're boring.`
` ......It's more like...they're missing the most important part."`
`"The most important part...is missing......?"`
`"The heart.`
` The heart is missing."`
`".........The heart........."`
`"I think the human heart is a really important thing.`
` For a person to decide to commit murder, plan it out, get everything ready, and actually carry it out,`
` that'd take an incredibly strong force of the heart.`
` The heart is what moves people."`
`......In other words,`
` only the heart can kill a person.`
`When an emotional upheaval grows strong enough to make a person want to kill, the result is the tragedy called murder.`
`Putting it the other way around, that means that the true way to close in on the crime is by searching for the heart that brings about the tragedy of murder.`
`Only the heart can kill.`
`So, if a person has been killed, you must search for the heart.`
`That's what he told me.`
`"So...`
`novels where the culprit is just a homicidal maniac who kills for fun...`
`don't really do it for me."`
`".........Then you like novels that show a strong enough movement of the heart to lead to murder?"`
`"That's right.`
` And the ones that let you reason that out are my favorite stories of all."`
`As he spoke, he looked back at me and smiled.`
`......Before today, I used to like novels that focused on exposing the tricks.`
`However, I decided to look for novels like the ones he recommended in the future.`
`"I don't like ignoring the heart.`
` .........The heart is what drives people to act."`
`"......Yes.`
` I think you're right......"`
`This isn't limited to the mystery genre.`
`{n}All people, at all times, are driven by their hearts.`
`Figuring out the heart is the essence of interactions between people—`
`no, interactions between hearts.`
`None of us humans can live on our own.`
`{n}And yet, we have no way of peeking into the hearts of others.`
`That's why every meeting between people............is its own mystery of the heart.`
`Encountering those mysteries, reasoning about them, and understanding them, is what allows people and hearts to connect with one another.`
`The two of us are here, by ourselves, talking together about mysteries.`
`And through that...`
`...we are exploring each other's heart and debating its mysteries......`
`I want you to feel about me...`
`...the way I feel about you.`
`We're both exploring,`
` trying to figure out the depths of the other's heart,`
` ......in this mystery of love.`
`"Nn, ......look how late it's gotten.`
` I wonder if Aniki and the others are waiting for us."`
`"Yes, we should probably go back soon......"`
`"......Time seems to fly by when I'm talking with you, Shannon‐chan."`
`He seemed to be speaking the words of my heart.`
`We were thinking the same thing, so the same words came out.`
`"I wish we could talk together like this forever......`
` I hate clocks."`
`"Same here.`
` Talking about this stuff with you is the most fun part of coming to Rokkenjima."`
`When I saw that his smiling eyes were looking right at me, ......I turned around.`
`I couldn't let him see my suddenly red face.`
`"If only I could go out into the world at large,`
` ......I'd be able to read so much more..."`
`".............................."`
`The bookshop on Niijima that I go to and the bookshop he goes to in the city are on completely different scales.`
`The book exchange between the two of us had become completely one‐sided, with him giving me all the books.`
`"How long do you plan to be a servant, Shannon‐chan?"`
`"......I don't know."`
`"If, someday,`
` you decide to quit..."`
`"If I do......?"`
`"Come over to my place."`
`He said it......almost carelessly.`
`{n}Maybe he was a bit embarrassed, since he laughed weakly and blushed.`
`"And then,`
` ......we won't need to worry about time running out anymore."`
`"......That's right.`
` ......We could be together......as long as we wanted..."`
`The little secret dates on this island only happened a few times a year,`
` ......and even when they did happen, it was only for a short, uncertain period of time.`
`It wouldn't work over the phone or with letters.`
`We can only talk about our mystery when we're standing together like this.`
`"I know that day'll come someday."`
`"......You think it will...?"`
`"Yeah.`
` I'm certain of it."`
`Certain?`
` How can he be certain...?`
`"When that day comes,`
` ......I'll come for you, riding a white horse."`
`".........Wha......?"`
`After saying this, he turned away.`
`He was probably too proud to show me his blushing cheeks.`
`But even without seeing, I knew what his face looked like.`
`To come riding on a white horse...`
`...umm, who did that, again...`
`{n}Uhh, isn't that like...a fairy tale prince......?`
`So, what exactly does that mean...`
`...umm...`
`ummmmm.........`
`Does that mean......you're going to be my......prince......?`
`......My mind was going blank, so I just couldn't reason out his mystery of love, even though it was all plain and simple...`
`"I,`
` ......I wonder...`
`when that day will come..."`
`"As soon as you make up your mind."`
`"Huh...............?"`
`My heart skipped a beat...`
`{n}It was so sweet...yet it hurt......`
`"Any time's good for me.`
` This is your life we're talking about, Shannon‐chan.`
` You should think about it carefully before you decide.`
` .......And once you've decided, I'll respect your decision, no matter when you make it."`
`"O‐`
`......okay......"`
`"I'll keep on waiting until that day comes."`
`"Nn, ......ah........."`
`If I were a bit more foolish...and courageous...`
`...I could have told him that my mind is already made up,`
` ...and I could have asked him to take me away from this island right now.`
`But I can't.`
`{n}I have to think carefully about my future, for both of our sakes......`
`My head filled with pointless, senseless thoughts......`
`"I,`
` ......I'm happy to hear you say that......`
` .........Thank you......"`
`"Heheh......"`
`With his back still to me, he scratched his head and laughed.`
`I knew he was doing this out of embarrassment, so I could clearly tell what his expression must have been.`
`In the same way...`
`{n}He must have realized what my face looked like.`
`We're both puzzle‐solvers of love.`
`{n}We theorize about each other's love, solving each other's mysteries...`
`"......Thanks for giving me time."`
`"You have all the time in the world."`
`"No.`
` ......I'd feel bad...`
`if I kept you waiting too long."`
`"Hahaha."`
`"So, I've made up my mind.`
` ......No, I should say that I will make up my mind.`
` ......I'm not going to quit my job immediately today.`
` ......Yes, that's it... One year.`
` ......One year from now."`
`......If, one year from now,`
` you still feel certain about coming for me on a white horse...`
`And me too.`
`If I still like you a year from now...`
`I'd like to dedicate the rest of my life to you......`
`"One year from now, in this very spot,`
` ......I'd like to make a resolved decision."`
`"......A whole year, huh?`
` That sounds good.`
` Spring, summer, autumn, winter.`
` ......That's a good amount of time to look deep into your heart."`
`"S‐`
`......so...`
`next year......"`
`You'll...`
`...come to get me, right......?`
`"Yep."`
`He responded to my cowardly resolve with a quick, strong answer......`
`"I'll be waiting for that day to come."`
`"Yes.`
` ......I'll be waiting too......`
` ...Make sure......you come, okay...?"`
`"Yeah."`
`"......Don't forget.`
` Come here next year, okay?"`
`"Yeah.`
` I'll definitely come.`
` I'll meet you here."`
`Definitely.`
`.........I see.`
`So,`
` ......this emotion that feels like sweet suffocation...`
`...is love...?`
`It is an emotion I do not know.`
` One I do not possess.`
`Though my magic can grant any wish...`
`{n}Though my paradise can grant any wish....`
`It is something I cannot have,`
` ......an incomprehensible emotion that burns like fire,`
` ......and yet, one desires madly to hold it close...`
`All I know is that no matter how great a witch I might become, I cannot create this emotion.`
`It must be given by another person.`
`For the first time, I realized that I was not all powerful.`
`And I knew what Shannon had discovered in the world of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s......`
`".........This emotion,`
` ...............it's just too much......`
` ...Once you've felt it,`
` ......there's no forgetting it, is there......"`
`......Shannon.`
` ......You win.`
`Love, ......is it?`
`It may be the most important element, ......and the one that I lack...`
`......Shannon.`
`{n}I shall observe from afar...`
`...the course of your love.`
`Go forth, ......and teach me more and more about this new emotion.........``"........................"`
`"............This form is......"`
`"I'm lending it to you.`
` After all, I hate idiots.`
` ......*giggle*giggle*.`
` Call yourself Clair, as a temporary name.`
` Or would you prefer Beato?"`
`"........................`
` ...You have my gratitude.`
` This way, I won't have to expose my pitiful form."`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} had given this person a fake form.`
`It was a temporary form for the person acting the part of {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`{n}A false appearance intended for those yet to reach the truth of {f:5:Beatrice}'s identity......`
`"......Is that...`
`...a story about...`
`...me in another world?"`
`"Lion.`
` ......It is a tale about me, who is also another world's you.`
` ......The tale of the world where I live as a witch, not a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}..."`
`"............I sometimes imagine "what if" scenarios for my own life.`
` ......However,`
` ......the tale you tell...`
`...is beyond anything...`
`I can imagine..."`
`"Even so,`
` ......it's the life that another "you" has led."`
`"But still!`
` That doesn't mean I can accept it easily."`
`Lion suddenly yelled and looked at the floor.`
`{n}Lion already knew.`
`Because of the fragments provided by {f:5:Bernkastel}, Lion knew.`
`This was a different world, where the same person lived as the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`And, in this world, .........eventually,`
` ............on the day of the October 1986 family conference,`
` .........this person would be the ringleader of a terrible crime.`
`"......Even if it is a different world,`
` ......you're saying that I get my immediate and extended family and all of the servants involved in a terrible crime that I'm the mastermind of!`
` How am I supposed to deal with that?!"`
`"...............Be quiet, listen, and understand."`
`"In a different life, I end up as a servant!`
` And if that wasn't enough, I suddenly become a witch!`
` And then, I eventually carry out several horrifying murders...!`
` How am I supposed to "understand" that?!"`
`".............................."`
`"Yeah, that's what I expected you to say.`
` ......I doubt anyone could understand.`
` ......This person here's long past expecting anyone to understand.`
` That's why {i:you} are here.`
` ......That's why {f:5:Bernkastel} brought you two, two people who never could have met, together like this."`
`"............It's not like I had any deep reason for it.`
` It was just a whim."`
`"It's a motive that no one else can understand, Lion, so you need to be the one to understand it.`
` I'm not the main character in this tale.`
` You are.`
` .........I'm just here to help you understand."`
`"You said that you understood the culprit's motive."`
`"......Yeah."`
`"Is it...a satisfying motive...`
`for explaining why I'd kill my entire family...?!"`
`"Who knows.`
` That's for you to decide.`
` Even if I say it's satisfying, that doesn't mean it'll satisfy you.`
` ......You have to decide that for yourself."`
`"I really don't have a clue what's going on...!`
` I've seen several crimes called game boards that {f:5:Beatrice} supposedly carried out.`
` And now, I'm hearing another me talk about a different life from mine.`
` But none of that fits with the crime!`
` I don't understand!!"`
`"..................At this point in the tale, ......even I...`
`could not have dreamed that I would eventually carry out such a terrible crime.`
` In fact, even if I could have dreamed it,`
` .........I did not have the power to commit that crime at that time."`
`"Probably.`
` ......Your misfortune probably came...`
`...when you solved the epitaph's riddle."`
`".........Huh?`
` You mean that epitaph about the hidden gold, which Grandfather supposedly wrote...?!"`
`"There was a system by which the culprit obtained different accomplices each time the crime was committed.`
` .........Reasoning leads us to the possibility that the culprit possessed a vast amount of money.`
` And...`
`......for inviting all to the Golden Land...`
`......and making all loves bear fruit......there was one other system."`
`"...............So, it's not just the motive...`
`...that you've figured out."`
`"That's the answer to the final riddle in the fourth game.`
` ......Your greatest misfortune was solving the epitaph,`
` .........reviving as the Golden Witch in the truest sense, and gaining that magical power."`
`"......Looking back, ......perhaps that was an ill‐fortuned event.`
` .........I do not know.`
` However, as long as the fact that Battler‐san returns in 1986 remains unchanged,`
` .........some sort of tragedy would certainly have occurred."`
`"That's right.`
` ......If Battler had returned a year earlier or later,`
` .........that incident might not have occurred."`
`No, some small incident would probably have occurred.`
`And it would surely have been a mysterious, impossible incident, which no one could understand.`
`But even so, it would have been insignificant compared to the Rokkenjima Serial Murders......`
`"......If Battler‐kun...`
`...had returned a year earlier or later,`
` ......then what?"`
`"........................`
` ......Fate can be so filled with irony.`
` .........It made me walk the path of a witch, ......and when I solved the epitaph, I became a true witch.`
` ......Then, after six years, I learned of his return.`
` .........If all of that was fate,`
` .........then this crime must have been inevitable and inescapable for me."`
`"In 1980,`
` when Asumu, his mother, died, and his father remarried too soon for his liking, Battler left the Ushiromiya family in disgust.`
` And he was gone for six whole years."`
`He convinced his grandparents on his mother's side to help him and had his last name changed to his mother's maiden name.`
`Then, when those grandparents passed away, he finally made up with Rudolf...and returned to the Ushiromiya family again in 1986...`
`"That bad luck......gave birth to your motive for the crime."`
`".........I did think it.`
` ......‘Why, after six whole years,`
` .........have you come back now?’"`
`"I understand.`
` In a way, ......it would have been better for you if he had never come back."`
`"Of course, my suffering would have continued.`
` ......However, I may have avoided tainting myself with the unforgivable crime of mass murder."`
`".........How could Battler‐kun leaving the Ushiromiya family...`
`...create a motive?"`
`"You've got it backwards."`
`"......Backwards?"`
`"The crime didn't occur because Battler left.`
` .........It happened because Battler came back."`
`"...........................`
` ......The more I think about it, the more I realize.`
` ......Ushiromiya Battler.`
` ......What a detestable man he was.`
` More than anything else, because he never realized that the outbreak of the crime was his fault."`
`"He did remember, in the end.`
` ......However, that was long after you gave up and disappeared."`
`"............If that is so,`
` ......then it would give my heart some peace..."`
`"I still don't have a clue what you two are talking about.`
` ......But I'd like to ask you straightforwardly.`
` I want to know.`
` ......What on Earth happened to you that made you decide to commit the crime?"`
`"Yes.`
` That's the most important part.`
` ......Just like how Ushiromiya Battler respected the whydunit in mystery novels.`
` .........In the tale of the Golden Witch and in the game, ......the answers to all the riddles are hidden there."`
`"In that case,`
` .........allow me to continue.`
` ......1980.`
` ......Six years before I resolved myself to commit the crime."`
`"......Battler‐sama has...`
`......left the Ushiromiya family......?"`
`"That's what Krauss‐sama and Rudolf‐sama were saying!`
` What a shock!"`
`"You have your own way of life and your own family situation.`
` I have no intention of criticizing those.`
` However, Father is in a towering rage.`
` Disinheriting a son is one thing, but I've never even heard of a child becoming so fed up with his family that he changed his own name."`
`"......No idea who he gets it from,`
` but that Battler's as stubborn as a mule."`
`"If you are unable to understand Battler‐kun's feelings, I believe that would make you a failure as a father."`
`"That's enough.`
` I'm sure Rudolf was just trying to show his commitment to raising Kyrie‐san's child properly."`
`"That would be perfectly satisfactory if it happened next year.`
` ......But why this year?`
` He's still in a period of mourning.`
` ......If you consider the timing of this pregnancy, one must acknowledge that Rudolf‐san has acted disgracefully."`
`"............Come on, don't be so harsh.`
` ......This is my way of atoning for what I've done..."`
`"Battler‐kun feels as though he's resisting you for the sake of his departed mother, Asumu‐san.`
` ......I deeply understand how he feels.`
` If he were here, I would like to hold him and cry along with him."`
`Natsuhi's words were sharp.`
` They pierced Rudolf mercilessly.`
`Rudolf had no retort.`
`{n}His relationship with Kyrie had been improper, plain and simple.`
`......According to Rudolf, he had been close to Kyrie longer than Asumu.`
`And, even after his marriage to Asumu, that relationship had not disappeared......`
`What the hell?!`
` You old bastard!!`
`So what you're telling me is, you've been betraying Mom all this time!!`
`Sure, I know Kyrie‐san.`
` You've told me that she was your business partner and a friend whose advice you can always rely on!`
`Now you're telling me she was more than that all along, and you think I give a damn about that now?!!`
`If all this had happened after Mom died, that'd be your own damn business!`
` I'd be right there with you, saying that you should live life as you please!`
`But just when did Kyrie‐san get pregnant?!`
` Back when Mom was still alive, right?!`
`Yeah, now I finally get it!`
` This is why looking at you makes me feel sick to my stomach!`
`You were {i:glad} when Mom died, weren't you? Weren't you?!`
`It must have been so hard on you, keeping your infidelity and even a kid secret while Mom was still alive!!`
`And now that Mom conveniently kicked it, you get to marry Kyrie‐san and make the kid my new little brother or sister... The nerve of you!!`
`Mom is crying her eyes out in heaven!!`
` You should be ashamed of yourself, you should be ashamed!!`
` {i:I} am!!`
` I am goddamn ashamed to have the same last name as you!!`
` The kid's done nothing wrong.`
` He or she'll need two parents to look after him or her.`
` So you go ahead and build a new family and give that kid a happy life!!`
`But don't expect any forgiveness from me!!`
`'Cause Mom isn't even here to hate you anymore!!`
` So I'm gonna hate you in her place!!`
` With all of my body and soul!!`
` So long, you old bastard!!`
`"................................."`
`"That is enough, Natsuhi.`
` ......Rudolf hasn't lost the affection he feels for Battler‐kun.`
` ......It may take some time, but he wants to fix their relationship one day."`
`"No less should be expected of him as a father.`
` ......Battler‐kun is not a stranger.`
` He is Rudolf‐san's flesh and blood, and Rudolf‐san has a bounden duty to repair their relationship."`
`".........Go ahead.`
` Heap it on me.`
` I won't argue back.`
` ......That's the only way I can atone."`
`"At the very least, make sure you give the new child a happy life."`
`"............The new kid......and Battler.`
` ......They're both my kids."`
`"Wedding Kyrie‐san after Asumu‐san's death...`
`...may have been painful for Battler‐kun, but it was the best choice you could make for the coming child.`
` ......I understand why you did it."`
`"And I understand why Battler‐kun felt like accusing you of being glad when Asumu‐san passed away."`
`"Stop, Natsuhi.`
` ......Rudolf has already been scolded enough from the person most fit to do so."`
`"......Now then, how about some black tea?`
` Would you mind asking someone in the kitchen to make us some?"`
`"...............Very well."`
`Natsuhi took this as a signal to leave the room and did so.`
`Once she left, Krauss relaxed slightly.`
`"............It is a terrible shame about Asumu‐san,`
` ......but considering the best interests of the coming child, the timing of all this might have been fortuitous."`
`"It's almost as though Asumu...`
`...knew about it, and stepped down from the stage of her own choosing.`
` .........Was I the one who killed her...?`
` .........If so, ......how long ago did I start...?"`
`"If you still treasure Asumu‐san's memory,`
` ......then, though it may take several years, you must fix your relationship with Battler‐kun."`
`".........Yeah.`
` ......I know."`
`"And be sure to pour just as much affection on Kyrie‐san and the new child that is to be born.`
` ......While also bearing Asumu‐san's cross."`
`"..............................`
` .........If they have reserved seating in hell..."`
`"......Hmm?"`
`"I hope that one of their finest seats...`
`...has got my name on it......"`
`"..........................."`
`The news that Battler had left the Ushiromiya family swept across the family.`
`"How terrible for Battler‐san, too......`
` I do believe that they will make up eventually, but......"`
`"......This is a matter for the family.`
` We servants have nothing to do with it.`
` Instead, we should focus on memorizing the face of the newest member of the Ushiromiya family, Kyrie‐sama."`
`"Yes, that's true.`
` She will be coming to the family conference this year......"`
`If the person new to the Ushiromiya family would be coming to the conference...`
`......Then what about the person who just left...?`
`"That means Battler isn't coming, right?"`
`"That seems the most probable outcome.`
` How lonely is the loss of a single, noisy man."`
`Though most people felt that it was sad to see Battler leave the Ushiromiya family and that he would be missed, they didn't think any more about it than that.`
`However, .........what about Shannon?`
`Wasn't Battler supposed to come for her on a white horse......?`
`At first, I was shocked.`
`Because I immediately thought that his departure from the family meant that he wouldn't be coming to this island anymore.`
`......And I do think that's understandable given how he must feel.`
`I understand painfully well why he wanted to leave his family...`
`But, ......does that really mean he won't come to Rokkenjima anymore...?`
`What on Earth is going on?`
`{n}Will he really never return?`
`Unable to ask him this directly, I was forced to spend each day contending with a growing sense of anxiety...`
` ......Battler‐san.`
`{n}I understand how you feel......`
`But............`
`.........You wouldn't leave this place behind forever just because you broke away from the Ushiromiya family, would you...?`
` ......Tell me it isn't true......`
`I was so confused that the world seemed to be spinning around me...`
`I felt tightness in my chest, and I couldn't think at all.`
`When I happened to touch my cheek,`
` ......I was surprised to find it hot and wet.`
`......With a miserable expression on my face,`
` I was...`
`...crying......`
`{a:c:`
`Shannon......`
`...Shannon.........}`
`From far away, ......I could hear someone calling to me.`
`{n}But it was a very strange sort of distance.`
`Though it felt very far away, ......the voice also seemed to be coming from right beside me.`
`"......Shannon.`
` I understand......how you must be feeling..."`
`"It's okay.`
` ......It's just a fight between a boy and his father.`
` And rumors always blow things out of proportion.`
` Everything's just being exaggerated."`
`"Indeed.`
` There are none who can say with certainty that Battler will not return to this island.`
` You would do well to remain strong."`
`......Where......is this place......?`
`I seem to remember it somehow.`
`It's like it reminds me of the scenery of a strange dream I once had.`
`{n}......Then, ......this must be another dream......`
`I was there, under an arbor in a golden rose garden,`
` ......and two witches in white and red dresses were showering words of encouragement upon me...`
`"You can be sure that those rumor‐mongering young servants are embellishing the story however they please.`
` That he has {i:changed his name} is obviously a gross exaggeration!`
` Surely, this can be nothing more than a family quarrel."`
`"........................`
` ......Thank you.`
` ......I wish I could believe that..."`
`"Of course that's true.`
` He's a boy, after all.`
` You can hardly be surprised that he has a few arguments with his dad."`
`"Precisely, as you say.`
` Clearly, they will make it up to each other once they cool their heads."`
`"Arguments between men flare up quickly, but they burn out just as fast."`
`"In contrast, an argument between women never bursts into flame, but smolders and lasts forever.`
` Men's arguments are fierce but short!`
` Quick and easy."`
`"......You're right.`
` ......I hope Battler‐san and Rudolf‐sama...`
`...make up soon..."`
`"Oh, they will!`
` Haven't you heard all the times Battler has spoken of it?`
` He always fights with his father!`
` This is just another of those fights.`
` His mother's death and his father's remarriage have upset him—that is all."`
`"It sounds as though he's gone to live with his mother's parents, but he'll come back after he's had a few days to cool his head.`
` You know, like a kid running away from home."`
`The two witches kept saying that Battler's fight hadn't been anything huge.`
`......If it was just a family quarrel, the rumors wouldn't have started in the first place.`
` I just can't feel optimistic about this...`
`"In any case,`
` this is a problem between Battler and his father.`
` Have patience, and time will heal all wounds!`
` Matters will not be helped by you worrying about it."`
`"Just because Battler didn't come today doesn't mean we can be sure he'll never come.`
` All this means is that Rudolf came alone today."`
`"Very true.`
` Of course he will appear at the next family conference, as energetic as ever!`
` By then, Rudolf will probably bring that Kyrie here too.`
` Battler may be sulky about it, but I am certain that he will come too!"`
`"......You're right.`
` ......Yeah.`
` .........I'm sure...you're right."`
`How nice would it be if they were right...`
`In fact, if I could, I'd like to flip through the calendar until autumn right now and check to see whether he does come to the next conference.`
`If he does, then all of my fears are groundless.`
`It would mean the rumor‐mongering family members and servants just blew things out of proportion......`
`If Battler‐san were right here, I'd like to question him right away...`
` "Hey, it isn't true that you'll never come to Rokkenjima again, right...?"`
`If I could just hear him say "of course not", ......I could stop worrying about it...`
`I don't know the phone number for Rudolf‐sama's house, but I could probably look it up if I tried.`
`However, as a servant of the family, I have no excuse for making the call.`
`And anyway, I have no way of finding out the phone number at Battler‐san's grandparents' house......`
`All I can do is wait for Rudolf‐sama's family to come visit and hope that my fears are groundless......`
`However, will I be able to make it through the day feeling like this...?`
`No way.`
` I doubt I'll sleep a wink tonight.`
`Just waiting around, feeling like this, ......when I don't know when my next chance will come...`
` I can't do that...`
`Will it be next month?`
` Or the month after?`
`{n}......In the worst case, I might have to wait until the next family conference.`
`And I have to wait that long......while holding back this suffocating feeling......`
`......I can't bear it.........`
`"Hey, Shannon.`
` Sorry for asking this out of the blue,`
` ......but when you said that by the next year you'd have made a resolved decision about something, that something wasn't just quitting work as a servant on this island, right?"`
`"......Huh? ......Well, I.........`
` ........................"`
`It was......to make up my mind to start a new life.`
`Instead of remaining a servant by force of habit.`
`I'm supposed to resolve to step into a new life and leave my old life as a servant behind.`
`"And Battler promised that he'd come here on the day you make that resolved decision, right...?"`
`".........Ummm,`
` .........yes..."`
`"Tact is not one of my strong points, so I shall speak frankly.`
` You are supposed to resolve to start a new life with Battler, correct...?"`
`"......A new life...`
`...with...Battler‐san..."`
`"You are afraid that Battler will not come for you on the day of your decision.`
` However, there is more to that day of decision than just Battler coming to see you."`
`"It's also the day for you to show your resolve to spend the rest of your life with Battler."`
`"That resolve is yours to create.`
` It is not something that will be created automatically upon Battler's visit."`
`"......Shannon.`
` Are you already resolved to spend the rest of your life with him?`
` You decided to put it off until the next family conference because you didn't have that resolve the last time, right?"`
`"What does it mean to live life with Battler?`
` Have you ever thought seriously about it in detail?"`
`"Well, .........uh............"`
`As long as I'm working as a servant on Rokkenjima, my opportunities for meeting him are limited.`
`We're both underage, so it's too early to talk about......umm......marriage.`
`However, if I quit working as a servant, I should have many more opportunities to meet him.`
`Once I quit work here, ......I'll return to the Gospel House.`
`I have my wages for serving the family, so I should have more than enough to make visits to Battler‐san's house.`
`And when I graduate from school, I can rent an apartment near to Battler‐san's house.`
`Then, well......I can work while going to school.`
`{n}That life will be a lot more difficult than my vague conception of it.`
`......However, I'll be able to see Battler‐san much, much more often.`
`{n}If not every day, then every week.`
`I won't be a servant anymore, so we'll finally be equals.`
` ......I'll be allowed to call him whenever I want.`
`And I'm already balancing school and work.`
`Thanks to my experience here, I know more than enough to do simple housework......`
`"......Doesn't that sound like a fun life?`
` You can rent a humble abode, and once you've built up your own home, you can invite Battler over."`
`"And then, the time you spend together, the world the two of you make, will begin.`
` Doesn't that sound wonderful?"`
`".........Y‐`
`......yes.`
` ......It does sound a bit...`
`...wonderful......"`
`This was the first time I had ever imagined that future clearly.`
`I've been able to appreciate the feeling of my love for him...`
`......and my honest desire to live my life with him.`
`However, now that I have a clear picture of the future I plan to choose, I finally understand.`
`I need to mentally commit myself to embarking on this future.`
`"You dream of...`
`......marriage, eventually, don't you?"`
`"Hohoh!`
` Girls these days, dating with marriage in mind at such a young age...!"`
`"W‐well, that's a bit, umm......"`
`"Don't deny your dreams, okay?`
` There's no point in taking a first step if your eyes are closed and you don't look to the future."`
`"If a girl's in love with a man, there's nothing wrong with thinking "I wanna marry hi~m"!`
` That's a young girl's natural right."`
`My face had turned bright red.`
`Before today, I had thought that considering marriage really was a bit premature, and I had been trying my best not to think about it.`
`......However, now that the witches had encouraged me to imagine it, that image was both exciting and fresh.`
`I felt an indescribable feeling of refreshment and awakening,`
` ......like the gentle breeze that washes over you when you go outside during a brief spot of sunshine on a rainy day.`
`Certainly, I hadn't yet reached that level of resolve.`
`I need to create that resolve by the time the next family conference comes around.`
`If I can't do that, then sticking around as a servant on this island is no more than I deserve.`
`"And at the same time, this is also a trial."`
`"True.`
` A trial to be overcome."`
`"......A trial...?`
` Why is that...?"`
`"Fool.`
` Battler promised that he would come for you at the next family conference, did he not?"`
`"He said he'd come on a white horse, right?"`
`"Y‐......yes......"`
`"You are thinking that Battler will not come anymore.`
` In other words, you have no trust in Battler's promise."`
`"That's why this is a trial.`
` To pass through this trial, you'll have to show that you can trust him and wait."`
`".........A trial......"`
`I never thought of it that way.`
`Since he promised to come for me in a year...`
`{n}I must believe that he will come for me in a year.`
`......If I doubt that, I don't have the right to wait for him in the first place.`
`..............................`
`"In fact, the reason that Battler left the Ushiromiya family might have been...`
`that he has his sights set on a future with you."`
`"Oh, why would that be?"`
`"If he knows that you will live together and eventually exchange marriage vows,`
` having the name Ushiromiya could cause problems, since Shannon is a servant of the Ushiromiya family."`
`"Ah, I see!`
` He realizes that there'll be all kinds of trouble if he decides to marry a servant girl, so he's abandoned the Ushiromiya name beforehand...!"`
`"What do you think, Shannon?!`
` That way, everything makes sense!`
` Battler has abandoned the Ushiromiya name for your sake!`
` This sudden argument with Rudolf was undoubtedly just an excuse."`
`"What splendid reasoning!`
` Nice going, Riiche!"`
`"Wahahahahahahahahaha...!`
` What do you say, Shannon?`
` There's no reason to feel down!`
` On the contrary, it is as though Battler has shown his resolve first!"`
`"......*giggle*.`
` ......*giggle*giggle*giggle*......"`
`A smile finally returned to my face.`
`{n}Of course, I hadn't taken the witches seriously and let myself be reassured.`
`The opposite, in fact.`
` It was just funny that they could think up such ridiculously convenient explanations for everything.`
`However, they had made all of those ridiculous theories to cheer me up.`
`......The witches are right when they say that I must trust Battler‐san...`
`and that there's no point moping about just because I've heard a few rumors.`
`By the date of the next family conference, I intend to have a firm resolve to live my life with him.`
`And......I believe that he'll accept my feelings and come for me.`
`The idea that Battler left the family so that he could be married to me some day...`
`......is laughable, of course.`
`But right now, I should try to feel confident enough to accept even crazy ideas like that.`
`"............Thanks so much.`
` ......I feel a little better now."`
`"That is well.`
` I cannot stand watching you dampen your pillow with tears."`
`"Thanks for coming into my dreams to encourage me."`
`"Yes.`
` ......It will be morning soon.`
` This is all a dream.`
` You will surely have forgotten it when you wake up.`
` However, your heart will be at peace."`
`".........Yes.`
` ......I'll believe in him...and wait.`
` ......So, I won't listen to every little rumor."`
`"Very good.`
` Wait until the next conference while improving yourself.`
` If you think of it as training to become a wife, all of your everyday chores will grow more meaningful!"`
`"*giggle*.`
` ......Thanks a lot."`
`"......Riiche.`
` It'll be morning soon."`
`"Is that so?`
` Then so long, Shannon.`
` ......You may not remember me,`
` but I will always be by your side, watching over you......"`
`"Thank you......`
` ......Thank you..."`
`"......The next family conference will be here in a flash.`
` ......Wait for it at your leisure......`
` Battler will certainly keep his promise........."`
`"Pleased to meet you.`
` .........My name is Kyrie.`
` I hope we can all become quick friends."`
`"I've known your name longer than I've known Asumu‐san's.`
` I hear you're Rudolf's old girlfriend."`
`"*giggle*.`
` Yes, we've known each other for quite a long time..."`
`"......Welcome to the Ushiromiya family.`
` I hope you find it easy to grow comfortable here."`
`"Yes.`
` I'd like to grow comfortable quickly, so that I can support my husband."`
`"But look at how cute that little girl is.`
` What's her name...?!"`
`"This is Ange‐chan.`
` What a cute name."`
`"............So, you two couldn't make up after all."`
`"I thought this would be the perfect chance to bring him back, but...`
` ......He's as stubborn as Dad."`
`"Will Battler‐kun ever come back...?`
` I'll miss him."`
`"Nothin' wrong with a man havin' the backbone to find his own way in the world.`
` I'm sure he'll make it big and come right back...!"`
`"You think so?`
` Right now, Battler‐kun's home isn't home for him.`
` There's no reason for him to go back there."`
`"......Enough.`
` This concerns Rudolf's family only.`
` It is not our place to meddle."`
`"Thank you, Krauss nii‐san.`
` ......This is an issue for our family alone.`
` However, I intend to do all I can to see that Battler‐kun and Rudolf‐san can live together again someday.`
` After all, he's Ange's one and only big brother."`
`"......Yep.`
` When that kid gets stuck on something, anything you say to him will have the opposite effect.`
` ......Asumu's father has a bit of a short temper.`
` Looks like he's been adding fuel to the fire."`
`"It'll be okay.`
` I'm sure he'll understand your feelings before too long."`
`"We can't do anything except cheer you on.`
` ......Even if he doesn't come back, we're all prayin' that the two of you will make up quickly."`
`"......It's kinda boring without Battler."`
`"Yeah.`
` ......I hope he and Uncle Rudolf can make up soon."`
`"............If you think about how Battler‐sama feels......it must be painful."`
`"It's like his family's suddenly changed around him...`
` ......It probably doesn't feel comfortable at home anymore."`
`"All men need to go out into the world one day or another.`
` It might just be that Battler‐kun's time has come."`
`"Do you think so......?"`
`"I do.`
` It's not cool for a guy to hang around at his parents' for too long.`
` You've got to leave the nest in a flurry and make your name in the world.`
` ......I planned to do that eventually, but it looks like he's gone and done it first."`
`"O‐once he makes his name in the world, ......do you think he will come back?"`
`"It may be......that he never comes back.`
` After all, this might be leaving the nest to him."`
`"......Leaving the nest....................."`
`"Battler didn't come, did he......"`
`"Oh, how terrible.`
` And I kept telling Shannon that he was sure to come.`
` .........I'm sure she feels very upset about Battler not coming.`
` And it's all because I irresponsibly raised her hopes...!"`
`"She's practically been living for the sake of this day...`
` It pains me to think of how she must feel."`
`"...............Thanks, you two.`
` ......I'm...okay."`
`I had been reunited with the witches once again in that dream world.`
`.........Though I could never remember anything during the day, now that I was in the dream world, I somehow knew that this was a reunion.`
`The witches both looked apologetic.`
`Though they had tried to cheer me up by saying that Battler would come today,`
` now that he hadn't come, it was like they had been lying, and they seemed to regret it heavily.`
`"Shannon,`
` ......umm...`
`...well......"`
`"......Thanks for your concern.`
` It'd be a lie to say I'm not sad,`
` .........but I'll be okay."`
`"Y‐you will?`
` You are certain?`
` ......That would be splendid, but......"`
`"Clearly, Battler's fight was so over‐the‐top that he couldn't bring himself to back down so soon.`
` Men are so stubborn."`
`"Y‐yes, that is true...!`
` He stormed out of the family with some very strong words, so his stubbornness is preventing him from taking back what he said so easily!`
` He probably regrets not coming today.`
` Yes, that must be it...!"`
`For some reason, ......they seemed nearly desperate in their attempts to encourage me.`
`It was almost funny to watch.`
` ......I couldn't help but giggle.`
`"Thanks a lot, both of you.`
` After all, .........you're the ones who told me in the first place.`
` That this is a test, a trial to be overcome."`
`The truth was, I couldn't really fool myself so easily.`
`When will he come back?`
`{n}When will he come for me?`
`{n}When...isn't the question.`
` ......Will he come for me, ever?`
`If I start moping right now, the uncertainty and sadness will probably tear me apart.`
`But they've taught me.`
`This is.........a test to see whether I really have faith in him or not.`
`The very fact that I feel uncertain and anxious is a betrayal of my resolve......and of his promise to come for me someday.`
`"George‐sama said something about it.`
` ......He said this might be the same as leaving the nest for Battler‐san."`
`"That's right.`
` This is his chance to leave behind the Ushiromiya name and spread his wings as his own man."`
`"If you really think about it, ......we're still very young.`
` Even if we want to be tied together, we're still lacking many years of social experience and trust.`
` If Battler‐san is really and truly taking this seriously, ......then it's too soon for him to come for me now."`
`"Well done.`
` Yes, that's the right attitude...!`
` You have done well to reach this understanding."`
`"......I haven't reached anything...`
` .........But I've decided to think of it that way for now.`
` This is a trial......to see whether I trust Battler‐san or not."`
`If he {i:had} showed up today,`
` ......then today, I would have had to inform Madam that I was quitting my job as a servant.`
`But was I mentally prepared for that?`
`I spent all last night worrying about whether Battler‐san would come or not.`
`I spent so much time worrying that not only was I not mentally prepared to quit my job, I didn't even prepare a letter of resignation.`
`......In short, I still don't have the "resolve" that I promised him that day.`
`I'm sure that God knew that.`
`{n}Battler is supposed to come for me when I've found my resolve.`
`I wasn't resolved, so it's only natural that he didn't come today......`
`..............................`
`......Yeah.`
` ...It all makes sense now.`
`"So,`
` ......I'm sure Battler‐san didn't come today......because I wasn't resolved enough.`
` It's only natural, since I couldn't even truly believe that he would come..."`
`"I'm sure Battler was the same way.`
` He did not yet have the resolve to come for you."`
`"......God isn't heartless.`
` When your feelings truly do draw close, I'm sure He'll bring the two of you together."`
`"Just like {c:86EF9C:Orihime and Hikoboshi}...!"`
`"Yes, it's as though the weather just happened to be bad during this year's Tanabata...`
` ......That's how I'd like to think about what happened today."`
`That's how...I'd like to think about it.`
`......I have no other choice.`
`..............................`
`......Battler‐san......`
`"But Battler‐kun didn't come back for......"`
`"Six years.`
` ......Still a long way to go until then."`
`"......So this agonizing wait continued for six whole years...?"`
`"When one waits every year for something to happen the next, and then the same thing the next year and the next,`
` ......it becomes similar to waiting for an eternity."`
`".........Pretty pathetic, don't you think?`
` After all, this promise you thought Battler made seems to be something he wasn't even conscious of, right?"`
`"Battler‐kun does tend to use melodramatic phrases, just like Uncle Rudolf.`
` ......His turns of phrase might have led to a misunderstanding..."`
`"Some girl's going to stab Battler in the back someday.`
` ......Well, that's more or less what this tale is."`
`".........When words carry significance, they can change the course of a person's life.`
` ......There are times...when careless talk can kill."`
`"...................................."``"Totally!`
` Why do guys turn into total morons when they get together?!"`
`Jessica's room was filled with laughter.`
`"It was one hell of a reality check...!`
` I thought this guy was a bit cool, a bit mature.`
` And then I see him with some of the other guys in our class, talking about dirty stuff with this creepy laugh!"`
`"It's true that boys always act like little kids when they're together."`
`"Well, it's not like girls are any better!"`
`""Ahhahahahahahaha!!""`
`The fun chat between girls continued without end.`
`Tonight, Krauss and Natsuhi were out late at a meeting on Niijima.`
`Normally, Natsuhi was always watching, so Jessica would make sure to be curt with the young servants,`
` but when Natsuhi wasn't around, Jessica never did that.`
`She had invited the servants of similar age to her room, and they were chatting away noisily...`
`All of them were at the age when they wanted to know about love.`
`Jessica enjoyed talking about love all the more thanks to the rigid and constricting way she had been brought up, and she seized upon this chance...`
`"What about you, Milady? You've got charm, you're the right age...`
` Aren't there any boys you're interested in?"`
`"W‐well, I'd like to fall in love, but there really aren't any...g‐good ones around...!"`
`"I think you should be a bit more proactive when it comes to love.`
` You act relaxed now, but it won't last long!`
` Once one of your friends starts going out with someone, it'll turn your world upside down."`
`"Th‐there's no way that'll happen...`
` None of my friends are traitors...`
` I, I think."`
`"Ah, no, no, no!`
` The one thing you definitely can't count on from a girl you call your friend is that she won't fall in love before you!`
` If you met someone you liked, you'd betray your friends and go out with the guy without a second thought, wouldn't you?!"`
`"A‐ahahahahahahahahahaha......`
` Wh‐what about you, Shannon...?!`
` It's not fair if I'm the only one who has to talk!"`
`"I, umm, ......don't have anyone like that around..."`
`......Not around.`
`He's far, far away, ......and like Orihime and Hikiboshi, I don't get to see him very often.`
`In fact, ......I don't even know when I'll be able to see him again.`
`......However, I believe that he'll come for me someday.`
` ......I believe it.`
`"Don't you betray me, okay, Shannon?!`
` If we get boyfriends, we'll get them together, okay?!`
` Right? Right? We promised, right?!"`
`"Oh, you wouldn't think it, but it's girls like Shannon‐chan...`
`who are the type to beat you to the punch!`
` *giggle*giggle*!"`
`"Shannon, fess up!!`
` You aren't going out with anyone, are you?!`
` You aren't, right?!"`
`"I, I'm not. Really......"`
`"Really?!"`
`"R‐really..."`
`"We'll get boyfriends together, okay?`
` No matter what happens, okay?!`
` Cross your heart and hope to die, stick a needle in your eye!!"`
`"Y‐yes......`
` I promise......"`
`"That's the face of a liar!`
` I'm willing to bet Shannon‐chan's the first of us all!`
` I can tell.`
` It's always the quiet ones that go first...!"`
`"Shannon, how could you?!`
` Fess up, fess up!!"`
`"P‐please stop, Milady...!`
` Th‐that tickles...!`
` A‐ahahahahaha...!!"`
`......Amid cheerful laughter, another lazy Sunday afternoon passed by.`
`I worked my way out of the fight and looked up at the sky through the window.`
`......I wonder if Battler‐san is somewhere out there right now...`
`surrounded by his friends and chatting about the same topic we are.`
`I only hope that you're thinking of me...`
`...the same way that I'm thinking of you...`
`But if I beg for that, it's the same as admitting that I don't trust you.`
`.........I'll wait.`
`And when you do come for me, I'll announce then and there that I'm quitting my job.`
`I've already prepared myself for it.`
`{n}......But...you haven't come yet.`
`That isn't because you won't come, ......but because I'm not resolved enough yet, right?`
`It's because I haven't clearly envisioned a future with you, right?`
`I'll wait.`
` ......No matter how long.`
`......Until you come for me, riding a white horse...`
`I will always treasure our promise.`
`{n}The promise of our precious resolve......`
`"No, never make a promise with a guy.`
` You can't count on them!"`
`Thinking that she had read my mind, I spun around.`
`Of course, she hadn't...`
`"Well, as far as that goes,`
` I think guys and girls have different ideas of what's important."`
`"They do, they do! {i:Totally} different.`
` On the whole, girls tend to be dreamers, and guys just do stuff without thinking."`
`"I guess understanding between the sexes is pretty much impossible after all."`
`"At least, I think it's pretty hard.`
` Girls often have the bad habit of thinking they know exactly what the guy is thinking right away.`
` They search for hidden meanings behind words that guys say for no reason in particular,`
` and just get the wrong idea."`
`"Ah, yeah, I've known girls like that.`
` Girls who've taken what anyone could tell them was just some meaningless comment as a sign that the guy is totally into them.`
` Yeah, I see it all the time."`
`"It's painful to watch when a girl gets the wrong idea."`
`Ahhahahahahahahaha.`
` The pair of them laughed together.`
`......When a girl...gets the wrong idea.`
` Could that be......me...?`
`No, that can't be.`
`{n}After all, Battler‐san made a clear promise to me.`
`{n}He said he'd come for me riding a white horse.`
`......I mustn't doubt.`
`I'm sure this conversation I'm hearing is just another one of God's trials.`
`So, I won't listen.`
` I won't even think twice about it.`
`"If there's one thing I never want to be, it's one of those embarrassing girls who thinks a guy's heart is linked to hers for no reason."`
`"Ahhahahahahahahahahahaha."`
`Those demonic sneers tormented me and tried to lead me astray.`
`{n}......I'm sure he'll come to the next family conference......`
`But Battler‐san didn't come to the 1982 conference either......`
`More and more things keep changing away from the way they were at the last family conference he came to.`
`Kyrie‐sama, Rudolf‐sama's new wife, now blends in perfectly here,`
` ......coming down off the boat with a familiar stride.`
`Her daughter, Ange‐sama, is growing well, and all of the family focus their attention on her.`
`Also, Maria‐sama, who was so small at the time, is already five years old.`
` She is full of energy, and old enough to enjoy playing with George‐sama.`
`Neither Jessica‐sama nor George‐sama brought up Battler‐san's absence.`
`The other relatives were the same way.`
` ......No one touches upon the subject, as though they've forgotten that Battler‐san is missing.`
`Maria‐sama was only three when she last saw Battler‐san.`
`I doubt whether she even remembers him.`
`......In just two short years...`
`All trace of your existence......has been erased from the Ushiromiya family conference.`
`That made me sad.`
` And so I said...`
`"......It looks like Battler‐sama didn't come back this year either."`
`"True.`
` ......Do you miss having him here?"`
`"Well, ......umm......"`
`"Uncle Rudolf and Auntie Kyrie don't even bring him up anymore.`
` ......It looks like Battler‐kun was much more serious than we thought."`
`"I wonder if he really will stay away forever."`
`"Looks like it was leaving the nest after all.`
` He's spread his wings and left for a new stage of life.`
` That's my assumption."`
`"......He's always been crazy and reckless.`
` Well, what more'd you expect from a guy?"`
`"Well, we know Battler‐kun.`
` I'm sure he's adapted to his new life and is enjoying himself.`
` So, there's no reason to worry."`
`Even though George‐sama said that with a smile, his words disconcerted me.`
`He's "enjoying himself", so there's "no reason to worry"...?`
` .........What is that supposed to mean......?`
`"This is Battler we're talking about, so you can bet he's forgotten all about us and is having a great time."`
`"Yeah, I'm sure that's the case.`
` And I think that's best for him.`
` Battler‐kun must have given a lot of thought to himself, his family, and his late mother, and made the independent decision to start a new life.`
` So, I hope he lives that new life with conviction.`
` Forgetting about the Ushiromiya family would do him a lot of good."`
`George‐sama smiled at me, expecting me to agree.`
`......After a moment of shock, I smoothed my expression over and found the expression he was expecting.`
`Is Battler‐san......living happily,`
` ......having forgotten about the family, about me, about our promise......?`
`That can't be true. It just can't be.`
`Battler‐san must be striving to reach that day of resolve just like me.`
`I'm not mistaken about that.`
`He promised me.`
`{n}He said he'd come riding a white horse.`
`I never asked him to say that.`
`{n}He said he'd come for me on the day I resolved to live life for his sake.`
`He made that promise himself.`
`For two years,`
` I've believed that.`
`I've done all I could to make it through God's trials and the whisperings of demons that tried to throw me from my path.`
`And yet, ......the things both George‐sama and Jessica‐sama are saying...are so cruel.`
`Battler‐san has forgotten about us and has started a new life?`
`Why are they telling such obvious lies......?`
`But that night...`
`{n}I dreamed of Battler‐san for the first time in a long while.`
`The Battler‐san in my dream.........wasn't the Battler‐san I believed in.`
`......It was the Battler‐san that George‐sama and Jessica‐sama had spoken of,`
` .........the one who had forgotten everything and started a new life.`
`Morning arrived.`
` I woke up with a tear‐stained face.`
`The me in the mirror......whimpered through tears that she couldn't wait any longer.`
`If you've managed to wait this long, why can't you wait any longer...?`
`{n}This is a trial.`
` ......We have to believe in him and wait.`
`But the me in the mirror spoke.`
` ......It was sharper than a fragment of glass.`
`.........We talk about this promise, ......but did we actually {i:make} a promise with him...?`
`Don't you remember what Jessica‐sama said?`
` ......That some girls are dreamers who get the wrong idea?`
`Don't you remember what George‐sama said?`
` ......That Battler‐san has gotten used to his new life......and has forgotten about the Ushiromiya family?`
`.........He wouldn't be the only one to forget.`
`{n}Without me asking about Battler‐san, everyone on this island would have forgotten his name.`
`{n}Even Rudolf‐sama doesn't say his name anymore.`
`If I weren't here to remember his face,`
` ......perhaps his existence would have been erased from the hearts and minds of everyone here.`
`......I don't believe it.`
` So, I won't doubt him.`
`Battler‐san must still remember our promise.`
`We're both waiting for the day of resolve, the day we'll be together.`
` ............Battler‐san.`
`{n}My mind is firmly made up.`
`Does the fact that you're not here mean that I'm {i:still} not resolved enough?`
`No.`
` ......It's because you and God are testing me, isn't it?`
`In that case, I will endure.`
`{n}Until that promised day inevitably comes.`
`.........So, ......please.`
` Battler‐san.`
`I want some sign......that you haven't forgotten me.........`
`That...was the crack that ran across my ceramic heart.`
`At last, I had to acknowledge the possibility.`
`......The possibility that something terrible and dreadfully sad was happening......and I was pretending not to notice.`
`Battler‐san...makes me yearn for him.`
`{n}Battler‐san...makes me sad.`
`{n}Battler‐san...makes it hurt.........`
`Battler‐san.`
`......Do you still remember me, now.........?`
`And then......came the third family conference since Battler‐san left.`
`If the number of beds was going to increase, we would be told about that when setting up.`
`The fact that nothing has changed in particular......means that he probably won't be here this year either.`
`Clinging to a final bit of hope, I stood by the docks, watching the boat draw closer.`
`"Hey, Shannon‐chan.`
` You're looking as pretty as ever."`
`"Careful, Ange.`
` Watch your step."`
`"Hey, Shannon. You know, I love visiting Rokkenjima...!`
` Uncle Krauss really should hurry up with his plans to turn it into a resort."`
`"Why bother?`
` It'd be such a waste."`
`"Eheheh, maybe it would.`
` How have you been, Shannon‐chan?`
` I think you've gotten a bit taller since last time."`
`"......Thank you very much."`
`"And the weather's good again this year...!`
` We should count our blessin's that we can bring the whole family together like this without a single one of us missin'."`
`"Please allow me to guide you to the mansion......"`
`So, after all, ......Battler‐san has been so thoroughly forgotten that he might as well not have existed in the first place.`
`The sadness must be showing on my face.`
`Not wanting anyone to see it, ......I turned my back to the family and led the way up to the mansion.`
`Then, ......suddenly, someone mentioned Battler‐san's name, and I jumped.`
`"What, you saw Battler‐kun?"`
`"Is he doing well...?!"`
`"Yes,`
` he's doing very well.`
` I took Ange and had some tea with him the other day."`
`I was surprised.`
` ......So, Kyrie‐sama was in touch with Battler‐san.`
`According to her, the fight between Battler‐san and Rudolf‐sama had calmed down a long time ago,`
` but both were so stubborn that they hadn't found a good chance to make up.`
`And since Battler‐san had gotten used to living with his grandparents and going to school near there,`
` it wasn't going to be easy to get him to come back home, especially considering that the grandparents were adding extra complications.`
`"......It's just too bad.`
` I think Asumu‐san's parents were even more angry than Battler‐kun was.`
` This isn't just an issue between Battler‐kun and Rudolf‐san anymore."`
`"Then will Battler be coming back sometime soon?"`
`"He will make up with Rudolf‐san, but it looks like he doesn't intend to return to the Ushiromiya family.`
` ......Such a shame.`
` Though I do understand how he feels."`
`It was a bit of a relief to hear that some of the bad feeling had died down in these three years.`
`Taking Asumu‐sama's parents into account, it's no surprise that things haven't gone as well as they could.`
`But if Battler‐san doesn't hate Rudolf‐sama anymore, ......then someday...`
`......Surely he'll come back.`
` He'll have grown so much.`
`My resolve will never waver again.`
`For some nights these past three years, I've felt sad and resentful.`
`But now, ......it feels as though those three years were something I needed.`
`After all, ......the seeds of love, the faint feelings I once had for you...`
`...have budded powerfully, waiting for the day that we'll be reunited.`
`This is how honest my feelings for you are now.`
`.........I...love you.`
`I want to see you again as soon as I can.`
`Until that time, ......I'll keep this sprout of love warm and growing for you......`
`I won't doubt the coming of that day anymore.`
`Just as I think of you, under the same sky...`
`...I believe that you are thinking of me.`
`......I'm sure this news about him is a sign that God is cheering me on.`
`So, I asked God one more time, inside my heart.`
`Since my feelings for Battler‐san have not wavered for a day these past three years...`
`Let me know that he feels the same way.`
`I know that asking for that is a sin.`
`However, now that we've reached a three‐year turning point,`
` ......I want some gift from God, any gift, to show that I have not waited in vain.`
`That is what I prayed.`
`"Oh, that's right.`
` It's been so long since Battler‐kun last saw you all, right?`
` I thought you might be feeling lonely, so I told him to write you letters.`
` Here they are."`
`..................Huh...?`
`Did God......really hear my prayers?`
`{n}I felt as though my heart was going to leap out of my chest.`
`"A letter from Battler?`
` Awesome!`
` What'd he write?!"`
`"Did he say anything about how he's been doing lately?`
` I can't wait to read it."`
`Kyrie‐sama pulled a brown envelope out of her bag and handed it to George‐sama.`
`Just one?`
`When George‐sama opened it, several folded letters came out.`
`"Looks like this one's addressed to me.`
` ......They all have different names on them.`
` Here, this one's yours, Jessica‐chan."`
`"Thanks!"`
`"And this one's for Maria‐chan.`
` Will she be able to read it...?"`
`"I'll read it to her later.`
` Thank you."`
`"There's even one for Ange‐chan.`
` Now of course she can't read."`
`"*giggle*.`
` I'll give it to her when she does learn."`
`"He says he's doing great and having a blast...!`
` That's awesome."`
`"......Umm,`
` ......is that...`
`all of them...?"`
`"Yep.`
` Looks like that's all of them.`
` Thanks a lot."`
`George‐sama handed me the empty envelope.`
`......Apparently, he thanked me because he thought I was offering to throw it away for him.`
`And, clearly, ......there was nothing inside it.`
`There was no letter for me...`
`"Whoa.`
` The more I read, the more fun it looks like Battler‐kun's been having.`
` Living every day to the fullest."`
`"That's what it looks like in mine, too.`
` If he's happy, then I guess that's what counts."`
`"*giggle*.`
` That's so mean of Battler‐kun.`
` It sounds like he forgot about us until you told him to write those letters."`
`"Well, you know what he's like.`
` Battler‐kun enjoys life.`
` And I hear he's popular with the ladies at school, too."`
`"Wow...!`
` Incredible!"`
`"There should be plenty of girls who like those hilarious, melodramatic lines of his.`
` Makes sense to me."`
`"I wonder if he really does plan to stay away."`
`"It looks like he does.`
` In my letter, it says that he doesn't plan to return to Rokkenjima."`
`I know that all these letters and the things written inside them...`
`...are trials from God.`
`The absence of a letter for me,`
` the information that he's enjoying life and has forgotten about Rokkenjima,`
` ......are all just trials upon trials.`
`He is...`
` God is...`
`...testing me.`
`The fact that I'm the only one without a letter is proof of that......`
` ............I...`
`............wanted to believe that............`
`......But...`
`......at last.........`
`I couldn't believe any longer...............`
`"......It might've been an important promise to you,`
` ......but it looks like it wasn't for Battler."`
`"................................."`
`"......No way.`
` ......Then, that promise about him coming on a white horse was..."`
`"I was a dreamer... It was just an illusion I created......"`
`"To Battler, they were probably just meaningless words to make him sound cool."`
`......What a ludicrous story it might seem to an outside observer.`
`{n}That promise with Battler might have been an illusion the whole time.`
`We don't even know......if they felt the same way about each other in the first place.`
`Love is an illusion.`
`When both sides see the same illusion, the love becomes true.`
`However, when the feelings of each side are different, ......then it's nothing more than a joke.`
`"This is Battler's sin."`
`"......That he created the illusion......of a promise."`
`"No."`
`".........Huh?"`
`"......It's that he didn't even remember."`
`"If he had simply broken his promise, ......I could have confronted him about it.`
` I could have regretted, or I could have recovered.`
` .........However, since he didn't even remember, I am unable to question him about it."`
`".............................."`
`"I am unable to hate Battler‐san.`
` ......After all, Battler‐san didn't even break his promise."`
`"There just wasn't......any promise from the beginning."`
`"......It was nothing more than a sad.........joke."`
`.........I kept on crying and crying.`
`{n}I dug my fingernails into my pillow, soaking it with my tears.`
`How much easier it would be to hate something...`
`But I can't hate anything.`
`I just couldn't get over my miserable arrogance,`
` ......which had led me to believe for three whole years that he felt the same as I did.`
`"......I am to blame for this.`
` ......My irresponsible words led you to believe that Battler made a promise..."`
`"No.........`
` This isn't anyone's fault.`
` ......It's all because I assumed that he felt the same way I did..."`
`"Battler did not make a promise.`
` However, that does not mean his feelings were anything to be laughed at!`
` Though there might have been a difference in degree when compared to yours,`
` it is true that he liked you!`
` Of that, there can be no doubt."`
`"......Please, ......just stop it......`
` ......I've believed that he liked me the way I liked him, ......without ever doubting that.`
` .........Please don't try to cheer me up.`
` ......I'd rather......that you mocked me........."`
`Before I knew it......`
`a dull inescapable pain had pierced my chest.`
`{n}When I pressed my hand against my chest, I realized what that pain was.`
`It was the bud of love, which I had sown the seeds of and raised in my heart.`
`Its roots had spread throughout my chest,`
` ......tormenting me like a metal wire wrapped around my heart.`
`Rather than roots, ......they looked more like fissures running through my heart.`
`The only way to kill the pain would be to tear out the roots of love.`
`But no matter how much I clawed at them, it was only my heart that got torn and scratched.`
` ......The roots of love didn't move at all.`
`If my feelings for Battler‐san were to turn to hate, without any lingering interest or regrets,`
` ...I'd be able to pull out these roots easily.`
`They would probably leave a hole behind, but at least they wouldn't hurt me anymore.`
`But they won't come out.`
` ......Even though it hurts so much, those roots of love are still stuck in my heart.`
`"......Shannon..............."`
`"I...`
` .........Even now,`
` ......I love Battler‐san...`
`......so much.`
` ......I miss him.`
` I want him to come back......`
` I believe he will come back someday,`
` ......and I want to wait for him...`
` ......But...`
`...now it's just...`
`...too much........."`
`As I sobbed, the tightness in my chest grew even stronger.`
`As long as I love Battler‐san, that pain will always continue.`
`Because I love him, I want to hold onto that pain forever.`
`But......it was written right there in the letters for George‐sama and the others.`
`Battler doesn't plan on returning to the Ushiromiya family.`
`He's forgotten about me and Rokkenjima,`
` ......and has started a new life with a different name.`
`I have to endure all this aching, biting, agonizing pain...`
`......and wait forever for someone who will never return...`
`"Is this another trial......?`
` To wait for him forever?`
` ......Is that what God is asking of me......?`
` I can't do that......`
` I...`
`...want to be with Battler‐san.`
` But if this is the trial...`
`that I must go through for that...`
`...it's just...`
`......too painful......"`
`"...................................."`
`{f:5:Beatrice} hung her head in shame.`
`If she hadn't encouraged Shannon so much, it probably wouldn't have been this painful.`
`Shannon may have been the one to sow the seed of love in her heart.`
`{n}However, {f:5:Beatrice} had irresponsibly watered it and told Shannon not to give up.`
`......{f:5:Beatrice} scratched at her chest, trying to share Shannon's pain...`
`"........................This is...my fault."`
`{f:5:Beatrice} mumbled to herself.`
`"......How can any of this be your fault?"`
`"For three years, I tortured you with the illusion of a promise that never happened.`
` ......If I had not nourished the bud of love within you, ......you would not have suffered so."`
`"................................."`
`"Shannon.`
` This may sound harsh, ......but listen."`
`"...............What is it...?"`
`"Forget Battler.`
` ......There was no bud of love in the first place."`
`"......No.`
` I'm the one who nourished it.`
` ......No matter how painful it is, I can't forget it."`
`"But you cannot bear that pain any longer, can you......?"`
`"......................................."`
`Wordlessly, Shannon held her chest and hung her head.`
`I......yearn for Battler.`
`Even now, that feeling burns inside me,`
` ......and no matter how much it hurts, I can't let it go.`
`I've spent three years pretending not to notice that pain.`
`Now, I know that I feel it.`
`And now that I know, ......it's unbearable...`
`"So, you cannot throw away your bud of love for Battler?"`
`"..................I can't."`
`"However, at this rate,`
` ......the bud...the roots...will kill you."`
`".............................."`
`"People need a universe to survive.`
` ......And one person cannot create that universe alone.`
` Two are needed."`
`".........A universe......"`
`"Together with Battler, you created the universe of that bud of love.`
` ......Now that one half of that pair is gone, your universe has crumbled.`
` ......People cannot......complete a universe on their own."`
`"But...`
`...the other person who creates my universe,`
` ......Battler‐san, won't come back..."`
`"Then you must create a new universe with someone else."`
`".........You mean, ......create one with someone other than Battler‐san?"`
`"I will give you that someone."`
`"......Who are you.........talking about......?"`
`"A creature to bury the pain in your heart and heal you.`
` ......He will not betray you.`
` ......Yes, ......let it be a sibling.`
` ............I will give you a little brother."`
`"A little brother..............."`
`"A boy you have always been close to at the Gospel House, whom you love as if he were your real brother.`
` ......That, I shall give to you.`
` ......Together with him, you will create a new universe."`
`"......Will that little brother......make me forget about the pain of my love for Battler‐san......?"`
`"Indeed.`
` .........You need a universe."`
`"Then, ......what will happen to the bud of love...`
`...in my heart?`
` .........My feelings for Battler‐san won't change.`
` ......I can't make them wither."`
`"..............................`
` ......I shall accept that bud and those roots...`
`in your place."`
`"......You will............?"`
`"You can forget the pain of love and create a new universe.`
` ......I will accept the bud of love in your place.`
` ......It means that I will accept the pain as well, ......but I will also learn of the single element I do not possess,`
` ......the element of love."`
`{f:5:Beatrice}......wanted to know love.`
`{n}She wanted to feel what Shannon had felt in the world of humans.`
`".........And,`
` if Battler ever does return,`
` if the bud still has not withered and you still desire it,`
` I shall return it to you.`
` ......What do you think of that?"`
`"...................................."`
`Still hanging her head, ......Shannon gave a small nod, but said nothing.`
`It would mean release from this unbearable pain.`
`And...it would mean giving the bud of love to the witch, to hold in her place......`
`Shannon spread the hands that she had held to her chest.`
`As she did, a faint light slipped out of her chest and floated in the air,`
` ......gradually swallowing everything with its brightness.`
`As the brilliant light began to fade away, Shannon and {f:5:Beatrice}, still facing each other,`
` were now inside a vast, starry sphere, like a planetarium.`
`They were the only ones in this pitch‐black starry sea.`
`.........Shannon felt as though she had seen this place once before, but she could not remember.`
`Then, I made another announcement.`
`"The world shall be modified.`
` ......Let the bud of love travel from Shannon to {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`This way, Shannon won't be tormented by the bud of love anymore.`
`On top of this, so that Shannon can create a new universe, ......I'll give her a little brother.`
`The backstory for the little brother will be a younger boy at the Gospel House with whom Shannon was close.`
`For a name, ...............let there be the {ruby:on:{p:0:音}} character, as Gospel House rules state.`
`............Yeah, I've decided.`
`{n}......That's a perfect name to go with Shannon's.`
`He'll be......a quiet, reticent boy.`
`{n}He'll come to Rokkenjima as a new servant.`
`There, he'll establish an immediate rapport with Shannon.`
`As a duty‐minded boy who loves Shannon like a big sister, he'll always be there for her......`
`Let's have him be a special servant like Genji, who is permitted to serve Kinzo directly.`
` ......Yeah.`
` That sounds kinda cool.`
`Then, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`{n}From now on, you will carry the bud of love.`
`In other words, ......the role of being infatuated with Battler and waiting for his return will go to you.`
`While you are still the witch who reigns over Rokkenjima's night...`
`{n}You have also been waiting for Ushiromiya Battler, ever since that day three years ago.`
`Along with this change in setting, I'll give you a new form as well...`
`He did tell us what his ideal woman would look like once, remember?`
`......A woman with a great figure and long, golden hair, like a foreign model.`
` Golden hair.`
` Long hair.`
` A great figure.`
`......Yeah.`
` Something like that.`
`{n}That's what the new {f:5:Beatrice} will look like.`
`Come now, hold that bud of love in your heart as you wait for Battler.`
`......You will learn of love at last...and pay the price of pain.`
`Yes, this will be the setting for my new world.`
`For Shannon, a new servant like a little brother will come.`
`{n}He will be a silent, reticent boy.`
` A duty‐minded kid who loves Shannon as a sister.`
`And the bud of love that has tortured Shannon......will go to the witch, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`She will just be holding onto the bud of love for the time being.`
`However, while she holds onto it, she will be a maiden in love with Battler.`
`For that time, you will be able to learn what love is......`
`Come, let the world be modified.`
`{n}Oh, I am one yet many.`
`Awaken, us.`
`And stretch your wings in this new world......`
`.........Slowly, .........I opened my eyes to the gentle rays of the morning sun.`
`..............................`
`How long has it been since I woke to such a pleasant morning?`
`......The face in my mirror is tear‐stained and pathetic.`
`However, ......my heart is as clear as the morning sun.`
`I could still clearly remember that strange dream.`
`{n}However, I could feel myself forgetting it rapidly...`
`The place I'd been in my dreams......had been such a strange place.`
`A peaceful, calm place.`
`......There, ......I had left behind the pain I had carried in my chest until yesterday.`
`So this morning, my heart was at peace...`
`"Good morning, me........."`
`My tear‐stained face really looked pathetic.`
`{n}However, my expression was bright and cheery.`
`I still do...`
`...love...`
`Battler‐san.`
`But, ......I think I'd say...`
`......I've calmed down.`
`It feels like I've put something precious safely away in the place it belongs.`
`............Battler‐san.`
` When will you come back, I wonder...`
`{n}When you do, I'd like to talk about mystery novels again.`
`......Oh, I almost forgot.`
`{n}A new boy servant will be coming today, won't he?`
`One of the rare servants who will serve the Master directly.`
`{n}What kind of kid will he be?`
` I hope we get along well......`
`What was his name again?`
`{n}I think......it was......``Men in work clothes were spreading a tarp over a section of the hall.`
`From the way they measured the wall and set out tools, it could be seen that they were preparing to do some sort of construction work.`
`"This is of the utmost importance to the Master.`
` Be sure that you do not damage it."`
`The president of the construction company nodded his head several times to show that he understood.`
`Then, six young workers carried in a large rectangular object wrapped in a white sheet...`
`"Ookay, careful there!`
` Set 'er down gently... Gently, I say."`
`"Is this spot good?"`
`"Great, let's get started."`
`Apparently, they were putting something large onto the wall of the hall...`
`".........Is that where he wants to hang it?"`
`"That's what he wants.`
` After all, this mansion is little more than one of Father's toys."`
`Natsuhi took a deep breath.`
`Though this was a whim of Kinzo's, a man she greatly respected,`
` ......she seemed to resist the idea of hanging it right here in the entrance hall, the face of the mansion.`
`When the white sheet was pulled off, a Western woman wearing a beautiful dress came into view...`
`It was a massive portrait of a woman......`
`"Is it proceeding well?"`
`"Yes.`
` They will be finished by this evening."`
`"I would like to see it hanging there for all to see as soon as possible.`
` I want you overseeing this, my friend."`
`"Leave it to me."`
`"......Father.`
` It seems to be a splendid portrait."`
`"Mm.`
` The artist has done excellent work.`
` I am satisfied."`
`"......This is your benefactor, the woman who gave you the gold?"`
`"Indeed.`
` ......If I had not met {f:5:Beatrice}, I would not be here, nor would the Ushiromiya family, nor would, of course, this mansion.`
` It's only natural that her portrait be displayed in the best possible location."`
`Now that he had said so this bluntly, there would be no contradicting him.`
`Krauss and Natsuhi could only shrug.`
`"......My lord.`
` The epitaph plate is here.`
` Would you please check to see that all is in order?"`
`"Mm.`
` Each and every word must be correct..."`
`Epitaph...?`
` Krauss and Natsuhi crooked their heads and followed Kinzo.`
`The leader of the workers set down a plate wrapped in a sheet.`
`The others thought that the picture's name and an explanation might be on it,`
` but it seemed to have quite a lot of words for that...`
`".........Father,`
` what is this......?"`
`"Behold...`
`...the sweetfish river, running through my beloved home of old......?"`
`"Heh.`
` ......Heheheheheheh.`
` Read and interpret it as you like."`
`"......So, we finally reach the appearance of the epitaph and the portrait."`
`"I don't know much about this epitaph.`
` It doesn't exist in my world."`
`"Probably not.`
` In your world, there's already a clear successor: you.`
` But not in this world."`
`"In other words, ......this epitaph was set up to choose Grandfather's successor after all...?"`
`"Most likely.`
` Or, he might have wanted to believe in the chance of a miracle."`
`A difficult riddle, made so that no one would be able to solve it.`
`If someone actually could solve it, ......they would be a miraculous person.`
`{n}And that miracle......might shepherd the person Kinzo most desired...`
`"In short, this epitaph really does show a ritual to revive the witch {f:5:Beatrice}, just as everyone thought...?"`
`".........That is a normal interpretation to make.`
` A mysterious ritual, sacrificing thirteen people to revive the witch.`
` ......However, that is not the true ritual.`
` ......The wait for someone to miraculously solve it.`
` That is the true ritual.`
` However, fate does have its irony."`
`"Genji already knew.`
` ......Maybe Kinzo set this up in the first place because he guessed that Genji knew everything."`
`"......Was that fate a coincidence, or something engineered?`
` I do not know.`
` ......However, with this epitaph, the witch {f:5:Beatrice} would revive in the truest sense."`
`".........This is...`
`.........{f:5:Beatrice}..."`
`My soul was captured by the woman shown in that massive portrait.`
`{n}That might have been literally true.`
`Or, rather than captured, perhaps it would be better to say that my soul had returned to a more fitting place, the place it belonged.`
`The beautiful blonde hair was the same as mine, but tied up.`
`The dress she wore was a deep black, making that golden hair stand out all the more.`
`.........This is the witch...{f:5:Beatrice}.`
`{n}My......true form......`
`"Hm?`
` ............What is this?"`
`There was a plate with too many words for it to be the title of the picture.`
`Behold the sweetfish river, running through my beloved home of old......`
`{n}You who seek the Golden Land, follow its path downstream in search of the key.`
`"......The Golden Land...`
` ......I see,`
` .........so my world...`
`...is the Golden Land..."`
`I have always called my own, personal world a Paradise.`
`{n}But tonight, I shall change that.`
`From now on, my world shall be the Golden Land.`
`{n}I am the master of the Golden Land, {f:5:Beatrice}......`
`......And then, there is the brutal ritual of sacrifices starting with the first twilight.`
`{n}On the ninth twilight, the witch revives, and none shall be left alive......`
`"Is it saying that if I carry out this ritual, ......I will experience a true revival......?"`
`Then, on the tenth twilight, the journey ends, and I shall reach the Home of the Gold......`
`{n}The witch shall praise the wise, and bestow four treasures.`
`{n}One shall be all of the Golden Land's gold.`
`......Kinzo received a massive amount of gold from {f:5:Beatrice}, and rumor has it that it still lies hidden somewhere.`
`Is this, as the family members and servants are all whispering, a code showing the location of Kinzo's hidden gold?`
`".........If a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} reaches the solution, they will obtain a great quantity of gold.`
` .........However, if I am the one to solve it, it will mean my own resurrection..."`
`.................................`
`......Kinzo, you aging mage.`
`{n}Just when I was mocking the shortness of the time left to you, you start a game like this.`
`How intriguing.`
` ......I shall solve this riddle of yours.`
`{n}I shall revive as the real {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`And then, I shall use my great magical power to control object and man, day and night, and all of Rokkenjima......`
`"They all say that epitaph is a guide to finding hidden treasure...!"`
`"The rumors tell that the Master has ten tons of gold hidden away...!"`
`"......Yes, those rumors about {f:5:Beatrice} being the one who gave it to him.`
` I've heard that too."`
`"Ten tons of gold...... That would be incredible.`
` I can hardly even imagine it."`
`"If you had all that, what would you use it for...?!`
` I'd like to touch it, just once...!"`
`"Hoh‐ho‐ho‐ho‐ho‐ho!`
` Forget touching it, I'd like to spend it all."`
`"But why would he go out of his way to present this epitaph, ......this code showing the hiding place of the gold..."`
`"That's obvious.`
` He's laughing at everyone, since he thinks no one can solve it."`
`"It's a challenge to the rest of us, isn't it?`
` He wants to know if there's anyone here wise enough to solve it..."`
`"It seems that the Master doesn't intend to let Krauss‐sama take the headship easily.`
` ......Perhaps the one who solves this will become his successor?"`
`"Genji‐san, what is this?!`
` Could this be a portrait of......{f:5:Beatrice}? The woman that Father..."`
`"......Correct.`
` This is {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama."`
`"What on Earth?`
` There's a strange little poem‐like thing over here."`
`"..............................`
` ......What is this all about?`
` ......It's almost like......a pirate code that shows the way to hidden treasure.`
` ......Genji‐san.`
` What does this mean?!"`
`"The Master says to read and interpret it as you wish.`
` ......And that the riddle applies equally to all who can see the epitaph."`
`"You said riddle just now, didn't you?!`
` That means this can be solved.`
` .........Yes, it's just as I thought.`
` Father doesn't want Nii‐san to succeed him...!"`
`"So, whoever solves this becomes the successor...!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*, *giggle*giggle*...!!!`
` Finally......`
` The tables have finally turned...`
` ......I now have a real chance......to become the head......!!"`
`"What do you think, Kyrie?"`
`"......I think it's extremely likely that this epitaph shows the location of the hidden gold."`
`"It looks like Aneki thinks the one who solves it will be chosen as the successor."`
`"That may also be possible.`
` ......Father doesn't view Krauss nii‐san as someone who has what it takes to succeed him.`
` Given that Father is reaching the end of his years, this might be a wild, last‐ditch gamble to find someone worthy."`
`"So, if we actually solve this riddle, we stand to gain ten tons of gold and the position of successor."`
`"On the face of it, perhaps.`
` ......However, I'm sensing some malice, as though he doesn't think us capable of solving it.`
` I doubt it will be easy."`
`"True.`
` ......Heheh.`
` Looks like this'll keep us entertained for some time."`
`".........Ridiculous.`
` How could anyone solve this?"`
`Rosa tossed aside a notepad with the epitaph written on it and flopped over onto the sofa.`
`Solving this means ten tons of gold.`
`With that much, I'd never need to worry about making money ever again.`
`......If I had money, I could pay off the debt, ......and then maybe he'll come back to me......`
`"............I know where Father's beloved home of old is.`
` What's the "sweetfish river"?`
` There are tons of rivers there.`
` And what "village"?`
` Aah, I don't have a clue......!"`
`"......Uu.`
` What's wrong, Mama......?"`
`Maria looked concerned.`
`Kids are really good at puzzles, so maybe......`
`"Hey, Maria.`
` Do you think you know the answer to this puzzle?"`
`".........................................."`
`Maria gazed at the paper with the epitaph on it as though she was trying to bore through it with her eyes.`
`{n}Her eyes opened wider and wider......`
`"What do you think, Maria...?`
` I guess it might be a bit too hard for you."`
`"Kihi.`
` Kihihihihihihihihi!`
` This is a witch's ritual, a resurrection ritual for Beato...!"`
`"Where'd you get this?!`
` Hey, Mama, where'd you get this?!`
` I'm gonna ask Beato, I'm gonna ask Beato!!"`
`"I'm sure this ritual will let Beato regain her full power!`
` She'll be able to appear in front of everyone and do miracles of magic, without having to worry about the anti‐magic toxin anymore...!!`
` Kihiha{0}haha, haha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!"`
`"......And what of the epitaph?"`
`"It seems the family members are all competing to solve the riddle."`
`"Hmph......`
` Good.`
` Let everyone try.`
` And none will solve it.`
` Except for the one blessed by a miracle.`
` ......If I let my guard down, even I might forget the process.`
` That is how difficult it is."`
`"......Because it is difficult, solving it will bring about a miracle..."`
`"Precisely.`
` ......This is the final miracle I will desire while I still live.`
` My final magic.`
`......When a miracle comes and allows one to solve that inscrutable epitaph, .........it will surely mean {f:5:Beatrice}'s resurrection.`
` ......Ohhh, {f:5:Beatrice}...`
` I just want to see your face one more time...`
` I don't need wealth or honor anymore.`
` If I could only see you one more time......!"`
`Kinzo understood that he was facing his last years and considered this his final magic.`
`After losing {f:5:Beatrice} across two generations, he was betting everything that she had given him in the hope of being reunited with her.`
`His meeting with her that day had been the true beginning of his life.`
`And even after the two of them had left the stage, Kinzo had remained there alone in the darkness.`
`The aged monarch had obtained everything, accomplished everything,`
` but this was the one element that had always slipped through his fingers, no matter how much he struggled.`
`If he could just have that element, ......he would need nothing else in life.`
` In the end,`
` ......perhaps his whole life was just a journey to learn that one single element makes up all that it means to be human.`
`"My friend.`
` .........Will the final bit of magic in my life bring me a miracle......?"`
`".............................."`
`For a while, Genji was silent.`
`He wasn't at a loss for words or struggling to find an answer.`
`......During that silence, something had passed between the two men, who had known each other for so long that their friendship surpassed that of master and servant.`
`"......Yes...so be it.`
` ......No one is capable of solving it.`
` That is why it would be a miracle."`
`"My lord.`
` ......Please, tell me one thing."`
`"Nn, ......what is it?"`
`"If, I ask you.`
` ............{i:If} a miracle does occur..."`
`"Nn........."`
`It may have been different when he was young, but in his old age, Genji was not fond of talking about dreams and "what ifs".`
`That very same Genji now spoke of a hypothetical.`
`{n}......Kinzo quietly waited for the next words of the man he called a friend.`
`"If a miracle does occur,`
` if your magic comes true...`
`.........and {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama does revive,`
` ......what will you do...?"`
`As the one closest to Kinzo,`
` Genji obviously knew of the crazed feelings with which Kinzo had sought {f:5:Beatrice} in the past.`
`......And yet, Genji was asking what Kinzo would do if {f:5:Beatrice} did revive.`
`"................................."`
`"......My lord, at one time in the past,`
` you experienced the miracle of {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama being reborn.`
` If that miracle happened again,`
` ......what would you do?"`
`"............My friend.`
` So, after all, ......you do blame me."`
`"......I cannot claim to know everything about your heart or the heart of {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` ......However, I believe that I do know something...`
`...of the way in which {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama adored you."`
`".................................`
` ......I am racked with regret.`
` You may not believe, ......but as I have aged, I have come to regret everything."`
`"........................"`
`"If a miracle does occur...`
`and {f:5:Beatrice} revives,`
` ......then, of course, I do not care if she knows nothing of the time she spent with me in the past.`
` ...No, as long as she is {f:5:Beatrice}, I don't care who it is!`
` ......I just............want to apologize...!"`
`".........Is that truly how you feel?"`
`"Yes, my friend.`
` ......I regret it.`
` I deeply regret the mistakes I made in my youth.`
` ......You have aged as well, so you must know.`
` ......I could not feel guilt for the sins of my youth when I was still young.`
` However, like a deep thorn, it began to fester, .........torturing me.`
` ......I am willing to accept death in whatever form it may take!"`
`"However, ......this thorn.........this regret.........is the one thing I must resolve......`
` I must return everything to {f:5:Beatrice}...`
`and beg forgiveness for my sins...!`
` That is, ......that is my only and final wish......`
` ...Ooh,`
` ......oooooohhhh.........`
` Uwaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}ah{0}h{0}h{0}h{0}h{0}h{0}h{0}h......!!"`
`Kinzo covered his eyes and sobbed.`
`This aged lord, who had built up enormous wealth in a single generation, ......was now, at the end of his life,`
` ......sobbing simply because he wanted someone to apologize to...`
`"......Wasn't the epitaph a trial Grandfather made to choose the successor?"`
`"..............................`
` I thought that too at first, ......but it looks like the situation's a bit different."`
`"At this point in time, I also thought it was a trial.`
` That it was a game for selecting the successor, which Ushiromiya Kinzo decided upon on a whim."`
`"And it wasn't?"`
`"......This epitaph...............had a special meaning for Ushiromiya Kinzo and Ronoue Genji,`
` one that only the two of them could understand.`
` So, this was not the workings of fate.`
` It was a foregone conclusion.`
` ......I was no more than a Cinderella, with the pumpkin carriage and glass slippers all prepared beforehand."`
`".........I get it.`
` ......So, ......this was a farce that Kinzo and Genji set up."`
`"Kinzo {i:knew}.`
` And Genji understood that this was a message to that effect."`
`"I, I don't have a clue what you mean...`
` ......What did Grandfather know?`
` And what does Genji‐san have to do with this epitaph...?"`
`"The epitaph wasn't "solved".`
` It was {i:allowed} to be solved."`
`"............And then, {f:5:Beatrice} truly revived.`
` ......If {f:5:Beatrice}'s revival had never happened..."`
`"......Then, when 1986 came, ......the incident might have been completely different."`
`"Ultimately, ......since the time of my birth, I have never once stood at the crossroads of fate...`
`...and been given the right to make the choice of my own free will."`
`Oh, I am one yet many.`
`And yet, never once have we been able to resist fate.`
`We are naught but leaves trapped in a whirlpool.`
`No matter how we dance, we are bound to vanish into its depths......`
`"Gaap's the one who specializes in instant movement!!`
` She's the 33rd in rank of the Great Demons...!`
` You must really be incredible to have a friend like that, Beato, uu!"`
`"I see, the Great Demon Gaap.`
` .........Very well, my friend, you will now be Gaap.`
` You may call yourself by that name!"`
`"Oh, wonderful.`
` So, you've finally given me a name.`
` It's a relief after being nameless so long."`
`"In that case, I would be honored to receive a name as well.`
` Being nothing more than the head furniture lacks flavor, does it not?"`
`"Maria.`
` I need a name for this guy too.`
` He is also a Great Demon, and serves as my butler.`
` He is a subordinate whom I can trust."`
`"Uu......`
` Ronove, I guess?`
` The 27th ranked of the Great Demons...!`
` It's said he'll give you reliable underlings!"`
`"My, what a coincidence.`
` ......The family name of my double, Genji, is Ronoue."`
`"Hoh, that truly is a coincidence!`
` Yes, there could be no more fitting name for you.`
` Very well, you shall now be known as Ronove...!"`
`"Oh, how pleasant it is to be called by one's name.`
` I thank you for this wonderful name, Lady {f:5:Maria}."`
`"Just as the form can be a vessel, so can the name be a strong vessel.`
` For unknown creatures of the other world, simply gaining a name can greatly increase their magical power...!!`
` That's why names are important.`
` Uu!"`
`"True, names are important and wonderful.`
` Right, Lia?!`
` You can call me Gaap now, okay...?!"`
`"Gaap.`
` A splendid name.`
` ......And I'll ask you to stop shortening my precious name...!"`
`"Pu ku ku ku...!`
` So, you're {f:5:Virgilia}, the one who guides travelers to {f:5:Beatrice}?`
` That is also a splendid name.`
` Perfect for Milady's master."`
`"Yes, I do like it a lot.`
` A name is a life."`
`"Maria, thanks to you, my friends have found names.`
` I am deeply grateful...!"`
`"Uu‐uu!`
` Now it's your turn, Beato!`
` Draw pictures of my bunny friends!`
` Like you did for Sakutaro!"`
`"Hmmm, very well.`
` Lend me that grimoire."`
`"Uryuu!`
` Beato's drawings are really great. I can't wait to see!"`
`"What'll it be like? What'll it be like?`
` Can't wait to see the bunnies!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`"They were in a forest band, were they not?`
` ......A band, a band......`
` ......Hmm.`
` Yes, something like..."`
`All of a sudden, Maria was no longer a little girl who did nothing but follow her mother around, laughing or crying.`
`Though she is still young, she already has a powerful self‐image,`
` ......and possesses enough knowledge of the magical world to surprise even me.`
`Together, we called ourselves Mariage Sorcière and made each other's magical worlds deeper and richer...`
`"So, a name can become a great vessel.`
` ......How very profound."`
`"It's very important to have a form for a vessel, but a name is just as important."`
`"Indeed.`
` Those with names leave a greater impression than those without."`
`"It's not just about forms and names.`
` By knowing more and more about them, you can make them exist much more strongly.`
` So, you have to think up lots of stuff for them."`
`"Did you do this for Sakutarou as well?"`
`"Yep.`
` Sakutaro isn't just a name and a form.`
` There's a lot more to him than that."`
`"He is a lion cub, correct?"`
`"Sakutaro's a vegeta‐lion, so he doesn't eat meat.`
` But everyone else thinks he does, so they're scared of him.`
` But Sakutaro's also a scaredy‐cat, so he's just as scared as the others.`
` Ahahahaha, Sakutaro's such a coward."`
`"Uryuu.`
` I don't eat meat.`
` I'm not a scary lion."`
`"Oh, look, a flesh‐eating sparrow...!!`
` Flap flap flap!"`
`"Uryuu!!`
` Sparrows are scary!`
` Whoosh."`
`"Wahaha, sparrows don't eat meat."`
`"Sakutaro's a coward, so he thinks they do.`
` Kihihihihi."`
`"D‐did the sparrow go away...?`
` Uryuu..."`
`"You're such a scaredy‐cat, Sakutaro.`
` If you keep this up, Sakusuke and Sakukichi will start making fun of you again."`
`"Uryu...!`
` I'm not a scaredy‐cat!"`
`"Ah, the sparrow's back!`
` Flap flap flap!"`
`"Nooo, I'll be eaten!!`
` Whoosh."`
`"Hahahaha.`
` Sakutaro is quite entertaining.`
` Then, are Sakusuke and Sakukichi his siblings?"`
`"Yep.`
` They're his little brothers, waiting for him at home!`
` Sakusuke's a lot more reliable than Sakutaro, and Sakukichi is so skillful, he can do anything.`
` But they're all really good friends...!`
` They all play together on my bed."`
`"Your bed must be covered with lions."`
`"Yep.`
` So I call my bed Lion Land!`
` But there's lots of other animals too!`
` Uu!"`
`"Lion Land, is it?`
` It sounds like fun."`
`"......By interacting together, all of {f:5:Maria}'s friends can reinforce their own existence.`
` She has a great world."`
`"Then we should work on deepening our relationships as well.`
` By strengthening our bonds, our existence and magical power will grow stronger and stronger..."`
`"Let's expand our world more and more!`
` From what I've heard, Maria's world has far more than just Sakutarou and the bunnies!`
` We have to keep up!"`
`"My, my.`
` In that case, shall we find more minions for ourselves?"`
`"It's no fun with just the gold butterflies.`
` After all, they cannot speak...!`
` I'd like some chatty minions who can talk, jump around, and fight with each other."`
`"True, of course it'll be better to spice things up around here."`
`"Here in Mariage Sorcière, we have learned how to expand our worlds and create new minions.`
` At this point, the kinds of minions you may create are limited only by your imagination......"`
`"Milady, what about those?`
` Could you make vessels of those dark tools you found when cleaning out {f:5:Goldsmith}'s storehouse?"`
`"Oh, perfect!`
` Minions manifested from dark‐looking vessels like that will surely be fitting for me...!`
` There will be more and more of us, and it will get very lively here...!"`
`"Uu!`
` We get more and more new friends...!`
` That's my magic!`
` And Beato can take my friends and give them a form.`
` You can make them grow...!"`
`"You create, and I grow.`
` ......Hmm.`
` That's Mariage Sorcière for you!`
` ......Hmmm, still, bunny ears are pretty hard...!`
` It might take some time before the bunnies manifest themselves."`
`"Make sure you make them cute."`
`"But of course.`
` This is where I get to show my skill...!"`
`Create a creature, give it a name, give it a form.`
`Doing that is no different from giving birth to new life.`
`When a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} gives birth to a child, they give it a form, give it a name to identify it by, and deepen its character by raising it in the world.`
`Mariage Sorcière is doing exactly the same thing.`
`In our world, we can create whatever creatures we think of, give them forms, give them names, and make them friends we can interact with.`
`We were engrossed with our game in this world called Mariage Sorcière.`
`At least, Maria was engrossed.`
`{n}She would badger me to play this game every time she came.`
`And, of course, I was too.`
`However, when Maria started happily drawing something and I just sat there for a while,`
` ......I must admit that there were times when I sighed and looked up at the sky, making sure she did not notice......`
`......It's fun to increase the numbers of our minions.`
`{n}They make things lively, so I do not tire of it.`
`I may have tired of my minions alone, but when I can interact with Maria's minions as well, that does not happen.`
`It takes two people to create a universe.`
` I now have that second person, so I am satisfied.`
`..............................`
`......I think...I am satisfied.`
`And yet, one little part of me......is not.`
`It truly is a tiny part.`
`After all, it is so much fun playing with Maria that time seems to fly on by.`
`But even so, ......when I look up at the sky,`
` ......during those short moments, I feel an empty feeling I cannot describe...`
`I know...`
`My universe is not complete.`
`My apologies to Maria,`
` ......but she is not the second person I seek to create a universe with.`
`......No matter how much I nurture my world with her, ......the roots of love in my heart leave gaps.`
`............Four years have already passed since that day.`
`He left saying he would come for me riding a white horse, ......and I was the only one without a letter.`
`And he even said that he would likely never return to Rokkenjima......`
`"...................................."`
`{i:This}.........is love?`
` ......I always believed that love was so much sweeter, so much more intoxicating.`
`But now, I don't know anymore.`
`Though I long for him so much it's maddening, ......I can sometimes feel hatred underneath.`
`However, even that hatred is wrapped in adoration.`
`The roots of love have remained in the corners of my heart all this time.`
`Some part of me......has given up and accepted that Battler might never return.`
`However, the roots of love have stayed right where they were.`
`......In other words, ......even four years later, I still believe.`
`He will come back someday.`
`The flower of my love has curled up as if to resist the winter cold, and it even appears to have withered.`
`However, the roots are still alive.`
`......And so it endures, waiting for the day he will surely return,`
` waiting for a chance to bloom beautifully again.`
`I am grateful to Maria.`
`Mariage Sorcière has eased the burden on my heart so much.`
`If we had not met like this, ......I may have withered away along with those roots.`
`......Even this incomplete universe is now necessary for my survival.`
`I must live on...until I can create my complete universe.`
`Until that day......I will not be complete.`
` Though I have a form and a name, ......no matter how deep my world grows, ......I will not be complete.`
`".........I am not......complete."`
`"..................Beato...?"`
`I accidentally muttered what I had been thinking.`
` Maria stopped talking to Sakutaro.`
`I regretted that my slip of the tongue had ruined this fun time,`
` but I had already remained silent for a little too long to smooth it over...`
`I laughed, but it probably sounded hollow.`
`Maria, not knowing why my face had suddenly changed like this, looked taken aback.`
`"......Though my minions will each deepen this world and their own existences, becoming full,`
` ......I alone will never be complete."`
`"...................................."`
`"......I know why I will not be complete."`
`"It's because you don't have enough magical power."`
`Maria answered instantly.`
`{f:5:Beatrice} has lost her magical power and is unable to regain the power she once had.`
`That is how the story goes.`
` So, Maria's answer is exactly correct.`
`............Yes.`
`I may be incomplete because I have lost my magical power.`
`In that case, if my power becomes complete, ......and I revive in the truest sense,`
` ......will my world become complete as well?`
`Does that mean.........that the person I want to nourish a universe with will come back?`
`......If, as I claim,`
` I really was once able to control miracles at will with my magic...`
`...then if I succeeded in reviving, that miracle would surely occur.`
`If that is what I could be capable of, .........then I want true magical power...to use for my resurrection.`
`"......That's right.`
` It is because I do not possess enough magical power."`
`"Poor Beato.`
` ......It must be pretty inconvenient with your magical power still weak."`
`"I want to get it back......quickly.`
` ......My old power."`
`"I guess you'll have to do that thing."`
`"......What thing is that...?"`
`"The ritual of resurrection.`
` .........The ritual of the portrait's epitaph."`
`"............................................."`
`If you read that epitaph literally, it does sound like a witch's resurrection ritual.`
`To Maria, who believes in witches, that epitaph must be nothing more or less than a ritual.`
`Unlike the other family members, it seems that she's not very interested in how it might indicate the location of the hidden gold.`
`"......If that epitaph's riddle is solved, one might learn the location where Kinzo hid all the gold I once gave him."`
`"That's the gold you created with magic, right?"`
`"Indeed.`
` A crystallization of the great magic I possessed in those days."`
`"In that case, ......if you get that gold back, your magical power will go back to normal."`
`".........Perhaps...you are right."`
`"It will. Uu!`
` It's got to be your resurrection ritual...!`
` I'll help, so let's solve it together.`
` And then you'll revive!`
` And when you do, you'll take me to your Golden Land...!"`
`"That's right.`
` I did promise that I would take you to the Golden Land."`
`"You said that all wishes are granted there...!`
` There's no black witch there, just Mama who's nice...!`
` And I might even meet Papa who I've never seen before...!"`
`"Of course, there won't be any school, or homework, or bullying friends, and we can live happily ever after...!`
` Hey, Sakutaro, doesn't that sound fun?!`
` Uryuu!"`
`............The portrait's epitaph.`
`Then, must I face the epitaph's riddle?`
`If Kinzo's children struggled uselessly over it,`
` ......how could a complete stranger like me solve it...?`
`......If I did happen to solve it, ......that would surely be a miracle.`
`Will one miracle bring about another and return my miraculous power to me......?`
`Behold the sweetfish river running through my beloved home of old.`
`{n}You who seek the Golden Land, follow its path downstream in search of the key......`
`"............So, am I to travel down a river in Kinzo's homeland in search of a key?"`
`As you travel down it, you will see a village.`
`{n}In that village, look for the shore the two speak of.`
`There the key to the Golden Land sleeps......`
`"......There may be villages down that river,`
` but what is this shore the two speak of?"`
`You who laid hand upon the key must journey as follows to the Golden Land......`
`.........So, those who do not have the key need not read the rest.`
`I do not understand it, but that's how this riddle is.`
`......It's practically unsolvable, so solving it would be a miracle.`
` That much makes sense......`
`"............nn."`
`I felt a stabbing pain in my body.`
` The anti‐magic toxin had burned my skin.`
`Some {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} is probably approaching.`
` I erased my form.`
`Multiple sets of footsteps approached.`
`It was Genji, Shannon, ......and Kanon too.`
`".........It seems everyone is engrossed with solving the epitaph's riddle."`
`"Yes.`
` I hear that even some of the servants have written it down and taken it home with them."`
`"......If you solve this riddle, will you really find ten tons of gold?"`
`"Yes.`
` There can be no doubt of that."`
`"I don't understand.`
` ......Why is the Master displaying the location of his precious gold,`
` even in the form of a cryptic epitaph, in a place where everyone can see?"`
`"......That is the Master's magic, and also a bet.`
` The Master believes that the soul of {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama will dwell within the one who solves this inscrutable riddle."`
`"............That's a strange bet—I mean, magic..."`
`"Hmph, looks like he's taken his occult fanaticism as far as it could possibly go."`
`"Shh.`
` You shouldn't say that......"`
`"......All have the right to challenge the epitaph's riddle.`
` Of course, the servants are no exceptions.`
` ......Are you making an attempt?"`
`"N‐no......`
` ......I could never solve such a hard riddle...`
` And......"`
`"......And?"`
`"Even if I had ten tons of gold, I can't think of anything in particular I'd want to use it for......`
` I'd be more than happy if these peaceful days continued forever."`
`"Looks like you and George‐sama have been pretty close these days.`
` I just hope being distracted doesn't make you even more of a klutz."`
`"Th‐that won't happen."`
`With a backward glance at this conversation, Genji walked up to the portrait...`
`...and looked up at the witch.`
`"......................................."`
`When they saw what Genji was doing, Shannon and Kanon immediately went silent.`
`......Genji, who was the head of the servants, ......the closest in age to Kinzo, and the one whom Kinzo called a friend,`
` probably understood Kinzo's heart better than anyone else.`
`What did he think when he looked at this portrait.........?`
`Neither Shannon nor Kanon could tell.`
`"............Behold the sweetfish river, running through my beloved home of old."`
`Suddenly, Genji started reciting the epitaph.`
`Shannon quickly nodded to show that she was listening, but it wasn't clear whether he was talking to her at all.`
`Genji, his back still to them, continued.`
`"The Master would not describe Odawara as his beloved home of old."`
`"......I've heard that he lived far away."`
`"Th‐though I don't know where it was......"`
`"Taiwan."`
`Genji turned around and spoke that single word.`
`"......O‐`
`......oh,`
` is that so...?"`
`"I see, so that explains what Krauss‐sama always used to say.`
` Remember him talking about how the Master liked areca nuts?"`
`"......Come to think of it,`
` Krauss‐sama said that those were a luxury item, like tobacco, that was popular in Taiwan...`
` So that's why the Master......"`
`Many Japanese moved to this land in the half‐century before the war.`
`Kinzo's family was a branch family of the Ushiromiyas.`
`Apparently, they were only distantly related to the head family, so they were able to emigrate to this new world with dreams of a new future,`
` without being constrained by the head family in Odawara...`
`Shannon and Kanon nodded their understanding, but they didn't know why Genji had suddenly broached this subject.`
`"......So, ......there was a river with sweetfish in it in the Master's homeland of Taiwan, and the key is there?"`
`"Don't be so stupid.`
` There must be countless rivers with sweetfish there."`
`"W‐we don't know that for sure, right...?`
` I don't know where the Master lived in Taiwan, ......but there might have been only one river there.`
` If so, that must be the place."`
`"You're too optimistic.`
` There's no way the riddle could be solved that easily."`
`"......The Master says his magical ritual will gain more power if more people try to solve the riddle.`
` You must try as well, Shannon.`
` Everyone has been given equal opportunity."`
`".........Y‐...yes."`
`"It's not like we have any chance.`
` So stupid......"`
`Genji spun around.`
` Shannon and Kanon hurried to follow after him.`
`When his footsteps receded and silence returned, a gold butterfly flitted out from among the shadows.`
`".........Taiwan, is it?`
` ......Hoh, so he lived quite far away."`
`Behold the sweetfish river, running through my beloved home of old.`
`{n}In other words, a sweetfish river running through my beloved Taiwan......?`
`"......There are countless rivers in Taiwan.`
` Kanon was right.`
` How ridiculous."`
`.................................`
`However, the word "Taiwan" interests me.`
`How could it not mean something when Genji, a man of few words, had muttered it unprompted?`
`Clearly, Genji must have said it in connection with the epitaph's riddle.`
`{n}Almost as though it were a hint for solving it......`
`"............Though I do find it ridiculous,`
` ......very well, Genji.`
` Why don't I play along with your farce for a while?"`
`Taiwan......`
` I have traveled the world these past thousand years, but I know nothing of the place.`
`"......To counter my ignorance, I shall need a crystallization of knowledge.`
` That which is smoothed out and pressed into many sheets, what is called a book."`
`Where might I find a book about Taiwan?`
`Kinzo's study is the first place that comes to mind if one is looking for books.`
`{n}But that won't work.`
` The charm on that room prevents me from entering.`
`In that case, the book archive......`
`Kinzo's vast library grows each year.`
`It can no longer be completely contained within his study, and so a portion of it is stored in a place called the book archive.`
`......Of course, there are countless books just in this place.`
`The archive has everything from valuable books to apparently worthless books, all packed together like an antique shop.`
`.........There was a golden glint in the keyhole of the archive's door, and a gold butterfly flitted out.`
`"The stench of this room is as overpowering as ever.`
` ...Dust, mold.`
` Yes, the stench of knowledge."`
`......Well now, how can I find a book on Taiwan amongst all this?`
` The prospect is almost dizzying.`
`However, I realized right away.`
`If I wanted to quickly find out about Taiwanese rivers, I didn't want a book on Taiwan.`
`".........An atlas.`
` .........There must be one of those somewhere around here.`
` ......Search, my butterfly minions...!!`
` Find the book I seek in this dusty, noble graveyard of knowledge!"`
`A cloud of countless gold butterflies appeared at my feet.`
`They rose in a swell, blew like the wind, and swirled around the archive.`
`Eventually, the cloud of butterflies selected a single book.`
` Apparently, this was the one.`
`"Well done.`
` .........Hmm, a world atlas, Asia volume.`
` Perfect."`
`It was a grand, thick, illustrated encyclopedia of maps, several volumes long.`
`There was a thick section devoted to Taiwan.`
` It seemed sufficiently useful as a reference.`
`".........Taiwan.`
` ......{nobr:394 km} north to south, {nobr:144 km} east to west.`
` An area of roughly 36,000 square kilometers.`
` ......Hohoh, that's pretty large."`
`By area, that's about the same size as Kyushu in Japan.`
`{n}......This led Beato to a very natural question.`
`"Just where on this massive island did Kinzo live?`
` ......Genji mentioned Taiwan, but that's all.`
` What a careless oversight......"`
`Beato had imagined, without much thought, that the riddle would be solved in a flash if only she could look at a map of Taiwan.`
`However, Taiwan is no small place.`
` Just which part of this large island did Kinzo call his beloved home of old?`
`......Looking through books in this dusty archive, sometimes having to cough, while this simple problem obstructed my progress...`
`was by no means enjoyable.`
`"So, the largest city is Taipei.`
` ......It says here that Japanese people used to live in a spot called Taishou.`
` ......So, is that where Kinzo lived?`
` No, it's too early to be sure of that without proof."`
`I'll skip to the next part before I settle on anything more specific than just Taiwan itself.`
`A sweetfish river running through the home of old.`
`{n}What's this......?`
` There are 129 rivers in Taiwan?`
`"Gah......`
` 129 rivers...!`
` And who knows how many of those have sweetfish swimming in them...?!`
` Just thinking about it is dizzying!"`
`This was quickly becoming ridiculous.`
`Genji must have been muttering nonsense to himself after all.`
`I only thought he was giving a hint about the epitaph...`
`"So, the reward for the fool blinded by gold is dust.`
` *cackle*cackle*, nice one, Genji."`
`I tossed the book aside, used magic to turn a bookshelf into a sofa, and plopped down on top of it.`
`For a while, I gazed up at the ceiling as I grumbled about getting tricked.`
`Then, I cast my eyes down at the floor, thinking that I would feel a lot better if I gathered all this room's dust, packed it into a ball, and tossed it into Genji's teacup. `
`A book I had thrown away lay open on the ground.`
`A gold butterfly alighted on that open page.`
`.........Tossing a book at random and reading an oracle from the page it happens to open to is one kind of charm.`
`I see, ......so that page might have some sort of hint.`
`Not entirely convinced, I picked the book up......`
`The opened page was probably very near the one I had been reading.`
`{n}It seemed to be a page explaining Taiwan's geography.`
`Oddly enough, it was a page about rivers and lakes......`
`".........I already know that there are 129 rivers.`
` Is there something else you're trying to tell me?"`
`There were six major rivers listed.`
`{n}Zhuoshui River.`
` Gaoping River.`
` Tamsui River.`
` Dajia River.`
` Zengwun River.`
` Dadu River.`
`"Hoh.`
` Now then, could any of these rivers have had sweetfish in them...or not?"`
`Then, I had a shocking realization.`
`Sweetfish are freshwater fish.`
` And you don't find ocean water in rivers.`
`......Unless it's extremely dirty or blocked by a dam,`
` any river might have sweetfish in it.`
`"How foolish.`
` All rivers have fresh water in them.`
` What's stopping sweetfish from living in any river?`
` ............Come to think of it, what a foolish name this Tamsui River has.`
` Freshwater River? What sort of river isn't a freshwater river?`
` Why not at least wait for something besides fresh water to flow down it and name it after that instead?"`
`Tamsui River flows from Taipei to the harbor town of Tamsui.`
`I see—it isn't called that because of the water in it, but because of the town at its mouth.`
`............As you travel down it, you will see a village.`
`{n}In that village, look for the shore the two speak of.`
`"...................................."`
`I realize that this is stupid.`
` And yet, something about this town seems off.`
`Behold the sweetfish river, running through my beloved home of old.`
`That line should be talking about one of the 129 rivers.`
`......Sweetfish...are freshwater fish.`
` And here's this "Freshwater River", flowing down to a town called "Freshwater".`
`I do think I'm stretching it.`
`{n}......Or...is it some kind of hint...?`
`......I've come all the way to this archive and even gotten myself covered in dust in my search for books.`
`If I give up now, it will all have been a waste of time.`
`............Very well.`
`Why don't I test my luck,`
` ......and see if the random page the book opened to contains a message from above?`
`I turned to the next page, trying to search in even greater detail......`
`"We treated this riddle as a sort of game.`
` And all of the servants were engrossed in it."`
`"I was just trying to be one of that group.`
` ......I had long since run out of books that I could become enthusiastic about, so, out of boredom, I took that book back with me to my own room and looked through it every night."`
`"......There's a hint for the epitaph's riddle in an atlas?"`
`"In the third game, Eva solved the riddle after reading a book in the book archive.`
` Then, in the fifth game, Furudo Erika looked for an atlas in the book archive before solving the riddle herself."`
`"Then there really is some secret in a map of Taiwan......"`
`"......I believed that the sweetfish river part was code for Tamsui River.`
` Every day, I researched the surrounding geography in detail.`
` ......Of course, I also looked up several small streams that might have sweetfish in them.`
` However, ......that didn't get me anywhere."`
`"According to some information from a previous game, ......we aren't looking for an actual river.`
` But it was something that flowed.`
` That's how Eva interpreted it."`
`"Not a river...?"`
`"Yes.`
` In the end, Tamsui River had nothing to do with it.`
` ......However, thinking about it now, it must have been a message from above after all.`
` Tamsui River itself was unrelated, ......but it was still an incredible hint."`
`"The river was unrelated, ......but it was still a hint?"`
`"Slow down and think.`
` Think of something that flows but isn't a river."`
`".........So, something other than water that flows...?"`
`"What comes to mind?`
` ......Try to think out of the box."`
`".............................."`
`"......Will,`
` I'm tired of all this puzzle‐solving.`
` ......Stop being annoying and come out with it.`
` ......You've solved it, haven't you? The epitaph."`
`".....................`
` ......Probably."`
`"......What things flow other than water......`
` ......What things...`
` ......Things......?`
` ......Things...being transported......?`
` Like on a road or a highway?"`
`"Correct.`
` It took me so long to realize that the sweetfish river did not refer to water itself......"`
`"That's right.`
` There's something other than a river with the name Tamsui.`
` Something that carries both people and things, and which flows both up and down."`
`"......Both up and down......?`
` You mean......"`
`"Yes.`
` A railway."`
`The Tamsui Line.`
` It's a railway that goes from Taipei to Tamsui Harbor.`
`It was opened in 1901.`
`{n}Afterwards, the number of stations continued to grow, and it became a major artery into Taipei.`
`This railroad was used after the war as well and is still in common use as the Taipei Metro Tamsui Line.`
`Its route begins at Taipei Station and continues on until the town of Tamsui......`
`{ruby:Taipei:{p:0:台北}} Station.`
`{n}{ruby:Chang‐an:{p:0:長安}} Station (old name: {ruby:Taishougai:{p:0:大正街}} Station).`
`{n}{ruby:Shuanglian:{p:0:双連}} Station.`
`{n}Tatung Company Station.`
`{n}{ruby:Yuanshan:{p:0:円山}} Station.`
`{n}{ruby:Jiantan:{p:0:剣潭}} Station (old name: {ruby:Miyanoshita:{p:0:宮ノ下}} Station).`
`{n}{ruby:Shilin:{p:0:士林}} Station.`
`{n}{ruby:Shipai:{p:0:石碑}} Station (old name—`
`".........What did the epitaph say you'd see if you went down the river?"`
`"A, a village."`
`"There's only one station on the Tamsui Line with {p:0:里}, the character for village, in its name, and that's the old name of this {ruby:Shipai:{p:0:石碑}} Station."`
`"H‐how do you read this......?"`
`"The Japanese reading is "Kirigan".`
` Its name was changed to Shipai Station after the war, but when Kinzo lived there, it was Kirigan Station."`
`"As you travel down it, you will see a {ruby:village:{p:0:里}}....`
` In that village, look for the shore the two speak of......"`
`"......*giggle*.`
` It's not just {ruby:village:{p:0:里}}. You can also see a {ruby:shore:{p:0:岸}} in the name of that station......"`
`"I spent no short amount of time trying to decide whether the epitaph truly was referring to this station.`
` ......It has the character for village and the character for shore.`
` It felt like a kids' puzzle, playing with letters..."`
`"The first character in Kirigan has a {p:0:口}, the character for mouth.`
` The other half of that first character, {p:0:其}, means "that", right...?!`
` And the mouth could be what "the two {i:speak} of" is referring to...!`
` ......Ah, ...but I don't get what "the two" means..."`
`The three characters of Kirigan can be split into {nobr:a mouth ({p:0:口})}, {nobr:a "that" ({p:0:其})}, {nobr:a village ({p:0:里})}, and {nobr:a shore ({p:0:岸})}.`
`Those all feature in the epitaph.`
`In {nobr:"that" ({p:0:其})} {nobr:"village" ({p:0:里})}, look for the {nobr:"shore" ({p:0:岸})} the two {nobr:"speak" ({p:0:口})} of.`
`You can read it as a code for the name of the station.`
`{n}However, I don't understand the part about "the two"......`
`"......I was also stuck on that part.`
` However, by then, I had a strong belief that this station was what the epitaph referred to."`
`"If the station had an old name, ......then could the place it refers to also have an old name?"`
`"That's right.`
` From the start, Kirigan Station was named after a place.`
` And the name of that place, which was also Kirigan, is written differently—like this."`
`"Ah, ......there are...two mouths...!"`
`"It was clear as soon as I looked it up.`
` ......The epitaph had to be referring to this place called Kirigan."`
`"Then is this where the key to the Golden Land sleeps...?"`
`"That would be the obvious answer.`
` However, I couldn't have made the long trip to Taiwan to check.`
` And, of course, the place known as Kirigan is quite large itself.`
` If a tiny key was hidden somewhere there, I'd never find it.`
` I was at a loss......"`
`"But you didn't give up."`
`"I was certain that I had found the answer, at least to the first five lines of the epitaph.`
` .........To me, this was a game—no, a mystery—more intriguing than any other."`
`I almost gave up at that point.`
`However, I was certain I had the key in my hand.`
`{n}So, I decided to follow the epitaph's instructions and journey to the Golden Land.`
`"......On the first twilight, sacrifice the six chosen by the key..."`
`"We can tell by this line that the key refers to six things.`
` ......From that fact alone, we can deduce that this doesn't refer to a physical key."`
`"Six things......?"`
`"Yes.`
` Six things.`
` ......I wasn't a very flexible thinker, so...`
`......I decided to look through books for anything related to the number six.`
` Six.`
` Six, six, six."`
`"The location of the key called Kirigan was hidden by a word game.`
` So I was convinced that the six things would be related to some sort of word game as well.`
` Six.`
` Six, six, six.`
` ......I kept searching for six."`
`"............Is there some way to split the characters of Kirigan into six parts......?"`
`"A good idea.`
` But no matter how much you stare at those three characters, you won't get an answer.`
` The problem here is that "Kirigan" is just the Japanese reading of the name."`
`"Then how did they pronounce it there?"`
`"......It's pronounced "Qilian".`
` The English spelling is six letters long."`
`"Six letters...!`
` Then it is a word game after all...!"`
`"Yes. On the first twilight, sacrifice the six {i:letters} chosen by the key."`
`"......I, .........I get it............"`
`When explained like this, it sounds like the logic can be taken from beginning to end in no time at all.`
`......However, it took a long, long time for me to reach this spot on my own.`
`A dizzying number of nights passed from the time Genji uttered that single word to the time I got this far.`
`"So, what does it mean to sacrifice these six letters?"`
`"On the second twilight, we start hearing about "those who remain".`
` ......We can deduce that the epitaph is telling us to remove the six letters of the key from some longer word or phrase, and then do something with the letters that remain."`
`"However, what could the six letters be removed from?`
` I spent a long time on that as well.`
` It was like the start of an entirely new riddle.`
` And this time, I had to solve it all by myself, without any assistance."`
`"......I think there was a previous game where someone—I think it was Aunt Rosa—`
`formed some sort of theory about the first twilight."`
`"That theory focused on the tenth twilight's "Home of the Gold".`
` The epitaph uses the phrase "Golden Land" four separate times, but the phrase "Home of the Gold" is only used that once."`
`"Why is it written that way only on the tenth twilight?`
` It took me a long time to notice the significance of this, and just as long to discover the reason."`
`"Rosa's theory went like this.`
` She read the "Home" ({p:0:郷}) kanji as "kyou" and interpreted it as {ruby:kyou:{p:0:京}}, which she took as short for "Kyoto" ({ruby:kyouto:{p:0:京都}}).`
` Then, she reasoned that if you take a ten‐day trip from the beloved hometown to Kyoto, there might be some secret at the end of the first tenth of that journey.`
` .........It was a good theory, but she just missed the mark.`
` {p:0:京} has another meaning besides Kyoto."`
`"......{p:0:京} can mean something other than Kyoto......?`
` Hmmm......"`
`"Don't think too hard on it.`
` You either know it or you don't."`
`"......There's another meaning of {p:0:京}.`
` One where it's not read "kyou", but "kei".`
` It's the name of a number.`
` {nobr:10,000 is {ruby:man:{p:0:万}}}, {nobr:10,000 {ruby:man:{p:0:万}} is {ruby:oku:{p:0:億}}}, {nobr:10,000 {ruby:oku:{p:0:億}} is {ruby:chou:{p:0:兆}}}, and {nobr:10,000 {ruby:chou:{p:0:兆}} is {ruby:kei:{p:0:京}}}."`
`"So it's a number......!"`
`"......Here, I had a home‐field advantage, since I lived on Rokkenjima.`
` There was a hint there that made it easier to think of the number "kei".`
` In fact, you might say that I actually found the answer before I knew what the question was."`
`"If you keep making it so complicated, Lion's gonna get a headache.`
` Let's get back to the point.`
` ......If you reach one kei on the tenth twilight, how far have you gotten by the first twilight?"`
`"O‐one tenth of one kei, and one kei is ten thousand chou...`
` ......So.........a thousand chou?"`
`"Exactly.`
` We remove the key's chosen six letters from a thousand chou."`
`"Since Qilian was written in English, I immediately guessed that "a thousand chou" would also have to be written in English."`
`"A thousand chou in English is "quadrillion".`
` ......As Battler guessed in the fifth game, it has 11 letters.`
` Or should I say as you guessed?"`
`"............*giggle*."`
`"Curiously enough, the first letter is "Q".`
` The first letter of the six‐letter key is also "Q".`
` I felt that this just had to be right."`
`Lion took a notepad from a pocket and spelled out Quadrillion and Qilian.`
`The two words even looked similar at a glance.`
`"..................`
` ......You're right.`
` ......The six letters chosen by the key are right there inside quadrillion...!`
` So, what happens if we take them out......?!"`
`We're left with five meaningless letters.`
`{n}However, the important thing is the number five.`
`After all, in the next part of the epitaph, the word "kill" appears five times,`
` and then, on the ninth twilight, "none shall be left alive".`
`In other words, there should be five letters left.`
`"On top of that, just as Battler‐san guessed in the fifth game,`
` two of these letters are close to each other.`
` The "d" and the "r"!`
` Those must be the two who are close!"`
`"......Once you reach this spot, the riddle has been practically solved."`
`"Or, put another way, this is as far as you can go with the epitaph alone.`
` You might be able to figure out the answer with a little more word play, but you won't be able to activate the mechanism."`
`"That's right.`
` ......Once you know this much, all that remains is to gouge and kill."`
`"You had a good idea of where the place was, even before you got this far, right?"`
`"Yes.`
` .........I suspected that the gold was hidden there even before the epitaph appeared.`
` It was only natural to suspect that the place concealed some secret, because of the mysterious phrase that appears there......"`
`"......What do you mean by "the place"......?"`
`"The place with the mechanism that opens the door to the Golden Land.`
` ......By now, a quick‐witted person should be able to figure out where to find "the first twilight" where you sacrifice the six chosen by the key."`
`"Huh?`
` I thought the first twilight was "quadrillion", not a place......"`
`"It's the place where "quadrillion" is written.`
` ......You should know it.`
` Or did you blindly follow Kinzo's orders and never go near it...?"``Quadrillion.`
`There's only one place you'll find that word on Rokkenjima.`
`Gold butterflies flitted from shadow to shadow, dodging raindrops.`
`"......Unless my memory is mistaken, this is probably the place."`
`It was......the chapel.`
`{n}That mysterious building, one of the oldest on Rokkenjima, which had been built at the same time as the mansion.`
`It was called the chapel, but not once had Kinzo used it for worship, and the members of the family had never been allowed inside.`
`There were strict orders that none approach it without reason, and its purpose was always a mystery.`
`However, any mystery will lose its luster after several decades.`
`At some point, everyone forgot the chapel even existed,`
` and that splendid building passed from the thoughts of Rokkenjima's residents......`
`Of course, this had been true for Beato as well.`
`Beato, who hated boredom, had no desire to approach places that humans never went.`
`Her last memory of the place was of the time she went in there to taunt Shannon as she tried to clean.`
`"......There can be no doubt.`
` That is it.`
` ......Quadrillion."`
`Beato looked up......above the door of the chapel.`
`{n}There was a relief displayed over an arch.`
`English words were written there.`
`"‘You will be blessed only at a probability of a Quadrillion to one’.`
` .........Heheh.`
` So, you thought that was the probability of someone solving this riddle...?"`
`This chapel was built long ago.`
`If there is a mechanism like the one I imagine,`
` ......Kinzo must have prepared that epitaph riddle many decades ago.`
`He must have been planning to use it as a ritual for choosing a fitting successor all this time.`
`......However, that ritual is now a ritual to open the door to the Golden Land and to my resurrection.`
`When I snapped my fingers,`
` the ground bulged, and several dead trees sprouted out of it, curving and twisting like snakes.`
`They twisted around each other to form a ladder, which leaned itself against the door.`
`"If my guess is right, ......there's some sort of mechanism in that relief."`
`I slowly climbed the ladder.`
`Because of the size of the door, the relief was very high up.`
`This close up, it looks much bigger than it did from the ground.`
`"............Come to think of it, whenever we cleaned the chapel,`
` ......this relief was the only thing that Genji always made sure he polished himself.`
` ......I always wondered why he didn't leave something so trivial to the younger servants."`
`I thought it strange, but nothing more.`
`The Master treasured this relief, so the head servant cared for it himself.`
` ......I always accepted that excuse.`
`But now, I understand.`
`{n}There must be a trick to this relief.`
`And Genji polished it himself to make sure that no one else accidentally found out......`
`"So, from this Quadrillion, I am to sacrifice the six letters chosen by the key......?"`
`I prodded and played with the letter "Q".`
`My fingertips were soon covered with dust.`
` However, I quickly realized that something felt strange about it.`
`"......Don't tell me this letter...`
` ......No, ......it had to be like this.`
` There would be no other way to offer up sacrifices......"`
`Beato grabbed hold of the letter "Q", and after experimenting with different levels of force,`
` ......the letter came out with a scraping sound.`
`"Just......as I thought........."`
`Here's the "Q" I pulled out.`
` And there's a wedge—no.`
` It's a key.`
`A key was attached to the back of the "Q", and that had been stuck into a keyhole in the relief.`
`"......I see......`
` In that case, I know what to do next.`
` ......Very good, this "Q" key is a wrong answer.`
` Away with you."`
`Beato carelessly tossed the "Q" key aside.`
`This was the first sacrifice.`
`She kept on pulling out the keys for the six letters representing "the key".`
`"......So, "a" will also be sacrificed.`
` ......And both "i"s.`
` ......And then the "n" at the end."`
`"Now, I only sacrifice one "l", ......but unfortunately, there are two "l"s here."`
`There were two "l"s.`
` I didn't know which I should sacrifice.`
`I tried pulling both out, but the keys were of different shapes.`
`So, one is a right answer, and one is a wrong answer.`
`"Well, there are only two.`
` ......If I make a mistake, I can just try the other one."`
`Unless messing up sets off a trap that blows up the island, of course.`
`Thinking it a waste of time to sit here worrying, I decided on the "l" on the right and pulled it out.`
`Five letters remained in the word.`
`"And now, the first twilight is over.`
` ......On to the second twilight."`
`On the second twilight, those who remain shall tear apart the two who are close.`
`"The "d" and "r" are close.`
` What does it mean to tear them apart...?`
` Do I pull them out?"`
`But if I do, there will only be three letters left.`
`By this point, I was able to make a good guess at what the "gouge and kill" lines from the fourth twilight onwards meant.`
`"Gouge and kill probably means to turn the keys and take them out.`
` In that case, the parts about going from head to leg must mean starting at the left and going right."`
`If that's the case, five letters have to remain on the board.`
`{n}In other words, "tear apart" doesn't mean kill.`
`"If so, then we can read "tear apart" to mean putting a gap between the "d" and the "r".`
` ......But how?`
` Once again, there are two ways to do it..."`
`Do I remove the "d" and move it to the left?`
`{n}Do I remove the "r" and move it to the right?`
`......After pondering this for some time, I realized that both choices were wrong.`
`"No.`
` That's not right.`
` I've had it wrong since I removed that "l"."`
`A short while ago, I removed the right of the two "l"s.`
`{n}However, if I had removed the left one...`
`......It would look like this.`
`If you line it up this way, it's easy to see the next step.`
`{n}The "r" gets shifted to the right.`
`This way, all of the letters are spread out evenly.`
`{n}This must be it.`
`"And this next part......is another tough one.`
` ......Praise my name...?"`
`It's already clear that this is a word game.`
`Those who remain shall praise my noble name.`
`I am supposed to do something with the remaining five letters.`
` Most likely, rearrange them.`
`"......‘u’, "d", "r", "l", "o"...`
` ......Can I do something with these five letters to give them some sort of meaning?"`
`Praise...my name.`
`"Gh.`
` ......How can I get stuck after coming so far......?`
` How are these five letters supposed to praise a name...?!"`
`That man's name is Ushiromiya Kinzo.`
`{n}Is the "u" part of Ushiromiya......?`
`No, several letters don't match, and there aren't nearly enough letters to make Ushiromiya...`
`"One thing that is certain... "My name" must refer to Kinzo.`
` ......Then, does the "u" stand for Ushiromiya after all?`
` Like an initial.`
` ......Then what do the "d", "r", "l", and "o" stand for?`
` They can't mean Kinzo.`
` Do the "r" and "o"......stand for Rokkenjima...?`
` The master of Rokkenjima, Kinzo......`
` ......Hmm, not nearly enough letters......"`
`This riddle left me totally confused.`
`{n}However, there were only five letters left.`
`There can't be so many possible combinations of those letters.`
` I could use process of elimination.`
`Thinking I'd play around with it, I pulled out the "u".`
`......There were four letters left.`
` "d", "r", "l", and "o".`
`"...................................."`
`My idea that the "u" stood for Ushiromiya was like a heavenly oracle.`
`When I removed the "u", I thought of making a word with the remaining four letters.`
`"d", "r", "l", and "o".`
`Those four letters spun around in my head, changing their orders,`
` ......and led me to a single English word that would serve to "praise" Kinzo...`
`"It's lord.`
` ......Lord...!"`
`I had absolutely no basis for it.`
` ......However, it was like a flash of inspiration.`
`I quickly changed the letters around before that flash faded from my mind.`
`"‘l’, "o", "r", "d"!`
` Lord!`
` "u"!`
` Ushiromiya!`
` ......Lord Ushiromiya! How do you like that?!"`
`"On the fourth twilight, .........gouge the head...`
`.........oho?!"`
`It was a key, so it wouldn't turn if it was the wrong one.`
`But it did turn.`
` I could gouge it...!`
`With a sound of scraping stone, I gouged the first letter, the "l", ......and then pulled it out.`
`"Next! The fifth twilight...!`
` Gouge the chest......and kill......!"`
`The "o" was gouged and pulled out easily.`
`Then, the "r".`
` Next, the "d".`
` And finally, the "u".`
`When I turned the key of the "u", I could feel a resistance, as though some mechanism had been activated.`
`I waited for something to change, ......but nothing did.`
`However, I had felt something happen.`
`{n}A secret door or something must have opened up somewhere around here.`
`......Waiting around won't accomplish anything.`
`I've probably done everything I can here......`
`All of the letters in "Quadrillion" had been removed.`
`"On the ninth twilight, ......the witch revives, and none shall be left alive......"`
`So now...has the witch...have I...revived......?`
`The tenth twilight.`
`{n}The journey ends, and you shall reach the Home of the Gold......`
`When I stepped down off the ladder and looked around,`
` ......I immediately noticed that small change.`
`"......That lion statue............"`
`At some point, the lion statue in front of the chapel had turned to face a different direction.`
`......What an elaborate mechanism...!`
`Did Kinzo plan up this extravagant device back when he first started building on this island......?`
`I walked up to the lion statue and stared at it.`
`{n}Other than the fact that it was pointing a different direction, nothing had changed.`
`{n}In that case, is the lion looking at something in particular now......?`
`I followed its line of sight.........and saw another lion statue.`
`And that lion statue had also changed its direction.`
`"I see......`
` So, let the lions guide you.`
` ......As elaborate as ever, I see, Kinzo."`
`I wasn't complaining anymore.`
`......I felt a bit of respect and awe at Kinzo for setting up such an intricate device...`
`and having it go undiscovered for all these years.`
`There were lion statues standing like guards at the entrance and the corners of the chapel.`
`The direction they faced had changed, pointing around to the back of the chapel.`
`There was something there.`
`"....................................`
` ............Hoh........."`
`It was no longer a surprise.`
`This was after the mechanism in the relief.`
` After being guided by the lions.`
`So, when a gaping open secret passageway appeared, .........with stairs leading down to the darkness below, ......it wasn't surprising to me anymore.`
`"So, .........is this the entrance to the Golden Land, Kinzo......?!!"`
`".........Did you find it...?`
` Grandfather's......gold......?"`
`"Yes.`
` .........At the end of my long, long journey......was the Golden Land."`
`"According to the previous games, there was an underground VIP room there, along with ten tons of gold, right?"`
`"Yes.`
` After going down a rough stairway, ......there was a door at the end of the passage.`
` Inside, it was beautifully furnished, a true VIP room."`
`"......And was the gold all you found there?"`
`"Yes, at the time......`
` It would be a lie to say that I was not dizzied by the sight of all that gold stacked high..."`
`"............Is this...`
`...real......?"`
`I lightly touched the pile of gold with my finger.`
`{n}It was hard...and cold.`
`I had almost thought that it might crumble like a sandcastle if I touched it.`
`Now, there could be no doubt.`
`{n}This certainly was......a ten ton pile of gold ingots.`
`"......Haha,`
` ...............ha......"`
`Considering the amount of gold I had just found, I figured I ought to be crying out in delight.`
`......I didn't really feel like laughing, but I thought it only good manners to do so in a situation like this,`
` so I forced it out.`
`Because of this, only a few feeble laughs slipped from my mouth.`
`At that moment, even stronger than any delight...`
`was a feeling as though I'd entered a place I wasn't supposed to be...`
`For a while, all I could do was stand there shocked, unsure what I should do now that the epitaph's riddle had been completed.`
`Then, I heard approaching footsteps.`
`They were coming from the stairway I had entered by.`
`Someone was coming.`
` Could it be...Kinzo?`
`If he finds out I've been in a place like this, won't I get scolded harshly......?`
`I thought about hiding and pretending this never happened, but my legs wouldn't move.`
`I kept standing there, stunned, in front of the pile of gold......as the footsteps drew closer and closer...`
`".................................!"`
`The door opened, ......and I saw who it was.`
`......It............wasn't Kinzo.`
`"................................."`
`".........You......"`
`"......Did you reach this place by your power alone?"`
`"I‐......indeed..."`
`"................................."`
`For some time, Genji stared at Beato in silence, as though he was calculating something.`
`Then, he slowly clapped his hands together.`
` ......He did it again, over and over.`
`It took quite a long time before I realized that he was applauding me...`
`"The Master has said that he will hand over the gold and the headship to the first person who solves the epitaph.`
` ......And, he believed that this person would be {f:5:Beatrice}..."`
`"......{f:5:Beatrice}......`
` .........Me......?"`
`"This is fate.`
` .........It is fate that brought you to this day."`
`".............................."`
`I didn't really understand what Genji was saying.`
`The shock of seeing the gold still had me paralyzed...`
`"......Come this way."`
`"O‐okay......"`
`Genji opened a closet.`
`Inside it was a dress form wearing a beautiful dress made of black cloth and golden stitching.`
`When I saw it, I understood immediately.`
`......It was the witch's dress.`
`The black dress worn by the {f:5:Beatrice} in the portrait......`
`"Change into this."`
`"......This is.........."`
`"It is something that.........you once wore."`
`I've never worn a dress like this.`
` However, I understood what Genji meant.`
`This dress was one that {f:5:Beatrice} once wore.`
`And the one who shows a miracle by solving the epitaph is {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`By reaching this room, .........I had succeeded the position of the real {f:5:Beatrice},`
` the one in the portrait.`
`Why do I call myself {f:5:Beatrice}?`
`Because the name of the Golden Witch who rules over Rokkenjima's night is {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` ......That's right.`
` I was never the real {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`I was a different witch, stealing the name of the witch from Kinzo's delusions.`
`And now, ......I have become the real {f:5:Beatrice}......`
`By solving the epitaph's riddle, I would achieve my resurrection.`
`{n}......I was the one who decided on that rule, or so I thought...`
`But as it turns out, ......this really {i:was}.........a ritual to resurrect {f:5:Beatrice}...`
`I believed that I could create my own fate with magic.`
`{n}I was a master of that magic, ......yet fate had led me here by the hand...`
`At this moment, I was forced to truly accept and believe in this word called "fate"...`
`"And after I put this on.........?"`
`"......You will go to the Master.`
` Ready yourself."`
`".........Wait here."`
`"......O‐...okay."`
`"My lord.`
` It is Genji."`
`After Genji knocked, the sound of the study's door unlocking could be heard.`
`After a single glance telling me to wait, Genji entered alone.`
`"I cannot believe that this day has come......`
` Fate can be such a strange thing......"`
`Kumasawa was with us too.`
`I thought this dress, which didn't really suit me, would lead to a lot of jokes, ......but she didn't laugh at me at all.`
`On the contrary, when she saw me, ......her expression had turned stern, as though a long‐awaited day had finally come.`
`......My heart raced.`
`It wasn't supposed to matter who solved the epitaph.`
` There shouldn't be anything strange about me solving it......`
`Everyone else maintained solemn expressions, ......and that, along with everything else, made this feel like some sort of grand ceremony.`
`The suffocating silence continued.`
`Eventually, the door opened, and Genji peeked out.`
`".........Please enter,`
` .........{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama."`
`He was saying those words to me, ......but not to the person I had been until a short while ago.`
`"....................."`
`"Go ahead,`
` ......{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama..."`
`Kumasawa also urged me forward with a respectful bow.`
`{n}Kinzo was probably waiting for me inside.`
`What expression should I wear as I go in...?`
` How should I greet him...?`
`{n}I don't have a clue...`
`As the two of them motioned me forward, it was all I could do to avoid tripping over my dress as I walked.`
`".........Kinzo‐san.`
` She is here."`
`Kinzo was before the portrait of {f:5:Beatrice}, crouched on the ground as though kneeling.`
`At Nanjo's words, he slowly turned, still crouching...`
`"...............Oh...`
` .........Oohhhhhh........."`
`Kinzo's eyes were already red with crying.`
`{n}When he saw me, he groaned with wonder.`
`"......{f:5:Beatrice}......`
` .........{f:5:Beatrice}........."`
`Had he even forgotten how to stand up?`
`{n}He crawled over to where I was.`
`...As he called out to me with the name of the woman he had loved long ago.`
`I was too stunned to move.`
`Then, Kinzo grabbed the hem of my dress, gripped it tightly, ......then curled up and sobbed.`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}......`
` ......I'm sorry. I'm so sorry......`
` I knew how you felt, ......and yet I......`
` I'm so sorry...... Forgive me...... Forgive me, I beg you......"`
`"...................................."`
`There was nothing I could say.`
` However, just standing here like this was all I needed to do.`
`Kinzo's moment of atonement, the moment he had spent half of his life searching for, had finally come.`
`......A human's life is packed with sin.`
`So, humans seek forgiveness while they still live.`
` However, in most cases, there are none in this world capable of giving such forgiveness.`
`It was like that for Kinzo.`
` There was no longer anyone in the world who could give that to him.`
`{n}......But a miracle had woven one together, and in this moment, he had obtained the impossible...`
`"Oooohhhh, {f:5:Beatrice}...`
` ......{f:5:Beatrice}......`
` ...You need not forgive me, you need not say anything...!`
` All I ever wanted......was to say one word......of apology......!`
` {nobr:Oooohhhhhh.........}"`
`Kinzo kept grasping the dress's hem and sobbing.`
`The sins of humans are not forgiven by other people.`
`{n}They find forgiveness through regret and repentance.`
`......I want to believe that some sin, some fault of his......has been forgiven thanks to the way I look...`
`Kinzo's sobbing gradually ceased,`
` ......and he slowly looked up at me and rose.`
`He staggered.`
` Nanjo rushed forward to support him.`
`"................................."`
`".........To know.........that you are alive......`
` ......It brings me such...joy......"`
`This time, his words weren't directed through me, but at me.`
`{n}I hesitated, unsure how I should respond.`
`"......My lord, I beg your forgiveness for keeping this a secret from you all this time."`
`"No matter.`
` ......I do not fault you, Genji...`
` ......Considering the sin that I committed, ......every single day until now has been necessary for my atonement......"`
`"However, there can be no doubt that today's miracle is a true one.`
` ......By her own power, without anyone's help,`
` ......she solved the epitaph before anyone else."`
`"You did well.........to solve that convoluted epitaph......"`
`"Th‐.........thanks......"`
`"......Yes.`
` ......Your voice resembles your mother's.`
` Even your face reminds me of that mother and daughter......`
` ...There can be no doubt that {f:5:Beatrice}'s blood flows through your veins......"`
`"Yes.`
` ......The traces of the lady of Kuwadorian in her youth are right there."`
`Who......are they saying I look like......?`
`"......{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama,`
` please forgive me for keeping what I am about to tell you a secret for all this time.`
` You are the child of {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama and the Master."`
`"........................What......?"`
`"It's true.`
` ......You have been raised as a child without parents.`
` However, your true father is the Master.`
` And your true mother......is {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama."`
`"......Is that, ......umm, ......really............?"`
`"Yes.`
` You truly are a descendant of {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama."`
`Is such a strange fate.........really possible......?`
`I've dreamed about it.`
` Dreamed about what it'd be like to be the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`But that dream was for me alone.`
`So, I'd dreamed that if I solved the epitaph,`
` ......and carried out its ritual, I would revive as the true {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`......Is it really conceivable...`
`...that after I solved it...`
`...{f:5:Beatrice} actually did revive......?`
`"I...`
`...truly carry...`
`......{f:5:Beatrice}'s...`
`......blood......?"`
`"Yes.`
` There is no doubt of that whatsoever."`
`"......It must have been hard for you to live until this day without knowing a parent's affection...`
` ......And yet, look at how wonderfully you've grown......"`
`"......So, ......you all knew.........?`
` About me......?"`
`Genji, Kumasawa, and even Nanjo nodded wordlessly.`
`......Now that I think about it, that explains so many things.`
`I was always...in some way...special.`
`{n}Genji and especially Kumasawa always treated me very kindly.`
`Then, ......does that mean this day is a promised day, which would eventually have come no matter what......?`
`I don't understand anything anymore.`
`It's all God's miracle.`
`The promised fate has led me to this day.`
`".........{f:5:Beatrice}.`
` ............No,`
` .........Lion."`
`"...............?"`
`"That is the name I wanted to give you......"`
`"......It is your true name."`
`"Lion......`
` I will now return to you everything that {f:5:Beatrice} gave me.`
` ......I return to you the gold, as well as everything of the Ushiromiya family, which was created by it."`
`Kinzo stuck out a wrinkled hand.`
`On his finger was a ring with the One‐winged Eagle crest, which was the symbol of the Ushiromiya family head.`
`He pulled it off, grasped it tightly, and then held it out to me.`
`......I didn't know what to do.`
`Slowly, as though they were being drawn forward, ......I held out my hands, palms up.`
`After pressing his fist against my cupped hands, Kinzo slowly opened his hand and let the ring drop.`
`".........Lion, my child.........`
` ......That your fate has been toyed with is a result of my sin.`
` ......Please forgive me...`
` ......You now inherit my ring as the new and proper head of the Ushiromiya family."`
`"All of that gold belongs to you.`
` I ask that you use it as you please, and hope that it will be enough to heal some small part of the pain you have suffered...`
` That trifling amount of gold may be nothing in comparison with the sin I committed,`
` .........but even so, it should be enough to bring you some comfort."`
`"Th‐.........thank...you........."`
`".........Lion.`
` .........I have one.........final request."`
`"Wh‐......what is that.........?"`
`"Could you..................`
`.........call me........."`
`"......Huh? ......Sorry, what did you say......?"`
`"Could you............call me.........Father?"`
`".............................."`
`"......I understand why you are not able to...`
` ......I have not been a father to you in any way.`
` Furthermore, you have been raised without knowing anything about your father.`
` ......I realize that it's not a name you can call me by.`
` And, I realize that I have no right to ask this of you.`
` .........But, knowing all of that, ......still, I ask you......`
` ......If I could just hear that, ......I would have no further regrets......"`
`.........After being asked like that, ......was it possible for me to refuse?`
`Even if I am his child, ......I cannot see him as my father...`
`So, I felt a strong resistance to saying that word.`
`But......I decided that saying it was the right thing to do.`
`Only God can truly forgive sins.`
`But, ......though it may be temporary,`
` people can be saved by the forgiveness of others.`
`".........F‐....................."`
`"........................"`
`"..................`
` .........Fath......er............"`
`"Heh, ............heheheh............"`
`That awkward word made Kinzo laugh.`
`{n}Drops of silver fell from both of his eyes.`
`At that moment, ......the shadow that had covered his face......was wiped away......`
`"Thank you, ......Lion.`
` My child......`
` .........And {f:5:Beatrice}, as well.`
` Thank you for this last chance......to ask for forgiveness........."`
`"......Of course, I don't believe that such a simple act will earn me forgiveness.`
` ......The rest, I will do as I burn in the fires of hell.`
` .........I, Ushiromiya Kinzo, have no more regrets in this life!!`
` None at all! No regrets or things left undone!!`
` Wahaha, ......waha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haa{0}ha{0}hah!!`
` Waaah{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haa{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!!"`
`Looking up to the heavens, Kinzo spread his arms as though facing an applauding audience,`
` ......laughing at the top of his lungs.`
`It was the final pleasure, known only by those who have been released from all regrets of this world.`
`.........Kinzo's laugh weakened, ......and when it disappeared...`
`He dropped to his knees...`
`...like a puppet with its strings cut...`
`............and slowly...`
`......fell to the ground.........`
`"......M‐.........my lord......"`
`"Doctor Nanjo......"`
`"Y‐......yes........."`
`Though their master had fallen, ......they walked up to him slowly.`
`They already knew.`
`{n}Kinzo's soul......had already burned itself out.`
`After checking Kinzo's pulse, Nanjo shook his head and stood back up.`
`"............It was a peaceful death.`
` ......I don't think he had any regrets at all."`
`"It may be......that the Master died long before now.`
` ......It was only his magic and tenacity that kept him here so long.`
` ......And.........once he finally had a chance to apologize to {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama for everything, .........he finished everything he had to do..."`
`".........Please, ......rest in peace.`
` ............I believe that you have redeemed yourself."`
`".................................Father........."`
`That was...`
`...the one‐night reunion...`
`...between me and my father...`
`...and also our final farewell......`
`".........This gold all belongs to you now.`
` ......If you wish to exchange it for money, I can arrange for that."`
`"I hear it's worth 20 billion yen.`
` .........All of your dreams in this world can now be granted with money."`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho......`
` It must be tough to think of what to do with this much money when it suddenly comes your way."`
`"............There is nothing I desire among the things money can buy.`
` ......So, for the present, I would like to leave this here."`
`......Of course, I'm glad I have a lot of money.`
`However, money can't heal the pain in my heart.`
`{n}I just.........want him to come back.`
`"As you wish.`
` Then it shall be left here.`
` ......Also, take this key."`
`".........What is this?"`
`"It is the key to this underground VIP room.`
` If you use this, you won't need to use the more complicated device."`
`She was the only one who knew the answer to the epitaph's riddle, and the only key to this place was now hers.`
`......At this point, she truly was the master of this golden VIP room.`
`"You are already the master of Rokkenjima.`
` You have the right to know all of this island's secrets."`
`".........We should talk about Kuwadorian too."`
`"That's the mansion your mother lived in.`
` ......I'm sure you've heard rumors about it."`
`"Kuwadorian........."`
`"There are two mansions on this island, one at either end.`
` ......One is the mansion we know well.`
` The other is a hidden mansion known as Kuwadorian."`
`"Below this island are the remains of a military base built during the war.`
` The Master used that to travel between the two ends of the island..."`
`"There is an underground path in the back of this room, and if you follow it, you will reach the basement of Kuwadorian on the other end of this island.`
` ......That is a secret mansion, which only the Master knew of.`
` Of course, that mansion, like everything else, now belongs to the new head."`
`"......It's the mansion your mother lived in.`
` It's probably worth taking a trip over there sometime."`
`"My......mother............"`
`I've lived alone my whole life.`
`The only person I've ever felt like calling "Mother" is Kumasawa‐san, who always helped me out.`
`The mansion where a mother I've never met nor seen lived...`
`.........Who in the world.........am I......?`
`"Ask any questions you wish.`
` ......You now deserve to know everything."`
`"......Right now, ......I'm feeling very confused.`
` ......I don't even know where I should start asking questions.`
` ......But I'm sure......I'll think of plenty of things to ask about.`
` ......When I do, please tell me..."`
`"As you wish."`
`"A‐......also,`
` ......being treated so respectfully like that...`
`is a bit uncomfortable.`
` I'd be happier if you could talk to me the same way you've always done."`
`"If that is what you wish, then I will do so."`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho.`
` That's easier for me too."`
`".........Well now.`
` What will we do now, Genji‐san?`
` ......Kinzo‐san is dead."`
`"I will tell Krauss‐sama and Madam that he has passed away.`
` ......Then, we must tell them that Lion‐sama is the official successor to the headship.`
` After all, from this point forth, you are the Ushiromiya family head."`
`"M‐me as the head? That's......`
` And isn't Krauss‐sama the successor......?"`
`"The one who solves the epitaph's riddle is the successor.`
` .........There exists a will specifying this.`
` .........The Master's final order was that you were to inherit everything."`
`"P‐please wait...!`
` I appreciate the sentiment, ......but I can't do the job of being the successor,`
` ......and I can't accept such a big responsibility.`
` I think it would be better for Krauss‐sama to inherit that role......"`
`".........Are you certain?"`
`"Today, ......I have learned who I am.`
` ......Everyone knows about their parents,`
` but I didn't, since the time of my birth.`
` ......And here, today, I finally learned the truth.`
` ......That alone is enough for me."`
`If I suddenly became the Ushiromiya family head, how would Krauss‐sama react?`
` How angry would Madam be?`
`I don't want to become the head if it means making them feel like that.`
`Today, I learned who I am.`
`Who gave birth to me, how, and when?`
` ......These are things I want to learn from them as time goes by.`
`That alone is enough.`
`".........I am Lion.`
` ......And I am the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` Knowing that is enough for me.`
` ......I don't plan on calling myself the head.`
` ......Krauss‐sama can take that job."`
`"Is that your order, as the Ushiromiya family head?"`
`".........Yes."`
`".....................`
` ......As you wish, Master.`
` Then I will make it so."`
`"And please, don't tell anyone about what happened tonight.`
` .........I want to stay me.`
` ......There's nothing I'd want to do if I had the Ushiromiya headship or the gold."`
`......I just...`
`"I want to wait.........here on this island......as I have done in the past.`
` I want everything to be exactly the same as it was.`
` .........That's my only wish."`
`"...........................`
` As you wish, Master.`
` ......Everything that has happened tonight will not go beyond those present here.`
` ......Kumasawa.`
` Doctor Nanjo.`
` That is the wish of the new head."`
`"......If that's what you want, I have no objections.`
` Kinzo‐san's will entrusts everything to you.`
` If this is what you want to do, none of us will complain."`
`"You say "exactly the same as it was",`
` ......but do you really mean exactly the same...?`
` With no differences at all...?"`
`"Yes.`
` .........We'll keep this a secret.`
` ......This place and the gold will be sealed away.`
` If I need money, I'll ask you about it then.`
` .........That's enough for me."`
`"As you wish.`
` The mechanism leading to this place and the key both belong to you.`
` ......And all of us swear to keep the events of this night a secret.`
` .........Krauss‐sama will be the successor,`
` ......but in my heart, you will be the only true successor."`
`"......As you have ordered, we will behave the same way we always have, but please order us whenever it suits you.`
` You are my only master."`
`"..................Th‐.........thank you very much..."`
`A vast mountain of gold and the ring of the Ushiromiya family head.`
`{n}The dress of the portrait {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`And.........I became the true {f:5:Beatrice}, the Golden Witch.`
`Right here in my very own Golden Land.`
`If I think about it, not much has actually changed.`
`After all, I've always been the Golden Witch. ......I've just had a few more people acknowledge that.`
`{a:c:November 29th.`
`{n}The day I became a true witch.}`
`{a:c:`
`Oh, I am one yet many.`
`I am the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}.}`
`{a:c:`
`The true ruler of Rokkenjima,{n}......and the possessor of endless gold.}`
`{a:c:`
`Yet, I am in no way complete.}`
`{a:c:`
`......Here I wait...{n}for the return of the one person I love......}``"............And that...`
`...is the end of my tale."`
`"Oh,`
` ......you're ending it there?`
` But aren't the next two years the fun part...?"`
`"We don't need them.`
` ......After all we've heard in the past games about your inner conflict and how you suffered,`
` you don't need to say any more."`
`"............You mean......the conflict of the furniture with incomplete souls?"`
`"There was a duel.`
` The result had almost been decided.`
` .........However, the year 1986......was incredibly merciless."`
`"......I'll bet you cursed your fate."`
`"Yes.`
` .........If it had been one year sooner.`
` ......Or else, one year later."`
`"The duel would've been settled... Though in different forms."`
`Silently, Clair hung her head.`
`......If only I had been given time...`
` Or else, if I hadn't been given time to think and agonize.`
`I curse...everything.`
` Why......did it have to be 1986?`
`"I decided...`
`...to delegate my fate."`
`".........Delegate it......"`
`"Like the ritual by which I inherited everything from the previous head,`
` ......I decided to put myself in the hands of that fate called a miracle."`
`It may be more accurate to say that I entrusted my fate to a spin of the roulette.`
`I—we—could not even decide our own fate,`
` so we let fate decide everything for us.`
`Perhaps someone's efforts would be rewarded.`
`{n}Or, perhaps all would be joined and set free.`
`{n}Or, perhaps someone would be kind enough to put a stop to this lunacy.`
`"......No matter which fate the roulette chose,`
` I planned to obey its ruling.`
` I would not resist fate.`
` ......After all, ......whenever I have tried in the past, fate has always been heartless to me........."`
`Clair hung her head and let a single tear drop down...`
`{y:0:Human}{n:0:Human}s will carelessly say that people have infinite possibilities.`
`{n}However, the Endless Witch......knows how limited those possibilities really are.`
`So, within the limits of her fate, she tried to find the infinite.`
`By entrusting her fate to God, she tried to find the infinite.`
`However, this did not mean that she abandoned her fate.`
`{n}Because she spun fate's roulette with an unshakable and certain will.`
`A certain fate, where absolutely no one could escape if the epitaph was not solved.`
`With it, she sealed up the island, herself included.`
`October 4th and 5th, 1986, were sealed away by an absolute and certain will,`
` .........and she entrusted herself to one of the fates that could be chosen in that short span of time on that island.`
`".........And now,`
` my confession truly is over.`
` ......This should be enough to find the motive for the crime.`
` .........If you still do not know, I will say no more.`
` It's not as though...anyone could understand my heart anyway."`
`"Yeah.`
` ......There's no need to say any more."`
`"......After watching how I wandered into a dead‐end of fate,`
` ......Lion, do you see how great a hope you represent to me?"`
`"........................`
` ............I'm...a different possibility for you."`
`"The fact of your happiness makes me jealous, but to an even greater degree, it shines brightly in my eyes.........and makes me smile.`
` ......You were a possible future.`
` .........Right now, .........that fact is my salvation."`
`".........I.................."`
`"......Live with enough happiness for the both of us.`
` I'm glad I got to meet you once...at the end.`
` .........You have my thanks,`
` Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}."`
`".........I'm just carrying out your funeral.`
` There's no need to thank me.`
` ......Well, it's about time to end this.`
` It's about time to send the dead to the land of the dead."`
`"..................Yes.`
` This is my funeral, after all.`
` It's time for me to go back to where I belong."`
`"................................."`
`"Don't make that face.`
` And please, rejoice that you are not me.`
` After all, I rejoice in that fact as well."`
`".........I'll live.`
` ......I'll live life for the both of us..."`
`"Thank you.`
` .........Live in happiness.`
` And someday, find yourself a wonderful person.`
` ......I pray that you live as a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}, without awakening as a witch.`
` ......That you have a whole and single soul...and love one person with all your strength...`
` ......I hope you live your life like that."`
`"............Okay......"`
`"Will‐san.`
` I thank you for being an observer.`
` ......You aren't the one I truly wanted to understand me, ......but you have saved my heart."`
`"I...understand you.`
` I don't ignore the heart."`
`".........Thank you.`
` ............So, now that I have a splendid observer who understands me, ......I want to entrust my final moments to you."`
`".....................Are you sure?"`
`"Yes.`
` ......For me, the important thing is whether the person understands me, not how well I know them."`
`......The one I wanted to understand me...didn't.`
`{n}......A person with no connection to me...did.`
`There's nothing sad about it.`
` On the contrary, the fact that a person with no relation to me was still able to understand me is a miracle that I feel grateful for.`
`"You are a good observer...and the only one who has managed to understand me.`
` ......That connection is strong enough."`
`"............Alright."`
`"I offer my heart to you, ......nameless and wonderful observer."`
`"..........................."`
`"......Lion.`
` Get back."`
`"Huh?`
` ......What's going to happen...?"`
`"A mystery story can't meet its death...unless the detective performs the last rites."`
`"............Will just stopping your heart be enough...?"`
`"When you mourn the dearly departed, do you put just their heart into the coffin?"`
`".........Got it.`
` ......That which was born from earth will return to earth.`
` ......I'll return all of you to the earth."`
`"Earth to earth.`
` Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.`
` Illusions to illusions.`
` And dreams to dreams."`
`"..................Right."`
`".........Then let us begin.`
` .........This is my...burial."`
`"Whenever you're ready."`
`"Let us start.`
` ......In the manner of the end of my final game."`
`Light gathered at Will's back, and a sword materialized there.`
`Slowly, ......he drew it out.`
`Its pitch‐black tip, which could neatly slice apart truth from fiction,`
` swung once, leaving a black trail, and then again, leaving a white trail.`
`".........I'll cut the truth out from the fiction.`
` ............Come."`
`Following Will's lead, a similar sword appeared in Clair's hand.`
`Its tip glinted silver, the opposite of Will's.`
`"First game, first twilight.`
` Six corpses in the gardening shed."`
`"Illusions to illusions.`
` ......The corpse that cannot return to earth returns to illusions."`
`Will's pitch‐black slash cut across Clair's body at an angle.`
`The blade passed through her like she was water, ......but its tip sent golden flower petals scattering.`
`"First game, second twilight.`
` Two corpses are close together in a locked room protected by a chain."`
`"Illusions to illusions.`
` ......A chain of illusions can imprison only illusions."`
`The razor‐thin black blur sent golden flower petals scattering again...`
`"First game, fourth twilight.`
` The old head from the locked‐room study, confined in a scorching furnace."`
`"Illusions to illusions.`
` ......Let the man of illusions go to where he belongs."`
`"First game, fifth twilight.`
` The last moments of the boy who offered his chest to a stake."`
`"Illusions to illusions.`
` ......The witch and stake of illusions can pierce naught but illusions."`
`"First game, sixth, seventh, and eighth twilights.`
` Three corpses lying in the locked room of the singing girl."`
`"Illusions to illusions.`
` ......Illusions are the blind girl's song. Illusion of a locked room."`
`"...............Well done.`
` ......Yes, you really are splendid."`
`"......That was a risky game from the very start.`
` ......What would you have done if he'd insisted on seeing your face and just stepped inside?"`
`"That's what it means to entrust yourself to fate."`
`".........And that's the roulette you were talking about."`
`"Let us continue.`
` Second game, first twilight.`
` Six with their stomachs split in the locked‐room chapel."`
`"Illusions to illusions.`
` ......The gold truth locks the lock of illusions."`
`"Second game, second twilight.`
` Even the corpses of the two who are close cannot be close."`
`"Illusions to illusions.`
` ......Illusions who have fulfilled their role do not leave a corpse."`
`"Second game, fourth, fifth, and sixth twilights.`
` In Natsuhi's locked room, none are left alive."`
`"Earth to earth.`
` ......No one would dispute that a coffin is a locked room."`
`"Second game, seventh and eighth twilights.`
` The two sliced to death by the red‐eyed phantom."`
`"Earth to earth. Illusions to illusions.`
` ......No illusion can create a corpse."`
`Every time the blade passed through Clair's body, golden flower petals flew everywhere.`
`......Bit by bit, the petals covering her heart were being torn away.`
`The witch illusion......was scattering.`
`"Third game, first twilight.`
` Six corpses connected by the linked locked rooms."`
`"Illusions to illusions.`
` ......In a locked‐room ring, the end and the beginning overlap."`
`"Third game, second twilight.`
` The corpses of mother and child lie together in the rose garden."`
`"Earth to earth.`
` ......No falsehoods in their final moments as told."`
`"Third game, fourth, fifth, and sixth twilights.`
` Three corpses lying in the mansion."`
`"Earth to earth.`
` ......No falsehoods in their final moments as told."`
`"Third game, seventh and eighth twilights.`
` The corpses of husband and wife lie exposed under the arbor."`
`"Earth to earth.`
` ......The obvious culprit wields the blade of impermanence."`
`"Fourth game, first twilight.`
` A massacring storm sweeps through the dining hall."`
`"Illusions to illusions.`
` ......Tales woven by the gold truth return to illusions."`
`"Fourth game, second twilight.`
` The two young ones face their trials and pass away together."`
`"Illusions to illusions.`
` ......Tales woven by the gold truth return to illusions."`
`"Fourth game, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth twilights.`
` None of the runaways are left alive."`
`"Earth to earth. Illusions to illusions.`
` ......Silent corpses, adorned by fiction."`
`"Fourth game, ninth twilight.`
` And none shall be left alive."`
`"Earth to earth. Illusions to illusions.`
` ......Fiction locked inside a cat box becomes truth."`
`......Over and over again, Clair's body was sliced by the pitch‐black sword.`
`As proof, the chapel was now filled with golden flower petals, ......which danced around like gold snow.`
`".........It's beautiful............"`
`"Who wouldn't want their last moments to be like that?"`
`The gold snow was like confetti at the finale of a show.`
`{n}The curtains were finally falling on the stage that was her.`
`"......Then, one final question."`
`"............Sure."`
`Clair slowly raised her hands.`
`{n}The sword she held became golden rose petals and melted away.`
`She stood there, arms wide, waiting for the final strike......`
`"Who...am I......?"`
`"Illusions...to illusions.`
` ......The promised reaper lowers the curtains on the tale regardless of the witch's will."`
`The wide swing of Will's pitch‐black blade...`
`......cleaved through Clair's form.`
`Blown away by a powerful gust of wind,`
` ......her human form crumbled in an instant, became a storm of golden flower petals, and was torn apart.`
`After she was blown away, a golden heart remained in midair,`
` but it too was swallowed by the vortex of wind and broke down into flower petals.`
`The golden vortex swirled around the chapel......`
` Then, the swirl of petals gradually scattered out of existence......and vanished......`
`A few remaining petals danced around like snowflakes,`
` and those final vestiges decorated the chapel beautifully.`
`.........A beam of light lit the center of the stage.`
`There stood Clair, whose tale had ended.`
`Then, slowly, ......softly, .........she faced the audience and bowed.`
`Applause spread throughout the theater.`
`The long, long tale she had just finished telling was being given massive applause.`
`It went on and on.`
` .........And on and on.`
`The stage slowly sunk into the darkness of oblivion.`
`Clair continued to bow in front of the unending applause......and as the curtain fell, she faded into the darkness.`
`......People are born with sin...and live life to obtain forgiveness from someone.`
`Or perhaps they are born as mysteries...and live life searching for someone to solve them.`
`Here, all of her riddles had been solved, ......with no lingering regrets.`
`People are riddles.`
`They want someone else to solve their riddle.`
`{n}They live life wanting someone to solve the riddle that they are, the most difficult riddle in the world.`
`They want someone to look at the riddle they are.`
`{n}And they want that person to solve it.`
`For her, that wish has been granted......`
`.........Her soul will wander no longer.`
`Rest in eternal slumber......within your cat box coffin.........`
`Though there had been so many golden flower petals flitting about like a blizzard, ......not a single one remained.`
`Everything had become dust, vanished as though there had been nothing there in the first place, ......and all was silent once more.`
`Even the sound of rain was gone.`
` The rain must have stopped at some point.`
`".............................."`
`".........Meeting you was her salvation."`
`"I......hope so."`
`"She cursed herself and her inescapable, dead‐end fate...and gave up.`
` ......Meeting you, a happy miracle in her eyes, saved her in a way nothing else could.`
` ......So don't make that face."`
`"...........................Heh."`
`"That was a pretty tasteful ending...for you."`
`"......Auau only told me to carry out the funeral.`
` ......Well, I just called a facilitator, you, and let you do everything."`
`"Thank you, Will."`
`".........Nn."`
`"In Clair's place, I want to thank you.`
` ......Thanks for cutting off all the lingering regrets...for a "me" of a different fate."`
`".........I thought I'd see a bit more head clutching and blind confusion from you."`
`"I understand now.`
` ......I realize how happy my life has been.`
` ......If fate had toyed with me...and if I was living in another world, I might have gotten stuck in the same dead‐end of fate.`
` ......However, thanks to an extremely improbable bit of good luck, I live in this world.`
` ......I now know how much that means...how much it's worth."`
`"................................."`
`".........What's up?`
` Why the significant look?"`
`"I thought decent witches didn't exist,`
` ......but I might have to change that theory."`
`"Don't worry, no need to change it.`
` ......I only joined that kid's game to kill some time.`
` ......And, though I lost, I enjoyed playing."`
`"......That kid died without folding up her game board.`
` ......I just took charge of cleaning up...as thanks to her for letting me play and because it's the loser's duty."`
`".........I was sure you'd be a lot crueler than this."`
`"Crueler?"`
`"I thought this'd be a cruel game that ignores the heart."`
`"Yes, it was a cruel game.`
` .........Though she claimed that the game was fantasy,`
` I've brought you along and made it end as a mystery.`
` ......The witch illusion has been spectacularly crushed, and my little bit of revenge is complete."`
`".............................."`
`"To bring an end to this tangled tale of love with absolute and certain willpower.`
` ......Out of respect for that certain willpower, the Witch of Certainty made that kid a witch for just two days."`
`"......Even within this limited span of two days, I've been able to enjoy an endless kaleidoscope.`
` ......I won't be bestowing my favor, so no miracle will occur.`
` .........However, even that ending is something that child wished for."`
`"......Which truth did those endless tales settle on in the end?"`
`"Who knows?`
` ......We can't say for sure—that's what makes it a cat box."`
`"When you open the box, you get a tale where no trace of the mansion remains, and no one except Eva survives.`
` ......And since Eva died without saying anything, all the truth is inside the cat box.`
` .........Endless possibilities, all kept within a limited box."`
`"......Now that I think about it,`
` maybe the whole island where she lived and died was the Golden Land."`
`"If you can call a cat box a Golden Land, that is.`
` ......And of all the imaginable stories that could occur within that cat box, Battler wrote the most enjoyable."`
`"......You mean that book in {f:5:Beatrice}'s coffin?"`
`"That's right.`
` .........It's the happiest possible tale for her, which he thought up himself."`
`"It was a really fun, love‐filled, ......happy tale.`
` ......I also think......that tale was the most fitting one to put in her coffin."`
`"No, that's wrong."`
`"......Huh?"`
`"............You heard Clair.`
` ......{i:You} are her hope and her salvation.`
` More than anything else, it's {i:you} living on in happiness that will be her salvation."`
`"........................`
` ............Right."`
`"......Live happily.`
` That's all you need to do to be that kid's miracle."`
`"Yes.`
` .........I'll live happily enough for the both of us."`
`"......I'm surprised you found this kid.`
` Didn't you have to search through about...`
`two million of them in that vast sea?"`
`"Such trivialities are all I am capable of."`
`"...............Hmph."`
`"And now, the funeral is over.`
` .........As promised, I've released the barrier.`
` Once you leave, time will start moving again like normal."`
`"So, you're done with us now.`
` If I don't get back quickly, Diana'll start scratching the curtains."`
`"......We weren't together long, but thank you for your help."`
`"So long.`
` Be happy...for the sake of the millions of other "you"s."`
`When he left the chapel, a beautiful after‐rain sky stretched out above him.`
`That sky, which was a mix of rain clouds, gaps of sunlight, and the tint of twilight, had a beauty to it that couldn't be described in words.`
`Will slowly descended the stone stairs, stepping in the puddles.`
`{n}Then, he waved without looking back...and left the chapel behind.`
`His form and footprints gradually faded away......until there was no trace left.`
`"Okay, time for me to disappear too.`
` ......Goodbye, Lion."`
`"I have you to thank as well.`
` ......I believe I said some fairly inconsiderate things to you.`
` You have my apologies.`
` ......You taught me something very important."`
`"......................................."`
`"......What is it?"`
`"No, it's nothing.`
` ......It's been a century since anyone's thanked me, so I wasn't sure how to respond."`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} shrugged, then floated up into the air.`
`Then, she looked up at the beautiful seven colors of light shining in through the stained glass...`
`and spoke as though someone was looking down on her from there.`
`"Auaurora.`
` Was that enough of an answer check for you?`
` If you still don't get it, why not gather the other observer witches and have a tea party or something? Then you can listen to their theories."`
`"I'm mean, so I won't give any more hints than this.`
` There are no witches who don't think.`
` After all, witches who don't think either die or turn to seaweed."`
`"......Now, it's time to go back and have a drink, ...while discussing how much of your theory was right.`
` I'm tired of playing the part of the bad guy...and of being a miko.`
` You're done with me now.`
` ......Bye, Lion.`
` And bye to you too, observer witches."`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} burst and disappeared.`
`{n}A single golden flower petal glittered.`
`......Lion picked it up.`
`{n}It was the only trace of a miracle that remained in this chapel......`
`At that time, cheery voices could suddenly be heard.`
`It was the relatives.`
` They came out of the waiting room, one by one.`
`"So this is where you were, Lion.`
` I was looking for you."`
`"Mother.`
` My apologies.`
` I was just thinking about something."`
`"Looks like the rain's finally stopped!`
` Finally some good weather!"`
`"Everyone,`
` let us return to the mansion.`
` I have been told that {f:5:Beatrice}'s funeral is over."`
`"Father, where's the head?"`
`"He'll be here in a sec.`
` Today was pretty crazy.`
` Playing along with Dad's little funeral show was a real pain."`
`"You shouldn't say that.`
` It was a very important ceremony."`
`"That's right.`
` I think it was very important for Father."`
`"I'm starving.`
` Gohda‐san, think you could cook something up for us?"`
`"Yes, ma'am!`
` I'll prepare some tea at once."`
`".........Where is Lion...?!`
` Lend me a hand."`
`"Our family head...! There you are."`
`As Kinzo came out after the others, Lion ran up to him.`
`"......You did very well today.`
` ......{f:5:Beatrice}'s funeral is now complete."`
`"Yes.`
` ......And I'm sure that {f:5:Beatrice}'s soul was saved."`
`"..................`
` ......How could you know that?"`
`"I was with {f:5:Beatrice} until a second ago.`
` ......And I saw her leave on her journey with no regrets.`
` That's how I know."`
`"......................................."`
`"......I guarantee it."`
`"I see.`
` ............If you say it, then it must be so."`
`The relatives left the chapel one by one.`
`{n}Lion left too, giving Kinzo a shoulder to lean on.`
`A beam of sunlight peeked through the clouds,`
` ......looking like a staircase leading up to heaven.``...............When I came to, all was silent.`
`{n}The lights were dim.`
` And yet......the room felt large.`
`......Where on Earth............is this............?`
`I was sitting in what seemed to be a very small single sofa.`
`{n}It was very constricting, and there seemed to be several more of them off to each side of me...`
`Once I noticed that, I realized that I was in a theater.`
`"............Where on Earth.........am I.........?"`
`I don't know how long I've been here.`
`{n}And, more importantly, I don't know where this is.`
`......Beatrice's funeral ended,`
` everyone went back to the mansion, and......`
`........And after that, my memory gets fuzzy, and I can't recall anything else.`
`Then, I was surprised to notice the presence of another person.`
`Apparently, I wasn't the only one sitting in the audience seating of this vast theater.`
`......The sound had come from a seat to the side of mine.`
`When I looked, I saw a girl sitting several seats off to my left.`
`It was a face I had never seen before.`
` ......I wondered who she was.`
`{n}She looked like a high‐schooler or a college student,`
` about the same age as I was.`
`"...............nnn......"`
`She groaned.`
` Apparently, she had just woken up...`
`I didn't want to scare her, so I decided to introduce myself first...`
`".........Hello."`
`".....................!!"`
`Apparently, she was equally surprised to find someone other than herself here.`
`{n}She jumped when she heard my greeting.`
`"......Who on Earth are you?"`
`"I feel the same way.`
` ......It seems that neither of us is here of our own accord."`
`"...............Is that...the One‐Winged Crest...?"`
`"Huh?`
` ......Do you recognize this crest?"`
`She looked suspiciously at the One‐Winged Crest emblazoned on my collar.`
`Her stare, which was unmoving but not openly hostile, wasn't exactly pleasant for me.`
`"Allow me to introduce myself first.`
` ......I am Ushiromiya Lion."`
`"Ushiromiya—huh?`
` What?"`
`"Lion.`
` Written as "{p:0:理御}", but pronounced "Lee‐on".`
` ......Pretty strange name, don't you think?"`
`"......No stranger than mine.`
` But I'll have to apologize.`
` I don't know who you are."`
`"That's hardly surprising,`
` since I don't know you either."`
`"That's not what I meant.`
` Who are you?`
` There's no one like you in the Ushiromiya family."`
`"And why are you so sure?`
` Do you have something to do with my family?"`
`"I'm a member of the Ushiromiya family."`
`".........But that's..."`
`She showed me her left sleeve......and the crest of the One‐Winged Eagle emblazoned upon it.`
`"......I regret having to ask the same question, but who are you?`
` I've never seen you in the Ushiromiya family."`
`".................................`
` ......First they tear me into little bits, then they make me read...`
` .........What's next?`
` What witch am I supposed to be entertaining this time?"`
`She spat out those words and seemed to be complaining about something.`
`"Ange.`
` ......I'm Ushiromiya Ange.`
` Rudolf and Kyrie's daughter."`
`"What?!`
` A‐......Ange‐chan......?!`
` But you're supposed to be six years old......"`
`"............I was six during the year of the final family conference on Rokkenjima.`
` ......Now I get it.`
` So, you're from the year 1986.`
` I'm eighteen.`
` And I'm from the year 1998."`
`"I‐in other words, ......you're the Ange‐chan......of twelve years in the future......?"`
`"I'm glad you can wrap your head around it.`
` But, unfortunately, I don't have a clue who you are.`
` ......Who are you?`
` Who are your parents?"`
`"My father is Krauss.`
` Natsuhi is my mother."`
`"That would make you Jessica onee‐chan."`
`"Jessica is my little sister."`
`"..............................`
` ...What's going on?`
` Wasn't Jessica onee‐chan an only child...?"`
`By this point, I was starting to figure out the situation this Ange had come from.`
`......She's probably from the world where I awakened as a witch—the world where Lion doesn't exist.`
`"It will be a bit difficult to explain, ......but think of it this way.`
` In a world slightly different from the one you know, I am also a member of the Ushiromiya family.`
` In your world, a different fate leads me to walk a different path through life, so that I do not live as an Ushiromiya family member."`
`"...............Are you...a witch......?"`
`"Sorry to disappoint you, but I'm just an ordinary human.`
` ......What I just told you is something I heard from the witch called {f:5:Bernkastel}‐san."`
`".........{f:5:Bernkastel}?`
` That one with the long, blue hair and the gloomy face...?"`
`"Y‐......yes.`
` That probably describes her, I think......"`
`".........In other words,`
` I'm being forced to play along with another witch's farce.`
` ......Just where is this place?"`
`"I only woke up a second ago myself.`
` ......I wonder where this is."`
`"It looks like a theater.`
` ......Are we supposed to watch a play, or something?"`
`"......I'm really not in the mood now.`
` Let's look for an exit."`
`"............You haven't noticed yet?`
` Look."`
`"Huh?`
` ..................Ah, these are......"`
`Clank.`
`I finally noticed.`
` Both of my wrists and ankles had chains attached to them.`
`As long as I sat here, I had enough slack that I could move about a little, but it looked like there wouldn't be nearly enough for me to get out of this place.`
`"......When did...`
` .........Who would do something like this......?"`
`"............Once a witch has made you her piece,`
` you'll be their plaything forever.`
` ......There's no way to escape."`
`Ange crossed her legs, making the chains clank together.`
`She must realize that no amount of struggling will break these chains,`
` ......that getting panicky won't accomplish anything.`
` She seemed to have nerves of steel.`
`"What do you mean, a witch's piece?"`
`"......It's like being their slave.`
` ......I made a deal, once.`
` ......I said I wanted to see my family, to bring them back from that day.`
` In exchange for making that a possibility, that witch turned me into a witch's piece.`
` .........At least the witch kept her promise.`
` I was able to see Onii‐chan again."`
`".........You mean Battler‐kun......?"`
`"Well, I wasn't even able to tell him who I was.`
` ......And, in exchange for that short bit of time, I'm now trapped inside the witches' toy box for all eternity.`
` ......Looks like you are too.`
` ......What bargain did you make?"`
`"I, I didn't......"`
`"You never asked a witch for anything?"`
`"Never.`
` .........She taught me what a miracle my existence is.`
` That's all."`
`".........Either way, neither of us is getting out of here.`
` ......Okay, witches!`
` What kind of show do you have for us this time?!`
` Have we moved from reading aloud to theatergoing?`
` Am I supposed to watch someone else read aloud this time, or what?!`
` If that's it, then start it up.`
` I'm bored enough as it is!"`
`Ange yelled this to the pitch‐black stage.`
`{n}Her voice reverberated throughout the theater, but no one gave an answer......`
`......No, someone did.`
` And that was also in a voice that rang out across the theater.`
`However, that voice sounded theatrical, as though someone was announcing the start of a play.`
`"What happened on that day, you ask?`
` I'm not telling.`
` Why don't you just give up and die?!"`
`".........W‐was that the voice of...?"`
`"That old hag.`
` It was Aunt Eva's voice."`
`"What does she mean by "what happened on that day"?"`
`"......She's talking about the 4th and 5th of October in the year 1986.`
` ......The day of the final family conference on Rokkenjima."`
`"In other words, ......today."`
`Today is October 4th, 1986.`
`As a prelude to the family conference, Beatrice's funeral was held...`
`"That's a surprise.`
` So, you've come here from October 4th, 1986?`
` Tell me.`
` What happened during those two days...?!"`
`The answer she seeks is inside the cat box.`
` Even I can tell her nothing except that there was a tragic misunderstanding of the heart.`
`However, I doubt that explanation would satisfy her.`
`Then, ......a pillar of bright light pierced the stage.`
`There stood a figure in white.`
`{n}.........That figure, clothed in a white dress, was obviously Clair.`
`Of course, Ange didn't recognize her.`
` She looked suspicious, apparently wondering who in the world this was.`
`However, even I felt as though something was wrong.`
`......Didn't she settle all of her regrets in that funeral a short while ago, before being sent off into the next world...?`
`She stood all alone in the narrow beam of light in the center of the stage, and the expression on her face......was lifeless.`
`The light began to grow brighter and brighter.`
`It shone more and more fiercely on her, until it became blinding just to look at her.`
`The world was enveloped by a light so bright that we couldn't keep our eyes open,`
` enveloped by a sound like wind or television static,`
` ......and our minds began to go blank...`
`"Whoo......!`
` They're bloomin' wonderfully again this year!"`
`"It must be a pain to take care of all these.`
` Pretty easy for us though, just looking at 'em."`
`"*giggle*, I agree.`
` We've got to thank the people who take care of them for us."`
`"But it is a bit lacking in grace.`
` I prefer the way it used to be, before Nii‐san decided to meddle with it."`
`"The old ones did have their charm, didn't they?"`
`"Uu!`
` I love roses!`
` I'd like them even more if they didn't have thorns!`
` Uu!"`
`"Whoa!`
` Now I remember this old garden!`
` I'd totally forgotten about it these past six years...!"`
`"It has been a long time for you.`
` Both you and this garden have changed so much."`
`"Ah, let me introduce you!`
` This is Kanon‐kun, one of our servants!`
` This is the first time you've met Battler, right?"`
`"......Pleased to meet you."`
`"You can just call me Battler!`
` Nice to meet you!"`
`"Shannon's here too, today.`
` Remember when we used to play together?"`
`"Oh, Shannon‐chan!`
` I'd totally forgotten... That really takes me back!`
` How's she been doing?!"`
`"She's blossomed into a beautiful young lady over the last six years.`
` You should say hi to her later on."`
`"Shannon and George onii‐chan are really good friends! Uu!"`
`"Maria, shhh!`
` That's a secret!"`
`"If you would, everyone, allow me to guide you to the guesthouse."`
`After enjoying the lovely welcome provided by the roses, the relatives followed Gohda in the direction of the guesthouse......`
`October 4th, 1986.`
`Rokkenjima.`
` A world without Lion.`
`{n}......The day of the Ushiromiya family's family conference.`
`The mysterious letter that Maria read aloud after dinner, just as she had been told to.`
`The writer of the letter claimed to be the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice} and challenged the family.`
`Solve the riddle of the epitaph.`
` Otherwise, I will take everything.`
`It was the letter that declared the start of {f:5:Beatrice}'s game, just as it had appeared in so many games before.`
`Had an unknown person appeared to complicate the inheritance problem?`
`{n}Where was the 20 billion yen's worth of gold hidden?`
`{n}What was the purpose of this letter? For what goal had it been written?`
`{n}Who on Earth was this {f:5:Beatrice}?`
`It was that tangled web of suspicion and paranoia that had been a constant in every game: .........the dinner of October 4th.`
`"George‐kun.`
` I'm sorry, but could you take the others and go back to the guesthouse?`
` My apologies."`
`"......Shannon.`
` Take the children to the guesthouse.`
` We will move straight on to the family conference."`
`"Y‐yes.`
` As you wish..."`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}, the Golden Witch......`
` What a fascinating letter you've sent us..."`
`"She's telling us to solve the epitaph...?`
` Ridiculous.`
` That gold belongs to us.`
` Why would we ever give it up to some outsider...?!"`
`"......If we could just find that gold, we'd all be happy.`
` No one'd have to lose anything."`
`"Let's go, everyone.`
` Looks like it'll be adult time from here on out..."`
`"......Give me a break.`
` Sounds like things are going to get complicated."`
`"Come on, Maria...`
` Let's go......"`
`"Beato's ritual has begun......`
` Kihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi......"`
`"Okay, everyone, ...I shall guide you to the guesthouse......"`
`".........What's......all this about......?"`
`"Probably a replay of one of the old games, ......or else an entirely new game.`
` In all the games, October 4th happens in pretty much the same way."`
`"......A new game?`
` You mean, a tale that hasn't appeared in any of the fragments so far?"`
`"There's no way they'd go to the trouble of chaining us down if they just wanted to show us a game we already know.`
` ......We should probably assume it's a new game.`
` That means there should be a Game Master.`
` ......Who is it?`
` .........That witch?`
` {f:5:Bernkastel}......?"`
`"I......can't imagine so.`
` ......Clair should have vanished already.`
` There should be no need to spin up a new tale..."`
`"Beato's game board was hijacked by those evil witches long ago.`
` Even Beato is nothing more than a piece in their games."`
`"......Just who is behind this......and what are they after?`
` What do they want to show us......?"`
`Before this tale began,`
` Clair definitely appeared on the stage.`
` She is "me" from a world of a different fate......and the teller of the tale that is {f:5:Beatrice}'s game.`
`However, didn't she entrust everything to Will and have all of her riddles solved?`
`There should be no need for her to make new riddles......`
`.........In that case, is {f:5:Bernkastel} using this tale to test me...?`
`Along with Will, I have at least touched the deepest depths of this tale...and understood the culprit's heart.`
`So, even if an entirely new tale presents itself, I should be able to see through the riddles.`
`.........Is that...what my role is......?`
`{n}Is my role to teach Ange about the truth of this tale......?`
`"......Do you know?`
` ......Do you know the truth of this tale?"`
`"I have several theories.`
` Still, none of those can give a conclusive answer.`
` The truth is always inside the cat box.`
` I can't say anything for sure."`
`In this world, Ange is absent on this day.`
`{n}So, it's only natural that she doesn't know what happened.`
`However, at the very least, I do know who the culprit is...and what they were trying to do......`
`".........Yes.`
` I think I've finally understood my role in this."`
`"What do you mean?"`
`"Apparently, you're here as a theatergoer, and I'm here to explain things."`
`"And what are you supposed to be explaining?"`
`"I know......who's behind the crime that's about to occur."`
`"What did you say.........?"`
`"Thinking about this normally,`
` ......the only explanation I see is that someone's trying to make us solve the epitaph, aiming to grab the gold for themselves."`
`"I agree.`
` If they'd already solved it, they could just take it.`
` There'd be no need to challenge us to solve the riddle."`
`"It's a prank by one of the servants.`
` They're hoping to pick up the scraps from the celebration if the gold is found."`
`"I cannot imagine that any of our servants would do such a thing..."`
`"......Or, maybe one of us sent the letter, pretending to be a servant."`
`"If that's it, you're the most suspicious one.`
` You schooled Maria‐chan on her part and made her read the letter, didn't you?"`
`"I, I wouldn't do that...!"`
`"Give that a rest, Eva.`
` We can't jump to conclusions.`
` Isn't this the time for us all to stick together?"`
`"That's right.`
` The aim of this strange letter is probably to disrupt our unity.`
` The more we let it affect us, the more things go the way of this "{f:5:Beatrice}" who sent it."`
`"Kyrie‐san's right.`
` Wouldn't it be best to simply ignore a letter like that from the start?"`
`"That is what I have been saying the whole time.`
` This sort of prank is not worth considering!"`
`"Yes, that's it exactly.`
` If a couple improbable claims for damages get ya flustered, you'll never be able to sell anythin'!"`
`"My husband's right.`
` This is a child's prank, and taking it seriously is just a waste of time.`
` If someone really wanted to shake up the inheritance issue, they'd come forward boldly instead of using something this roundabout."`
`"You've got it right there.`
` Someone probably wants to make us think there's another person trying to make demands about the inheritance, when their real goal is just to pick up the scraps."`
`"......I wonder if they'll ask for some hush money in exchange for staying out of the inheritance issue."`
`"If that were the case, they would have written it into the letter already."`
`"And the letter is just a challenge, telling us to solve the epitaph or have everything taken from us."`
`"The culprit is tryin' to make us solve the epitaph's riddle!`
` Nothin' more, nothin' less."`
`"So, it's simple.`
` If we let this letter scare us, we lose."`
`"Yes, I agree.`
` ......After that big mysterious show, like something out of a mystery novel, we've all gotten carried away.`
` ......Hahahaha.`
` It shows how tense we all are."`
`"But who did it?`
` ......Such an aggravating thing to do."`
`"If it wasn't a servant, then one of us must have written it.`
` I'm not naming names, of course."`
`"St‐stop it.`
` I really know nothing about this...!"`
`"Settle down.`
` Anyway, what this letter says does make a bit of sense.`
` ......All of us need money.`
` And, if possible, we need it right away.`
` No one here has any objections to that, right...?"`
`"......Of course not.`
` Who'd object to money or love?"`
`"We don't know when Father's inheritance will come to us.`
` ......However, the gold of the epitaph is different.`
` If we find it, we could just split it then and there."`
`"In a sense,`
` it's even closer to us now than the inheritance is."`
`"Assuming we can solve the epitaph......"`
`"......Everyone here has made their own attempt at the riddle, yes?"`
`Kyrie asked the room at large, and everyone wordlessly nodded back.`
`"We have a whole four people here who inherit the blood of the one who made that riddle, yet we're all tackling it individually.`
` That doesn't sound very efficient, does it?"`
`"......True.`
` We've all been greedy and tried to go it alone.`
` ......However.`
` We've already reached a decision about how we'll split the gold up if it's found.`
` And about acknowledging Aniki as the successor."`
`"Though you demanded quite a lot in exchange."`
`".........I wonder if we can solve that epitaph...if we pool our efforts and work together..."`
`"Two heads are better than one.`
` And here, we have seven."`
`"Today, we reached a general agreement about the inheritance problem.`
` ......Why not take a shot at the epitaph for a bit of fun on the side?"`
`"Nice idea.`
` Let's give it a try and call it a break."`
`"......Ridiculous.`
` There is no......"`
`"Take it easy.`
` Just think of it as a game.`
` Let's have Gohda‐san bring us something cool to drink.`
` We can take a break and all play with riddles as a big, happy bunch of siblings for once."`
`"Hmmm.`
` Well, the night is long.`
` It would be, at least, more productive than pointless inquiries regarding Father's health."`
`"I'll ring up Gohda‐san.`
` He can bring us something."`
`"Some tea, snacks, and...`
`......oh, could you also ask him for a map of Taiwan?"`
`Two figures could be seen in the rose garden arbor.`
`{n}......It was George and Shannon's secret meeting.`
`"I want you to take this ring."`
`"G‐......George‐sama......"`
`"I swear to love you all my life.`
` ......Not just while we're young.`
` I swear to love you and keep you happy until we grow old and go to our graves."`
`"......Are there any lies in your words?"`
`"Nope, none.`
` I'm confident in my resolve to love you and build a happy household together with you."`
`"And what would this happy household be like?"`
`"Well,`
` it will be full of happiness.`
` We'll have a house, with a car and a garden.`
` And one dog.`
` The garden will be a vegetable garden.`
` The kids will run around, and we'll smile down on them from the balcony.`
` That's what our typical future Sunday will look like."`
`"That...would be wonderful......"`
`"Whaaaa?!!`
` Those two are {i:a couple}?!"`
`"Shhh!`
` Why are you so damn loud?!`
` Maria'll wake up...!"`
`"Oh, r‐right.`
` So that's how it is, huh...`
` Now that you mention it, they seemed to have a pretty good mood going on there.`
` ......That's right, we're all about the age where you fall in love."`
`"We've changed a lot in the last six years.`
` George nii‐san used to be a bit unreliable, but he isn't anymore."`
`"That's what I thought.`
` George‐aniki's got one of those "air of dignity" things around him."`
`......But still, Shannon‐chan and George‐aniki.`
` That's a bit unexpected.`
`They played together often enough six years ago, but I didn't think they were that close.`
`"......Well, six years is a long time."`
`"The last six years have been huge for all of us."`
`"Yep.`
` ......Honestly, so much happened to me over the past six years that I pretty much forgot about Rokkenjima."`
`"Yeah, and I almost totally forgot about you as well."`
`"Now that really hurts, ihihi~!"`
`Talking together like this, it felt as though we'd been transported six years into the past.`
`Those six years were so long that I forgot almost everything.`
`{n}And yet......it's coming back to me, bit by bit.`
`.........Shannon‐chan...`
`Six years ago, you were part of our group, and we played together a lot, didn't we...`
`Back then, I think I might've......liked Shannon‐chan.`
`That was the age when we were all overly self‐conscious, in love with love.`
`I recalled bittersweet memories of jokes involving melodramatic, flippant words.`
`"......That takes me back.`
` I think I remember saying all kinds of stuff that I'd be way too embarrassed to say now.`
` Gyaaah, just remembering it is making my face go red!"`
`"Hihihi.`
` Shannon might be a scatterbrain, but her memory's incredible.`
` Guess I'll just have to ask her all about your dark, embarrassing history."`
`"Qu‐quit it.`
` That was six years ago, so give me a break...!"`
`......I see...`
` So, Shannon‐chan is going out with George‐aniki...`
`..............................`
`What am I thinking?`
` Could this be...jealousy?`
`I didn't really think about it until now, ...but that thing Shannon‐chan and I had back then...... That was probably my first love.`
`Well, it's not like I have any right to be jealous, after forgetting the whole thing until we met again.`
`"Everyone knows that Dad's old home was Taishou in Taiwan."`
`"Father still chews areca nuts from time to time in memory of Taiwan.`
` Apparently, he got hooked on that instead of smoking when he was young."`
`"......But there must have been countless rivers there with sweetfish swimming in them."`
`"There's an endless number of streams that are famous sweetfish fishing spots.`
` ......You could probably have found sweetfish living in every body of clear water.`
` We're completely stuck."`
`"Could it be some nearby creek that Father used to play in as a kid?`
` He said sweetfish, but maybe we're looking for somethin' more like carp."`
`"......Or, it could be some sort of metaphor.`
` The river isn't necessarily a river with water flowing through it."`
`"What do you mean by that...?"`
`"Well now......`
` ...Who knows?"`
`"Kyrie has a point there.`
` Isn't it a bit too early to be sure that Taiwan is this "home of old", or that this sweetfish river is a river with water flowing down it?"`
`"If we look at it that way, we're just stuck again.`
` The more you think about this puzzle, the harder it seems."`
`".........That's it.`
` This is just a silly puzzle.`
` ......Kyrie‐san is right.`
` We need to be flexible in our thinking..."`
`"If we're looking for a river near Taishou, .........that would have to be Tamsui River..."`
`"Are you even listening?!`
` We just said that it might not be the kind of river with water flowing down it!`
` Is there any proof that that river is a sweetfish river?!"`
`"Y‐you're right...... I, I'm sorry..."`
`"......Well, it probably did have sweetfish in it.`
` I mean, it's literally called Freshwater River.`
` Makes sense that a freshwater fish like sweetfish would be swimming in it."`
`"Sweetfish are freshwater fish.`
` So, a sweetfish river would be a freshwater river.`
` ......Is that how we get Tamsui River?`
` Hahahaha, quite the word game."`
`"Now that's an interesting theory.`
` ......Let's advance our reasoning a bit further.`
` As you travel down the river, you will see a village.`
` ......What's the name of the town at the mouth of Tamsui River?"`
`".........It says "Tamsui" here."`
`"I went sightseeing in Tamsui.`
` It was a calm and gentle harbor town.`
` Beautiful sunsets."`
`"In that village, did you find "the shore the two spoke of"?"`
`"......Not really.`
` It doesn't ring any bells."`
`"I guess the beloved home of old doesn't refer to Taiwan.`
` It might be Odawara after all."`
`"If we can't discount any possibilities, ......then we won't get anywhere.`
` We can't even get past the first line of the epitaph."`
`"Quiet, you're distracting me!`
` ......It has to be Taiwan.`
` Father wouldn't describe any other place as "beloved"!"`
`".........That is one thing we can agree upon.`
` To this very day, Taiwan is the homeland of Father's heart."`
`"It's probably best if we don't spend too much time on the first line.`
` I'm going to take a look at the other lines.`
` ......Just a quick peek, starting at the first twilight."`
`"......Me too.`
` I'll leave the sweetfish river to you, Aneki, and have a go at the second half."`
`"On the first twilight, sacrifice the six chosen by the key......`
` How mysterious."`
`"I, ......I've got it."`
`Eva suddenly muttered.`
`{n}All of the others spun around to look at her.`
`Eva flipped through the pages about Taiwan with incredible force,`
` then found the page she was looking for and slammed the book open so hard that it almost tore.`
`This whole time, they had been looking at pages with place names.`
`{n}As far as the overall mass of information went, those had seemed the most useful pages to start from.`
`However, the page that Eva opened to was very limited in the scope of its information.`
`It was.........a map of railway lines.`
`"......As you travel down it, ......you will see a village......a village.`
` .........!!`
` There it is, the village!"`
`"Wh‐......what are you talking about, Eva?`
` Explain yourself."`
`"Quiet!!`
` There's a shore too, and a mouth for "speak"...!`
` I'm not sure what it means by "the two", ......but there definitely is a village and a shore and a mouth...!!`
` This is it... This is definitely the village where the key to the gold sleeps...!!"`
`"C‐calm down...!`
` Explain it so we can understand too!"`
`"......The Tamsui Line?`
` ......I see.`
` So, the sweetfish river was actually a railway called the Tamsui Line?"`
`"Well, I doubt there are any sweetfish swimming there......"`
`"Look!!`
` If we follow the Tamsui Line down, there's a station that used to be known as Kirigan!`
` Look at the characters it's written with!!`
` There's a village ({p:0:里}), a mouth ({p:0:口}), and a shore ({p:0:岸})!!"`
`"Sh‐she's right...!`
` There's a village, mouth, and shore...!!"`
`".........As you travel down it, you will see a village.`
` ......True, that's the only station on the Tamsui Line that has the character for village in its name."`
`"I see, it's like a code pointing towards this station's name......"`
`"This has to be it! There's no doubt...!!`
` We just need to look a bit further, then we'll definitely find out what "the two speak of" means...!!`
` ......L‐look!!`
` This is it! This is it!"`
`"The town near the station is also called Kirigan but with a mouth in the second character.`
` ......That makes a total of two mouths in Kirigan.`
` Is that "the two speak"...?"`
`"I‐......incredible, Nee‐san.`
` This has to be it......"`
`"Does this mean that the key is hidden somewhere in this town of Kirigan...?"`
`"I wonder.`
` ......The whole riddle so far has been a word game.`
` If so, isn't it likely that the sleeping key is also a word game?"`
`"I agree.`
` On the first twilight, the key selects six sacrifices, right?`
` So, it's hard to imagine that it's actually something key‐shaped...!"`
`"......Whoo.`
` ......This is getting......damn interesting..."`
`"Sacrifice the six chosen by the key.`
` ......Let's think of a key that's somehow related to this!`
` And let's break down this name, "Kirigan"!`
` I'm absolutely sure that this is a word game!`
` It has to be...!!`
` Think, everyone!!"`
`"It's funny, isn't it?`
` ......If I were alone, this kind of rain would get me down, but it feels nice and cool when you're by my side."`
`"......It's about time for us to head back.`
` I'm keeping Kanon‐kun waiting."`
`"You're right.`
` And I've probably kept Jessica‐chan and Battler‐kun waiting."`
`"It brings back good memories.`
` Remember when the four of us used to play together?`
` ......It was a lot of fun back then too."`
`"To me, it's a lot more fun now.`
` Because I get you all to myself."`
`"*giggle*.`
` ......Oh, George‐sama."`
`They laughed at George's melodramatic line.`
` However, George's laugh seemed just slightly forced.`
`"......George‐sama?"`
`"Hm?`
` ......Oh, I'm sorry.`
` .........Well,`
` I guess I still have a bit of a complex about Battler‐kun."`
`"A complex......?"`
`"Like Uncle Rudolf, he's lively, interesting, and just full of energy.`
` He's a much more charming person than I am.`
` ......I can tell how much he outshines me when we're together."`
`"That's not true.`
` You're an accomplished and charming man.`
` You aren't inferior to Battler‐sama in any way."`
`".........Really?"`
`"Yes.`
` Really."`
`"The truth is,`
` ......when I heard that Battler‐kun would be coming back this year, ......I felt unhappy about it at first."`
`"Why...?"`
`".........Six years ago,`
` ......Battler‐kun was the one who was really close to you.`
` I wanted to get closer to you, but I just couldn't manage to get between the two of you.`
` ......You two just looked made for each other, and all I could do was watch on longingly."`
`"Is that how you remember it...?`
` I don't really think we were "made for each other"...... It was just Battler‐sama teasing me......"`
`"......You two were the perfect couple.`
` There's no doubt about it.`
` ......I was sure that you two were going out."`
`"That never happened.`
` You're thinking too much..."`
`".........I really am pathetic.`
` I was afraid that I'd hand you this ring today and you'd refuse."`
`"Why is that?`
` ......Why should I refuse your ring, George‐san?"`
`"Because...Battler‐kun came back.`
` I was afraid that, deep down, you might still like Battler‐kun...`
`...and that, now that he was here, you wouldn't have any use for me."`
`"............George‐san?`
` Please, look at this.`
` Do you see this silver glint on my ring finger?`
` What do you think it is?"`
`"......You're right.`
` Sorry.`
` What's got me so shaken, I wonder.`
` ......I'm probably feeling jealous at the fact that he's cooler than ever six years later.`
` ......How pathetic."`
`"No, it's okay.`
` Those feelings are a sign that your love for me is so strong, ......you don't want to give me up to anyone.`
` ......If you're worried about my feelings switching to Battler‐sama,`
` please love me so strongly that the thought never enters my mind.`
` ......Love me so much that I don't have time to think about any other man."`
`"I'm scared too.`
` I'm sure you'll meet many women in the future who have much more attractive qualities than I do.`
` Or, I might not meet your expectations, and you might tire of me.`
` It scares me to think that I might not be able to keep you to myself for the rest of our lives."`
`"There's no need for you to be scared of that.`
` I swear to uphold my love for you as long as I live."`
`"And I swore the same thing, but you stopped taking my word for it when Battler‐sama came back."`
`As Shannon giggled,`
` George finally realized that his own lack of confidence had hurt her...`
`"......I've won the heart of a wonderful man named Ushiromiya George‐san.`
` And he has sworn to love me all his life and given me a ring as a sign of this oath.`
` With this ring here on my ring finger, I'm going to be honest with you."`
`"Sure."`
`"Yes, as you said,`
` ......I did like Battler‐sama six years ago.`
` I think I probably liked him more than you."`
`"However,`
` that was six years ago.`
` Now, things are different.`
` In these six years, I've sorted out my feelings for Battler‐sama and put them in the past along with the memories.`
` Now, I exist only to love you."`
`Shannon spoke clearly and strongly...`
`George gave a single, uncertain laugh.`
` It was probably the same sort the George of six years ago had made.`
`Then, he straightened up his back and hugged Shannon without saying a word.`
` In that moment, he parted ways with the person he had been six years ago......`
`"I've got the ladder...!`
` Here we go!"`
`"<Quadrillion>.`
` ......This is the only place you'll find that number written on this island."`
`"One tenth of a "{ruby:kei:{p:0:京}}"...`
` Who'd have thought it?"`
`"If our idea is right, then the letters of that relief should be the mechanism."`
`"We just need to check.`
` Who's going up?"`
`"I'll go.`
` Hold that ladder steady, okay?"`
`"Be careful.`
` It is fairly high..."`
`Rudolf climbed up the propped up ladder.`
` Step by step, as the rain poured down on him...`
`"Look at the "Q".`
` See anything?`
` Does it look like there's anything to it?"`
`"Nnn......`
` There's a bit of play.`
` ......Hmm?`
` Crap......"`
`"What is it?!`
` Did something happen?!"`
`"............Heheh...`
` Bingo.`
` Take a look at this."`
`Rudolf tossed the "Q" down.`
`{n}It hit Krauss on the shoulder and landed in a puddle.`
`"This is......a key!"`
`"What does it mean?!`
` Rudolf‐kun!`
` Can you take out the other letters too?!"`
`"......Yeah, looks like it.`
` Guess our crazy theories were on the right track after all!`
` What's the next letter to take out?!"`
`"U‐ummm, "i"!`
` And then "l"!"`
`Following her instructions, Rudolf removed the six letters of the first twilight...`
`Now that they'd gotten this far, ......nothing stood in the way of them solving the riddle.`
`By trial and error, ......they finally reached the final stage.`
`"It says to gouge starting from the head, which must mean going from left to right."`
`"Rudolf‐san!`
` Starting from the left, turn the keys before taking them out!"`
`"Got it...!"`
`"Now we've massacred all of the letters.`
` So, none are left alive on the ninth twilight."`
`"So?!`
` Did something happen?"`
`"It felt like something clicked, but nothing's different.`
` Maybe a hidden door or something opened up somewhere."`
`"H‐hey!`
` Look at that!`
` It moved, I'm sure it did!!"`
`"...............?!`
` Everyone, look!`
` The lion statue's facing the other way...!"`
`"Wh‐what is going on?`
` Is there some secret inside the lion statue...?!"`
`"......That's not it.`
` It's probably telling us to look where the lion's pointing.`
` See?`
` Look that way."`
`"That lion's facing a different way too...!`
` What does it mean?!"`
`"It's guiding us, stupid!`
` We have to go in the direction the lions face...!"`
`Eva dashed ahead.`
`{n}The others all chased after her.`
`......The gold was right in front of them.`
`".........Now this is a surprise.`
` Who would have thought that a hidden stairway like this existed."`
`"It makes sense now.`
` Father didn't like people going near the chapel..."`
`"......I wonder how long that mechanism has been there.`
` Judging by the feel of this underground passage, probably for quite a long time..."`
`"I imagine it was nearly the same time that the mansion itself was built.`
` ......The riddle of the epitaph was probably also planned many decades ago."`
`"Well, this is Dad we're talking about.`
` ......I try not to let the things he does surprise me, but this..."`
`"Just how far does this stairway go......?"`
`"Hey, maybe that old rumor was true.`
` ......You know, the story about him having a mistress in a hidden mansion somewhere in the forest."`
`"I see.`
` It's likely that this underground passage goes all the way there."`
`".........I wonder if it connects to the mansion from that day......"`
`"I think we've found the goal.`
` ......Look at that filthy door.`
` Something's written on it."`
`"......Whoo.`
` This is it."`
`Something was written on the door in red paint.`
`On the tenth twilight, the journey ends, and you shall reach the Home of the Gold......`
`"Does it open......?"`
`"It does.`
` ......Ready?`
` I'm going to open it."`
`"Have we finally reached the gold......?"`
`"It sounds too good to be true, ......but I'm wishin' it is."`
`"Let's open it, Nee‐san."`
`"Right.`
` Here goes."`
`The heavy door......opened slowly......`
`Then, the gold‐filled, underground VIP room showed itself......`
`They only had an instant to admire the splendid furnishings of the underground VIP room.`
`As soon as the mountain of gold next to the canopy bed came into sight, they all froze, stunned.`
`After a second, the stunned silence faded and was replaced by cries of astonishment and wild joy......`
`"............Incredible!!`
` Haha, hah{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!"`
`"I, I can't believe it... It's 20 billion yen in gold...!!`
` It really...really exists!!"`
`"What a shining mountain.`
` It almost blinds the eyes......"`
`"Uhhahahahahahahaha!!`
` We did it! We did it!!`
` We win this game!!"`
`".........Y‐you mustn't touch it without permission!`
` This is Father's gold!!"`
`"Oh, really?!`
` Then why don't you call Father down here now!`
` Right away!!`
` Your little farce is long over!!"`
`"Natsuhi nee‐san.`
` Let's put an end to the obvious lies, shall we?`
` This mountain of gold is as real as can be!`
` Let's all be just as real with one another."`
`"Fortunately, we're all in a good mood and feeling very generous right now.`
` Just give it up already!"`
`"Nng......!"`
`A pile of gold this massive carries magical power within it.`
` That power draws out the most honest feelings within people.`
`The light from the chandelier glinted off the golden mountain, lighting them up with its golden gleam.`
`It was as though the gleam manipulated them.`
`For some time, they forgot their age,`
` and howled and laughed, running about and rolling around like a bunch of excited kindergartners at a park......`
`".........What is all this?`
` What's it supposed to mean?"`
`"The epitaph has been solved before the crime occurred.........and by all of the siblings together..."`
`"That hasn't happened in any of the games before now."`
`"......Supposedly, {f:5:Beatrice} decided not to commit the crime if the epitaph was solved..."`
`"Yeah, supposedly.`
` ......Hmph.`
` I wonder."`
`Ange snorted, ......but I believed.`
`......This is what Clair decided.`
`She entrusted everything to the roulette of fate, so she would obey the result.`
`She let the roulette decide her own fate specifically because "they" couldn't decide on their own.`
`So, she'll do what it says.`
` She'll follow her own rule.`
`She'll definitely keep her promise.`
`"It won't occur.`
` The crime."`
`"......Are you sure about that?"`
`"Yes.`
` ......Her roulette has already made its decision.`
` This is the end of her game."`
`"If it's the end, what happens next?`
` They all become happy rich people and leave the family conference unharmed?`
` My family comes back to me with a souvenir of an ingot that isn't made of chocolate?`
` And everything ends happily?`
` You think those witches would chain us to chairs to show us a naive dream like that?!"`
`".....................mgh..."`
`When she showed off the chain on her wrist with a clank, I was unable to counter her with confidence.`
`But I want to believe.`
`That Clair's game has now come to one of its possible conclusions, even if it is the least eventful.`
`......Perhaps, just once at the end, she wanted to show us a world where no crime occurs.`
`Having disappeared with no regrets,`
` perhaps she left us a parting gift in the form of a game where no crime occurs—in a sense, the most peaceful sort of game.`
`I would like to believe that.`
`......If only these heavy, cold chains weren't holding us in place in this theater.`
`"I‐is someone there?!?!"`
`Rosa's shrill cry brought the celebrating to an immediate stop.`
`Rosa knew she'd seen it.`
`The curtain against the wall had fluttered, and the shape of a person had been there behind it.`
`"......None of that, if you don't mind.`
` You're just imagining things......"`
`"Is someone there?!`
` If you are, come out...!"`
`When Eva yelled,`
` ......the curtain shook.`
`And then, ......a witch wearing a black dress appeared from the other side......`
`In an instant, everyone realized that the dress was the same as the one worn by the witch of the portrait,`
` ......and they realized one more thing.`
`This person......was the owner of this room.`
`".........Welcome to the room of the gold."`
`Her face and her voice were expressionless, blank.`
`The others all looked at each other, wondering who should respond.`
` Rudolf was the first to speak.`
`"......So, you are {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"Indeed."`
`"A‐and you're the one who gave Maria that letter...?!"`
`"Indeed."`
`"......Is Father behind this?"`
`"No.`
` This is my...game."`
`"If that's so, then we've won.`
` We've solved the epitaph's riddle and found the gold...!"`
`"We've accepted your challenge and won...!`
` That means this gold belongs to us, right?!"`
`"Indeed, it is as you say.`
` ......You have solved the epitaph splendidly and discovered the hidden gold.`
` This game ends in your victory.`
` ......This gold no longer belongs to me, but to all of you......"`
`".........It seems you're graceful in defeat."`
`"Hey, you.`
` ......If we hadn't solved the epitaph's riddle, what were you planning to do?"`
`"The letter said that you'd take "everything of the Ushiromiya family"."`
`"Yes.`
` I planned to take all of your wealth...and all of your lives.`
` ......I planned to do as I pleased with everything that exists on this island."`
`......The witch walked towards the table next to the bed.`
`Then, for the first time, the others realized what sat on that table.`
`They were...four rifles.`
` There was also a case filled with bullets......`
`The witch picked up one of the lead bullets lying on the table and played with it, her face still expressionless, as she spoke.`
`"If...`
`the night had ended before you managed to solve the epitaph's riddle,`
` ......I planned to follow its instructions and commit thirteen murders."`
`"Wh‐......what did you say......?"`
`"......That's what I thought when I first saw that epitaph.`
` ......It almost looks like something you'd find in a serial murder mystery novel.`
` ......That's right.`
` If you had killed thirteen people to match the epitaph, ......that would have made for quite a mysterious crime..."`
`"Th‐there's no way you could do that all by yourself...!`
` No matter how many guns you have, killing thirteen people...that would just be...!!"`
`"......My planning was meticulous and involved many different alternatives.`
` I envisioned all of the actions you might take from tonight and through tomorrow...and prepared a mystery to deal with each of those.`
` .........I'm afraid I can no longer reveal them, but I had quite the number of intricate and entertaining locked‐room murders prepared."`
`"You could probably have gunned a few of us down in our sleep.`
` But there's no way you'd have been able to kill thirteen of us...!`
` We aren't that stupid."`
`".........It would seem so.`
` I will admit that the epitaph being solved before the first twilight was the result I considered the most unlikely."`
`"So, you never accounted for us reaching this place."`
`"That is not so.`
` .........Even this was one of the results of the roulette I wished to create.`
` And it is most likely the best outcome for all of you.`
` No one will die, and you can leave this island with the gold.`
` ......Congratulations.`
` This game ends with a perfect victory for you all."`
`If no one could solve the riddle, she planned to take those guns and commit a serial murder.`
` Everyone gulped as they watched the witch emotionlessly make her confession...`
`"......If your confession is the truth,`
` that means you were trying to kill us."`
`"Yes.`
` That is true."`
`"The hell......`
` I can't believe you can just admit to that."`
`"You can't possibly expect us to treat you favorably now that you've revealed that to us..."`
`"I am prepared.`
` .........You may do as you will with me.`
` ......If you hadn't solved the epitaph, I would have done the same to you, so it is only fair."`
`"......This girl's got guts."`
`"I planned this game because I was prepared to bet my life.`
` I am satisfied with the result.`
` ......If you wish to kill me now, I am prepared."`
`She no longer even treasured her life.`
`The witch walked towards the others as she spoke, and they automatically stepped back...`
`"The gold belongs to all of you.`
` I planned to give everything to the one who discovered it first, but I didn't expect there to be seven of you.`
` ......I leave the decision of how to split the gold to the seven of you.`
` I will not involve myself.`
` ......And..."`
`The witch walked even closer.`
`She walked through the middle of the group up to the antique clock behind them.`
`The clock was large and had a dignified feel to it.`
` The witch patted it and spoke.`
`"......Allow me to explain the device within this clock.`
` For you have gained not just the gold,`
` but the entirety of this island."`
`"What.........do you mean by that?"`
`".....................`
` If you interpret the epitaph as a series of murders, then yes, there are only thirteen people killed on the first eight twilights.`
` ......But on the ninth twilight,`
` ......it says clearly that none shall be left alive."`
`"What does that mean?`
` ......In other words, she was planning to massacre all of us?"`
`".........Don't tell me, that clock......"`
`"As you have guessed,`
` ......it is connected to a set of explosives."`
`"Are you the one who set that up?`
` ......Or was that Ushiromiya Kinzo?"`
`"Ushiromiya Kinzo is the one who set up the device.`
` This device is the source of his mad magical power......"`
`"......I, I don't have a clue what you're talking about."`
`"In other words,`
` ......Dad set up this bomb,`
` and if he ever went broke, he was prepared to die in a blast that would wipe away everything including himself......?"`
`"On this island, Ushiromiya Kinzo made a contract with the Golden Witch and obtained the gold.`
` However, that was not all he gained."`
`".........Wh‐what are you talking about...?"`
`"Wait, ......don't tell me......`
` ........................"`
`"There is that rumor about the remains of an old Japanese military base existing on Rokkenjima...`
` Could it be......"`
`"Your guess is correct.`
` ......Beneath this island sleep the remains of an underground Japanese military base from the time of the war.`
` Along with nine hundred tons of explosives."`
`"Ni‐......nine hundred tons?!`
` Th‐that's unbelievable!`
` If that exploded, the result would be unimaginable!`
` Forget just the mansion blowing up, it'd leave a massive crater!!"`
`"I believe an expert's estimate measured it as a hole several dozen meters deep and a kilometer across."`
`"...............There wouldn't be.........even a trace left......"`
`"There is a special mechanism that controls the detonation of these explosives.`
` ......This switch I just flipped arms the mechanism."`
`The witch toyed with a switch on the top of the antique clock.`
`"......If midnight arrives while the switch is in this position, the explosives will detonate."`
`"B‐but it's almost midnight now......"`
`"In other words, it's not a time bomb that explodes a certain number of hours after you activate it.`
` ......It's one that only explodes at the stroke of midnight."`
`"Indeed.`
` .........It is almost midnight now.`
` If an explosion is what you desire, you can just leave it like this."`
`"Who would want that...?!!`
` Turn it off!"`
`By this time, Kinzo was probably the only one who knew.`
`The secret base on Rokkenjima had started out as a submarine base.`
`However, when that plan reached a standstill, it was redefined as a top secret base for homeland defense.`
`A huge plan had been drawn up to have the army and navy perform a pincer attack on American forces if the latter decided to land on Kujuukuri Beach and press towards Tokyo.`
`As a trump card for this massive defensive maneuver, the navy started stockpiling large quantities of explosives and fuel in absolute secrecy.`
`And the Rokkenjima base was the location those were stockpiled at.`
`The total weight of the buried explosives was nine hundred tons.`
`Also, fearing that the Americans might find out the island's secrets and seize the explosives,`
` they set up a system for the self‐destruction of the entire island......`
`Kinzo, who knew about all of this, decided not only to keep this self‐destruct system active, but to connect it up to this strange clock that could cause the explosion any night at midnight.`
`......Kinzo is famous for building up his funds using a vast store of gold,`
` and then using those funds in several sink‐or‐swim gambles, one after another.`
`Just what did his stockpile of gold......and the nine hundred tons of sleeping explosives mean to him?`
`At this point, we can only speculate.`
` Perhaps the true source of Kinzo's mad power......wasn't the gold after all.`
`Perhaps it was this device, with which he could erase himself and this entire island from existence if he lost a big gamble and all that he owned.`
`He must have been putting the gold and everything else he had on the line at every point in his life......`
`Kinzo had probably looked at this clock at times, ......maybe flipping the activation switch and letting the clock tick down.`
`Whenever things got tough and he got stuck, maybe he would hide in here and flip the switch......`
`He might have made it a rule for himself that he would blow everything away if he couldn't think of a brilliant plan before midnight came.`
`He would gaze at the mountain of gold, listening to the clock tick towards his death as he searched for an idea......`
`Perhaps Ushiromiya Kinzo's real study wasn't the one in the mansion,`
` but this place instead......`
`"......This whole setup sounds just like Dad.`
` ......So, maybe each time Dad worried about something, all of us kids were put on the line as well..."`
`"For our Father, ......it wouldn't be unthinkable......"`
`"This device now belongs to all of you.`
` ......If you want a massive explosion, use it whenever you please."`
`"A‐are you crazy...?!`
` Who'd want a big explosion...?!!"`
`"......These explosives are half a century old, right?`
` Would they really go off?"`
`"Yes, of course.`
` The explosives and the fuses are still working.`
` ......I tested them myself."`
`"You tested them......?"`
`".........Could it be......that?"`
`"Yes, now I finally understand.`
` So that's why the shrine disappeared without a trace..."`
`This summer, the shrine had disappeared without a trace, along with the reef under it.`
`It felt strange that the waves could have destroyed it without a trace like that, but no one had paid it much mind.`
`And now, this piece perfectly fit into the hole left by that strange feeling......`
`"Indeed.`
` .........I used that shrine to test whether the explosives were still working after half a century.`
` I believe you are all aware of the result."`
`"......................................."`
`"The little bit I used was enough to make that entire reef vanish.`
` As I'm sure you can imagine, nine hundred tons of that would cause an explosion large enough to rewrite the map..."`
`"......If an explosion like that happened, all of us would most certainly die.`
` But what would you have done?`
` I somehow doubt that you intended on going down with the rest of us..."`
`"This underground VIP room is connected to an underground passage from the remnants of the military base.`
` If you go straight along that, you'll come out at the hidden mansion on the opposite side of the island, Kuwadorian.`
` It's about two kilometers away.`
` If you make it all the way there, it should be possible to escape the blast."`
`"......I see.`
` So, you planned to escape to there just before the blast."`
`"I have only said that such a thing is possible.`
` ......You may not believe this, but if the ninth twilight had ended before any of you could solve the riddle,`
` ......I planned to die along with everything else."`
`"............There's something seriously wrong with this girl..."`
`"She's insane...`
` There's no point thinking about it!`
` If we hadn't solved the epitaph, she would have used those guns,`
` or else that switch,`
` to massacre all of us!`
` There's no doubt in my mind!!"`
`"You are correct.`
` ......You have ended this game in the best possible way, without there being even a single victim.`
` ......I wish to convey my respect and admiration.`
` Though it was a seven‐person effort, it took you only a single night to solve the riddle that took me a very long time to solve.`
` .........That is worthy of praise."`
`"I also admire you for your graciousness and honesty in defeat.`
` .........We haven't decided how you will be dealt with, but I hope to do all I can to reach a gentlemanly agreement."`
`".........Do not concern yourself with me any longer.`
` As someone who was already prepared to kill you all and die in the process, I am already one of the dead."`
`The Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice} solved the epitaph, reached this room, and revived.`
`And now.`
` ......New people had solved the riddle and reached this room, ......so her role was finished.`
`When the epitaph's riddle was solved, ......{f:5:Beatrice}'s witch illusion ended.`
`Most likely, no one in this room would have been capable of understanding her tragic resolve.`
`......She herself was probably the only one who could.`
`As long as the many selves inside of her understood, that was enough.`
`.........I am one yet many.`
`I entrusted myself to the magical roulette of endless possibilities.`
`{n}The result, the answer, is this.`
`{n}This is what the tarot cards known as the ritual of the epitaph have shown me.`
`......{f:5:Beatrice} is now dead.`
`They did not kill her.`
`{n}I killed her myself......in accordance with fate's command.`
`{n}They will never understand, .........for all eternity.`
`...........................`
`The witch stared up at the ceiling without speaking for a while, then looked as though she'd suddenly remembered something.`
`She grabbed at the sleeves of her dress and took out some sort of card.`
`"Oh, yes.`
` I forgot.`
` .........I have no need for money after death.`
` I will give this to all of you as well."`
`"......A cash card?"`
`"I have converted a portion of the gold to cash.`
` This is for the account that the money is in."`
`"I see.`
` So this is the magical energy of the Golden Witch."`
`"How much is in the account?"`
`"I've forgotten the exact figure.`
` However, there is more than a billion yen."`
`"A billion...!`
` ......Now that really is magic!"`
`"True.`
` There's nothing you couldn't do with that much money."`
`"Very true.`
` The strongest magic to counter the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s' anti‐magic toxin is this magic of gold.`
` ......It may be that this card holds greater power than the ingots."`
`"Certainly.`
` Cash would be much more agreeable than ingots."`
`"Here you go.`
` .........I have no need of this anymore."`
`The card she held out......was not taken by any of them.`
`Who would ever just hand over a card with a billion yen in it?`
`The mountain of gold, the device for blowing up the island, the card with a billion yen...`
` ......All of these surpassed their understanding.`
`So, ......no one could bring themselves to take it.`
`"......I don't like it."`
`".........What don't you like?"`
`"Here you go, here's a mountain of gold.`
` And I'll turn off the explosives and give you a card worth a billion yen while we're at it.`
` .........It sounds far too good to be true.`
` ......You're trying to trick us somehow, aren't you?"`
`"I have no desire to trick you, but I won't try to force you to believe.`
` ......I have offered you everything, revealed everything.`
` What you believe and what you do is now for you, the new masters of the gold, to decide.`
` You are even free to disbelieve all I say and leave this place."`
`"Eva.`
` I can't imagine that she's lying."`
`"And how could you know that?!`
` I don't like how relaxed she's acting!`
` It's as though she thinks she's already won!`
` ......I just had an idea, a second ago!!`
` What if she's lying about which is the "off" side of the switch?!"`
`"Wh‐what do you mean, Nee‐san...?"`
`"Just a second ago, this woman flipped the switch, saying she'd turn off the bomb!`
` But what if that actually armed the bomb?!`
` We solved the riddle, so you turned the bomb's switch to "on", trying to blow us and everything else up, right?!"`
`"........................`
` ......If that is what you think, then please feel free to flip the switch on this clock.`
` It will be midnight in one minute.`
` ......The clock will show you the truth."`
`"Wh‐......what did you say............?"`
`"H‐hey, what're we supposed to do...?`
` Is the bomb set to "on" now?`
` Or "off"?!"`
`"I don't think she could be lying...!`
` It's inactive now.`
` We shouldn't flip it...!"`
`"But I don't like it!!`
` Why is she so resigned to her fate?!`
` Why's she offering us things one after another?!`
` She's tricking us to buy time!!`
` She wants to buy time until midnight so that she can go down in flames along with us!!"`
`"...................................."`
`"Wh‐what about the switch itself?`
` Is there some way to tell if it's on or off...?"`
`On the upper part of the antique clock was a metal switch that could slide right or left.`
`Currently, it was set to the left.`
`However, there were no marks in particular on either side to indicate which side was "off" and which was "on".`
`"Hey, tell us the truth!!`
` Which way is off?!"`
`".........Left.`
` It's off now."`
`"Rudolf, you idiot!`
` You really expect an honest answer from her?!`
` It's the opposite... It has to be!!`
` The right side has to be "off"!!"`
`"W‐we don't have any more time, Nee‐san...!!"`
`"Stop it, Eva!!`
` Don't touch the switch!`
` It's already off!!"`
`"Eva‐san, take your hand off it!!"`
`"I agree.`
` It's "off" now.`
` If she wanted to kill us with a bomb, she wouldn't have told us about it."`
`"...............!!!`
` B‐......{f:5:Beatriceeeeeee}...!!`
` Don't think you can trick me......!!!"`
`"....................................`
` ...Five,`
` ......four, ......three..."`
`"Nng, aah....aaaaaaaaaarrrrgggghh!!!"`
`The second hand of the clock......ticked past midnight.`
`October 4th ended, ......and the curtain rose on October 5th, 1986......`
`The switch was still pointing to the left.`
`{n}......The witch's words had been proven correct.`
`"............Have I gained your trust now...?"`
`"Y‐...............you bitch!"`
`With a hideous, sweat‐covered expression, Eva snatched the cash card away from the witch's hand.`
`"......How about a bankbook and seal?`
` We can't withdraw anything with just a card!"`
`"All you need is the PIN.`
` It's eight digits long."`
`"W‐wait a second!!`
` I'm writing it down...!!"`
`Eva and Kyrie both took out a pen and notepad and began writing the eight‐digit number the witch told them.`
`".........That is everything I have to tell you and give you.`
` ......I will say nothing more.`
` All of my tasks have been completed."`
`After saying this, the witch spun around......and sat down on the bed.`
`She wasn't even looking at the others anymore.`
`She sat there like an empty husk which had, just as she had said, finished everything it existed to do......`
`For a while, everyone watched the witch to see if she would remember something else and start talking.`
`However, she said nothing further.`
`The witch who had called herself one of the dead was now little more than a large French doll wearing a black dress......`
`Gold is the only physical embodiment of magic that can appear in the human world.`
`{n}Since ancient times, even a small fragment of it could control men with its magic.`
`In that case, how much magic power would dwell in it...`
`if it was piled up in a mountain so high you'd have to look up to see the top?`
`"Don't be stupid, we'll split it evenly!`
` Isn't that the obvious solution?!"`
`"Didn't we say that half of this pile would belong to me, and the other half would be split between the four of us?!"`
`The yells of the people dancing around the gold reverberated throughout the underground room...`
`{n}In front of the pile of gold, they were arguing about how it should be split.`
`"Could you have solved the riddle all by yourself, Nii‐san?`
` You couldn't have, could you?!`
` The four of us siblings solved it together!`
` Of course we'll split it in four equal parts!!"`
`"Coward!`
` Weren't you the ones who first made that proposal about the gold's distribution?!!`
` How can you disregard that so easily...?!!"`
`"You really think you're in a position to bargain?`
` When you're the ones hiding Dad's death...?!!"`
`"Th‐that's right, that's right...!!`
` You've been swindling us this whole time, treating Father's wealth as if it were your own...!"`
`"All you need to do is split the gold evenly, and we'll drop all the rest.`
` It sounds very fair to me."`
`"Well, if you're going to say that, let's just try splitting it four ways.`
` Feel free to split this pile in four and carry your own shares home."`
`"I hope you have pockets that can hold 2.5 tons of ingots...!`
` It seems you've all been driven mad by the gold and lost all ability to make rational judgments."`
`"What do you mean by that, Krauss nii‐san?"`
`"Look at this ingot.`
` As you can see, there are no official markings, just Father's crest.`
` ......How do you intend to turn unmarked gold into cash?"`
`"Nnn, .........well......"`
`"Have you finally figured it out?`
` This pile of gold may well be worth 20 billion yen.`
` However, that's only if you can exchange it for cash.`
` Are any of you capable of liquidating this many unmarked, unknown ingots at the proper exchange rate without word of it getting out?!"`
`If it was a necklace or a ring, exchanging it for cash would have been a manageable problem.`
`However, to do that with several tons of unmarked gold that couldn't be made public...would be impossible for any normal person.`
`......However, Krauss could do it.`
`Among the several business associates who had been close to the family since Kinzo's generation, there were some who had black market ties and sufficient financial clout.`
`The billion yen tied to the cash card that the Golden Witch had handed out was also money that had been liquidated via one of Kinzo's connections......`
`However, none of the other siblings had any connections like that.`
`They would have to rely on Krauss to exchange the gold for cash.`
`"Now you're finally seeing it.`
` I apologize for hiding all of those things about Father.`
` However, your position is not so strong that you can use them as leverage against me."`
`"......Y‐you really think that little thing gives you the advantage?!?!"`
`"What do you intend to do with that gun?`
` Please, put that vicious thing away."`
`Eva was gripping the gun so hard it looked like it might snap.`
`......The four guns that the witch had placed in this room were now in the hands of the relatives.`
`Just as the gold had led their hearts astray,`
` it seemed these guns had the magical power to turn their hearts to violence......`
`Finally, a scuffle arose between Eva and Krauss.`
`Off to the side, Natsuhi started arguing with Rudolf and his wife, and the grand underground VIP room filled with a cacophony of angry outbursts......`
`"...................................."`
`Ange's face was starting to contort with pain after being forced to watch this scene for so long.`
`It was only natural, after being shown this abusive argument between her parents and her other relatives.`
`"......What on Earth........."`
`It was painful for Lion too.`
`{n}Lion would have tried to intervene and calm them, if that had been possible.`
`The gold wouldn't go anywhere.`
` If they just took their time and thought about it calmly, they would be able to resolve this.`
`Eva and the others had argued that they needed a lot of money before the end of the year, which was understandable.`
`However, the billion yen cash card would be more than enough to pay for that.`
`With their emergency expenses taken care of, they could liquidate the gold at their leisure, then just split it amongst themselves.`
`Sure, maybe Krauss was the only one capable of converting the gold.`
` That might give him an advantage over the other siblings.`
`However, this gold couldn't be dealt with by open means.`
` In addition to attracting public attention, it would also lead to various legal problems.`
`It was better for this secret money to remain secret.`
`If they wanted to get the largest portions possible, then they should all agree not to tell anyone about this gold.`
`In other words, to maximize their profits, they needed a gentleman's agreement that all of them would keep the secret.`
`Krauss did have a slight advantage.`
` However, it was possible for the other relatives to refuse to cooperate and tell the world about the gold.`
`And then, ......there was also the concealment of Kinzo's death to consider.`
`Krauss was an investor.`
` He needed not only financial clout, but also a certain degree of public confidence.`
`His advantage wasn't big enough for him to act so overbearing.`
`"......The mountain of gold......has made everyone lose their ability to think rationally.`
` ......This isn't an argument between adults.`
` ......It's just a fight between kids."`
`"What's so fun about showing this to us......?`
` Or is this the game of some new witch...?`
` Are they watching us suffer from somewhere and laughing?!"`
`"......................................."`
`By now, ......even I didn't have a clue who was showing us this, or for what reason.`
`At the very least, it doesn't look as though this new tale is overflowing with affection.`
`......At first, I thought it was a tale of a beautiful world where no crime occurred, since Clair had gotten past all of her regrets.`
`But something's different.`
`This tale is clearly filled with ill will towards us.`
`I'm sure of that much now, ......but I don't have a clue who would want to show us this.`
`Suddenly, a loud explosion rang out.`
`......It didn't feel like the sound of gunfire.`
`After all, ......most people living a normal life never hear that sound.`
`Drip, drip drip drip.`
`{n}The sound of thick raindrops hitting the floor.`
`......There was no rain in this underground room.`
`......It was the sound of blood dripping down......from Natsuhi's right eye.`
`The bullet had gone in through her right eye...towards the back of her head......`
`"N‐.........Natsuhi.........?"`
`"...I‐it's your fault...for jumping at me......"`
`The gun......which fell from Eva's grasp......landed on the floor with a hard metallic clang.`
`As though in response to that sound, Natsuhi's head slowly turned to face the ceiling...`
`"......Na‐.........Natsuhi......`
` ......Natsuhiiiiiiiiiiiii!!!"`
`Natsuhi flopped backwards.`
`When the back of her head hit the floor, a red splash spread out beneath it, ......forming a single flower to adorn her dead face...`
`"Natsuhi......nee‐san......"`
`"Wh‐why did you shoot her?!`
` Why did you shoot her, Eva?! Evaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aa!!"`
`Krauss howled, raised his gun, and ran at Eva.`
`At the same time, Hideyoshi leapt between them.`
` A scuffle broke out between the two men.`
`"You killed Natsuhi, you killed Natsuhiii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}iii, nngaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaahhh!!"`
`"K‐Krauss nii‐san, you've got it wrong... You've got it all wrong... It was...just an accident......!!"`
`"Evaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aaa, how could you?!!`
` I'll kill you! I'll kill yoo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}ou!!"`
`"I, .........I didn't shoot her... I didn't...`
` I, ......I told her to stop, and she just jumped at me, and...!!"`
`Krauss, who had just seen his wife killed before his eyes, had lost all traces of rationality in his expression.`
`He was so furious that, if he had knocked Hideyoshi aside and jumped at Eva, he might have torn her throat out.`
`"Why did you kill her?! Why did you kill her?!`
` Evaaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aa!!"`
`"It was an accident, ...an accident...!!`
` Calm down, Krauss nii‐san...!!`
` ......Ow{0}ow{0}ow{0}ow{0}ow{0}ow, .........nngg{0}g{0}g{0}g{0}g{0}g{0}g{0}gghhhh......"`
`Another explosion rang out.`
`{n}Hideyoshi's face was covered with blood.`
`The two of them had been fighting over the gun Krauss held, trying to push it away from themselves.`
`When the barrel had turned to point at Krauss's chin, .........the sneering, formless reaper, master of the room of gold, had swung its scythe once more.`
`A line of blood......trickled from Krauss's mouth.`
`"U‐......uwa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahh, ...hyaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhh...!!"`
`The two fell down, with Krauss's body on top of Hideyoshi.`
`Letting out a cowardly cry, Hideyoshi backed away before Krauss's body could cover him...`
`"H‐......honey...!!"`
`"I didn't do anythin'!!`
` Krauss nii‐san's finger just got caught on the trigger...!`
` It's an accident, an accident I tell you...!!"`
`"Th‐that's right, an accident...... This was all an accident......!!"`
`As the pair of them broke down sobbing and repeatedly claiming that it was all an accident, Rosa and the others were unable to say a thing......`
`The witch also watched this scene, but said nothing, and appeared to be completely disinterested.`
`"I‐......it wasn't our fault...!`
` It's just an accident, an accident...!`
` You saw, right?! Right? Right?!"`
`"You saw that, didn't you, Rosa?!`
` Krauss nii‐san and Natsuhi nee‐san both let their emotions get ahold of them and charged at us...!"`
`"............Well,`
` I can't say I'm sure."`
`"Stupid Rosa!!`
` You saw, didn't you?!`
` You saw it from right there, so you must know!!"`
`"I'm sorry.`
` I can't tell if it happened by accident...or if you killed them and tried to make it look like an accident."`
`"R‐Rosa, you......!!!"`
`"Rudolf‐kun...!`
` You saw!`
` You know what happened, right?!`
` Right?!"`
`"........................`
` ......Sorry, but I agree with Rosa.`
` We can't tell if it was an accident or intentional."`
`Rosa's and Rudolf's gazes looked very cold and indifferent to Eva and her husband.`
`"What are we going to do? They were shot to death...!`
` We can't just write this off as an accident...!!"`
`"Th‐the forest!`
` We'll say they went to the forest and went missing! Then we can buy some time...!"`
`"That won't get us off the hook, right?!`
` The police will just search the whole forest!!`
` And anyway, why would those two go off into an uncultivated forest like that?!`
` It'll look suspicious from the start!`
` There's no way we'll get away with it!!"`
`"It'll be okay...!`
` If we hide the corpses here, no one will be able to find them!`
` If we all play dumb, it'll work!"`
`"It won't......`
` There's no way you can fool the police.`
` If the two of them disappear during a family conference where we were arguing over the inheritance problem,`
` ......the police won't just put it down as a case of missing persons."`
`".....................`
` .........I, I just thought of something..."`
`Though Eva had been scratching at her head, overcome with emotion,`
` ......her arms suddenly fell as though their strings had been cut.`
`"Wh‐......what did you think of?"`
`"......An accident.`
` ......We just need to make it look like an accident."`
`"Don't talk stupid...!`
` What kind of accident...?!`
` There are clear gunshot wounds on both corpses!`
` Even if we burn them to make it look like they were caught in a fire, it'll still be obvious that they were killed by guns!!"`
`"......A fire?`
` That's not good enough.`
` ......We need more.`
` A much more massive accident."`
`"A, ......a massive accident......?"`
`Eva slowly walked forward, .........tapped on it, and spoke.`
`"An explosion accident.`
` ......We just need the sort of accident that will leave no traces of their corpses."`
`As she played with the switch that would cause an automatic explosion at midnight,`
` ......Eva spun around to face them, a crazed expression on her face...`
`It was truly...a mad inspiration.`
`If they flipped the switch to the right and waited for midnight, the nine hundred tons of explosives would wipe out the mansion without a trace.`
`There wouldn't even be remnants of the corpses.`
` There would be no way to tell that they had died by gunshot wounds before the explosion.`
`"It's an unshakable fact that this island is still filled with explosives from the war!`
` Then, by coincidence, tomorrow night...something will set it off by chance and the whole thing will explode!!`
` Yes, it'll be an accident!`
` An explosion accident!!`
` What do you say?!!`
` There's no way the police will find out the truth!!`
` This way, we can pull it off!!`
` We can hide the manner of their deaths!!"`
`"Ha......hahaha......how......ridiculous......"`
`Shaking, Hideyoshi frantically searched for a counterargument, hoping to repudiate Eva's mad idea.`
`.........But he couldn't find one.`
`If they blew everything up, the facts would all be muddled......`
`{n}They could make it look as though Krauss and Natsuhi had died in an explosion accident......!`
`"It's perfect, just perfect...!!!`
` After all, it was an accident that they died anyway!`
` We're just changing the type of accident!!`
` Isn't that right?`
` We can think up any story we want!!`
` By chance, the rest of us will happen to be in the hidden mansion tomorrow night!`
` Then, when the explosion accident occurs, we'll be lucky enough to survive!!`
` That story should work!!"`
`".........J‐just what sort of story are you planning on?`
` ......What kind of story could explain how the two of them alone remained here,`
` while the rest of us went to the hidden mansion and conveniently managed to escape...?!"`
`"That's what we've got to think up now, stupid Rosa!!!`
` It doesn't matter what it is, as long as we all agree to it!!`
` I'll think of something... I am thinking... You all think too!!`
` Someone think of somethii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}ing!!!"`
`"C‐calm down, Eva...`
` I'll think about it, and so will everyone else!`
` We'll definitely think of something, and it'll all work out!`
` We'll share the burden. You won't have to carry it all yourself...!!`
` It'll be okay... It will!!`
` I know we'll think of a good excuse!"`
`"......What kind of excuse?`
` We took the kids and all the servants to go exploring an underground passageway, leaving just the two of them behind,`
` and the rest of us all decided to spend the night in the hidden mansion?`
` How could any excuse work?`
` ......It's insane!"`
`"And thinking up that insane thing is our job!!`
` Why are you acting like this has nothing to do with you?!`
` You think of something too!!!"`
`".........Nee‐san.`
` Let me ask you a question.`
` ......If you blow up the island, what will happen to this gold?"`
`"Nnn, ......w‐.........well....................."`
`"We've finally gotten our hands on 20 billion yen of gold.`
` And you want to blow it all away...?"`
`"We can just carry it away, it's as simple as that!!`
` The explosion will happen tomorrow at midnight!`
` We have a full day!!`
` If we all carry it together, we might—"`
`"You realize there's ten tons of it, right?`
` ......We're a small group who can each shoulder a sack of rice in weight at best, and we only have a single day.`
` Just how much do you think we can carry back and forth across this long underground passage that goes all the way across the island?`
` You're being absurd."`
`"H‐here!!`
` We have this card!`
` The card worth a billion yen which that woman gave us!!`
` We can just carry whatever gold we can!`
` We have the card worth a billion yen on top of that!`
` If we split that three ways, we'll have more than 300 million each!`
` That should be enough for all of our purposes!!"`
`"No thanks."`
`"Wh‐......what.........?"`
`"There's a mountain worth 20 billion yen right here.`
` Why should I be satisfied with a measly 300 million?"`
`"R‐......Rosaaaaa......"`
`Eva's face twisted in anguish, ......and was met by Rosa's look of cold unconcern.`
`"......Even if we factor in Krauss nii‐san's share,`
` that gives us a rightful share of 5 billion yen each.`
` Subtract the 300 million from the card, and the rest of my share is 4.7 billion.`
` ......If you agree to pay that much to me, then you can do whatever you want with this mountain of gold."`
`"What do you think you're saying?!`
` So, you don't intend to cooperate?!"`
`"Nee‐san.`
` Please calm down and listen.`
` I'm going to suggest to you the way that both of us can leave with the most money."`
`"Wh‐what......?!?!"`
`"I want you to go to the police and turn yourself in, admitting that you got into a scuffle and the gun went off."`
`"A‐are you crazy?! I don't want to go to the police!!!"`
`"Of course, we don't want to say that the crime happened here.`
` The police would find the gold.`
` ......Yes, what about the rose garden?`
` It's pouring rain now, so the police probably won't find any contradictions in the crime scene."`
`"I'll let you think of an excuse for why you and Nii‐san started fighting while you were holding guns in the rainy rose garden.`
` ......Don't try to get us and our shares involved just because you want to hide your crime."`
`"R‐Rosaaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aaa!!!"`
`"It's not so bad, right?`
` It's not like they'll lock you up for decades.`
` It was an accident, right? You'll be able to get out after just a few years.`
` ......Once you've paid for your crime and gotten out, then you can do whatever you want with your 5 billion."`
`"No, absolutely no!!`
` What would happen if we were arrested?!`
` What would happen to my husband's company?!"`
`"Who cares about the company?`
` With 5 billion yen, working any longer would just be a waste of time, right?"`
`Rosa had never intended to go along with the idea Eva proposed.`
`As far as the size of each person's portion went, no one had anything to gain from an explosion accident.`
`By doing that, they could conceal Krauss and Natsuhi's deaths.`
` There was no other reason to do it.`
`From Rosa's perspective, the ideal outcome would be for them to confess to their crimes, without any unnecessary tricks.`
`All she wanted to do was to change the crime scene from here to a different place.`
`However, Eva didn't want to be arrested.`
`She didn't like having her share shrink from 5 billion to 300 million,`
` but even that was more than enough to cover the amount she had been trying to wring out of Krauss in the first place.`
`She wanted to hide what had happened here, even if it meant blowing away 4.7 billion yen.`
`What would happen if they were arrested?`
`The life, the company, and the trust that Eva and her husband had worked so long to build...... Those were things that couldn't be bought back with money.`
`So, she wanted to hide Krauss and Natsuhi's deaths, even if it meant blowing up all 4.7 billion yen worth of her gold...!`
`But from Rosa's perspective, that was just irrational nonsense.`
`"R‐Rosaaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aaa!!"`
`"What do you think you're doing with that gun, Nee‐san?`
` ......Are you going to "misfire" and kill me too?`
` That'll make finding an excuse even harder.`
` In fact, it'll also make it harder to explain away the other two deaths as accidents too..."`
`"If you end up linked to three deaths, that's a fairly huge crime.`
` .........They'll seek the death penalty, most likely.`
` And settle for a life sentence.`
` At the very least, you'll be put away for a good ten‐plus years."`
`"Give up and turn yourself in.`
` If you do, this'll be no more than a pair of unfortunate accidents.`
` Of course, your prison term won't be too terrible either.`
` ......Don't worry about George‐kun.`
` We'll take good care of him.`
` And we'll make sure that all 5 billion of your share will be waiting for you when you get back."`
`Eva ground her teeth and glared.`
`The Rosa she knew should have been shaking and obeying her commands.`
` And yet, ......Rosa wasn't scared.`
`Her blank expression—`
`no, that slight smile—was one that Eva had never seen before.`
`"Put the gun down, Nee‐san.`
` If you calm down, you'll see that my plan is the best one.`
` ......Prison isn't so bad, right?`
` Think of it as a financial strategy."`
`"Even if they put you in for ten years, there will be 5 billion waiting for you when you get out.`
` That's like working for a 500 million yen salary, right?`
` If you think of it that way, you might even enjoy your job."`
`"Liar!!!`
` You just want to make off with my share while I'm in there!!`
` Like your man did to you!!!"`
`"H‐he has nothing to do with this, okay?!?!`
` I'm not going to run off! I would never, ever run away with money!`
` ...I, .......I would never do thaaaaat!!!"`
`Rosa's once‐stony expression was filled with rage.`
`{n}The two howling people pointed their guns at each other, shouting insults at each other......`
`You could smell the gold room's reaper slinking closer.`
`The smell of gunpowder, the explosive smell of death, ......filled the room......`
`Blorp.`
`A bubble of blood dripped from Rosa's mouth.`
`Then, ......she fell over lifelessly, ......like a mannequin.`
`"......E‐......Eva......?!"`
`"I‐......i‐it wasn't me!`
` I swear I didn't even pull the trigger?!"`
`"............Eva nee‐san, you just shot Natsuhi‐san, so your gun wasn't loaded, right...?`
` You never reloaded, so even if you pull the trigger, that gun wouldn't kill anyone.`
` Have no fear."`
`As Kyrie said this, she maneuvered the lever action with a practiced hand, and a smoke‐smelling shell casing was ejected...`
`It hit the floor with a small, metallic sound.`
` That tiny sound had a disturbing ring to it...`
`"Rosa‐san's analysis was a little naive.`
` ......Converting this many unmarked gold ingots into usable money...`
` She has no idea how difficult that would be."`
`".........Dad just used it as show money to gain confidence, and even that was enough to create the rumor called the Legend of the Ushiromiya Gold.`
` ......It's impossible to liquidate it.`
` A pile of gold you can't use is no better than a pile of shit."`
`"Ten tons of gold exchanged on the black market. The successor and his wife dead in suspicious circumstances.`
` Expecting that not to attract attention is what's really impossible.`
` ......It's better not to get the police involved.`
` We'll blow up this island and destroy all the evidence.`
` If it's tough parting with the gold, feel free to grab a few ingots.`
` The billion yen on the cash card is more than enough.`
` ......In other words, Eva nee‐san, you're right."`
`"I, .........I'm glad......`
` ......It looks like we're on the same page......`
` ...I‐if the police get involved, who knows what might happen?`
` It's the same with cashing in the gold.`
` It'd just create more opportunities for word to get out somehow, it's more than we can handle...!!"`
`"The billion yen that woman over there exchanged for cash is the only money we can get our hands on!`
` And even splitting that billion, it'll be more than enough for what we need...!`
` On top of that, now that Rosa is dead, our shares have increased even more...!`
` We can each leave this island with 500 million...!"`
`"Exactly.`
` As long as we don't let our greedy desire to cash in the gold control us,`
` ......we can pretend that everything that occurred on this island never happened.`
` We have a way to do that right here."`
`There was no longer any reason to worry about accidental discharges or people being shot to death on this island.`
`Everything would be erased equally by the explosion accident.`
`No matter what happened between now and midnight the next day, everything would be rewritten by the explosion accident.`
`"......And you told me......to turn myself in?! Stupid Rosa...!`
` You weren't satisfied with a measly 300 million?`
` This is what you get for being too greedy......`
` Y‐...you got nothing more than you deserved......"`
`"But Kyrie‐san, ......there was no need to shoot her, right......?`
` Even Rosa‐san would've figured it out if you'd just told her......"`
`"I did need to shoot her.`
` After all, Rosa‐san's the only one who didn't fire her gun."`
`".........What does that matter...?"`
`"The guns lying at your feet are Krauss nii‐san's and Eva nee‐san's.`
` Both of those have been fired.`
` However, Rosa‐san's gun can shoot if you just pull the trigger.`
` It's hard to reload one of these if you aren't used to a lever action.`
` An amateur couldn't do it."`
`"Kyrie‐san, what are you talking about......?"`
`"Y‐......you......!!"`
`They finally realized what Kyrie meant.`
`...“Rosa had the only gun that could still fire, so I shot her first”.`
`Oh, how foolish we were... Why didn't we realize sooner?`
`We should have realized that there's a mechanism for erasing everything that happens on this island...`
`Eva and Hideyoshi hurried to pick up the guns that lay at their feet.`
`At the same time, fire spat from Kyrie's gun once more.`
`Hideyoshi let out a short scream, clutched at his chest, and fell over face‐down.`
`"Honey?!`
` Honey...!!"`
`"......Ngh, ......what's wrong with this—"`
`Eva fiddled with the lever action, trying to imitate something she vaguely remembered from old westerns,`
` but something seemed to be caught, and the still‐open lever didn't budge.`
`"See?`
` It's pretty hard."`
`"Y‐......you.........!!!"`
`Kyrie finished reloading with a fluid motion.`
`{n}The way she held it was as innocent and sure as a kid playing with a squirt gun.`
`With another heartless cry of gunfire, the puppet called Eva slumped down to the floor...`
`as though all her strings had been cut......`
`"......Rudolf‐san.`
` The billion yen card."`
`"Sure......"`
`The cash card with a billion yen, which Eva had just grabbed from the witch.`
`That alone was worth more than enough.`
`The 20 billion yen pile of gold had skewed everyone's sense of value.`
`People could kill over a few million yen.`
` And this was a billion.`
`"Rosa‐san.`
` Those were some famous last words there.`
` "A measly 300 million"?`
` ......You were too greedy."`
`"Heheh......`
` No doubt.`
` .........Ah, lucky me.`
` I don't have to fish through her corpse."`
`As Rudolf walked up to Eva's body, he found the card lying beside it...and picked it up.`
`"So, this thin, little card is worth a billion yen...`
` ......Keeping the company going feels ridiculous now.`
` Shall we close up shop and spend the rest of our lives in some southern country?"`
`"That would just get boring.`
` Besides, I like seeing you get all worried about some problem, then play around like a little kid when you finally overcome it."`
`"Heheheh...!`
` Sure you do..."`
`"Thank you, Ms. Golden Witch.`
` ......Rudolf‐san and I will make good use of this billion."`
`"................................."`
`"Krauss nii‐san promised to treat you in a gentlemanly fashion.`
` But I haven't made any such promise."`
`......She pulled the trigger without a trace of mercy.`
`When the ringing of the gunfire died down, ......blood trickled from the witch's mouth, and she fell over onto the bed.`
`Once again, Kyrie ejected the used shell casing.`
`The four metal sounds of used shells hitting the floor seemed to symbolize the fact that Rudolf and his wife now possessed all shares of the gold......`
`"......All of them were really slow‐witted......`
` ......From the moment she explained about the bomb, the entire notion of playing nicely vanished from this island, and they failed to notice."`
`"Sorry 'bout this, Aniki, Aneki, Rosa.`
` ......What can I say, that's just how the cookie crumbles.`
` Cut me a break, okay?`
` Aniki and Aneki get into a fight, Rosa gets dragged in,`
` and I run away with the bone.`
` ......Just the same way it's always been, right?"`
`At the start, Rudolf and Kyrie hadn't planned to kill everyone and take everything for themselves.`
`Kyrie had quickly realized by the size of the gun in her hands that it would probably hold five rounds at a time.`
`.........Yes.`
` Both Kyrie and Rudolf knew a lot about these guns.`
`Rudolf, who had gotten his interest in old‐style western guns from his father, owned a shotgun of a similar design.`
`Since Kyrie had the same skill at handling firearms, they both knew enough about these guns to enjoy shooting together...`
`Including the witch, there had been eight people there.`
` Six people besides the two of them.`
`Each gun held five rounds.`
` ......That was one short.`
` They didn't have enough to kill everyone.`
`"......I was honestly surprised when they got into a fight and one of the guns went off."`
`That coincidental accident......had provided the missing bullet.`
`It wasn't the second shot.`
` The very first shot, which had accidentally killed Natsuhi, had guaranteed the result of this massacre...`
`In this smoke and corpse‐filled room of gold, the two of them wore easygoing smiles, hardly any different from the ones they usually wore...`
`"......So.`
` What now?"`
`Rudolf picked up Rosa's gun.`
` Then, he fired a test shot at the wall and ejected the old shell with a smooth motion like Kyrie's.`
`Kyrie went to the box of bullets on the table, casually picked up a few, and loaded them one after another into her gun.`
`"Set the bomb switch to "on".`
` Then, we just need to wait twenty‐four hours."`
`"The others'll make a lot of noise when they realize everyone's missing in the morning."`
`"Then we just need to shut them up."`
`"Guess so.`
` ......What about Battler?"`
`"He's your son.`
` Not mine."`
`"Don't say that.`
` He really took a shine to you.`
` He respects you, you know."`
`"Then think of something clever that'll convince him.`
` I'll worry about Ange.`
` You worry about Battler‐kun.`
` Fair enough?"`
`"Nn, .........sure."`
`"I may be kind to my own child,`
` ......but it's quite a struggle for me to treat Asumu‐san's kid the same way.`
` You understand, I hope?"`
`".............................."`
`Kyrie's voice had grown cold.`
`Kyrie had acted warmly towards Battler because that had been the adult thing to do.`
`He was Rudolf's son, so she just tried to avoid being unkind.`
`But underneath, he was the son of Asumu, the woman whose death had done nothing to quell the hate Kyrie harbored towards her.`
`Now that she had given birth to Ange and finally built up a new family,`
` .........was Battler's return really such a happy thing for her......?`
`"Brace yourself.`
` Now that we've come this far,`
` ......we can only go for the billion yen or die trying.`
` If Battler‐kun is unconvinced, I'm sorry, but I won't be taking any chances."`
`".........No need to threaten me.`
` I'll take care of it.`
` I'll find a good story to tell him."`
`"Make sure you do a good job of it.`
` ......If Ange hears that Battler‐kun has died in an accident, I'm sure she'll be very sad."`
`"Sure......`
` .....................`
` ......How do we start?"`
`"We have nothing to gain by waiting for morning.`
` Now is the best time."`
`"......Oh, wonderful.`
` Not even time for a break."`
`"......A test?`
` What is he thinking?`
` At this time of night?`
` Right now?"`
`Battler yelled wildly into the receiver.`
`When he said "at this time of night", George and Jessica turned to look.`
`According to the clock, it was past midnight.`
`It might be a normal time to be told to brush their teeth and go to bed, but they couldn't understand what this "test" was all about.`
`"Okay, I'll hand it over.`
` .........Here, George‐aniki.`
` It's my dad."`
`"......Hello,`
` this is George speaking."`
`"Ah, hey, George‐kun.`
` Sorry to call so late.`
` I'll bet I didn't wake you, though, right?`
` You're all still up chatting away?"`
`"Pretty much.`
` Maria‐chan is sleeping, ......oh, wait, looks like she just woke up.`
` So, what did you want to talk about?`
` Battler‐kun said something about a test..."`
`"Yep.`
` Dad can be such a pain sometimes.`
` He suddenly came down from his room.`
` A bunch of stuff happened, and he suddenly started talking about which grandchild would make the best successor."`
`"......But isn't Uncle Krauss the successor?"`
`"He says that none of us are good enough to be the successor.`
` ......So, he's talking about skipping us adults and choosing one from you grandchildren instead.`
` It's really shaken us up, having this forced on us all of a sudden.`
` Aniki and the others are all arguing about it across the room.`
` Maybe you can hear Aneki's shrill voice leaking through across the phone."`
`"I‐......is that so?`
` If that's what Grandfather says, then there's no way around it, I guess...`
` In that case, what should we do?"`
`"He says he wants to call you out one by one, starting with Jessica‐chan.`
` ......Oh, wait a sec.`
` ...........................`
` ......Okay, you still there?`
` Looks like George‐kun and Jessica‐chan will be the first up to bat.`
` He wants Jessica‐chan to go to the parlor in the mansion.`
` You're supposed to go out by the chapel."`
`"It's so sudden, I hardly feel ready......`
` What sort of test is it?"`
`"It looks like Dad's made some sort of crazy quiz.`
` ......Some weird questions about what it means to be the head."`
`Of course, George felt as though something wasn't right.`
`However, Kinzo was famous for doing radical things on a whim.`
` ......Even this strange test seemed plausible once he heard that it was a sudden idea of Kinzo's.`
`......But even in that case, if he wanted to test them one by one, why wouldn't he call them out one by one?`
`Like an interview, they should just have to wait in the reception room and go when they were called.`
`Why would two people be called to different places at the same time?`
` ......The plan didn't seem to make sense, which made George feel as though he was missing something.`
`"Still, I wonder why he wanted you to go to the chapel, of all places.`
` ......It seems your grandfather expects a lot from you.`
` I'm not sure what it is, but I think he wants to talk to you about something alone."`
`"......Grandfather...wants to talk to me?"`
`"I wonder what it is.`
` You are the most accomplished of all his grandchildren, after all.`
` I guess there's something he wants to tell you in particular.`
` ......Well, anyway, that's what he says.`
` Get over there right away.`
` I'm also supposed to go there.`
` Let's get this over with.`
` We'll both catch cold if we keep this up."`
`"............Is that so?`
` I see.`
` Then I'll head towards the chapel.`
` Jessica‐chan will go to the parlor.`
` .........Okay.`
` I'll see you in a bit, then."`
`Just what sort of test, what sort of private conversation could Kinzo want to have at this time of night?`
`However, it was a well‐known fact that Kinzo didn't have very long to live.`
`It was conceivable that he had some last words for each of his individual descendants...`
`Inside George's mind, the faint feeling that something was wrong was replaced by curiosity...and a desire to meet Kinzo directly and hear the details.`
`George set down the receiver and quickly explained to the others.`
`"It's as you heard.`
` .........Grandfather says he wants to give us all some kind of test."`
`"Uu?`
` A test...?"`
`"After hiding in his study all these years, he decides to give us a pop quiz this late at night?`
` ......Damn that old geezer.`
` What's he thinking?"`
`"It seems our parents feel the same way.`
` It sounds as though they're very worked up about it."`
`"Well, I doubt getting worked up about it will change Grandfather's mind any."`
`"Exactly.`
` ......We might as well accept it.`
` It's the order of the head of the family, after all.`
` Let's obey it.`
` ......To start, Jessica‐chan and I are being called out.`
` I'm going to the chapel.`
` Jessica‐chan, you're supposed to go to the parlor in the mansion."`
`"What about Maria and me?"`
`"I think they'll call about you later.`
` You can wait here."`
`"Uu!`
` A midnight test!`
` What could it be?!`
` What kind of test is it?!`
` A quiz?`
` A puzzle?`
` I'm really good at wolves and sheep puzzles!`
` Uu!"`
`Maria, who was now fully awake, seemed to be very excited about this unexpected midnight test.`
`"Then we'll just hang out here."`
`"Yes.`
` Okay, I'm going.`
` I think they're already waiting for us."`
`"......So, he's making one of his grandkids the successor.`
` Sounds just great for me.`
` Now I can let one of you guys deal with it!"`
`"I'm gonna become the successor!`
` I wanna do it!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!"`
`"Ahaha.`
` It'd be fun to have Maria as the successor."`
`"Bye.`
` See you later."`
`Rudolf put down the receiver and stood up.`
`"Okay.`
` ......Guess I'm going to the chapel.`
` It's damn cold out there.`
` ......Gohda‐san.`
` Have some coffee waiting for me when I get back, will you?"`
`Next to Rudolf, .........Gohda was lying face‐up.`
`His face was covered by a crossword puzzle book.`
`However, its pages were stained with blood, and there was no need to move the book to imagine how he had met his pitiful end...`
`"How was it?`
` A nice script, don't you think?"`
`"Yep.`
` We should be thanking Dad.`
` All we've gotta do is say it's him being fickle, and no one thinks to doubt it."`
`"*giggle*.`
` Then, let's split up.`
` ......I'll take care of Jessica‐chan.`
` You take care of George‐kun."`
`"You got it.`
` ......Let's get this over with quickly, then relax with some coffee."`
`"There won't be any problems, yes?`
` ......No sudden pangs of conscience?"`
`Kyrie smiled coldly......`
`It probably would have been safer to call them out one by one and finish them off together.`
`......However, Kyrie had chosen to have her husband work separately.`
`She wanted to measure Rudolf's resolve.`
`If she was the only one who got her hands dirty, and Rudolf just watched, his heart would not be as dedicated to this venture.`
`By having him dirty his own hands, she could make him truly determined to see this thing through.`
`......Kyrie understood this sort of mind game better than anyone else.`
`Rudolf reflexively averted his gaze from the cold glint in her eyes, but then he just shrugged and answered her question.`
`"Of course.`
` .........We have a billion yen riding on this.`
` I'm a man.`
` I'm not going to miss a chance that'll never come again in my lifetime."`
`"......I expected no less of you, Rudolf‐san.`
` ......I love people who seize chances when they come.`
` That's why I fell in love with you."`
`"Th‐thanks......`
` I'm glad."`
`"Rudolf‐san."`
`"What......?"`
`"You will stay.........?"`
`"Huh?`
` What did you say?"`
`"You will stay...`
`......the same Rudolf‐san that I love, ......right?"`
`".........Of course.`
` When have I ever let you down?`
` ......Instead of that, you should be worrying more about the kind of champagne we'll use to toast our victory."`
`"I'll do that.`
` ............Take care, now.`
` If you really treasure Battler‐kun, don't kill George‐kun in front of the chapel, okay?`
` It'll be a pain if he finds the corpse."`
`"......Yeah, I know.`
` ......I'll lure him away somehow.`
` It's raining outside.`
` Should be some way to do it."`
`"And you aren't a villain in some old western, got it?`
` Don't grant any last requests or ask for any last words, okay?"`
`Kyrie lifted up her gun again and pulled on the lever.`
`{n}......To eject the casing from the bullet she had killed Gohda with.`
`".........Honey......`
` ......Honeyyyy...`
` Uuuughhhuu{0}u{0}uuu......"`
`Eva was holding Hideyoshi's body and crying.`
`She hadn't been shot at all.`
` The bullet had grazed the side of her head......and missed.`
`She hadn't been playing dead.`
` She really thought that she had been shot.`
`When Kyrie's gun spat fire, Eva felt something swift and fierce scrape past her head...`
`before feeling light‐headed and fainting.`
`Then, later on, she woke up in the now silent room of the gold.`
`The corpse of her beloved husband lay beside her.`
` Along with the corpses of Krauss, Natsuhi, and Rosa.`
`It was a room of death and piled up bodies......`
`When she had cried all she could over Hideyoshi's body,`
` ............she realized that she still had something she needed to do.`
`"......George is in danger.........`
` ......George, ..........George.........!"`
`They're trying to use the bomb to blow up everything, to bury this whole island with an "explosion accident".`
`......Eva checked the clock, and was proven right.`
`As expected, the switch was set to the right, which meant that it was active.`
`Eva moved to flip it to the left......and stopped.`
`That's right.`
` As long as this switch points to the right, ............everything that happens on this island will disappear into a night of illusion.`
`Yes, this is an illusion.`
`No matter what happens tonight, everything will become muddled and hidden away.`
`"They're going to kill everyone else.`
` That has to be it... I'm sure of it...!"`
`When she looked at the table with the box of bullets,`
` she saw signs that they had grabbed several large handfuls of bullets from the box.`
`It clearly showed......that they planned to use that many bullets.`
`......I have to fight.`
`......If only to protect just the life of my precious son......`
`The gun that I dropped when I was shot is stuck with the lever handle open.`
`No matter how hard I pull, it won't open any further, and it won't close again.`
`......A bullet must have gotten jammed and broken it.`
`......It's just as Kyrie said.`
` Loading a bullet is tough if you aren't used to it.`
`"Please,`
` honey......`
` Lend me your strength......`
` .........Help me protect George...`
` ......Lend me your strength......"`
`In Hideyoshi's hand was Krauss's gun, which he had been trying to pick up.`
`Eva took it, ......prayed to her husband one more time, and tugged on the lever handle.`
`.........With a light metallic sound,`
` ......the golden casing spun through the air...`
`and bounced off the ground.`
`When she timidly tried to push the lever back,`
` ......this time it returned to its original place without any resistance.`
`......There was another metallic clang.`
`It was the sound of a new bullet being loaded......`
`"......Hmph.`
` I figured it'd be something like this.`
` ......Someone's scheming to show me the game that'd disgust me the most, so they can laugh at me...."`
`In the games so far, various people have been suspected of being the culprit or an accomplice.`
`The only difference now was that Rudolf and Kyrie were those suspects...`
`However, that was the most aggravating development possible for Ange.`
`"..........................."`
`Even Lion was full of painful thoughts.`
`They had been lucky enough to solve the epitaph, which was the only miracle that could lead to a game with no victims.`
` ......How ironic that they were unable to prevent the tragedy.`
`Does this mean that we aren't allowed to have a future where we all happily return from this island alive,`
` ......even if the epitaph is miraculously solved before the crime occurs...?`
`There will be...absolutely...no miracles.`
`......I recalled those words, which I had heard in one of the fragments {f:5:Bernkastel} had shown me......`
`"{f:5:Bernkastel}‐san......`
` You showed me how wonderful my world was...`
` ......I don't want to believe that you created this tale just to hurt Ange......"`
`"......By now, even I realize that you're the Game Master here.`
` ......Please, tell me.`
` ...Why are you showing us this game...?"`
`Of course, no one answered Lion's muttered question.`
`The game created to mock Ange continued emotionlessly,`
` ......with more terrible twists that didn't betray anyone's expectations anymore......`
`"Ha!`
` Show whatever terrible game you like!`
` You're trying to say that this is one of the endless possibilities inside the cat box, right?!`
` Just do whatever you want...!`
` I won't let something like this get to me!!`
` Someday, I'll find out the truth of what happened on October 5th, 1986!!"`
`After meeting Kyrie in the parlor, Jessica was told that the test would be held in the dining hall, and she followed Kyrie there...`
`".........Auntie Kyrie, there's no one here."`
`"He'll be here soon.`
` Sit over there."`
`"..........................."`
`Jessica sat in that chair, looking nervous and agitated.`
`Kyrie was by far the calmer of the two.`
`Kyrie closed the door behind her, revealing the gun that rested behind it.`
` Jessica was facing the other way, so she saw nothing......`
`"......Did you hear anything, Auntie Kyrie?`
` You know what kind of test this is?"`
`"Yes.`
` It'll be over soon."`
`"I sure hope so."`
`As she complained, Jessica turned her head around, and the tip of her nose bumped into cold metal.`
`"............Huh—"`
`"U‐Uncle Rudolf......?!`
` What......are you doing......?"`
`"Heheh.`
` Just can't bring myself to shoot you in the back."`
`"......C‐......careful, guns are dangerous.`
` What on Earth are you doing...?!"`
`"You really have to ask why someone'd point a gun and pull the trigger?"`
`Rudolf reloaded rapidly and pulled the trigger again without any sign of hesitation.`
`As the sound of gunfire thundered through the rain, George grabbed at his side and fell to his knees...`
`"Unnggg......ggnhh......!!"`
`"That's weird.`
` Looks like it shoots low.`
` ......This gun's really got it bad."`
`"S‐somebody......!!`
` Help me, ...Uncle Rudolf is......!!"`
`George started stumbling away, still clutching at his side.`
`{n}His voice as he called for help was weak and thin.`
`Behind him, Rudolf looked perfectly calm as he fiddled with his gun and inspected the sights.`
`"......It hurts...... ...It hurts......`
` ......Gah, .........nngg...!"`
`A gouging pain in George's side tormented him.`
` It was so painful that he could barely stand and walk......`
`He leaned against the trunk of a tree.`
`After he crouched down, trying to cover his wound, ......he was no longer able to stand back up.`
`George didn't have a clue what was going on.`
` However, he had thought it strange the whole time.`
`Of course it was strange that he should be called out to a place like this at a time like this.`
`.........And yet,`
` ......how could he have guessed that something was wrong...?`
`After all,`
` ......his own uncle...`
`had told him that his grandfather was calling for him from the family conference.`
` ......How could he have gotten suspicious......?`
`"......Sorry 'bout this, George‐kun.`
` It hurts, doesn't it?`
` If I knew it'd be like this, it'd have been more merciful to blow your brains out from behind.`
` I thought it'd be too cruel to finish you off before you knew what hit you, but it looks like I got it backwards."`
`".........Wh‐`
`......why,`
` Uncle Rudolf......?`
` ......Why would...`
`...my kind uncle...`
`...do...`
`...this............?"`
`"Just forget about all this.`
` By tomorrow night, none of it will have happened."`
`With a quick use of the lever handle, he loaded another bullet.`
`The casing of the bullet that had pierced George's side fell heartlessly in front of him...`
`"Everyone's gonna die in a sudden, unfortunate accident.`
` Until that moment, we'll all have been a big, happy family.`
` ......That's how it's gonna be.`
` So don't worry about this.`
` Forget it all."`
`Of course, George didn't have a clue what Rudolf was talking about.`
`All he knew was that Rudolf wanted to kill him, and that he showed no trace of hesitation...`
`......The image George had of Rudolf as the ideal cool, joke‐loving adult...`
`...didn't match up with the Rudolf standing in front of him, holding a gun.`
`No, maybe it didn't fit because it fit too well.`
`Even though there was a gun in his hands,`
` ......Rudolf had a huge smile on his face, as though he was about to tell some hilarious joke.`
`......Why would that kind, funny...`
`...Uncle Rudolf...`
`......do this......?`
`It made him feel unimaginably sad, ......and tears flowed from his eyes.`
`"Ungh, ......uughh... ...Uncle Rudolf......`
` ......I......admired you so much......"`
`"Haven't I always told you, George‐kun?`
` ......To make sure you don't end up as an adult like me?`
` Now you see.`
` In the next world, make it your first priority to learn how to recognize a real bastard.`
` .........I know you can do it.`
` After all, it's just another kind of studying."`
`"Uu...khh......rrrraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh!!"`
`Biting down the pain in his side,`
` ......and summoning the last of his strength, George threw his whole body into a roundhouse kick.`
`At the same time, fire spat from Rudolf's gun.`
`......The bullet pierced George's chest.`
`{n}George twisted and fell as blood gushed from the wound.`
`He moaned wordlessly, clenching blood‐stained teeth.`
`{n}The frigid gun was pressed harshly against his temple.`
`"So long.`
` ......Go become a great man in the next world.`
` Don't get blinded by money like me."`
`"......I can't believe...`
`...that my uncle...`
`......would kill for money......`
` Khghaaaahhhhh........."`
`"You're so innocent.`
` ......People can.`
` Kill for money."`
`The ruthless trigger forestalled any further questions.`
`George's hands, which had been covering his wound, dropped lifelessly......`
`After Rudolf saw the last glimmer of life leave him, he let out a deeply exhausted sigh he'd been holding back for some time.`
`"Hahh. ......Ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha.`
` .........I expected worse."`
`Rudolf looked up into the dark, rainy sky, the rain drops hitting him full in the face,`
` ......and laughed with an indescribable expression, his tongue hanging out.`
`"I figured my conscience would be giving me a harder time.`
` ......Now that it's over, ...I'm surprised how little I feel."`
`*chuckle*chuckle*,`
` gahahahahahaha.`
`{n}Rudolf started laughing.`
`{n}This was probably just the thing Kyrie had hoped for.`
`It had taken some effort to kill George.`
`......Though he had been merciless, the last traces of conscience in Rudolf's heart had probably slowed him down.`
`However, now that he had killed someone with his own hands, a turning point that few people ever reach, ......Rudolf had finally awakened.`
`...No, he finally understood.`
`".........It's exactly the same as screwing suckers out of their money.`
` .........The same old game of musical chairs.`
` When there's a pile of money up for grabs, there's no prize for taking your time.`
` The slow ones just get kicked down to hell."`
`I've scammed dozens of unfortunate saps and buried them in debt.`
`Several of them probably ended up bankrupt, and some of those might've hanged themselves.`
` And I always laughed, saying that wasn't my problem.`
`That's all there is to it.`
`The only difference now is that, for the first time,`
` .........I've dealt the final blow with my own hands.`
`".........Thanks, Kyrie.`
` ......You're always the best at cutting away my naivety.`
` ......Heheheh, ...heh{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haa{0}hah!`
` Hyahh{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haa{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!!"`
`Rudolf's evil laugh rang out.`
`The laugh was so purely evil, it was almost refreshing.`
`{n}Evil that still has a conscience and thinks itself good is far more repulsive to behold.`
`If a man commits himself to an evil act, how much more pleasant and graceful it is when he is honest about his intentions.`
`In that sense, Rudolf's evil smile and laugh...`
`.........truly were pleasant and graceful......`
`......And so.`
`Surely the brutal, bloody stage of the dining hall......was also refreshing.`
`A clang.`
` A thud.`
` A crack, a squish.`
` ......A strange mixture of these sounds kept repeating over and over at the same tempo.`
`......Each time, a red splash landed on the nearby dangling tablecloth.`
`"Jessica‐chan, .........are you listening......?"`
`Kyrie asked this with the sort of smile any aunt might make to her niece.`
`{n}However, Jessica didn't answer.`
`There was nothing particularly surprising about this.`
`......After all, by now,`
` ......her nose was broken,`
` her eyes had been smashed,`
` ......her teeth had been knocked out,`
` ......and not only her nose, but her entire face was now hardly recognizable as a face,`
` ......just a lump of bloody flesh......`
`Kyrie finally stopped her task of repeatedly smashing Jessica's face with the stock of her gun.`
`Still sitting on top of Jessica, Kyrie tossed her gun to the side, ......pulled a compact out of her pocket, and looked at her own face in the mirror.`
`Then, finally, ......she realized that her face was covered by speckles of fresh blood.`
`"How terrible.`
` These clothes will have to go too.`
` ......*cackle*cackle*, *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"`
`With a muffled laugh, Kyrie shakily rose to her feet.`
`Jessica wasn't moving anymore.`
` ......She had been convulsing a bit until a second ago, but now, she was as still as stone.`
`"......When it comes to punching women in the face,`
` your aunt is an old pro.`
` Sorry about that.`
` .........If you hadn't resisted, I could've let you have a much cleaner death."`
`Kyrie pulled the tablecloth off and used it like a towel to wipe the blood from all over her body.`
`However, instead of taking the blood off, it just smeared it around,`
` ......and did nothing to remove the stench of blood and death that covered her.`
`When she got tired of smearing blood over the tablecloth, Kyrie walked over to the extension telephone in the corner of the room.`
`Then, she dialed the number for the cousins' room in the guesthouse......`
`".........Hello.`
` It's me.`
` .........It's your turn now, Battler‐kun.`
` ......You're next to go to the front of the chapel.`
` ............Yes, that's right.`
` I haven't been given any instructions about Maria‐chan.`
` Have her wait there.`
`.........*giggle*.`
` Yes, take it seriously.`
` ......I'm rooting for you to be chosen as the successor."`
`With the same smile as usual and the partly‐wiped splashes of blood still covering her face, ......Kyrie finished her call to Battler.`
`When she set down the receiver, there was a small knock, and Rudolf came back into the room.`
`".........Whoa, what a mess."`
`"Jessica‐chan has better reflexes than I gave her credit for.`
` I didn't expect her to knock the gun away when she did."`
`"It's a bit of a shame she had to end up looking like this.`
` ......What a waste of the good looks she got from Natsuhi nee‐san."`
`"And how about your end?`
` Did he give you much trouble?"`
`"No problems there.`
` Plain and simple."`
`When Kyrie heard Rudolf's instant response, she favored him with an evil smile.`
`Yes, the man she loved was the sort who could do whatever he put his mind to, without letting cheap emotions get in the way...`
`"I love you, Rudolf‐san.`
` I wouldn't have it any other way."`
`"It's hard to imagine an easier job to net you a billion yen.`
` ......It's like Dad always said.`
` In the life of every man, there comes one day where he has to be willing to kill."`
`"In other words, always be willing to kill if your own survival depends on it.`
` ......That's my favorite of the things he used to say."`
`"What's next?`
` My rifle is hungry for blood."`
`"You've got a big job coming up.`
` Convincing Battler‐kun."`
`"Ah, that's right.`
` That'll be a pain.`
` Hope I don't have to end it by pulling the trigger."`
`"I'm fond of it, you know.`
` ......Our little family of three with Ange.`
` ......But, if you really want Battler‐kun to join in on that, ......good luck."`
`"Sure.`
` .........I'm not gonna give him the room to argue back.`
` Don't worry, I've worked out a scenario to trick him good."`
`"Good luck.`
` I do hope for Ange's beloved big brother not to get caught up in an explosion accident if it can be avoided."`
`"I know.`
` Alright, I'm heading back to the chapel."`
`"Rudolf‐san."`
`"What...?"`
`".........If Battler‐kun doesn't buy it..."`
`"...........................`
` ......I know, I know.`
` If it comes to that, bang."`
`"Remember, Battler‐kun is the type to take action, so much so that he left the family out of protest when I married you.`
` ......If your story to him isn't airtight, and he starts questioning things later on,`
` ......he'll prove fatal to us."`
`"I know.`
` Believe in me."`
`".........So...`
`if I decide that Battler‐kun is the least bit suspicious,`
` ......I'll kill him myself.`
` He's not my kid, after all."`
`"......Yeah,`
` I know.`
` .........So, Kyrie,`
` promise me one thing."`
`"What's that...?"`
`"If.........I can trick Battler, and the three of us make it off this island..."`
`".........Yes?"`
`"..............................`
` ......Never say that Battler isn't your kid again.`
` ......You're......his mother.`
` ......Please."`
`".....................`
` ......Sure, I promise."`
`Kyrie shrugged and answered as she loaded bullets.`
`"You go to the chapel.`
` I'll wait until Battler‐kun has left, and then clean up everything inside the guesthouse."`
`"Sure you'll be alright doing that alone?"`
`"You worry about yourself."`
`Battler left the guesthouse under an umbrella.`
`He had been called to the area in front of the chapel, just like George had been.`
`Not even half an hour had passed since the time George and Jessica had been called out.`
` ......Apparently, this test didn't last too long.`
`"......Damn geezer.`
` You didn't even show up for lunch, and now you show up in the middle of a night with a test.`
` ......I'll bet living as a shut‐in's got his sense of day and night all backwards."`
`Complaining all the way, Battler strolled off into the rain.`
`Almost immediately, he was swallowed up by the darkness of the rose garden and passed out of sight......`
`.........And then...`
`Kyrie could be seen coming out from the darkness of the rose garden.`
`Her right hand held a gun.`
` Her left an umbrella.`
`Her inner pocket contained the master key ring she had stolen from Gohda.`
`Her right pocket had a handful of bullets.`
` Her left held a knife she had taken from the kitchen.`
`She was a carefully and perfectly outfitted murderer.`
`Another bolt of lightning struck down from the swirling skies.`
` It lit up only half of Kyrie's face.`
`Her cheek......was still covered with Jessica's blood......`
`Under the eaves, Kyrie folded up her umbrella, smiled, and spoke to no one.`
`"How's it going, everyone?"`
`Rudolf could be seen under the eaves of the chapel.`
`{n}He had hidden his gun in the nearby shadows and was now smoking a cigarette...`
`".........Should be easy to trick that dimwit.`
` ......And if it doesn't work, that's just too bad."`
`He glanced over at the place he had stowed his gun.`
`{n}The cigarette smoke began to pleasantly cloud his mind.`
`......Battler isn't a kid anymore.`
` He's an adult, who can choose his path through life as he pleases.`
`When animals grow up, it's normal for them to leave their group and go on a journey.`
` Humans are the only ones that keep treating them like kids even after they get big......`
`".........If it was gonna come to this,`
` I should never have begged for you to come back.`
` .........I regret......dragging you back into the family......"`
`He puffed out those words...`
`...along with the smoke.`
`When Battler came, he didn't intend to voice those regrets of his.`
`Rudolf had already determined to play the part of the evil murderer who kills for money......`
`"......He's still not here.`
` .........What's taking him so long?"`
`At that moment, he heard the sound of someone stepping on gravel.`
`He looked up, thinking that Battler had finally arrived, ......but the sound had come from the direction opposite of the mansion.`
`"...........................!"`
`"......Rudolf.........`
` ...How could you...`
` .........How could you...do that to my husband......?!!"`
`"Aneki...... So, you're alive......"`
`"Yeah, sorry, but I lived...`
` Too bad!`
` But my husband wasn't so lucky...`
` How could you...`
` ......How could you...?!!"`
`With a face obscured by anger and tears, Eva slowly walked closer, her gun raised.`
`Her husband had been killed right in front of her.`
` She probably wouldn't even hesitate.`
`Realizing that a gun, quivering with anger, was pointed right at his chest, Rudolf backed away.`
`As he pretended to back away, ......he approached the gun he had hidden in the shadows.`
`"C‐calm down, Aneki......`
` Put the gun down...`
` ......I never wanted that to happen.`
` Everything happened so fast. There was nothing I could do...!"`
`"How can you say such half‐baked lies?!!"`
`As Eva had said, it really had been a half‐baked, pointless thing to say.`
`Rudolf would have said anything if he thought it would calm Eva's emotions before she pulled the trigger, which she looked capable of doing at any moment now...`
`......Then, Rudolf's foot came in contact with his gun.`
`"L‐let's just talk this over.`
` ......George‐kun should be here soon.`
` ......Oh.`
` ...Hey, George‐kun, we're over here."`
`Rudolf waved, as though George was coming from behind Eva.`
`Let Eva's attention turn in that direction......`
`.........That idiot...`
` My simple, big sister has always been a sucker.`
`Die!!!`
`Gunfire. `
`......Then, a bit later, the sound of something heavier than rain......drip‐dropping onto the cobblestone floor.`
`"...............Agh,`
` ..................nggg........."`
`".........Rudolf...`
` I've always been able to see through your tricks...!!"`
`The bullet Eva fired had struck Rudolf square in the chest.`
`{n}The bullet Rudolf fired had missed, landing near Eva's feet.`
`"Guess I was right...`
` This gun...`
`......does shoot...`
`...low......"`
`He dropped the gun into a puddle with a splash, staggered backwards, and leaned against the wall of the chapel.`
`"Nah, that's not it......`
` .........All good westerns end......with the bad guy's bullet missing......"`
`Eva dashed up to him, kicked away the gun that had fallen into a puddle, and grabbed Rudolf by the collar.`
`"What about George?!`
` Where is he?!`
` I won't let you kill him...!!"`
`".........Sorry, Aneki.`
` ......The deed's...already done."`
`"You're lying!!"`
`"......Did it in the bushes over there.`
` ......Go take a look.`
` You'll see......"`
`"...............R‐`
`......Rudolf......`
`...you............"`
`Eva, who said she had always been able to see through her little brother's tricks,`
` ......also knew that Rudolf's final words, as his consciousness began to fade from having been shot, were not a lie.`
`"How could you...... .........George... Geoo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}orge!!!"`
`An empty shell casing bounced off the cobblestone.`
` The furious gun barrel was pressed against Rudolf's forehead.`
`".........Go ahead and shoot.`
` ......I doubt that'll bring you much peace though."`
`A bolt of lightning turned everything white.`
`{n}However, the wall of the chapel......was stained blood red.`
`A red splash like a crushed tomato covered the wall behind Rudolf's head......`
`Then, leaving a red trail behind him,`
` ......Rudolf slid down the wall,`
` sat on the ground, and fell over.`
`"George, Geooo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}orge!!`
` Geooo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}orge, uwaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhh!!"`
`Eva dashed off towards the bushes.`
` ......She found George's corpse almost immediately, screamed, and broke down sobbing.`
`......Rudolf's bloody corpse was exposed to the rain that ran down off the eaves.`
`His eyes were still wide open.`
` A ragged, fist‐sized hole had been torn open in the back of his head, ......exposing its contents to the open air.`
`Inside was minced flesh and bright red jelly.`
`That goop, which looked like someone had mixed it up with a spoon, dripped from his eyes, nose, ears, mouth, and the hole in his head......`
`".........Dad......Dad......`
` ......Aaaaaaaaahhh...!!!"`
`Ange clutched at her head, sobbing and moaning.`
`Her father had dirtied his hands with murder over money, and on top of that, he had faced such a cruel end, and Ange had been forced to see his corpse.`
` It was hard to imagine a more painful experience for a daughter to go through.`
`......I'm totally fed up with this. It's completely meaningless.`
`"{f:5:Bernkastel}‐san...!`
` I know you're here somewhere!`
` Please, make this game stop...!!`
` There's no point to it!"`
`As if in answer to that yell, ......a black shadow appeared a few seats in front of them.`
`Or perhaps she had been sitting there the whole time.`
`Maybe we just couldn't see her until we realized she was there.`
`It was, without a doubt, the back of {f:5:Bernkastel}'s head.`
`"{f:5:Bernkastel}‐san......!!"`
`"......Pipe down back there.`
` Can't you watch the show quietly?"`
`The witch turned around with bored eyes.`
` ......As though the two who were yelling were the strange ones.`
`"Please stop this...!`
` We realize that this world is the sealed cat box world of October 4th and 5th...!"`
`The games are like messages.`
`Or maybe more like a roundabout love letter,`
` conveying a single message over several games.`
`But we already understand.`
` We know that endless tales can seep out of the sealed, two‐day cat box.`
`And beyond that, I even know the culprit and the motive.`
` That has already been revealed, and it has nothing to do with this game.`
`"We both know the answer, that this is a cat box tale...!`
` So, there shouldn't be any reason to hold further games like this...!!`
` If this is supposed to be a game between you and us, then we already know the answer...!!`
` The game should be able to end now!!"`
`"Just shut up already.`
` Didn't you hear Bern tell you to be quiet?"`
`Another shadow appeared in the next seat over, turned around, and scolded the pair.`
`".........There is a point.`
` If you just watch, you'll see it.`
` ......*giggle*giggle*."`
`"Are you the Game Master...?!"`
`"......Not at all."`
`"Then who is it?!`
` Could it be.........Clair...?"`
`"If you watch, you'll see.`
` Not much longer now.`
` ......*giggle*giggle*."`
`"The tragedy is already reaching its climax.`
` Who'll survive, I wonder?`
` Eheh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eheh......"`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} isn't the Game Master...?`
`Then who is?`
`{n}Could Clair have created this cruel tale......?`
`Or are there even more witches playing around with this cat box......?`
`The guesthouse......was wrapped in silence.`
`There were no sounds.`
`No trace of anyone's presence.`
` No breathing from anyone alive.`
`There wasn't anything to be heard anymore......`
`If there was a sound...`
`{n}Then that would be only the sound of a murderer's feet stepping across the floor......`
`Kyrie slowly passed through the lounge.`
`In her right hand...was a gun.`
`{n}In her left hand...was a knife.`
`The knife was stained with blood, and some was still dripping from the tip,`
` ......leaving behind red tracks like a demon's footprints......`
`Her hands were filled with tools of murder.`
`{n}So, she wasn't capable of doing anything but murder.`
`In that sense, at this moment, she was nothing more than a pure and unadulterated murderer.`
`......The murderer reached the front door, and then, finally, she looked down at her blood‐stained hands.`
`The hands that carried the tools of death with which she had performed her cruel massacre.`
`At last, the murderer realized that she couldn't even open the door like this, and threw away the knife in her left hand...`
`Then, she placed her hand on the door, turned around calmly, ......and spoke.`
`"Sorry, everyone.`
` ......But don't worry.`
` In a few days, the newspapers will be talking about an unfortunate accident.`
` ......And I'm sure the news shows, newspapers, and all the rumor‐spreading people will say that you must have spent your time in happy ignorance until the instant of the accident.`
` ......In other words, that'll mean you all had a good time until midnight on October 5th."`
`So said the one who had stained the guesthouse red.`
`"At this hour, the cousins are all staying up late and playing around.`
` ......The servants who have the morning shift are all snoring.`
` The ones on the late shift are probably filling in the log or taking a break about now."`
`".........That's how it is.`
` From where I am now, I can hear the laughter coming from the cousins' room.`
` ...............*giggle*."`
`Humans outside the cat box would probably never understand what Kyrie was saying.`
`Only she, shut inside the cat box of the explosion accident, could understand the true meaning of her words......`
`Outside, the rain poured down heavily.`
`Kyrie almost picked up an umbrella, but then stopped suddenly, as if she'd just thought of something.`
`Then, she started walking out into the rain, not caring at all whether she got wet or not...`
`Did the murderer not want an umbrella to get in the way of her pointing her gun?`
` ......Or was she hoping that the rain could act as a shower to get the blood off her?`
`"......................................."`
`Kyrie stopped walking.`
` As though something unexpected had caught her attention.`
`{n}However, this time, it was no whim of hers......`
`".........How could you...`
`...kill my husband......?!!!"`
`"Oh,`
` ......Eva nee‐san.`
` .........That's surprising.`
` How could I have missed you from that distance?"`
`"I'm just as surprised.`
` I still can't believe I survived."`
`"......You came here from the underground stairway behind the chapel, right?`
` ......In that case—"`
`"That's right.`
` I bumped into Rudolf in front of the chapel!"`
`"Did he look well?"`
`"Oh, yes.`
` It's been a while since we siblings had a nice chat."`
`".....................`
` ......I see.`
` ......He's such a show‐off, but so unreliable in a tight spot.`
` ......Looks like he's hopeless without me after all."`
`Kyrie had already realized that Rudolf had been killed.`
`However, no trace of urgency or panic rose to her face.`
`She just closed her eyes with her usual unconcerned expression,`
` ......and when she opened them again, she had regained her composed smile.`
`".........Thank you.`
` I'm grateful.`
` Now I really can have everything to myself."`
`"What's that blood on your clothes...?`
` You just came out of the guesthouse, didn't you......?`
` ......Don't tell me......"`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` ......I'm in the middle of a murder right now."`
`"You killed them?!`
` All of them?!!`
` Even Maria‐chan...?!"`
`"There was no reason to let them live until morning.`
` When morning came, there would be an uproar, and that could prove to be a pain.`
` They might have used a wireless to contact someone off the island and gotten help.`
` ......So, this was clearly the best move to take.`
` If you flip over the chessboard and look at it that way."`
`"Monster!!`
` I can't believe you're so blinded by greed that you committed murder...!!"`
`"Don't forget what you did yourself."`
`"That was an accident!!`
` I didn't mean to kill them!`
` I'm not like you!!"`
`"Oh, yes, you are.`
` ......If that gun hadn't gone off, you would have kept on arguing and grappling with each other.`
` If you had, then the two of you would eventually have reached the same answer as I did, just a few steps slower."`
`"I'm not a murderer!!"`
`"Not true.`
` You're absolutely a murderer, just one who didn't get a chance.`
` You were saved by an accidental discharge, that's all.`
` .........If it weren't for that bit of good luck, and if I hadn't sprung into action before you did,`
` ......then you would have played the same role I'm playing now.`
` That is a fact, a truth of an alternate future, and it won't go away no matter how much you try to deny it."`
`"D‐don't try and confuse me!"`
`However, ......on the inside, Eva understood.`
`Back then, she probably had been saved by that coincidental misfire.`
`If the argument had continued much longer, she would surely have grown a desire to kill Krauss and the others, and might even have carried it out.`
`......She simply could not deny the existence of that demon deep within her heart.`
`Only the theatergoers knew.`
`{n}They knew that she could become a killer in another world.`
`And Kyrie, who did not have the theatergoing ability, knew this fact also.`
` ......Apparently, she really was an extraordinary person.`
`So, for some time, Eva could only grind her teeth in silence, still pointing her gun......`
`"......I don't understand.`
` You're also a mother, you've felt the pain of giving birth to your own child.`
` How can you not know how precious a life is...?!`
` How are you capable of doing all this...?!"`
`"You can create a child without even trying."`
`"What does that have to do with anything...?!!"`
`"Children are bonds...is what I mean."`
`"What?!"`
`"Children are bonds that can tie you to your husband.`
` ......In my case, a bond to make Rudolf‐san acknowledge me, so I could take him back from that woman."`
`"But you've killed Rudolf‐san now.`
` So, .........you understand what that means, right?"`
`"What do you mean...`
`...I understand?!"`
`"Right now,`
` I'm no man's wife, so there's no need for me to be a mother.`
` ......I am me.`
` Kyrie.`
` Now that Rudolf‐san's dead, I'm not even an Ushiromiya anymore.`
` I live to benefit me."`
`"Right, Rudolf is dead, so maybe you aren't a wife anymore.`
` But you still have Ange‐chan, right...?!`
` You're still a mother, aren't you...?!"`
`"Didn't you hear what I just said about bonds?`
` Now that Rudolf‐san is gone, Ange is of no use to me."`
`"......Y‐`
`...you......`
` How can any mother say that about her own daughter?!"`
`"Eva nee‐san.`
` Let's put a stop to this.`
` Stop pretending to be so noble."`
`"Pretending...?!"`
`"Did either of us marry because we wanted children?`
` We didn't, right?`
` We married because we wanted to live with the man we loved.`
` And, once you've married, you never want to let that man go, for the rest of your life, correct?`
` Children are weapons to be used for that goal."`
`"No one would have children for a reason like that...!!"`
`"Some people would have children for a reason like that."`
`Kyrie kept on speaking emotionlessly, ignoring the falling rain......`
`{n}Her relaxed smile did not falter for an instant.`
`"Ange was just a chain I used to tie Rudolf‐san to me.`
` ......Or, you could call her a chess piece, someone to play the role of the kid in our family drama.`
` ......To me, Ange was nothing more than a piece, necessary so that I could act the part of the good mother in front of Rudolf‐san."`
`"......You... ...Could you say that to Ange‐chan's face?!"`
`"Of course, that'd be pointlessly cruel, so I won't say this to her directly.`
` I plan to write her a letter asking her to forgive her bad mother, then vanish from her life.`
` You've seen what Rosa‐san and Maria‐chan are like, right?`
` Now that Rudolf‐san's gone, Ange's just a chain tying me down."`
`"......I'll go back to being just Kyrie, and enjoy the rest of my life at my leisure.`
` A new challenge, and a new life.`
` And maybe even a new love.`
` *giggle*............"`
`"......And you call yourself human......`
` ......You call yourself Ange‐chan's mother?!"`
`"*giggle*giggle*.`
` Who gives a damn about Ange?`
` She's a little brat.`
` I've never once felt any affection for her."`
`"......H‐......how can you......"`
`"You've been released from your family drama too, haven't you?`
` Let's sing the praises of a woman's freedom.`
` You should thank me for having George‐kun killed for you."`
`"Y‐......you.........monstee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}eer!!"`
`"Ahhah{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hah{0}ha{0}a{0}ahh{0}hyah{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhhhh!!!"`
`The two yells...and the sound of gunfire......thundered across the dark rose garden.`
`......Slowly, Eva fell backwards.`
`Then, she landed in a puddle, ......scattering countless drops of water.`
`Across from her, Kyrie spun around as though dancing.`
`Beautiful, black rose petals scattered around her.`
`They were dark red rose petals.`
`......As these rose petals sprayed from her throat, she spun around in a circle,`
` ......and slowly crumpled.`
`Then, she fell to the ground, sending muddy water flying.`
`The two women had both fired their guns......and fallen.........`
`However, when the thunder roared, it was only Eva who sat back up...`
`".........*pant*...`
` .........*pant*...`
` ............*pant*......"`
`Eva hadn't been shot.`
`Kyrie's intensity had made her fall backwards, ......but the bullet had once again only grazed her......`
`Eva cursed her good luck.`
`{n}Why couldn't this luck have saved her husband or her son?`
`"............Die there......for Ange‐chan's sake.`
` .........You'll be killed in the explosion accident.`
` Until the moment of your death, you worried about the daughter you left behind.`
` ......I'll carve that message...`
`into the lid of the cat box........."`
`"......................................."`
`When Kyrie heard this, ......blood dripped from her grinning mouth, and she seemed to say something in response.`
`However, her voice came out only as globs of blood from the hole in her throat, not words......`
`"M‐......`
`Mom......`
` ......Mom......`
` ......Uwaaaaaa......!`
` It's...`
`a lie...`
` .........It's all a lie...!!`
` Aaaaaaagggghhhhhh...!!"`
`"Ange, ...please, calm down...!`
` This is just a game...!`
` That couldn't possibly be what your mother truly feels...!`
` It's just something that the Game Master made Aunt Kyrie's piece say...!!"`
`But saying that did nothing to calm Ange's sobs.`
`I don't blame her.`
` Even if she knows it's just a game, ......she's been forced to see not only her mother's death,`
` ......but also her mother announcing that she was the culprit of a mass murder, who didn't even love her daughter.`
` Anyone would sob after hearing that...`
`"{f:5:Bernkastel}‐san!!`
` Enough of this!!`
` I don't care who the Game Master is!!`
` Stop this pointless game right now!!"`
`When Lion yelled this, the theater suddenly went pitch‐black, swallowed in darkness.`
`However, that wasn't enough to shock Lion.`
`Lion continued to yell {f:5:Bernkastel}'s name into the darkness, telling the witch to stop this game.`
`Then, a single beam of light shone down upon the stage.`
`There......was Clair, the one who had appeared for just a second right before this cruel game began.`
`"Clair...!!`
` So, ......you were the Game Master after all?!`
` ......I don't understand! Why?!"`
`Clair didn't answer.`
`......In fact, ......it looked as though she hadn't even heard.`
`Her eyes were blank, and you couldn't tell what she was looking at.`
`{n}In fact, she was even forgetting to blink...`
`......She looked......just like a doll......`
`Then, another beam of light lit up the side of the stage.`
`Under that light......stood {f:5:Bernkastel}.`
`At the same time, though there appeared to be no one in the audience, a large applause rang out...`
`"........................*giggle*."`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} raised her right hand in response to the applause.`
`{n}She kept doing so until the applause died down......`
`"{f:5:Bernkastel}‐san!!`
` So, ......you were the Master of this game after all...!!"`
`"......Lion.`
` How many times do I have to tell you that I'm not the Game Master?"`
`"Then are you saying it's Clair?!`
` That's impossible...!!"`
`"Yep.`
` That is, of course, impossible.`
` After all,`
` Clair is dead.`
` .........We were just conducting her funeral.`
` Did you forget that......?"`
`"Then just who is standing there......?"`
`"A corpse.`
` It's not taxidermy.`
` So, of course, she still has her insides.`
` ......She's hiding it under a beautiful exterior, but she's actually packed full of guts."`
`When {f:5:Bernkastel} raised her right hand, ......a light fell on it, and a black, shining scythe appeared there.`
`It was a cold, merciless, and cruel object, like something a classic grim reaper might hold.`
`"Wh‐......what are you planning to do.........?"`
`".........When they're alive, you can enjoy watching them struggle.`
` When they're dead, you can enjoy tearing out their guts.`
` Tales are things you get to enjoy twice.`
` ......That's what it means to be a Witch of Theatergoing."`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} pressed the blade of her reaper scythe against Clair's stomach,`
` then slowly slid it across.`
`Then, along the line she traced, Clair's dress was sliced open.`
`It was now clear that the scythe she held was not a fake one for theatrical use.`
` ......And, it was clear just what she planned to do next that made her cruel smile so fitting.`
`"Ange.`
` Can you hear me?"`
`".........I hear you...`
` You tear me to bits, make me read!`
` What's next?!`
` Are you showing me this worst possible tale to hurt me even more?!"`
`"Is this fun for you?!`
` Yeah, I'll bet it is.`
` I had a grand old time with it too...!`
` Did you think......that this would be enough to break me?!`
` You think......I'll sit around crying any longer because of this disgusting game of yours?!!"`
`"......Both you and Lion...`
`seem to have the wrong idea.`
` I'm not the Game Master.`
` This tale is not one that I created."`
`"Then that woman in the dress is the Game Master?!"`
`"No, she isn't...!`
` That can't be!`
` Then who's the Game Master?!`
` Who created this disgusting tale?!!"`
`"You still don't understand?"`
`"What don't we understand?!!"`
`"Ange.`
` You gambled everything on a faint chance of a miracle, throwing yourself forward.`
` ......Out of respect for your courage, I invited you to the two‐day world of October 4th and 5th, 1986."`
`"......What was your goal?`
` To take your family back.`
` ......That would be a very difficult thing, and without the blessing of a miracle, a thoroughly impossible one.`
` You were prepared for that, weren't you?"`
`"Yes, I'm prepared...!!`
` And I still haven't given up on Onii‐chan, Mom, and Dad!"`
`"Whether you give up or not is your choice.`
` That's your own game, after all.`
` I won't support you, and I won't interfere either.`
` I've already enjoyed my fill of games that use you as a piece, so I have no need for you any longer."`
`"Well, that's a relief.`
` Then why am I here?`
` Didn't you invite me?!"`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` I invited you here.`
` ......To thank you for entertaining me for a while, as my piece."`
`"To thank me?!`
` Ha, so this is how witches show gratitude!!`
` Yeah, it's been a real blast, you sick monster!`
` How dare you do this to my parents,`
` ......putting them in this...`
`.........this sick game?!!"`
`"Ange.`
` You made a wish, hoping that you could take your family back.`
` However, you made one more wish.`
` Remember?"`
`"No, I don't!!"`
`"You wanted to know what happened on that day."`
`What happened on Rokkenjima on October 4th and 5th, 1986?`
`Didn't Ange leave on her journey with Amakusa because she longed to answer that question?`
`"That's right......`
` So what's your point?!"`
`"......You don't............mean......"`
`Lion realized what {f:5:Bernkastel} was getting at.`
`And because of that, ......Lion was too shocked to speak......`
`The Game Master isn't {f:5:Bernkastel} or Clair.`
`Then who is it......?`
`That's the wrong question.`
` There is.........no Game Master.`
`That could mean only one thing......`
`"Ange.`
` You still don't understand?"`
`"......What......?"`
`"This is the truth.`
` The insides of the cat box of October 4th and 5th, 1986.`
` After this, Eva survives the explosion by escaping to Kuwadorian.`
` ......And, since she never spoke of the inside of the cat box no matter how much you wanted to know, that truth was shut within the cat box for all eternity."`
`"What......are you saying......?"`
`"Only Eva returned alive.`
` Even though the police claimed it was an accident, the public didn't believe it.`
` Then, she took over her husband's company, and the harder she worked to make it more and more successful, the more enemies she made.`
` In the eyes of the public, she became viewed as the queen of a vast criminal plot."`
`"......I'm sure she wanted to tell people what really happened.`
` The truth that no one would ever believe without proof.`
` .........Bit by bit, Eva's heart began to snap."`
`"You rejected Eva just like everyone else, so she rejected you in turn.`
` You were the last two members of your family, and your relationship was completely strained.`
` Each time she compared you with her beloved son, she grew more and more twisted and broken."`
`Then, a strange message bottle was picked up and became a topic of conversation.`
`It contained a bizarre story, one which told of a mysterious serial murder related to the gold on Rokkenjima.`
`Everyone rejected the explosion accident theory and started to think up conspiracy theories.`
`Some of those theories named Eva as the culprit, which tormented her even more.`
`But Eva used even that to create the cat box.`
`And until the moment of her death, she protected it.`
`{n}She protected the lock that held the cat box shut.`
`So, no {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} would ever reach the truth inside the cat box.`
`{n}Not unless the witches who crossed the sea of fragments opened the lock......`
`"This is the truth."`
`"...............You're lying......`
` ......You're lying......lying...!!`
` If this was actually true, you'd be able to say it using the red truth!!`
` But you can't, of course you can't!!`
` Aaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahh!!!"`
`"Ange...!!`
` Ange, calm down...!!`
` Ungh, ......ah...?!"`
`Ange writhed with such strength that the chains on her arms and legs looked like they might snap.`
`All over her body, ......a red, gooey liquid started to seep out.`
`It was as though cracks had opened up all over her and blood was leaking out of all of them.`
`"What's that?`
` You want me to announce it clearly with the red truth?`
` Then I'll do that, just for you."`
`{a:c:`
`"‘{p:1:This is all truth}`
`}`
`{a:c:`
`"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!"`
`}`
`Ange's scream covered up Bern's red truth.`
`"*giggle*giggle*giggle*,`
` ahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha...!!`
` Stupid kid.`
` If only you hadn't made me say that, I could've shut it up inside the cat box."`
`"But you did tell me to, right?`
` I knew you would, of course.`
` And I so wanted to see you scream like that."`
`".........What a lovely expression, one that'll keep me laughing for about a hundred years.`
` ......*giggle*giggle*, *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!!`
` Go back to being scrap meat.`
` Ahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!!"`
`"Uwaaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahh, gyaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhhh!!"`
`"Mom, Dad,`
` ......it's a lie, right?!`
` Lies,`
` ......lies......`
`...gyaaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhhh........."`
`"A‐Ange......!`
` Ange......?!"`
`As Ange held her head and screamed, the blood dripping from her finally grew so thick that it started scattering all over the place.`
`Then, bit by bit, her body began to melt—no, to fall apart.`
`{n}Then, bits of her began to pile up on the chair, ......until she was nothing but a pile of guts and scraps......`
`"Ahhahahahahahahahahahahah, aaaahhahahahahaaaaahhaahaha!!`
` Is the truth really such a precious thing?`
` How absurd, how foolish!!"`
`"Why can't {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s control their own truth?`
` They stupidly search for the truth like that's all that matters, and when they finally find it and can't stand it, they turn themselves into scrap meat!!"`
`"Hey, are you watching?`
` Clair?`
` .........You wanted to hide this truth too, didn't you?"`
`"For fun, you wrote several cat box tales,`
` and sealed them in message bottles like the end of one of those mystery novels you admired.`
` Then, you threw them into the sea.`
` To save those who would suffer if they knew the truth...!!"`
`"You sealed everything in a cat box, and Eva provided the lock.`
` *giggle*giggle*!!`
` And I've sliced that box open for you...!!"`
`"Ahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha,`
` all that effort you spent to hide it has gone to waste!!`
` I've exposed all of the truth you hid with your death!!`
` Ahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hah{0}hah{0}hah{0}hah{0}hah{0}ha!!"`
`"Is that......what you've been after?!`
` You......did all of this just to insult Clair's death?!!`
` And then...you showed it to Ange to make her suffer...!`
` You really were......an evil witch after all!!"`
`"I've been a witch the whole time.`
` A traveler whose only goal is to escape boredom.`
` ......Care for it and love it while it's alive, then eat the guts when it's dead.`
` That's how witches live!"`
`"What you have done is unforgivable to me...!!`
` You've hurt Ange and humiliated Clair, ......the person I would become in another world...!!`
` I cannot forgive you for this...!!"`
`"Lion.`
` Despite all of this, you are what Clair longs to be.`
` Even after death, she longs for it."`
`"..................!"`
`"From the moment that Clair was thrown from the cliff, her fate was already sealed.`
` I'm sure it gave her a little bit of salvation to know that another "her"...`
`lives in happiness in another world."`
`"......That's right.`
` I'm her salvation...!`
` So, I must live life to the fullest...live life for the both of us...!"`
`"Lion.`
` ......Let me show you just a bit more of this tale of the truth."`
`"I'm not interested!"`
`"Don't worry, it'll be very interesting.`
` ......After the duel between Eva and Kyrie, the guesthouse is wrapped in silence.`
` Let me invite you to the parlor at that point in time."`
`"The parlor......?`
` The one in the mansion?"`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} snapped her fingers, and the scene of the mansion's parlor unfolded before them.`
`In the cruel tale they had just been shown, the parlor hadn't been particularly important.`
`Jessica had been summoned to the parlor, but she was then immediately led to the dining hall and killed there.`
`So, there had been nothing in the parlor.`
`{n}And, right now, there was nothing in the parlor that appeared before Lion.`
`"Just what is supposed to be here?"`
`"*giggle*.`
` ......As you can see, there's nothing here.`
` But watch.`
` I'm about to show you something interesting."`
`"If you call it interesting, that's a sure sign that it isn't."`
`"*giggle*giggle*.`
` ......Go on, take a look.`
` ......It's right there.`
` Right in that corner."`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} was pointing.........at nothing more than a corner of the room.`
`There was nothing there.`
`She had told Lion to look there, so Lion was expecting something terrible to be there,`
` ......but there really was nothing there at all.`
`"..............................??"`
`"......That's right, there's nothing there.`
` At least, not in this world.`
` But what if we peek into the next fragment over......?"`
`".....................?!"`
`On the white, blank wall...`
`...bit...`
`by bit...`
`...a splash of blood seeped into view.`
`Then, right there, .........a corpse appeared.`
`{n}But, ......that couldn't be.........`
`"Th‐`
`......this is......`
`......m‐`
`............me......?!"`
`It was Lion, ......lying dead against the wall......`
`Ushiromiya Lion's corpse lay there exposed......`
`"Wh‐what's going on here......?`
` Why am I here...?`
` ......This is supposed to be Clair's world, not mine...!`
` Clair and I can't exist at the same time, right...?!"`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` That's because I just switched worlds, switched fragments.`
` Switched to your world, that is."`
`"......I don't understand!"`
`"It's very simple.`
` They both end the same way.`
` .........*giggle*giggle*!!"`
`"I don't get it!!`
` Why would I be dead here?!!"`
`"In your world,`
` on October 4th, 1986,`
` Beatrice's funeral was held just before the family conference."`
`"Yes, I know that.`
` And for me, that happened today, a short while ago!"`
`"From that time until late that night, do you know what happened...?"`
`"Nothing at all!!`
` The cousins are all going to play together, and the whole family will have dinner together!"`
`"Then, that night, the family conference took place.`
` .........You were going to succeed the headship when you turned twenty, right?`
` Was the entire family satisfied with that, I wonder...?"`
`".........I don't know if they're satisfied, but the decision has been made.`
` ......The head made it himself."`
`"Looks like even you don't believe they were satisfied.`
` That's it right there.`
` ......Kinzo adored you more than anything...and tried to make an exception and set you up as the next head.`
` Of course, his children wouldn't have been happy with that."`
`The siblings objected to having Lion succeed the headship.`
`Even Krauss joined in, saying that Lion was still too young.`
`Then, on the night of the family conference, Kinzo tried proposing a difficult riddle......`
`"You.........don't mean..............."`
`"That's right.`
` The riddle of the epitaph.`
` .........As you can tell by the mechanism set into the chapel, Kinzo thought up the epitaph trick near the beginning, when the mansion on Rokkenjima was being built.`
` ......He had the romantic idea of someday using it as a test to select the next head."`
`Kinzo decided to present that riddle at the family conference.`
`Did he plan to give the position of successor to the person who solved it?`
` Or did he promise to reconsider Lion's position as the head if it was solved?`
`Either way, Kinzo was confident.`
`He was confident that no one would be able to solve this tough riddle, which he had created himself.`
`"After that, everything happened exactly like the truth you just saw.`
` The siblings solved it right away, and there was a clash over the pile of gold.`
` *giggle*......"`
`"Then, Kyrie and Rudolf carried out the late night murders to prevent any chance of the crime being discovered the next morning and an outcry being raised.`
` .........They called the kids out from the cousins' room one by one, then killed them."`
`"......As the first of the cousins, you were the first to be called out.`
` Then, Kyrie shot you dead right here in the parlor."`
`".........No, that's not quite right.`
` You're the Ushiromiya Lion from the early evening of October 4th, 1986.`
` So, I'll say it this way.`
` ......Tonight, Kyrie will shoot you dead in the parlor."`
`"That's............insane............`
` It's—that's right, probability!"`
`"Just like the miracle called Lion only has a slight probability of arising from Clair,`
` Aunt Kyrie must only commit murder with a tiny probability close to zero!`
` Aren't you the witch who specializes in finding extremely improbable worlds?!!"`
`"That is correct.`
` I had to find one fragment out of 2,578,917 in order to discover the miracle that is you."`
`"......However,`
` it was very, very easy to find this result for your world.`
` After all, probability isn't a factor.`
` .........I'm a witch who can find any miracle, no matter how unlikely it is."`
`"But I can't find things that don't exist.`
` ......If the Witch of Certainty really guarantees that something is certain, even I can't win against her."`
`"But...`
`......then...`
`...I.................."`
`"With a 2,578,916 out of 2,578,917 probability,`
` you live in the world as Clair, are toyed with by an inescapable fate, and meet with a tragic end.`
` And, with a 1 out of 2,578,917 probability, you live as Ushiromiya Lion...`
`and are killed by Kyrie tonight."`
`".........In other words, your fate—no, the fate the two of you share—traps you in an inescapable dead end, a hell of fate, with a 2,578,917 out of 2,578,917 probability.`
` .........To put it another way, it's a certain fate, with absolutely no chance for a miracle!"`
`"*giggle*, ehe{0}he{0}he{0}he{0}he{0}he{0}he{0}he{0}heh!!`
` Too bad for you, Clair.`
` No, {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`A bright light seemed to turn the world white—then, the next moment, they were back in the theater.`
`As Clair stood absolutely still on the stage, the tip of {f:5:Bernkastel}'s reaper scythe traced a line across her stomach.`
`A red line was drawn across her white skin, exposed now that the dress had been cut, and black blood began to seep out......`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}.`
` Trapped in that inescapable, certain, locked‐away pair of days, you became a witch who could give birth to endless possibilities within that two‐day cat box.`
` ......In exchange, it was absolutely certain that you would not be saved or rewarded."`
`"However, you had a dream.`
` ......You dreamed of Ushiromiya Lion.`
` .........You consoled yourself with the thought of a miracle world, where you could have lived in happiness and would never have become Clair!"`
`".........I really had to work hard to find Lion.`
` As Beato dreamed, Lion's existence was a true miracle.`
` And, at the end of your funeral, I wanted to show you.`
` .........That even {i:with} that miracle, you couldn't have escaped this tragedy!!"`
`Faced with the little bit of sky that she could see through the bars of the jail that imprisoned her,`
` the witch called {f:5:Beatrice} dreamed of a world where she might have been happy...`
`However, the sky beyond the bars...`
`.........was also part of a larger jail......`
`"The more I hear......the less I understand about you......!`
` Why......would you do something like this...?!"`
`"I lost a game to Beato, so I wanted to get back at her.`
` ......*giggle*giggle*!!`
` Yeah, now I feel a lot better about losing that game...!`
` Hey, Beato, are you watching?`
` Can you see this?!`
` And do you remember?`
` Remember when I promised you that there would be absolutely no miracles?!"`
`"Ahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hah, ahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haa{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!`
` So, Lion!`
` Allow me to return you to your world, right before Beato's eyes!!"`
`"It looks like the Witches of Theatergoing are all sick and tired of those happy family get‐together scenes.`
` So, I'll send you to the moment just before Kyrie shoots you!`
` Then, I'll make sure Beato witnesses that moment!!"`
`"Ahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hah{0}hah{0}hah{0}ha{0}haha!!`
` Die, pukespittle Lion!`
` The last hope of pukespittle Beato, uhyah{0}hah{0}hyaah{0}ha{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhh!!!"`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} raised her reaper scythe,`
` .........swung it down with gusto,`
` ......and plunged it deep into Clair's stomach......`
`"Did you think you'd get an easy death?`
` Hehihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi!!`
` But humiliating a corpse and tearing out its guts is what I'm best at...!!"`
`Heartlessly, ruthlessly, brutally, ......she swung the enormous blade buried in Clair's stomach back up towards the heavens.`
`.........Along a vertical line from Clair's stomach to her chest,`
` ......the blade cut deeply,`
` .........slicing Clair open.`
`Her red‐black innards...`
`...jutted out...`
`...and then, like a dam breaking, they burst out of her stomach, covering the world with dark red entrails......`
`"S‐steal the Italians' gold, you say?`
` You coward, Ushiromiya! And you call yourself a soldier of the Empire?!!"`
`".........F‐Father......?`
` I, I do love and respect you, Father......`
` B‐but......your feelings are something I, ummm......"`
`"Why...?!!`
` Why did you save me?!`
` Why didn't you let me die?!`
` Because of that terrible injury, ......I've been forced to live in a body like this!!`
` I never wanted to live in a body like this!!"`
`"This body isn't even capable of love......!!`
` What's...what's the point in living like that?!`
` This isn't a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}'s life...!!`
` It's like being furniture!!"`
`"That's right, I'm...furniture......!!`
` Furniture...!!`
` Why, .........why didn't you let me die back then?!!`
` Aaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhhh......!!!"`
`"..................Huh—"`
`When I came to,`
` ......I was in the parlor of the mansion.`
`When did I get here?`
`......I heard a sound behind me, then slowly turned around......`
`And there...............`
`"Sorry. Please don't take this personally."`
`"..................Huh—"`
`I could see down the frigid barrel of the gun Aunt Kyrie was pointing.`
`Then...`
`......slowly...`
`......she pulled the trigger......`
`I could feel a razor‐sharp wind pass through my body like a knife slicing through butter.`
`......Prepared for death, and hoping to see my fate until the end, I slowly opened my eyes...`
`.........The world had been cut in two.`
`Kyrie was frozen in place like a statue, still pointing her gun with a cold smile on her face...`
`...and had been cut in half at an angle, the top part of her slowly sliding off to the side.`
`No, that wasn't quite right.`
` That wasn't right at all.`
`It wasn't just Kyrie.`
` The whole world had been sliced in half at an angle, and was slowly sliding off to one side.`
`Fissures seemed to appear across the world, and before I had any time to process it, the world shattered.`
`"..................?!`
` ......Y‐......you......!"`
`"......When you own a cat, you tend to pick up their habits."`
`He pointed at {f:5:Bernkastel} with the tip of the pitch‐black sword that had sliced the world, glaring at her.`
`"*giggle*giggle*......`
` ......What's this?`
` Are you saying you came back here on a whim...?"`
`"......There was no way you'd end things on a happy note.`
` Do you really hate {f:5:Beatrice} so much?"`
`"You think I'd let her win and get away...?`
` I have to pay her back in full for the humiliation she caused me.`
` When I hold a grudge, I don't forget about it for a hundred years."`
`"You're a gloomy person."`
`"Please, you mustn't ignore my heart.`
` ......*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!"`
`"Are you okay, Lion?`
` .........Hey, what's wrong?!"`
`Lion had suddenly doubled over, groaning.`
`".........My chest...`
`.........hurts.........`
` ......It's......"`
`Will roughly grabbed the hand that was pressed against Lion's chest and tore it away.`
`Blood was seeping out of the place that Lion's hand had been.`
`......It was the place that the bullet would have entered if Kyrie had shot Lion.`
`"*giggle*.`
` ......Lion's body is already in the process...`
`...of accepting its fate."`
`"Lion, hang in there!`
` ......Damn these chains...!"`
`When Will tried to pick Lion up, he finally noticed the chains attached to each wrist and ankle.`
`"What's this?`
` Are you trying to take that kid and escape?`
` I won't let you.`
` Lion needs to cough up blood, despairing at the fact that there is no hope in any of the many worlds.`
` We're all here to watch Lion die in agony and despair."`
`"Lion isn't a show."`
`Will swung his pitch‐black sword and destroyed the chains binding Lion.`
`The chains and shackles shattered into little bits like glass...then vanished.`
`"You intend to get in the way of my fun......?"`
`"You aren't God.`
` All you can do is sneer at fate.`
` .........Lion's fate is decided by Lion.`
` You can't use a human's fate like a toy."`
`".........*giggle*giggle*,`
` hah{0}ha{0}hah{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha...!!`
` You've got guts, saying that to the great {f:5:Bernkastel}, witch of the Senate!`
` I have no more use for you either, get it...?"`
`"You've shown that Beato's fantasy is a mystery and cut it to pieces.`
` You've fulfilled your role.`
` I would've let you be, if only you'd just left quietly.`
` Now that you've strolled on back here, you can hardly complain when I make you my plaything, can you?"`
`"Come to me, my sweet little kitties.`
` ......Scratch them up and tear off their skin.`
` Peel them like grapes...!"`
`When {f:5:Bernkastel} clapped her hands twice, countless pairs of glaring jewels appeared all around Will and Lion.`
`They were clearly cat eyes, but their breathing sounded far more terrifying than any cat...`
`"......Will......`
` ......Nnnghh......"`
`"I'll handle this.`
` Trimming kitty nails is nothing new to me."`
`The number of jewels surrounding them already reached into the thousands.`
`Will pointed his sword in one direction after another, warding off the surrounding cats......`
`"Get a grip, Lion.`
` You haven't been shot.`
` Don't accept that you've been—no, don't accept that you're {i:going} to be shot...!"`
`"...........................nngggghhh......"`
`Lion tried to fight an incredible tearing pain.`
`No, ......it was a fight against the promised future that {f:5:Bernkastel} had shown.`
`However, the gouging stake representing that future, which the Witch of Miracles had guaranteed would hold absolutely no miracle, was firm and merciless......`
`Bit by bit, and yet unceasingly, it continued to pierce Lion's chest......`
`"......Listen up.`
` ......I'm gonna break through their perimeter for just a second.`
` When I do, you need to run with all you've got.`
` Don't change direction, just keep running.`
` It doesn't matter where to.`
` Just make sure you get far away from this place, and keep on running no matter what happens."`
`"...............I'll try...`
`...to the best of my ability......`
` ......If I can't do it,`
` ......please forgive me........."`
`"......If you {i:can't}?`
` Never say die.`
` I won't let you.`
` Clair won't let you."`
`"......Did you forget that you're Clair's 1 in 2,578,917 chance?`
` If you give up, you're betraying all the other "you"s in countless worlds......!!`
` So don't lose heart! Keep on struggling and struggling...!!`
` Don't look for a miracle... Be one!!"`
`"......Be.........a miracle........."`
`"You're gonna reach a happy future.`
` You can't give up, and you can't complain.`
` Just you try complaining one more time.`
` I'll be the one pinching your ass...!"`
`"............O‐.........okay......"`
`"*giggle*giggle*.`
` Ahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hah{0}hah{0}hah{0}hah{0}hahha!!`
` How very confident you are, telling this kid to be a miracle when you stand before the Witch of Miracles...!`
` Miracles are no more than fantasy!`
` Grovel in this world that has been convicted as a mystery, and die horribly like a worm!`
` The Witches of Theatergoing are looking forward to watching it!!"`
`"......Hmph.`
` You call that mystery?`
` You think I'd ever accept a mystery without heart?`
` ......Let the cat who wants to be made into a {c:86EF9C:shamisen} strike first."`
`"Gah, what a pain.`
` Let's have all of you at once!`
` I'm Willard {nobr:H. Wright}, SSVD's Chief Inquisitor.`
` This'll be the final time I draw my sword...!"`
`"Trash him, kitties."`
`At once, all of the cat eyes opened wide, undulated and spun in a spiral, then swallowed Will up.`
`But Will and Lion were not swallowed up.`
`As though a balloon had expanded around the two of them and burst, the cats that had flown in at them from all directions were now being launched away.`
`"......Oh, not bad."`
`"I don't give a damn about your kitties.`
` It's just the mama cat I care about.`
` .........{f:5:Bernkastel}, Witch of Miracles!!`
` It's about time someone trimmed your claws!!"`
`Another flash of the black blade spun in a black tornado and scattered the cats once more.`
`Lion, realizing that this was the opening Will had planned to make, ran all out, hand on chest.`
`"......Will, ......I'm running."`
`"Diana has a weak stomach.`
` Make sure you only give her warm milk."`
`"Huh?"`
`Before Lion could ask Will to repeat what he had said, Will had already leapt onto the stage and was now confronting {f:5:Bernkastel}.`
`It was like the climax of a show.`
` ......Loud cheers erupted from the pitch‐black audience seating.`
`On either side of Clair, who lay with her insides exposed,`
` ......stood Will, with his pitch‐black sword, and {f:5:Bernkastel}, with the scythe that could harvest miracles from fate.`
`"Kyrie and Rudolf are the culprits, and they massacred the people on the island?`
` They called Lion out to the parlor, then shot Lion to death?`
` Sorry, but the concept of mysteries rejects this "truth" of yours.`
` This is all fantasy."`
`"Fantasy?`
` You're calling it that to try and let Lion escape fate?`
` By all means, try.`
` *cackle*cackle*, *giggle*giggle*giggle*!!`
` Ahh{0}hah{0}hah{0}hah{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha, hiiyaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aah{0}haa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhh!!!"`
`"{p:1:Rule #1. It is forbidden to have a crime without all clues presented}."`
`......Will's black sword had cut through {f:5:Bernkastel}'s body at a diagonal angle.`
`However, it had no effect, ......like cutting the reflection of the moon on the water.`
`"What's this?`
` What do you mean by "clues"?"`
`"I won't accept your "mystery" with Kyrie and Rudolf as the culprits.`
` ......You won't find clues showing that they're the culprits no matter which game you look at."`
`"Of course you won't.`
` Even if they did exist at one point, the whole island blew up."`
`"Which means there aren't any clues.`
` And that means this is no mystery.`
` It's fantasy."`
`"......Huuh...?"`
`It is impossible for an unprovable truth to become truth in the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} world.`
`In other words, even the truth cannot leave the cat box.`
`"Ahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!`
` Are you trying to shut the {i:truth} inside the cat box?`
` *giggle*giggle*, is this how the mystery genre is supposed to fight?`
` Ahhahhah{0}hah{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!`
` Hiiyahhha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhh!!"`
`With a laugh like the howl of a wild animal, {f:5:Bernkastel} carelessly tossed her scythe aside.`
`"You're not even worth fighting.`
` Get over here, pukespittle.`
` Try and cut me all you like.`
` I'll listen to all you've got to say."`
`".........The twenty wedges'll pierce every part of your heartless mystery.`
` Here it comes."`
`"And when you realize that you can't defeat me with those twenty wedges, .........you know what'll happen next, right?`
` *giggle*, come on.`
` I'll play with you, ......and these twenty wedges of yours!"`
`"Haaaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhhh!!!"`
`Trying to ignore an incredibly painful chest, ......Lion kept on running and running without stopping.`
`I dashed out of the theater of the Witches of Theatergoing, then ran through an incomprehensible world of blackness.`
`Before I knew it, I was running through a place that looked like a sea of stars,`
` ......or maybe the bottom of the ocean with stars scattered around.`
`If I get careless for a second, I'll probably trip.`
`No, if I get careless, I won't be able to tell whether I'm running or just making running motions as I free fall,`
` ......endlessly sinking deeper into the ocean of stars.`
`I just kept on running, without any goal or target.`
`I mustn't stop moving.`
`{n}I mustn't fall here.`
`If I fall, ......I'll crush the hope of the "me"s in countless worlds...`
`The happy world that the {f:5:Beatrice}s dreamed of.`
`I'm their last hope, the only one who can reach that world...`
`......Even though I understand this, ............the witch who controls miracles has declared there will be no miracle,`
` ......and the "truth" that she thrust in front of me with those words gouges cruelly into my chest......`
`".................................`
` ......Sorry, .........Will.........`
` ......My body......can't............"`
`Lion finally...`
`...succumbed to the fierce pain and fate...`
`...and fell over......`
`Lion's body was held roughly from behind and lifted up.`
`"............!!`
` ......W‐......Will......!!`
` You're okay.........!"`
`"No, not really.`
` ......Don't give up. Didn't I tell you I'd pinch your ass?"`
`"......I'm sorry...`
` ......I'm really sorry......`
` ...But...`
`...that day, that place, is where I was fated to be killed......"`
`"That's right.`
` All humans are fated to die in the end.`
` Does that mean their lives are meaningless?"`
`"Of course not.`
` What a person's life means, what it's worth, what it is—these are things a person decides for themselves.`
` ......So what if a fate's been forced upon you?`
` Don't accept it.`
` Create your own world...for yourself...!"`
`".........Will, ......your...left arm......!"`
`"Ah, right...... Must have forgotten it.`
` It'd be a pain to go back and get it now."`
`There were rips all over Will's body.`
`Also, his left arm had been brutally torn off from the elbow, his clothes were in tatters, ......and he looked like a blood‐stained scarecrow...`
`Then, Lion noticed.`
`Though this place had once felt like a sea filled with stars, both above and below them,`
` ......those stars had now gathered together and were surrounding them...`
`That huge number of stars, grouped in even‐numbered clusters, all glared at the two of them...`
`Will was holding Lion with one arm.`
` He couldn't take his sword out.`
`{n}However, he didn't let go.`
`......He was determined to let Lion escape from here, and to lead Lion towards the happy tale that the {f:5:Beatrice}s had dreamed of.`
`Through the cats whose eyes glowed in the empty darkness...the queen of cats who permitted no miracles appeared......`
`".........Willard.`
` Put Lion down.`
` If you do, I'll let you go."`
`"Go file a protest with the Great Court.`
` You can put it up for debate."`
`".........Will,`
` ......please............"`
`"I won't leave you behind.`
` ......Let me tell you...`
`why I quit SSVD."`
`"......Come to think of it, even I don't know that.`
` ......Why'd you do it?"`
`"It's because I got fed up with all those damn sob story mysteries.`
` .........We're gonna survive and make a happy ending."`
`"I'm gonna show her.`
` {f:5:Beatrice} died in despair, thinking that there were only bad endings, and I'm gonna show her that a happy ending can exist.`
` So I'll never put you down."`
`"..................Will......"`
`"You can take the rest of my left arm, cats.`
` I'll give you my legs too, if you want them.`
` ......But I'm not letting go of Lion here.`
` ......I'm gonna let Lion escape your bad ending if I have to crawl out of here......!"`
`"Are you okay with this, Lion?`
` Will's planning to die protecting you.`
` You don't want that, right?`
` Go ahead and tell him to leave you be and save himself."`
`"...............Will......"`
`"Yeah."`
`"......Please, ............don't leave me here......!`
` ......I'll survive......for certain!`
` And so will you...!!"`
`"That's the spirit."`
`As he said this, Will held Lion tight.`
`"There you have it.`
` We'll keep struggling on, {f:5:Bernkastel}."`
`"We won't give up on the chance of a miracle...!"`
`"I'm amazed you can say that when the Witch of Miracles has promised you that there will be absolutely no miracles.`
` .........*giggle*giggle*,`
` ehheh{0}eh{0}eheha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!`
` So long, you two.`
` Go collect dust in the depths of oblivion, unable even to die, and disappear!!"`
`"Come, my kitties.`
` I won't tell you to kill them.`
` There are no more scenes for these two pieces... Put them away."`
`A billion, a trillion, a quadrillion cats all bared their fangs.`
`In the starry sky of cat eyes, countless flesh‐colored mouths opened, exposing countless teeth.`
`{a:c:......The world was wrapped in flesh and blood and fangs}.``Two white pieces were set on the chessboard.`
`......The countless black pieces surrounding them were packed tightly together, not even placed on the squares anymore.`
`Then, {f:5:Bernkastel} tipped the two white pieces over...`
`...and took them off the board.`
`"May I end it there?"`
`".........Yes.`
` Your reading truly does fit my ears well, my miko."`
`"As you wished, I've scraped out even the inner parts of the guts.`
` Was this enough to check your answers with?"`
`"Yes.`
` ......I am very satisfied.`
` Using the answer you have revealed as a key, I will go back through all the tales so far,`
` opening the locked rooms like treasure boxes, one by one."`
`".........It's fun finding the key.`
` And it's even more fun to stick it into all the locks.`
` You have done well, my miko.`
` From this point on, I would like to enjoy my thoughts alone.`
` This has been enough......"`
`The Witch of Theatergoing sat back in her rocking chair, a satisfied smile on her face, as though enjoying a pleasant aftertaste.`
`There was no need for a game board anymore.`
`She just had to go back in her mind, through the whole set of tales, to check whether her theory was right or not.`
`It seemed to leave her pleasantly drunk, even better than the most expensive wine......`
`".........Are you done with me now?"`
`"You have done well, my miko.`
` I absolve you of your duty.`
` ......I will return to my slumber.`
` I'd like to enjoy this pleasant dream for a few more centuries."`
`"And when I grow tired of that,`
` ......you will find yet another tale to keep me entertained.`
` ......For those centuries, which will pass in the blink of an eye,`
` I grant you your freedom."`
`"Heheheheheh......`
` Splendidly done, {f:5:Bernkastel}, my darling, darling miko......"`
`".........That's not my concern.`
` Just shrivel up and die, won't you.`
` So long, for the rest of time."`
`"You call a few mere centuries "for the rest of time"?`
` *cackle*cackle*...............`
` ......................................."`
`{f:5:Featherine}'s consciousness slowly faded away.`
`As the owner of the study's slumber grew deeper,`
` ......the lights about the room slowly darkened.`
`"Good night forever, Auaurora.`
` ............You don't need this game board anymore.`
` I'll take it."`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} reached out towards Beato's game board, which lay on the table in front of {f:5:Featherine}'s rocking chair, and tapped it twice.`
`The game board and the pieces flew into the air, folded up and put themselves away, then landed on {f:5:Bernkastel}'s outstretched right hand.`
`"......I still haven't had a chance to do any real Game Mastering.`
` ......I just did Beato's funeral.`
` That, and tearing out the guts.`
` ............I still haven't done anything."`
`{f:5:Bernkastel}'s smile twisted evilly.`
`Then, the game board floated up once again, .........and a world unfolded itself above {f:5:Bernkastel}'s palm......`
`"Now, pieces of Beato's game......?`
` I'm going to have you spin a truly brutal tale to truly entertain me.`
` Tremble with fear of the absolute fate you have been promised.`
` ......By the name of {f:5:Bernkastel}, Witch of Miracles,`
` ......and as the final Game Master of Beato's game, I proclaim it."`
`"......Though just saying it would be boring.`
` ......Maybe I should follow Beato's rules and say it in red."`
`"Good idea, I think.`
` It looks like there might still be some witches with naive dreams."`
`"Ah, Lambda. So you're here?`
` Of course you are. You're always wherever I am."`
`"Go on and say it.`
` You tell those naive dreamers."`
`"Yes, I will.`
` ......As the Witch of Miracles, and as the final Game Master, I proclaim the start of the final game.`
` And I make you this promise."`
`{a:c:`
`{p:1:I will not give this game a happy ending.}}`
`*sob*.`
` ......*sob*sob*......`
`A single girl......was crying in a desolate, quiet chapel.`
`She was a small girl.`
` ......Only six years old.`
`The girl who would, for twelve years starting now,`
` lament the fact that she wasn't on the island on October 4th and 5th, 1986......`
`Then,`
` .........a man appeared......`
`The man noticed the girl,`
` ......walked up to her quietly, trying not to scare her,`
` ......and put an arm gently around her shoulder......`
`".........Onii‐chan..............."`
`"I've been looking for you, Ange......"`
`The girl jumped into her big brother's chest and started crying again...`
`"What's wrong?`
` ......Why are you so sad?"`
`"Today, a kid in class bullied me......`
` He said the people on TV were saying Mom had ties to bad people.`
` .........So, he said that Mom and Dad were the culprits, and that they probably killed everyone......`
` ......I asked Auntie Eva, hoping she'd say it wasn't true, but she didn't say anything......`
` ......Mom and Dad aren't bad people, are they?`
` Are they...?"`
`"Poor thing......`
` ......Everyone says whatever they please about what might have happened on that island on that day...`
` ......Sit over here."`
`"...............Okay..."`
`When the man pointed to the floor, a group of gold butterflies gathered there and created a chair.`
`The girl obediently sat down on it......`
`"......You know, don't you, Onii‐chan?`
` You know that Mom and Dad aren't bad people, right?"`
`"Yeah. Of course I know that.`
` ......I know that none of them were bad people."`
`"Then tell me.`
` What happened that day?`
` What happened on Rokkenjima?"`
`"Okay.`
` .........I'll tell you.`
` This is what happened on that day."`
`"Is it......a scary story...?"`
`"Come now."`
`"Is it a sad story......?"`
`"Of course not."`
`"Then, ......what kind of story is it......?"`
`"You can decide that for yourself when you hear it.`
` It isn't a painful story at all.`
` So listen up."`
`"Okay,`
` Battler onii‐chan......"`
`"On that day, we all went to Rokkenjima.`
` There were a lot of us.`
` It was an important day, the day of the family conference."`
`".........Hmm, where should I start?"`
`{a:c:`
`This is...`
`the final game, made just for Ange.`
`}`
`{a:c:`
`Listen, Ange.`
`This is what happened on Rokkenjima on that day.`
`It isn't sad or painful at all.........`
