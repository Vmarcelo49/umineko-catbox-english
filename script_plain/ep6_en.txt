A beautiful glow shone in from the skylight over the grand cathedral.
The place was somehow different from the way it had been during the witches\' trial.
{n}The decorations had changed.
The several pleasantly sparkling white ribbons were paper‐thin, but they hung beautifully in the air.
Flowers were arranged all over in a way that would make any place look cheerful.
It was like how a single drop of impure water could spoil an entire cask of wine.
Just the presence of the flowers, the ribbons, and the red carpet that ran down the center of the room...
made it hard to believe that this was the same place Ushiromiya Natsuhi had been falsely accused of a crime...
It had truly become......a wedding chapel.
"Love is generous, love is merciful!"
"Love does not envy, it does not boast!"
These words, spoken by two demons who seemed to be in charge of this gathering, were part of a ceremony for making an oath of love before the eyes of God.
Of course, in this wedding celebrated by demons, there was no priest in sight.
{n}Instead, there stood the witch who controls miracles.
"In sickness and in health.
 ......Yeah, a wife\'s true job is to be supportive in times of sickness.
 Isn\'t that right, Erika?"
"......Yes.
 My master......"
"That looks good on you.
 What a fitting outfit for the one who has conquered the bridegroom.
 *giggle*giggle*giggle*."
"Ehehehehehehehehehe.
 I\'m honored, my master."
The bride standing on the carpeted path...was Furudo Erika.
{n}......The groom\'s face couldn\'t be seen.
The bride\'s outfit was, without a doubt, a pure‐white wedding dress.
The bride\'s veil represented both the white of God\'s blessings...and the white of the demons\' cruelty.
A great many goat nobles, witches, and demons were gathered for this wedding.
If only their heads hadn\'t been those of goats,
 it would probably have seemed to be a very refined crowd worthy of this great cathedral...
"......I\'d expect no less of you, Bern.
 Every single thing you come up with is always so screwed up."
"A wife to support her ailing husband.
 ......Isn\'t that wonderful?
 It suits you, Erika."
"......And......congratulations to you too,
 ......Mr. Groom."
At that point, ......{f:5:Bernkastel} stared straight into the groom\'s eyes.
The groom...
...didn\'t answer.
His eyes were gray.
......His lips would mutter something from time to time, but no one could tell if the words meant anything.
{a:c:
"Hey, ......{i:are you listening}?
 All of you?"}
She spoke to the groom in the plural.
{n}......Of course, there was only one groom.
And, of course, the gray‐eyed groom didn\'t answer...
"*giggle*giggle*giggle*.
 You can hear, but you can\'t answer, right?
 ......Don\'t worry, okay,
 Battler‐san?"
"...............nn..................gah......"
"I\'ll take everything of yours,
 ......and trample all over it......
 *giggle*giggle*giggle*!!"
"Ehhahahahahahahaahahahahahaahahahahaha...!!"
The Witch of Miracles sneered with an evil smile that would make even demons want to avert their gaze.
Even that sneer...
...provoked no response...
...from Battler\'s dim eyes.
"People live for the sake of love!
 Therefore, today, you have fulfilled the purpose of your lives."
"Oh, how great is the power to live, the power of love...!
 I pray that the brightness of this day blesses these two for all time!"
"......Just give it a rest already, you demons.
 What comes next?"
"The couple will now make an oath of eternal love."
"After that, they will exchange rings...!"
On Battler\'s hand......was a ring bearing the seal of the One‐winged Eagle, proof that he was the territory lord of this world.
And on Erika\'s finger was a diamond ring that could not be shattered by any miracle.
Diamonds signify an "eternal bond".
{n}However, in Greek, the word for "diamond" simply means "unbreakable".
Erika wasn\'t vowing to love Battler forever.
{n}She just wanted to take Battler as her property for all eternity.
This wedding was being performed......for the sole purpose of humiliating Battler.
"......Don\'t worry.
 I won\'t love you forever.
 After all, the point of this ceremony is to make you submit to me.
 ...Your heart will be shut inside an inescapable locked room forever......where I, Furudo {f:5:Erika}, the detective and the Witch of Truth, will command it.
 Your position as territory lord and your ring will become mine..."
"...........................Can\'t...
...get..."
"......Hmm?
 What was that?"
"........Nn......gah.........
 ......Can\'t......get out......"
"Heh, ...ha, ......hahahahahahahahaha...!
 Yes, I\'ll bet you can\'t get out of that locked room.
 After all, you made that locked room yourself.
 You will suffer in that room for all eternity.
 I\'ll remain by your side as your wife for eternity......and get to enjoy that look of anguish on your face all by myself."
"*giggle*giggle*, ahhahahahahahahaha...!!
 I\'ll defile you forever.
 ......Ushiromiya Battlee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}eer!!!"......All that could be heard was the sound of the wind.
A sound of misfortune, strong enough to bring sadness and unease to those who heard it.
Slowly, ......I came back to my senses.
I finally regained consciousness on top of a bed with a firm mattress...
Where......was this, again...?
I couldn\'t remember where this was,
 ......but I could vaguely recall......that it was very bad for me to be here.
The room was dimly lit.
There was a light on, but that just made the darkness and eeriness of the room more apparent.
There were no curtains over the window, but it was too dark outside to see anything beyond it.
If I squinted into that pitch‐blackness,
 ......it felt as though I would see the witch of the forest peeking back at me through the darkness,
 ...and I averted my gaze from the window in fear.
......I couldn\'t see or hear it,
 ......but I got the feeling that if I left this room, it would be bright and warm, and someone would be there for me.
I have to get to where everyone else is right now......
A bad memory from when I was very young began to well up.
I was having trouble staying awake during a family gathering, and the next thing I knew, I was lying on a bed in a room I\'d never seen before.
 I have the horrible, painful memory of waking up there feeling incredibly lonely and crying my eyes out...
This room—I\'m not supposed to be here.
I just want out.
Once I started to think that way, I didn\'t want to stay in this room a second longer than I had to.
This room scares me.
 It\'s creepy.
 ......Where is everyone?
{n}I want to get out of here right now...
I opened the door, trying to leave the room.
A pleasant glow snuck in through the crack of the door.
{n}......As I\'d thought, the corridor was filled with a comforting light.
I couldn\'t actually hear them, but I could sense that far away, people were enjoying themselves.
......Everyone else must be gathered in the room across from this one.
......I\'ve been shut up in this lonely, creepy room......all alone...
I should go, quickly.
As soon as I thought this, a merciless metallic sound rang out, and the door refused to open any further.
.........The chain had been set.
I\'ve always hated chain locks.
You can open a normal lock just by twisting.
......But chain locks are built in a kind of annoying way where it\'s difficult to undo them easily.
...So I\'ve hated them since I was very young.
.........See?
 ......Even this chain...
is causing me trouble...and I just can\'t get it undone.
Why is this happening? I just want to leave this creepy room right away...
Just on the other side of this thin door, everything is bathed in a warm light...
I can\'t undo it...... I just can\'t undo this chain.
The more desperate I grew,
 the more the unsettling darkness of this room seemed to close in on me from behind, and the more frightened I became...
......Then, I finally noticed.
There was something......wrong with this chain.
......Yes, there is a chain,
 ...but this isn\'t a chain lock.
This is just a chain staked into the door so that it can\'t open any further...
In other words, it isn\'t made to be opened.
"Wh‐......what the hell\'s going on......?
 Who\'d do something like this, dammit..."
No matter what I did, no matter how much I struggled, I couldn\'t pull out the stake or undo the chain or break the mechanism.
This door was just a demon\'s mouth...made to trick me into thinking it would open before crushing my hopes a moment later.
Even so, if only I could just open this door somehow, I could get out into that pleasant corridor......
 This desire forced me to keep my hand glued to the doorknob.
But it was useless.
Both the chain and the stake were firm, and though they clattered about, there was no chance of them letting the door open any further.
Even though I could see the pleasant hallway through the crack, I had no chance of opening the door any further.
Maybe someone will come if I yell...
Maybe the door can be opened easily from the outside...
When I thought this,
 ......I tried to call out to someone,
 ......but it was as though the wind had been knocked out of me.
I could mouth the words "someone, come here",
 but no voice left my lips.
What\'s...going on...?!
{n}Someone, come...
 Why can\'t I cry out...?!
Help me help me help me.
Not even being able to say "help me" out loud scared me more than anything.
And if I turned around,
 ......the witch gazing into the room from the darkness outside...
...might now be inside the room, standing right behind me......
 I\'m frightened... I\'m scared I\'m scared I\'m scared...
Someone help me, someone help me...
I can\'t get out... I can\'t get out...
Let me out......of this room......
 Help me,
 I\'m scared
 I\'m scared
 I\'m scared,
 let me out
 let me out
 let me out,
 help me
 help me
 help me......
"Missy, it sounds like they\'ve arrived."
"Huh?
 .........Oh, ........."
Amakusa ran his finger down my cheek.
I awoke in an instant from the doze I had just been in.
I glared at Amakusa for waking me up in such a creepy way, but he just played dumb.
Where......is this?
It feels like a parlor in the house of some well‐off person,
 ......but I have no memory of this place at all.
"....................."
Where......is this......?
 ...And......why am I......?
"Are you still half‐asleep, missy?"
"......Yeah, sorry.
 Where are we......?"
"Huh?"
Apparently, he hadn\'t expected me to forget something like that just because I wasn\'t fully awake yet.
 ......Oddly enough, I agreed.
Why am I in this parlor that I don\'t recognize?
The sound of the footsteps of the person—or people—that Amakusa had mentioned...
had come right up to the opposite side of the door.
I could hear the sound of a conversation.
 They were probably women...
Judging by the coffee and snacks laid in front of me, I was the guest here.
In that case, I\'d better remember why I came here...
...or at least who it was I came to visit...
Who am I?
 Ushiromiya Ange.
Who is the man standing behind me?
Amakusa Juuza.
 The man who used to be my guard long ago.
{n}He\'s now the bodyguard Okonogi assigned to me.
......In that case, ......after Aunt Eva died...
...I must have thrown off my pursuers...
......and gone on a journey to find out what happened on that day twelve years ago......
......Is that...what happened...?
 ...Did I have...{i:a memory of this}......?
After a knock, the door opened,
 and the person I must have come here to meet entered along with a maid.
......Oh, wonderful.
 ...Even after seeing her face, I can\'t remember who she is.
"Sorry to have kept you waiting.
 This is Hachijo Tohya."
That\'s a relief.
 The maid introduced her to me first.
...And, I finally remembered who she was...
"She"?
 I was sure it was a "he"......
"Excuse me, ...but are you...?"
"Yes.
 ......I am Hachijo Tohya ({p:0:八城十八})."
"The magazines talked about your book signing event.
 Supposedly, a mysterious male author showed up wearing sunglasses and a mask...
 Never thought you\'d be a woman...... What\'s the deal?"
"......That was just a double set up by the editing department.
 I was the assistant standing behind him at the book signing."
"Heh, now there\'s a shock...
 ......I haven\'t read your works,
 but I\'ll bet you\'re even more of a mystery than your books are."
"My readers only pretend to read my books.
 ......They buy them just based on the name of the author and the brand and think that they\'ve actually read them."
"......No matter what I write in my books, they don\'t truly read anything.
 They just pretend to read so they can look smart and knowledgeable and keep up with the current fad.
 ......Am I supposed to expose myself to these people?
 Why indulge such trash?"
"......I see.
 Looks like......you really are the great Hachijo."
This person really is eccentric...
{n}There\'s no doubt about it... This is Hachijo Tohya herself...
Hachijo Tohya is a mystery novelist who\'s become the center of discussion lately.
Although her actual books are also apparently highly praised, it\'s her mysterious debut that\'s attracted so much attention towards her lately.
Last year, she somehow managed to win several different awards for exceptional mystery novels offered by multiple large publishing companies,
 submitting each of her works under a different pen name.
And after that, several highly regarded anonymous works were discovered, one after another, to have been stories she had written in the past under false names,
 and her popularity soared as she herself became more mysterious than her books.
Despite all of this, the author herself never appeared in public, and everything about her was wrapped in a veil of secrecy.
 However, just a few days ago, this author had finally made a public appearance for a book signing, showing up with a mask that covered "his" face and drawing even more public attention...
......And yet, apparently even that had been a fake.
Given this person\'s radically unconventional track record,
 it was hardly a surprise to hear her casually insult her fans like this.
"I know quite a lot about you, too, Ushiromiya Ange‐san.
 The talk shows have been discussing you for some time now..."
"I\'m sure you\'ve heard nothing good."
"Yes.
 Nothing good at all.
 Apparently, you employ and then fire people on a whim,
 think anything can be resolved with money, and are an outlaw and a thug."
"Yep, sounds about right.
 Heheheh!"
"However.
 ......I happen to like intelligent people like you."
"......Is that why you agreed to meet with me?"
"Exactly.
 You\'re the only person who\'s managed to spot that Itouikukuro0576 is another pen name used by Hachijo Tohya.
 That\'s actually pretty impressive..."
"Itouikukuro0576.
 It was a pretty strange username.
 However, if you match the Japanese syllables to numbers, you can read it as {nobr:{ruby:i:1}‐{ruby:tou:10}‐{ruby:i:1}‐{ruby:ku:9}‐{ruby:ku:9}‐{ruby:ro:6}‐0576}."
11,019,960,576.
{n}This massive number is equal to 18⁸.
Eighteen to the eighth power.
 In Japanese, "tohya no hachijo".
......That\'s how you reach Hachijo Tohya...
"Heheh, ......very well done.
 I was quite impressed.
 In fact, I was so impressed, I decided to let you meet me in person.
 ......Welcome to my mansion, child of man."
Her manner of speaking was extremely condescending,
 but, perhaps because of her elegant manner, it didn\'t feel particularly irritating.
This person had a sort of majestic grandeur about her which made that style of speech seem almost natural.
{n}......At least, that\'s how it felt to me.
.........In fact, it felt almost as though this was the manifestation of some noble being,
 who would have no need to show herself before mere {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s under normal circumstances.
Since I\'m not particularly a fan of hers,
 I guess this is proof that her mysterious charisma really is nothing to be laughed at......
However, I didn\'t come here to talk to Hachijo Tohya, the mystery novelist.
......I\'m interested in Itouikukuro0576,
 the mysterious web author who only releases her works over the Internet...
Around the Japanese parts of the Internet, Itouikukuro is an extremely famous Witch Hunter.
However, she isn\'t a big opinion leader like Professor Ootsuki.
She\'s one of those "message bottle Forgers" who are always the center of vigorous debate...
Message bottle Forgers are, as the name suggests,
 people who forge and post the contents of riddle‐filled message bottles which purport to tell the story of the Rokkenjima incident.
Claiming to have discovered a new message bottle,
 they post either a very similar counterfeit or a new theory with their own interpretation of the truth, claiming that it was written by Ushiromiya Maria.
They openly call themselves "Ushiromiya Maria",
 write up a new bizarre tale as if they had been there themselves and knew the truth,
 and send their stories out into the newest sea that {y:0:Humans have}{n:0:mankind has} discovered—the Internet—calling them the third or fourth message bottles...
All of the first Forgers were either simple pranksters...
or crooks trying to swindle collectors.
However, eventually, people who claimed to have solved the riddles of the message bottles\' tales and reached the "truth" started to appear,
 and they started work creating third and fourth message bottles from Ushiromiya Maria, as though they had moved over to the riddle‐teller\'s side.
These people rewrote the tale of the witch with whatever interpretation they wanted, and every once in a while, certain theories would gather an enormous amount of support on the web.
 Because of this, some of these "creations" began to be so widely trusted that they were believed to contain some grain of truth.
The more rigid Witch Hunters openly despised these people, calling them "Forgers", "Counterfeiters", or just "Witches".
Though they claimed to have reached the truth, they refused to tell it, and created fake message bottles as though testing everyone else.
It\'s no surprise that the serious Witch Hunters were very annoyed by these Forgers...
However, there were many people who simply liked to entertain themselves with the occult fantasy of Rokkenjima,
 and a small number of those accepted these creations as literary works,
 glad of this expansion to the mysterious tale...
Of all the Forgers, Itouikukuro was the one most highly regarded.
"......End of the Golden Witch.
 I read that one of yours.
 ......It\'s nice to know you have no qualms about killing off other people\'s families."
"Is that why you came all this way? Just to say that...?
 I think not, final descendant of the Ushiromiya family."
In her latest forgery, "End", she killed off at least seven of my relatives during the story.
No, if you count "Alliance" and "Banquet", the other forgeries she\'s made before now,
 then she\'s killed off most of my family in horrible ways, over and over again...
Of course I\'d want to complain.
However, all of her works are known for being, in both form and level of completion,
 the closest tales to those written by "Ushiromiya Maria" herself.
In particular, Itouikukuro\'s first forgery, "Banquet of the Golden Witch",
 was a depiction so complete that it even included Ushiromiya Eva\'s escape to Kuwadorian.
 People wondered whether this might be the true story of Rokkenjima, and it even made it onto the talk shows...
So far, all of these tales have been nothing more than electronic text on the web.
......However, people will eventually realize that Itouikukuro is actually Hachijo Tohya.
When that happens, these tales will become associated with "that bizarre Hachijo", and no one will think of them as mere fan creations.
 ...People will probably start wondering if this might actually be a third message bottle she found and released under the guise of a story she herself wrote.
 When that happens, these stories will probably seem even more bizarre and credible...
"......You are cunning, aren\'t you?"
"Why do you say that?"
"You\'re doing this to make your forgeries more mysterious and more credible."
"And what do you mean by credible?"
"Once you\'ve gained credibility, your forgeries will rise to the level of truth."
"Rise to the level of truth?
 Hmph, how foolish.
 Such a thing is unnecessary for my works."
"......Is that because your works are the truth, and not mere forgeries...?"
"Correct.
 They are the truth, so there\'s no need for them to rise into anything."
"You aren\'t Maria onee‐chan.
 And you weren\'t on Rokkenjima on that day.
 So how can you be so absurd as to call this the truth?"
"Missy, you\'re getting a bit too stirred up."
"Shut up. How can you call this stirred up?"
"*giggle*......"
Ange realized that she\'d let her emotions get control over her.
She let out a sigh and shrugged...
"Your reason for coming here.
 It wasn\'t to yell at me for murdering your family several times within my forgeries, correct...?"
Hachijo had been smiling at Ange kindly, ......but in a condescending manner,
 or else, like a mother might watch over a very small child.
Ange realized this and was unable to suppress her irritation.
Apparently, Amakusa could tell that Ange was getting worked up.
He joked around with her for a bit so that they could start the conversation over again from the beginning.
"The thing you came here to hear...
 ...It\'s the "truth" that I\'ve reached, is it not?"
"............Why are you so sure that you\'ve reached the truth...?"
"Because I\'ve understood all of the tales."
"And I\'m asking you why you\'re so sure about that."
"......Do you think the Sun ever revolved around the Earth?"
Hachijo suddenly started talking about the geocentric model.
......Ange was about to tell her not to answer questions with more questions, but she quickly realized what Hachijo meant.
"......{y:0:Human}{n:0:Human}s used to support geocentrism.
 However, that theory has been disproved in the modern age.
 ......Does this mean that, at the instant the theory was denied, the sun stopped moving and the Earth started revolving around the Sun?"
"......Of course not.
 The truth doesn\'t change based on what {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s believe."
"It\'s the same with this case.
 Your denying my truth amounts to the same thing."
Several scholars before Galileo proposed the heliocentric model.
{n}......However, it was hard to objectively prove it using the scientific techniques available at the time.
However, that didn\'t change the fact that it was the truth.
{n}"And yet it moves".
".........So, you\'re saying the truth is still the truth whether you can prove it or not...?"
"Correct.
 In the future,
 when the full truth finally becomes known,
 people will look back and realize that I had already discovered it."
Apparently, Ange just couldn\'t stand Hachijo\'s attitude.
{n}She kept getting irritated, and every time, Amakusa would joke around until she settled down again.
However, there could be no mistake that Hachijo was a genius...
and had used her extraordinary intuition to form a most interesting perspective on the events that had occurred on that island...
That was why Ange had wanted to contact Itouikukuro and hear about her viewpoint.
Still, she really was lucky to have been granted this meeting.
Ange hadn\'t been absolutely sure that Itouikukuro was Hachijo Tohya,
 she hadn\'t thought that the publishing company would really contact the author,
 ......and most of all, she hadn\'t dreamed that the mysterious masked author would grant her an interview under such short notice.
The more she thought about it, the more she realized that the sum of the events leading to this meeting made for nothing short of a miracle.
......Yes.
 A miracle.
......After all, in most cases, I don\'t get contacted by the publishing company at all and leave for Niijima the next day.
..................?
.........I left for Niijima, then I went on to Rokkenjima.
......Then I gave Onee‐chan...Sakutarou.
......Huh?
.........Why would I have Sakutarou.........?
..............................
My memory of the future...is all muddled...
 My head......hurts...
Hachijo said something about showing Ange something good, rose from the sofa, and headed for the study desk.
When she turned her back, Amakusa asked Ange, who seemed to be troubled about something, if she was okay.
"......Hey, Amakusa.
 ......How...long have I been here...?"
"Wha?
 You\'ve been acting weird for a while now.
 What\'s going on?"
".........I can\'t remember how long I\'ve been sitting here."
"Are you still sleepy?"
"That\'s not it.
 ......I mean, I managed to get an appointment with Professor Ootsuki, but the publishing company never got back to me about Itouikukuro,
 ......and in the end, I spent the whole of today unable to accomplish anything, I thought..."
"Huh?"
"Amakusa, ......I thought you went to go get that large black bag..."
That\'s right.
 Just before we left for Niijima, Amakusa and I briefly parted ways.
 ......He said something about getting a weapon from an acquaintance of his, and he went to go get that large black bag.
Wasn\'t that...
...today.........?
What......am I talking about......?
I mean,
 ......didn\'t I go to Niijima,
 ......meet Captain Kawabata,
 ...and, inside the bed shop,
 .........huh?
 ............What...?
"......Is something wrong...?"
Did my confusion and uncertainty make me sigh out loud...?
Even though Hachijo\'s back was to me,
 ......she slowly turned around......and smiled as though she had peered into my heart.
"N‐
......no, it\'s nothing."
Strange memories...ones that even I can\'t understand.
I tried to hide my confusion,
 .........but for some reason, Hachijo had a strange glint in her eyes, ......as though she could read my mind.
"I have revived and killed your family several times within various forgeries.
 ......Almost as a witch might."
"Reviving and killing them whenever you like.
 .........Endlessly.
 ...Sounds almost like {f:5:Beatrice}, doesn\'t it..."
"Yes, it does.
 ......So, please follow the lead of all those people on the web,
 and consider the possibility that I might be a witch."
She took a thickly‐packed, brown envelope out of a locked drawer.
It appeared to be filled to bursting with pages of printed‐out text.
......Perhaps this was a manuscript for one of her works.
And, the neat letters written with a fountain pen on the envelope...
...spelled out the word "Dawn".
There is no forgery by the name of Dawn.
{n}......Which...must mean......
......Ange could tell.
 This was a new one.
{n}Hachijo\'s newest, unreleased forgery......
“Dawn of the Golden Witch”...
"For one such as I, who knows everything, everything is boring.
 ......However, I don\'t dislike letting the ignorant read my works to see what kind of reaction they have.
 ......And so, I want you to read it."
"......You want me to read your newest work, which you\'ve created as the new Endless Witch?"
"Correct, child of man.
 Whether you resent it or admire it, you can help me forget my illness for a time."
".....................
 ......Let\'s put an end to this farce, shall we?
 ...Who are you?
 ......I don\'t remember ever meeting you like this."
Yes, I did try to contact Hachijo Tohya.
{n}However, in the end, I never got a chance to meet her.
In other words, all of this is a falsehood.
"Whose piece am I this time?
 ......Sorry, but if you think you can tame Ushiromiya Ange so easily,
 you\'re making a big mistake."
".........Pfft.
 ......*giggle*giggle*.........
 Yes, ...I hoped you\'d be this interesting.
 Eheh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eheheh..."
She finally couldn\'t hold it back and burst out laughing...
Gradually, the space around them seemed to fill with a strange purple mist...
The room itself seemed to twist and bend...
Her figure also twisted,
 ......and, after transforming through something that couldn\'t be described, she took the form of just what she had called herself:
 ......a witch.
"Splendid.
 You did well to see through my trick..."
".........It seems I\'m the type that witches just love to cling to.
 .........All of you have that same condescending tone towards other people.
 I figured you were a witch right away."
The novelist sitting on the sofa was nowhere to be seen.
{n}Even Ange\'s bodyguard, who was supposed to be around at times like this, was gone.
There was only a nonhuman figure relaxing in a large, ornate rocking chair.
"I find you to be truly interesting, child of man.
 ......Your charming nature is the perfect thing to alleviate my boredom."
"Yeah, well, I don\'t see anything charming about this.
 ......Why am I alive?
 ......Wasn\'t I killed in a pretty nasty way for breaking the rule about revealing my name...?"
Well, ......I did doubt that those people would just let me go so easily.
......What kind of farce will I be forced to go along with this time?
I really don\'t care.
 I\'ll just do whatever I can within the bounds of the role they give me...whatever I can to help Onii‐chan.
Of course, I understand.
......Even if he wins, he\'ll never come back to "me".
"Even so, ......I\'ll struggle on.
 I\'ll make sure Onii‐chan comes back to the "me" of that day."
"No need to lose your temper.
 I am not asking you to be a piece..."
"Then why did you summon me here?
 Don\'t tell me you want me to read this new story or whatever it is you\'ve written."
"That\'s it exactly.
 ......I do not want you to be my piece.
 I have always been a mere observer,
 and I have no intention of sticking my neck into their game..."
".........I don\'t get it.
 What is it you want from me?"
"Be an observer for me, an observer of the fragments {f:5:Beatrice} has woven."
"An observer...?
 I don\'t really know what you mean, but no deal."
"In the past,
 I observed the fragments through Battler\'s eyes.
 ......However, now that he has succeeded the position of Game Master, he is not a suitable observer.
 I am following this tale with true and earnest intentions.
 It would be such a waste to observe it through the eyes of Battler as he is now, like reading a detective novel backwards..."
"......Onii‐chan is the Game Master??
 What on Earth are you talking about?"
"Of course you don\'t know.
 You want to know, don\'t you?
 ......I too wish to know something.
 What kind of tale will Battler weave now that he has taken the position of Game Master?
 ...Furthermore, I wish to search for the truth Battler reached as part of my own mental journey.
 .........My illness affects me gravely.
 If I do not think, I cannot even keep my heart beating..."
".........So,
 ...you want me to read your new picture book aloud to you...?"
"You might as well interpret it that way.
 In exchange, you will also be able to take part in your own journey of the mind.
 I do believe that even you have yet to reach the truth.
 .........I think you want to continue,
 ...on the journey to find that truth."
"I don\'t owe you anything."
"Don\'t push your luck.
 I can be lenient at times, but that is not usually the case..."
"........................"
Ange hadn\'t yet reached the truth either.
Though she knew that the game was little more than a toy for the witches to play with, she wanted it to resume...so that she could follow the tale and close in on the "king" called truth......
"......I might follow the tale so that I can find the truth myself,
 ......but I have no obligation to read it aloud until the end for your sake.
 ...Understand?"
Ange was willing to read the story aloud, but she could quit any time if this witch made her mad.
She was, in effect, warning the witch not to annoy her...
"Of course.
 ......You call it a picture book, but to me, it is the only medicine for a fatal illness.
 I cannot take that medicine without you to assist me.
 ......In other words, this is a mutually beneficial arrangement."
"......So, you\'re telling me to read you a book until you fall asleep.
 And in exchange, you\'ll let me read it too.
 ......Is that right?"
"Precisely.
 ......If you are willing to accept,
 I shall ask that you become my Reader for a time."
"Well, it\'s nice to get my own title, but all you really want me to do is read books, right?"
"Becoming my Reader means the same as becoming my familiar.
 ......In other words, what is done against you will be done against me.
 I will not permit anyone to disrupt my only interest, that being to read the rest of {f:5:Beatrice}\'s tale.
 ......I will not let {f:5:Bernkastel}, {f:5:Lambdadelta},
 or even {f:5:Beatrice} force anything upon you..."
This witch, who seemed to have an almost divine quality to her, spoke both quietly and forcefully...
There was no threat in her words.
......However, even so,
 it was clear that she was on a different level than {f:5:Bernkastel} and the other witches, and not at all to be taken lightly.
"So, you\'ll offer me protection if I agree to read your book...?"
"Of course.
 What I want is for you to read aloud to me.
 ......I will not spare any who attempt to stand in the way of that."
"..........................."
"......If my attitude seems arrogant to you, allow me to apologize, child of man.
 It may not seem so, but I am speaking to you with the utmost respect."
"Yeah, probably.
 ......I get the feeling that even that witch‐like style of speech...
is the most respect you\'ve shown anyone in the last few centuries."
"When you\'re reading a book, do you tell it "thank you very much" before flipping through the pages...?"
"......I guess it is like that.
 I understand."
Just by agreeing to have a conversation with Ange, she was showing an incredible amount of respect and willingness to compromise.
Ange shrugged, but she also nodded to show her consent.
"Sure.
 ......I\'ll be your Reader.
 I see that you showed a ton of respect just by asking for my consent first."
"You understand well, child of man."
"......My name\'s Ange.
 Not child of man or whatever."
"Heheheheheh.
 ......Very well.
 As proof of my respect for you, I will acknowledge your name."
For her, acknowledging a human\'s name was like acknowledging the names of all the leaves scattered across the ground.
So, .........her acknowledging Ange\'s name was a miracle.
{n}No, it was immensely good fortune.
"...From this point forth, Ushiromiya Ange...
will serve as Reader and {c:86EF9C:miko} to the Witch of Theatergoing, {f:5:Featherine Augustus Aurora}.
 Until you finish reading,
 I shall bring calamity to all who attempt to hinder your task."
When the Witch of Theatergoing, {f:5:Featherine}, spoke this, ......Ange was wrapped in a bright light.
Ange didn\'t feel any particular change herself,
 ......but she definitely had been given something that only nonhumans could sense.
It signified that from this point forward, Ange would be attached to the Witch of Theatergoing.
That didn\'t mean that Ange would gain some sort of special power,
 ......but at the very least, it probably meant that anyone wanting to cause her harm would first have to take on {f:5:Featherine} herself...
"......Your name is pretty long.
 Sounds like some ancient Roman person.
 ......What should I call you?"
"Those not familiar with me call me {f:5:Augustus Aurora}."
".........After all the respect you\'ve shown me, it\'s only fitting that I respond in kind.
 I\'ll call you {f:5:Featherine}.
 Any problems?"
"None at all.
 ......For an ailing witch such as myself, even being called by my first name will be an experience to be treasured and pondered over. Child of man."
"I have a name. It\'s Ange."
"......Heheh. Even conversations like this are nice every once in a while.
 ......Ange, my miko."
Ange accepted her role.
{n}She would observe this tale with the Witch of Theatergoing.
The curtain was rising on the sixth tale......At one time, only Beato and her fellow witches had gathered in this smoking room to chat.
Now, however, an unusually large number of people were present.
"Ehheheheheh.
 I wonder what kind of game Battler\'s going to show us."
"......I don\'t care what...
as long as it\'s fun enough to relieve my boredom as I crush it."
"Leave everything to me, my master!
 I will perform to my fullest and give you the results you desire!"
"Yeah, you\'d better.
 ......I kept making strange faces all the time last game thanks to you...
 Thought I might start getting wrinkles."
"Th‐there\'s no need to worry.
 The beauty of your face is without peer, no matter how wrinkly it may get."
"........................!!!"
"Eheheheh!
 It\'s rare to see Bern in such high spirits.
 Beato\'s game board really is something else."
"......How sad it is that the master of this game board is no longer with {f:5:us}."
"A tiger dies and leaves behind its hide.
 Looks like Beato has died and left behind her game."
"Even though chess still exists, no one knows the name of the person who invented it."
"Oh, you\'re right!
 Kyahahaha, poor game creato~rs!"
"Come to think of it, Battler‐san is really keeping us waiting, isn\'t he?
 Is he still setting up the sixth game?"
"......Gertrude.
 How are Lord {f:5:Battler}\'s preparations {f:5:progressing}?"
"For your attention: I beg to inform you of the following.
 ......Know that he will be finished very soon."
"He must have a lot of confidence in what he\'s creating to keep us waiting this long.
 ......He really humiliated me in front of my master last time.
 I\'ll defeat him no matter what it takes...!
 And you in particular! Make sure you don\'t screw up again...!"
"......I will meet the challenge with all of my strength."
The previous Game Master, {f:5:Lambdadelta},
 had confirmed that Battler understood everything about Beato\'s game.
However, in order to prove it,
 Battler would have to run this game by himself and carry it through to completion.
In other words, if Erika could crush this game of Battler\'s,
 she would, in effect, wipe away the dishonor of that last game.
Though Erika was chomping at the bit to get started,
 it was taking Battler quite some time to show himself.
Then, a swarm of gold butterflies swelled out of nothing and formed a human shape.
From the shape of that familiar dress, everyone immediately realized who it was.
"Ah, look, it\'s {f:5:Beatrice}‐san.
 And I thought you\'d died and disappeared last time."
"......Beato the player is the one who disappeared.
 This is probably just a piece...Battler\'s piece."
"Even if she is a piece, it does not change the fact that it is {f:5:her}."
{f:5:Beatrice} gave an elegant curtsy as she appeared.
This humble entrance was so vastly different from her usual high‐pitched laugh...
that it created a sense of tension as they waited for the start of the sixth game to be announced at last...
"Father will be here very soon.
 I ask that you wait for just a short while longer......"
"...............
 ...Aha.
 Father? What\'s that?
 This game\'s new twist on things?"
Not only had Beato started talking in an unusually polite manner,
 she had also used the word "Father"...probably referring to Battler.
For an instant, everyone was stunned into silence,
 but they quickly realized that this was part of something bigger, and they grinned.
Beato wasn\'t the type who could keep up this kind of act for long.
It would probably fall apart in a few seconds, leaving her laughing and cackling rudely at everyone.
Erika, who was itching for a fight, went for Beato almost at once.
"I never expected that incompetent Battler‐san...
to reach the truth of your game."
"......It must be Father\'s talent that led him to his profound understanding.
 He really is clever."
"...............
 You\'re pretty lucky, aren\'t you?
 If Battler hadn\'t become the Game Master, you would never have revived again.
 You certainly have the luck of the devil."
"......The devil?"
"In any case,
 I\'m going to pay you back in full for last time.
 You\'re just one of Battler\'s delusions, fantasies... I\'ll erase every part of you and knock you down into the abyss of oblivion."
"Well, {ruby:watashi:I} also intend to hold my own.
 ......I, um, look forward to having a good, clean fight."
"...........................???"
By this point, everyone realized that something weird was going on.
There was no doubt that the face, the dress, and the hair were all {f:5:Beatrice}\'s.
......However, ......her expression was different.
Even though she had Beato\'s face, Beato would never show anyone an expression like that.
"....................."
"......Just who...are you?"
There was a heavy silence.
......{f:5:Lambdadelta} spoke for everyone there.
At first, Beato wore a smiling yet confused expression.
 ......However, when she realized that the mood had gone suddenly stiff, her expression finally darkened, and she hung her head.
"Who......are you?"
"......You appear to be Lady {f:5:Beatrice}...
...but is that {f:5:true}...?"
Even Dlanor was forced to ask despite the rudeness of the question.
That was how much...
this woman...
who appeared to be Beato...
was not.
".........Am I somehow different from the {f:5:Beatrice}...
...that all of you were expecting?"
"What......are you talking about?"
"Wait a second,
 don\'t tell me you have amnesia or something...?"
"I, ...I was only born recently, so I have no memories at all.
 ......B‐but I...!
 I\'m studying hard...in order to become the {f:5:Beatrice} you all expect—"
{a:c:
"Beato.
 ......I thought I told you to stay in your room."}
Battler\'s voice came out of nowhere.
......His tone was very slightly cold.
{n}Beato\'s expression looked like that of a young girl being scolded.
With a swirl of gold butterflies,
 ......Battler appeared.
His dignified bearing and appearance were fitting for the ruler of this game.
......However, his expression was gloomy...
and his gaze was directed at Beato.
"......Go back to your room.
 You aren\'t supposed to be here."
"I, ...I just wanted to help you however I could, Father......"
"Go. To your room."
He spoke both softly and forcefully.
 Battler didn\'t leave her any room for debate.
Beato hung her head and curtsied as she prepared to leave the room...
"Also."
"Y‐yes, what is it, Father?"
"......My name is Battler.
 ...Never call me by another name again."
"...Y‐
.........yes."
Beato melted into a swarm of butterflies and disappeared.
This was the first part of the tale with Battler as the Game Master.
The witches had all expected him to come forward with some flashy, big developments, ...so they were all fairly confused.
......Their mouths were still hanging open.
"......This is an unusual approach."
"Pardon me.
 ......Please forget what you saw just now."
"Hmph, so, are you trying to trick us with this?
 You\'re scheming to give us the wrong impression, like another North Wind and the Sun strategy, aren\'t you?"
"......Is there something {f:5:wrong}?"
"Don\'t worry about it.
 It has nothing to do with you people."
"I see.
 Then it doesn\'t matter.
 Alright, Battler! Please start up the new game right away!
 You\'ve kept us waiting so long, it\'s gotten totally boring!"
"......Sure.
 Let\'s start the sixth game.
 ......Erika, and you too, {f:5:Bernkastel}.
 This will be my tale, proof that I\'ve reached the truth about Beato.
 ...{f:5:Lambdadelta}.
 Please oversee this game, as a former Game Master."
"Sure, looking forward to it. What\'s the title?"
"......‘Dawn’.
 ...As in, the Dawn of the Golden Witch."
"Of course, the winter sun is quick to sink back below the horizon."
"Of course, my master.
 I\'ll drag it back down for you right away.
 At least your title is <good>, Battler‐san. I\'ll give you that much."
"I\'m glad you like it.
 ...Then let\'s get started.
 The sixth game will now begin."
Battler solemnly announced the start of the game.
......Compared to his fired‐up attitude at the end of the last game, where he and Erika had sworn to settle everything next time,
 he was extremely quiet now......
"......Ange.
 Beato seems very different from the way she was before."
"I\'m surprised too.
 ......I don\'t have a clue what\'s going on.
 In fact, I don\'t even get why Beato\'s revived in the first place.
 I just finished reading it a little while ago, ......but at the end of the previous tale,
 didn\'t she die just before Onii‐chan reached the truth?"
"There are two kinds of death in this world.
 ......One of them is when a piece is taken from the game board.
 This is only a death within the bounds of the game, and these lives can revive over and over again each time you start a new game."
"......And that\'s why the witches are so merciless when it comes to taking those lives..."
To the witch players,
 the lives of those characters who appear on the game board are no different from pieces on a chess board that take other pieces and get taken.
After all, these pieces will be set up again when the next game starts.
"Maria\'s Sakutarou is a prime example of these."
"......Sakutarou is Onee‐chan\'s piece...?"
Yes, ......that does make sense.
On the game board that represents the inside of Onee‐chan\'s head, Sakutarou certainly does exist,
 and is a piece which always stays by her side.
Though he\'s nothing more than a stuffed animal in the real world,
 on Onee‐chan\'s game board, he is a full piece, no different from any other piece.
"But, ......I wonder.
 ...On the witches\' game board, it\'s easy to revive a piece, right?
 ......But Onee‐chan was unable to revive Sakutarou in her world."
"......That\'s because she lost that completely unique stuffed animal that was his vessel.
 Because of this, the conditions for that piece\'s existence were violated, and it became impossible to revive him on Maria\'s game board.
 ......The only reason you were able to revive Sakutarou on the game board was because you once again satisfied the conditions for his existence, correct?"
".........True."
Maria onee‐chan...
was only unable to revive him because she had lost the stuffed animal that was his vessel.
......If, like my family on Beato\'s game board,
 she hadn\'t needed a "vessel" for him, she would have been able to revive him as often as she wanted.
"Got it.
 ......I see that Sakutarou might be considered Onee‐chan\'s piece.
 At least, as long as his vessel was okay, he could have been revived over and over again."
"Correct.
 As long as the vessel is safe, it can be revived over and over again.
 That\'s what the life of a piece is like..."
"......That\'s the first kind of death in this world.
 ......What\'s the second?"
"That\'s the death of beings outside the game board.
 To continue with the Sakutarou example, this would be like Maria\'s death."
"Not the piece,
 ......but the real Onee‐chan\'s death, right?"
"It doesn\'t have to be her death.
 Loss of interest or concern would have the same effect.
 ......When Maria grows up from playing with stuffed animals, then "Maria the game player" will die.
 It\'s as quick and easy as turning off the switch on a TV when you get bored of it."
".........I see.
 In that case, "Beato the player" completely gave up on winning during the last game,
 ......so she died and vanished.
 ...Which means that if Beato thinks she has a chance of defeating Onii‐chan again, she\'ll come back to life, right?"
"Logically, that is true.
 It\'s the same for people, witches, and even gods.
 If they lose interest and concern, they can die at any time.
 And if they regain that interest, they can revive at any time.
 ......However, though the concept of time does not exist in the world of gods, who can revive whenever they want,
 time shoots by like an arrow in the human world, and it is not so easy there..."
"That\'s true.
 Skipping school for one day might not be a problem, but if you skip for three days in a row, it\'d be really hard to convince yourself to go back."
"And what if that stretched out for a month, a year, a decade?
 What if it lasted for a thousand years, like the world of witches?"
"......I see.
 If you skipped for that long, it would mean your "death" as far as society is concerned.
 ......If you remained dead for that long,
 not only would you be unable to catch up on all you missed in the world at large, you\'d also lose any motivation you might\'ve had when you left."
"......So, even though you\'d be alive, you could say that you\'d died once.
 You would never again......be able to regain the self that you once were. It would never revive."
"Beato lost any chance or hope of winning.
 ......Even though she knew this, she pretended not to and kept on fighting for many, many games.
 So, Beato will not return.
 Her hopes were crushed.
 She\'s spent all of the willpower that she might have used to regain the will to fight.
 Therefore,
 ......
{p:1:that {f:5:Beatrice} will never revive again}."
That Beato, who just sat around the whole time with empty eyes in the fifth game...
...must have been her corpse.
She had managed to remain on the game board despite it all,
 ......but then even that corpse was wiped away...
If Beato had been the Game Master at that time instead of {f:5:Lambdadelta},
 the game board itself would have vanished at that moment, and everything would have ended.
Come to think of it, Beato started to lose the will to fight back near the end of the fourth game.
When Beato loses her will to fight, ......the world of this game disappears.
However, the witches wanted to keep playing in this game board world,
 so {f:5:Lambdadelta} bound Beato in place with the curse of that shackle.
She used that shackle to make sure that the game board wouldn\'t disappear,
 even if Beato did lose the will to fight.
In chess, this would be the equivalent of removing the set time limit for each turn,
 making it endless.
However, simply having the game endlessly paused on Beato\'s turn would cause the witches to die from their illness of boredom.
That\'s why {f:5:Lambdadelta} took the position of Game Master.
......Starting then, Beato\'s existence was no longer one of the conditions necessary for the game to exist.
That\'s probably why the shackles binding her to the game board were released.
And that explains why she disappeared in the fifth game...
"......So,
 when Onii‐chan managed to reach the truth,
 ...it was one game too late for him to tell Beato about it."
"The fifth game was a form of charity on {f:5:Lambdadelta}\'s part.
 ......She merely showed Battler some mercy as the Witch of Certainty, acknowledging his strong desire to reach the truth no matter what..."
".........How can you call that charity?
 It\'s just those fickle witches killing time.
 ......Let\'s get back to the point.
 So, that means this weird Beato isn\'t the player Beato.
 She\'s just a piece Beato."
"Yes.
 ......And if that is so, you would expect her to turn out as the Beato everyone knows well.
 ......That should also be the kind of Beato that Battler wants..."
".....................
 ......You mean,
 ...he wasn\'t satisfied with just a doll?"
When playing with dolls,
 one can project the personality they most desire onto the doll.
......However, since you are acting out their part, nothing unexpected can ever happen.
You cannot hope for any unanticipated happiness.
In the human world, there is nothing so boring as predictability.
That\'s why, though a doll can become a person\'s best friend in the world,
 ......people eventually get bored and outgrow them...
Onii‐chan only wants the real Beato.
He couldn\'t bear having a doll that he could only make act like Beato...
".........A Beato born as Battler\'s piece...
would probably move exactly according to Battler\'s wishes."
"She is a piece, so that\'s only natural.
 Pieces move according to their player\'s directions.
 ......And they are incapable of moving in any other way.
 ......I see what it is Onii‐chan wants.
 Then, just who is this weird Beato?"
"......Battler might be trying to revive Beato in the truest sense.
 ......It is the never‐dying dream held by the children of man."
"You just used the red to say that wasn\'t possible."
"......{i:That Beato} has no chance of reviving.
 However, that doesn\'t mean that it is impossible to create "Beato" again...
 Have you forgotten?
 I believe that {f:5:Bernkastel} herself revealed Beato\'s true form at the end of the first game..."
"........................
 ......Now I remember.
 ...She said something about how Beato exists as the incarnation of the rules."
"Rules and information, brought together,
 ultimately took the form of the witch known as {f:5:Beatrice}.
 If that pattern is followed once more, the same {f:5:Beatrice} will be born again,
 and perhaps one could call that a resurrection..."
".........In other words, that weird Beato...
...is like an egg of Beato, ...or else a chick."
"That interpretation is probably accurate...
 ......In short, this Beato is a chick that might become that Beato."
"And that means,
 .........this pure and lovable kid will eventually grow into that screwed up, crazy witch."
In other words, that Beato is a baby version of the Beato we all know.
So, just like how no person is born evil,
 ......the newborn Beato isn\'t evil either.
Even though she really is a different person, .........if you measure her by her basis...her soul...
...then maybe you really could call this a resurrection.
......However, ......this reality can\'t possibly be easy to accept.
Though she may technically be Beato herself,
 ......she is also, without a doubt, ......a different person.
And that way she acts...would make anyone feel as though something\'s out of place......
"How entertaining...
 ......Hearing you read aloud is far from boring."
"......I wonder if you even really need someone to read aloud for you.
 ...It looks like you already know everything."
"I only reached that thought because I am engaged in a conversation with you.
 ......My thoughts are more numerous than the stars in the sky.
 I only appear to know everything to a child of man like you.
 ......However, without you here, I am nothing but a weak, sickly person without even the power to think..."
"If you\'d just said that in the first place, I\'d have agreed to read for you a lot more easily."
"......My mood just happened to improve.
 ...Don\'t get an over‐swelled impression of yourself.
 I think of your life as nothing more than a leaf one may lose after using it as a bookmark..."
"‘Please continue reading’,
 is how I choose to interpret that.
 OK?"
"Heh......
 Far from boring.
 ...You really do make an excellent miko."
{f:5:Featherine} rocked back in her rocking chair and looked up at the ceiling,
 laughing as though the conversation itself was pleasant for her.
Ange was slowly figuring out how to deal with this strange witch.
......This person was also...bored.
When a sick person has been in bed for a long time and gets too bored, they sometimes act in a rebellious way.
{n}On the other hand, they also get a little bored of being treated kindly all the time.
She may want to be respected for her superiority,
 but it\'s probably more interesting for her when she\'s spoken to a little rudely.
......What a coincidence.
 That\'s exactly how I used to be.
"Anyway.
 ......From what we learned in the fourth game, there\'s no doubt that there was some kind of bad blood between Beato and Onii‐chan in the past.
 Learning about this Beato might give us a key towards finding the truth."
"It does seem so.
 ......It has caught my interest as well.
 ...Let us read her tale too."
"Oh, sure, as you wish, my master."
Ange raised her hands like a conductor, and the bookshelves in this bizarre study responded.
......Once again, several books floated out and began to swirl around Ange......
Kinzo\'s study is the room belonging to the master in the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} world.
So, this study in the world of nonhumans belonged to the master of the game board...
...and was a place where he could look down upon the {y:0:Humans}{n:0:humans}...
Therefore, it was understandable that one might mistake the imposing, robe‐clad man in the center of the study for Kinzo,
 if only for a second.
It wasn\'t Kinzo.
......It was Battler, the one who had taken up the position of Game Master,
 and who had become the new territory lord of this world.
"................................."
Around Battler was a swirl of glowing fragments, sparkling like the night sky,
 ......and on the floor was what appeared to be a red magic circle.
To an outsider, it would have appeared to be nothing more than an incomprehensible geometric shape.
But to Battler, who stood at its center,
 it was the outline for a new tale...
A new line grew across the magic circle, following Battler\'s gaze.
Then, at the instant it connected with a complicated symbol, the entire magic circle flashed brightly.
"......So,
 ......how does it look?"
"It is splendid, my lord.
 ......The sixth game is complete."
As Battler wiped his forehead and finally relaxed,
 Genji, who was standing behind him and watching over his every move, nodded deeply in response.
"......I always thought being a Game Master meant you could make the tale however you want,
 ......but this is seriously harder than I thought it\'d be."
"You must write up multiple tales and make the inner and outer sides of the story match.
 ......And yet, you have displayed such skill, it is hard to believe that this is your first time.
 ......I believe even Erika‐sama will be satisfied with this game."
"Well, hopefully it matches that great detective\'s tastes.
 ......Still, ...I\'ve got to honestly respect Beato now.
 ...I can hardly believe that she managed to create such complicated stories so easily."
"......It was not easy.
 ......{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama spent a long, long time deliberating, and each time she created a tale, she would worry over various contradictions.
 She was constantly battling with logic errors."
"Logic errors?"
"That is when the two sides of the tale do not meet, creating a contradiction.
 ......When this happens, it becomes a fatal violation of the rules known as a logic error, and the game board will immediately collapse and be destroyed.
 It is the greatest and worst form of error that the witch side can make, and one which must always be avoided."
"And Beato...
got close to bumping into those several times in her games...?"
"......She fought with them every time she created a game.
 ...I believe it grew even more difficult for her as you became a more effective opponent."
"............So,
 ......do you think this game I\'ve made...
...is good enough to show Beato?"
"......Yes.
 ......Of course."
"...............
 ......Has Beato...
still not woken up?"
"..........................."
"It\'s been a while since her body was formed as a personification of the rules.
 Is she still not awake...?"
After remaining silent for a while longer, Genji answered.
"......She woke up three days ago.
 You were concentrating on the construction of the sixth game, so I decided to wait before telling you...
 My sincere apologies..."
"Oh, really?
 Yeah, I\'ll bet she\'s still all drowsy after sleeping so long.
 I\'ve really wanted to show her my game!
 No, it\'s more than that, I have to show her my game.
 I need to tell her that I\'ve understood everything."
Battler\'s face broke into a smile.
There was no trace in his expression of the hatred he had once felt towards Beato for murdering his family...
"......In a way,
 ...that was the final mystery of the fifth game."
"Yes.
 ......When Battler reached the truth, there was a great change in his impression of Beato."
"Does that mean it\'s fair to assume that there really was some kind of connection between Onii‐chan and Beato,
 and that he forgot all about it...?"
However, Battler suspected this in the fourth game and asked Beato about it.
And within the story,
 this was denied by the red truth:
 "Six years ago, no person called {f:5:Beatrice} existed for Battler"...
"......We can read this as saying that Beato did not exist six years before,
 or it could simply mean that she had no connection to Battler at that time.
 However, either way, Battler did not visit Rokkenjima at all for the next six years..."
"October 4th, 1986 should have been the first time {f:5:Beatrice} and Onii‐chan met.
 ......If so, why was there already some kind of bad blood between them?
 I don\'t have a clue what it means."
"......That "Ushiromiya Battler\'s sin", which Beato questioned Battler about in the fourth game,
 might give us a clue.
 ...The result of that might have been {f:5:Beatrice} herself."
"The result?
 The result of Onii‐chan\'s sin was...Beato...?"
That almost sounds as though...
Onii‐chan created the witch called {f:5:Beatrice} himself...
"Almost as though...
...{f:5:Beatrice} was Battler\'s piece."
"......Huh...?"
"Six years earlier, Battler committed a sin.
 Because of that sin, people died.
 The killer was {f:5:Beatrice}.
 ......If you consider the possibility that everything is connected to Battler\'s sin six years before,
 ......then the one who created {f:5:Beatrice} was Battler himself.
 I thought it sounded almost as though she was Battler\'s piece..."
"I don\'t get it.
 If Onii‐chan sinned in some way, it must have been something much lighter than murder, at the very least.
 If someone caused this huge massacre in retaliation for that,
 that\'s totally out of proportion."
"Beato killed our family.
 Dad, Mom, Onii‐chan, everyone.
 ......I can\'t believe that Onii‐chan\'s sin was anything deserving of that."
"The weight of a sin depends on the person measuring it.
 Even a sin so light that Battler might have forgotten...
could have been so serious to Beato that she hated him enough to massacre his whole family a full six years after the fact."
"......Well, even I think that a bit excessive, and more importantly, if she were a person like that,
 I would find it hard to accept that Battler would act so friendly towards her after discovering the truth..."
".............................."
{f:5:Featherine}\'s observation was extremely interesting.
In a past game,
 Beato said clearly that Onii‐chan\'s sin six years before was the cause of this two‐day tragedy.
I still don\'t know what kind of sin that was.
However, he figured it out at the end of the fifth game,
 ......and he even apologized to Beato.
Even though she was the witch who had massacred his entire family in retaliation for his sin of six years before,
 ......Battler apologized to her.
......Of course, it was the player Battler who apologized,
 not the piece Battler whose family had been murdered over and over again.
But even so, ......Battler must have remembered something at the end of the last game...
that made him feel like apologizing...
"......This sin from six years before.
 ......Does this mean that it\'s hidden somewhere in the tale so far...?"
"...I have already formed a theory about it."
"Oh?
 Let me hear it."
"Heheheheheh, I can\'t tell you yet.
 I want to enjoy being the only one who knows the answer for a little while longer..."
"......Well then, I guess I\'m done reading for you."
"Hahaha, well, we can\'t have that, can we?
 ......Have some patience and read a bit further.
 My theory is still nothing more than a guess.
 ......Once I\'m certain of it, I\'ll tell you."
"Okay, okay, my master.
 I actually do want to hear what comes next, after all."
Onii‐chan and {f:5:Beatrice}...
 Just what kind of connection is there between them?
......Learning that will probably be the ultimate key to the truth of this world.
After all, remembering that...
was what enabled him to reach the truth.
"{f:5:Beatrice}...!!"
"Welcome, my lord...
 {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama is waiting for you.
 This way, please......"
This place was a villa set aside for {f:5:Beatrice}\'s use.
It was a sacred site for her only, built so that she could spend her days without being affected by the outside world.
My heart began to race.
 ......I\'m so glad that she was able to revive...and that everything\'s okay...
Beato is a personification of the rules.
So, even though she was destroyed once, it is possible for her to be reborn again...
Battler had quickly succeeded in reviving Beato\'s body, but he had had trouble summoning her soul back.
However, during the time he had spent immersed in the creation of the sixth game, she had woken up.
 And this had happened three days ago.
Battler let himself be led into the dining hall.
The dining hall had been set up for his and Beato\'s use.
......It existed so that they could enjoy some black tea while discussing the truth, now that he had finally reached it in its entirety.
I want to tell her.
I want to tell Beato that I\'ve found the truth.
Battler couldn\'t hold back his excitement over this miracle he had been granted, that Beato was waiting for him in the dining hall to hear what he had to say...
"How is {f:5:Beatrice}?
 Same as usual?
 Is she in high spirits?"
"Oh yes, she is in very high spirits now.
 She has been waiting for you all this time, my lord. Oh yes."
"Is she in the dining hall? Is she eating or something?
 Ah, that\'s alright, it doesn\'t matter either way...!"
"Hoh‐hoh‐ho, you\'ll be surprised..."
"{f:5:Beatrice}...!!"
When he swung open the doors to the dining hall,
 ......Battler was greeted by a wonderful sight.
Though the food laid out on the table wasn\'t particularly sensational,
 it was arranged beautifully, and a champagne bottle stood there waiting.
......Then, ......the person clad in that familiar dress with the beautiful golden hair bowed deeply in greeting.
"......B‐......{f:5:Beatrice}..."
"You have my sincerest gratitude for giving me this form."
"Ha...hahahaha...
 Come on, don\'t worry about that......
 ...I\'m so glad...
 Beato........."
Battler rushed up to Beato and hugged her tightly.
Just to make sure her body wasn\'t just mist or an illusion...
"......I...
...solved...
your riddle for you......
 But then,
 before I could tell you about it,
 you went and disappeared......"
"......I am right here...
 I will not disappear..."
"It\'s okay, you can stop talking like that.
 I\'m not going to ask you for anything in return.
 ......Anyway, I want to apologize.
 And I want to talk with you.
 ......I don\'t even know where I should start."
"You have done nothing that you need to apologize for, Father.
 ...I\'m glad just to be of service to you."
".........Beato......?"
"I was born for your sake, Father.
 Please, let me support you.
 And Father,
 congratulations on completing the sixth game."
"I told you, stop talking like that.
 It\'s totally creepy."
"......Do you find this style of speech displeasing?
 Please forgive my rudeness..."
"Well, I don\'t "find it displeasing", but it\'s not like you.
 I guess I like the way you usually talk best."
"....................."
Beato smiled vaguely.
To Battler, it probably looked as though they were both smiling over the same joke.
......However, Beato\'s smile was literally vague and uncertain.
After all...she didn\'t know how she was supposed to talk...
"Anyway, Beato.
 Just what kind of joke is this?
 Don\'t tell me that the great {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama decided to cook for me...?"
"When I heard that you had completed the sixth game,
 I wanted to see if I could prepare a modest reward to congratulate you......"
"...Hoh‐hoh‐ho.
 {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama really worked hard to make this.
 I didn\'t even need to lend a hand at all, no I didn\'t!"
The food set on the table really was modest and inexpertly made.
You could tell by looking at it that Beato, who wasn\'t particularly skilled with cooking, had given it her all when making it...
However, signs of discomfort and irritation were beginning to appear on Battler\'s face......
"......What...
......is this all about...?"
"Well, as she said, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama decided that she would like to congratulate......"
Sweat was starting to show up on Kumasawa\'s forehead...
......She was also feeling uneasy.
When he noticed, Battler realized that it wasn\'t just his imagination.
Beato turned her back to Battler and stuck a corkscrew into the champagne bottle.
Then, she showed it to Battler.
"Father, congratulations on the completion of the sixth game.
 In the hopes that you will prove victorious over your longtime rival, Furudo Erika..."
Pop.
When presented with a champagne bottle and a sound like that, anyone would think that the cork had been pulled out.
However, it wasn\'t the cork......it was the bottom of the bottle.
The high‐quality champagne that Beato had procured splashed out all over the floor and her dress.
Then, the same sound repeated several more times.
......Each time, one of the plates of food on the table was knocked into the air.
"F‐
......Father,
 ......did you find the food displeasing...?"
"Who......are you...?"
"...I, ......I am {f:5:Beatrice}.
 ...I was born for your sake, Father..."
"No..."
"Huh...?"
"Who is this?!
 This isn\'t Beato...!!
 And don\'t call me Father...!!
 What\'s going on here?!
 What is this?!
 Didn\'t I revive Beato?!
 Genji, what\'s this all about?!!"
"......My apologies,
 but that is indeed {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama."
"Like hell it is!
 How is this supposed to be Beato?!
 She\'s totally wrong, a fake!!"
"No, that is {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.
 It is, without a doubt, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, who was born in accordance with the rules of the game board."
"No, this isn\'t anything like Beato...!!
 Beato would always talk in this weird way, she\'d laugh rudely, and more, and more...!!"
"No, this is unquestionably {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama herself."
"Then why is she talking like that?
 Why is she calling me Father?!"
"B‐{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama was only born a short while ago...
 It would be far too cruel to expect her to act as she once did so soon..."
"Are you saying that her memory hasn\'t returned yet?"
".........My lord.
 This person is most certainly {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama herself.
 However, she is not the {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama you know so well."
"What are you talking about...?!
 I\'m the Game Master, right?!
 Why can\'t I revive Beato...?!"
"Oh yes, she most certainly has revived.
 However, the old {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama had lived for a thousand years.
 ......This {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, on the other hand, was only born a short while ago...!
 If she appears to be a different person, well, that just can\'t be helped...!"
"Then, ...how can I revive that Beato?!
 Her body is right here!
 How can I revive her soul?!"
"......If she lives the same thousand‐year life again, she should become the same {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama she was before."
"So I\'m supposed to wait a thousand years...?!"
"A, a person\'s personality isn\'t decided solely by their birth.
 It can change drastically based on how they live and what they experience..."
"......Do you understand?
 Even though she is the same Beato, she is not the same."
"I get it.
 ......Even if you had two of the exact same person, they could change enormously depending on their upbringing."
"Even though they might both be the same human to start with, their upbringing could change them so much that they effectively become two completely different people.
 ......Usually, we use the term "person" to refer to a person, not their personality.
 However, since {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s recognize a person by their personality, they might as well be two different people, from a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} perspective..."
"......That\'s so true.
 If that tragedy twelve years ago hadn\'t happened, missy here might have been a cute girl who could smile without looking weird."
"That\'s rude.
 I\'m cute enough right now, thank you very much."
......I understand.
If a personality is what makes a person a person in our eyes,
 you could say that a second personality is a different person entirely, even if it inhabits the same flesh body.
At the very least,
 I\'m a completely different person than I used to be twelve years ago.
And if my family had come home twelve years ago,
 ......then the Ange that resulted would surely be a completely different person from me.
Even the same human can become different people.
{n}In fact, depending on their upbringing and endless possibilities, they can become an endless number of different people.
......So, just because this is the same Beato,
 ......that\'s no guarantee at all that she\'ll be the Beato that Onii‐chan knows so well.
"And on top of that, {f:5:Beatrice} is a witch who lived a thousand years.
 ......A person can die and be reborn in the span of just three days.
 A thousand years.........is just too long."
".........It seems you\'re quite a skilled reader.
 ...For most of my readers, it would be necessary to devote several hundred pages to explaining how a single human...
can become different people depending on their upbringing and the passage of time."
"Don\'t underestimate your readers.
 We aren\'t just reading.
 We read...and we think."
"......If I give my work to a hundred people to read, ninety will actually be able to.
 However, only fifty will actually understand what it means.
 And not even twenty will be capable of thinking beyond that.
 ......Yet all I am asking is that they chew before they swallow.
 ...Nothing more than that. *giggle*"
"However, it seems that "you" are one of those precious twenty readers...
 That\'s why I invited you here, child of man..."
It was hard to actually like this Hachijo Tohya person.
......However, though this forgery she had written was still in its first stages,
 ......it definitely felt as though it had something very similar to the tales in those message bottles.
Speaking metaphorically, ......one might call it a scent.
An indescribable stern atmosphere, ......like a stuffy library.
The "{f:5:Beatrice}" who wrote the message bottles and Hachijo Tohya are different people.
......And yet, this has the same scent as that tale...
......I see.
 This is why some of those curious Witch Hunters are so intensely devoted to her...
Their keen sense of smell was able to sniff out that familiar scent......
"Very well then.
 ......Please continue reading.
 There could be nothing more entertaining than watching your face as you glance over the words.
 That, and speaking with you..."
"I guess it\'s true that writers are always starving for opinions on their works.
 ......Sorry to disappoint you, but I don\'t have time to read all the way through this thick manuscript.
 More importantly, I came here to............"
"......But you have all the time in the world......"
Both the second hand and the pendulum on the ornate clock behind Hachijo had been moving the whole time.
However, ......absolutely no time had passed for a while now.
Only about three minutes had gone by since the time she had entered the room...
"See?
 Time isn\'t something you have to worry about.
 ......Time everywhere will leave you alone until you\'ve finished reading..."
"................................."
"Next page, missy, next page."
Amakusa badgered me to turn the page, ......so I returned to the world of the tale once more.
......Why does her tale have the same scent as {f:5:Beatrice}\'s, I wonder...
Is it because......she actually has reached the truth, as she claims?
Does this mean that anyone who knows the truth could create an endless number of message bottles?
......Is that what the cat box world is like...?
I see.
 ......Maybe she really is an Endless Witch herself.
In fact,
 ......maybe anyone who knows the truth can become an Endless Witch.
An endless tale created by Endless Witches.
{n}The two days starting on October 4th, 1986, where my family is being toyed with endlessly.
......I have to end it.
I have to find a hint of the truth from within this story......and end this endless tale.
"What do you think, Beato?
 How\'s this sixth game I\'ve made?"
"........................"
"Well, you\'re not the type to give me an honest compliment anyway, are you...
 You\'d probably say something more like "not bad for an incompetent fool like you"."
"*cackle*cackle*.
 Not bad for an incompetent fool like you."
"Heh.
 Now that I\'ve seen what it\'s like to be a Game Master, I understand everything.
 ......You really had to work hard during each and every game."
"........................"
"‘Creating a game is not such an easy thing.
 To think the day would come when we would both congratulate each other like this.’"
"Creating a game is not such an easy thing.
 To think the day would come when we would both congratulate each other like this."
".............................."
".............................."
"......All wrong...
 ......This......isn\'t Beato..."
Battler slammed hard on the desk, but the piece Beato showed no reaction.
......After all, Battler hadn\'t ordered her to react.
It was easy to revive that Beato as a piece.
{n}However, it would only move according to Battler\'s wishes.
......Having a conversation with it...
...was no different...
...from talking to himself......
The Game Master could summon any kind of piece.
{n}He could move those pieces in any way he wanted, reigning as an absolute god.
......However, for that very reason,
 ......they were just pieces.
That made it unbelievably lonely...
...and sad.
"......You created many kinds of furniture, as well as several tales in the past.
 ......When I saw that, ......I was sure you were having a great time doing it."
""‘But that\'s wrong.’""
"You were......unbelievably lonely."
"‘It must have been such a relief for you to have an opponent in me who could actually go against you.
 I\'m painfully aware of that now.’"
".........That weird, polite Beato...
...she {i:is} you, I don\'t doubt that.
 ......The way you were a thousand years ago."
""‘However,
 ......she is a separate person.’""
"The way she looks just like you is what I really can\'t get over...!
 I can\'t stand it......"
"‘However, she isn\'t a piece, so she can go against my will.’"
"Sure, unlike the piece {i:you} are, that Beato is much more alive.
 I acknowledge that!
 But it\'s all wrong!!
 That isn\'t you!
 She\'s a completely separate person, like a long‐lost little sister or something!
 And that\'s why...
...I just can\'t accept her...!!"
......As much as he hated this piece Beato...
Battler felt an even stronger dislike...
...for the "chick" Beato.
Even after a whole thousand years,
 she still wouldn\'t become the original Beato.
Even if she were ordered to act like the original Beato, ......it would just be an imitation.
This was a very similar but separate person, and definitely not Beato herself.
......Then, .........in the previous game,
 ......Beato really did disappear for all eternity...
Even after becoming the Game Master,
 .........there was no way to revive her.........
"......Laugh.
 Laugh at how pathetic I am."
"............
 ......Heheheheh,
 *cackle*cackle*.
 Pfft,
 hya
hah
ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hah{0}ha{0}ha{0}haa{0}a{0}aah!!"
Just give it a rest already......
You\'re just an illusion who won\'t laugh unless I order it...
...and who can\'t even continue to laugh unless I keep on ordering it...
 ......Just disappear!!......On Rokkenjima, this day—
or rather, this time around—
was the same as any other.
The typhoon would be coming very soon.
{n}The clouds hadn\'t yet grown thick, but they were moving quickly.
The only thing on Natsuhi\'s mind was the plan to cover up Kinzo\'s absence this year as well.
Krauss appeared to have suffered a stomachache from the stress and was resting in his room.
Jessica and Kumasawa had left in a boat to go shopping and greet the incoming relatives on Niijima.
The servants had been busy since the early morning in preparation for the family conference, the greatest event of the year...
Shannon and Kanon were getting the guesthouse ready.
"......Shouldn\'t the guest rooms in the mansion be more than enough to hold the relatives?"
"Good point.
 It is a pain to clean up here as well.
 ......Even so, I like cleaning the guesthouse."
"Yeah, it\'s nice and quiet without Madam and all the annoying servants."
Shannon gave a non‐committal smile as she performed a detailed examination of the guest room.
Did we forget to clean anything? Do we need to restock anything?
{n}She diligently gave the room one final check over......
"You checked everything thoroughly last night too, didn\'t you?
 You really are dedicated."
"It\'s on days like this when you tend to get pranked if you\'re careless.
 ......You can never find important things when you need them,
 and things that were supposed to be closed turn out to be open."
"That\'s because you\'re too careless.
 You don\'t pay attention while you work."
"I guess that\'s why you\'re helping me check.
 Thanks."
"......There\'s nothing to thank me for.
 If you were a bit more alert, I wouldn\'t have to help at all."
".........*giggle*.
 But the truth is, you just want to be with me, right?
 You\'re such a kid."
"Th‐that\'s not it at all...
 It\'s all because you\'ve been so ecstatic about George‐sama lately.
 You\'re messing up so much, I can\'t let you out of my sight."
"*giggle*...
 ......Kanon‐kun.
 Let\'s chat a bit."
"......We can\'t do that now. We\'re working."
"You keep making fun of me and George‐sama,
 ......but how is it going between you and Jessica‐sama?"
"N‐......nothing\'s going on in particular.
 If you have time to talk about that, let\'s just finish this...
......wah—"
Kanon was—very obviously—trying to change the subject.
{n}So Shannon snuck up behind him and pushed him down onto the bed.
"Why did you turn down Milady when she asked you to go with her to welcome the relatives?"
".........Because I have work to do..."
"Liar.
 ......You don\'t actually have any work at all."
Shannon and Kanon had switched roles.
Normally, Kanon was the one in control, but when it came to romance, it was the opposite.
As Shannon had said, ......Jessica and Kanon were supposed to have been the ones to go greet the relatives at the Niijima harbor.
However, Kanon had suddenly claimed that he had work to do, so Kumasawa had gone instead.
Kanon...didn\'t have any work to do.
 Shannon knew this...
"Milady told me.
 ......Despite everything that happened after the cultural festival, her feelings for you haven\'t changed."
"............Even though I\'m...furniture..."
"That\'s right.
 And I\'m furniture too."
"......And yet you\'re in love with a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.
 ......Even though that\'s never going to be possible."
"You think so...?
 ......Maybe thinking that way...
...is what makes us furniture."
"I don\'t have any special feelings for Milady Jessica.
 ......I only think of her as the daughter of the family we serve."
"Really...?"
"Really."
"........................"
"......Wh‐......what?"
"You know,
 ............there is a chance...
that George‐sama will propose to me tonight."
"...............!"
Shannon wore an incredibly peaceful smile on her face,
 ......but Kanon could tell that there was no way she\'d let him change the subject.
Kanon realized that she must have made him help out here in the guesthouse in order to talk to him about this, and he clicked his tongue softly...
"......You really think you can marry a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} even though you\'re furniture?"
"I think I can."
"That\'s impossible."
"Why?"
"That dream future that George‐sama has imagined for you two...is something you can never give him."
"W‐......well......"
"......We aren\'t {y:0:Humans}{n:0:humans}.
 We\'re furniture, inferior to them.
 George‐sama only thinks that you\'re {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}."
"...W‐......well, that is true, but......"
"I\'m impressed that you\'ve managed to trick him for this long.
 Do you really think you can keep tricking him like that forever?
 Even though you still haven\'t been able to tell him that you\'re furniture."
"......Being furniture or being {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}...has nothing to do with this.
 ......I believe that George‐sama will accept all of me."
"And yet you don\'t have the courage to check and make sure."
"........................
 ......You know,
 ......I\'m planning on...
saying yes."
As Shannon looked up at the ceiling, ......she spoke of the imagined future that she and George would create.
Though some anxiety over the future appeared on her face,
 ......so did joy from discovering what it was like to live with love.
As Kanon watched this vivid dream he was being shown,
 ......he knew that none of his words would reach Shannon anymore...
"......Hmph.........
 ...You can just do what you want.
 ......Once you\'ve said something, you\'re incredibly stubborn."
"Yep.
 ......I want to live life my own way.
 ......I\'ve decided to stop worrying...
about who\'s furniture and who\'s a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}."
"........................"
Kanon walked over to the window silently.
......He saw the rose garden filled with boring, gray flowers in bloom...
He understood that Shannon was acting above her place.
And he knew that her tale had no chance of a happy ending.
......However, he also knew that now Shannon had made her decision,
 no words of his could change her mind.
".........In that case,
 ......it doesn\'t matter what I say.
 ......If I tell you to stop, you won\'t listen.
 If I tell you to do what you want, you\'ll do what you want.
 ......Why are you talking to me about this?
 It\'s not like you care what my response is."
"What I want to know...
...is how you feel about Milady."
"......I have nothing to do with the two of you."
"Do you really...
...feel absolutely nothing...
for Milady?"
"......No, I don\'t, as I keep telling you."
"Liar."
"Why do you think that\'s a lie?"
"I know.
 I\'m your big sister."
"You don\'t know.
 You can\'t know what I\'m feeling...!!"
"I do.
 I know everything about you, Kanon‐kun."
"If you really do know, then why are you asking?!
 Your head and heart are already full with your feelings for George‐sama!!
 And that single‐hearted devotion is what I love about you!!
 That\'s why......I\'m rooting for you in the only way I can, you know that!!
 Otherwise, ......even I...!!"
"Even I?"
"Even I...
.........would have loved to fall for Milady...!!!"
Kanon finally turned to face her, honestly and openly telling her his real emotions.
That was what Shannon had wanted to hear.
{n}And having heard it, she closed in even further on Kanon\'s true feelings.
"No, you can\'t word it that way.
 I won\'t let you."
"Then what do you want from me?!!
 What am I supposed to say?!!"
"Don\'t try to dodge by saying "I would have loved to fall for her".
 All you need to do is honestly tell me what you really feel."
"Milady is......too dazzling for me!!
 The way she lives is blinding like the sun!!
 That\'s what I love about her...!
 I was so happy when Milady stretched out her hand and asked me to walk with her!!
 No, I still am happy!!"
"You love her, don\'t you?"
"Yes, I do!!
 I love Milady!!"
Finally,
 ......Kanon confessed his feelings in their entirety.
In fact, by saying it aloud, he finally understood how he truly felt.
As passionate tears welled up in his eyes,
 ......Kanon finally accepted it...
He couldn\'t stop the tears from dripping down his face.
"Milady was exactly like me, locked up on Rokkenjima and living without any hope at all...!
 And yet, she was able to light her own path and create her own fate...!
 She was so dazzling that I envied her!!
 I felt as though, if I could be with her, ......I could find my true self, instead of the pitiful person I am now...!!"
"When you turned down Milady\'s confession,
 ......were you sad?"
"I was!!
 I never realized that lying to yourself could be so sad, so painful, so excruciating!!
 And I just couldn\'t forgive myself for hurting Milady with that lie!!
 I believed that I didn\'t have any right to fall in love ever again!!"
"But you do.
 The right to love...
is something only you can give yourself.
 Being furniture or not has nothing to do with it.
 If you tell yourself "no", then it\'ll never happen.
 You mustn\'t think that way.
 That\'s why I gave myself, impudent furniture that I am, the right to fall in love.
 And you have it too."
"The right to fall in love?"
"Yes.
 If you can\'t give it to yourself, then I will."
"Thank you.
 ......I...
feel as though...
I can finally...
see the sea......"
"......I\'m certain.
 Tonight, George‐sama...
will propose to me."
".............................."
"When he does, I will accept.
 ......I intend to leave this island and start a new life in a new world."
"If that\'s the path you\'ve chosen,
 ......then I have no say in the matter."
"I\'ll leave this island, ......and I\'ll never return again.
 ......It will mean saying farewell to you, Kanon‐kun."
"...........................
 ......You\'re right.
 ......We won\'t......see each other again, will we?"
"If...
...if you do love Milady from the bottom of your heart, and if you can honestly say that your feelings are at least as strong as the ones I have for George‐san,
 .........then you and I need to settle this."
"......N‐.........nee‐san......"
"This way is best for both of us.
 ..........Don\'t give up on your feelings on account of me."
"Even though my selfishness might keep you from your happiness......?"
"I\'m fully aware of it.
 ......My happiness......is hurting you as well."
We have no choice but to hurt each other.
As she said this, Shannon turned her back to Kanon...
As Kanon watched Shannon from behind,
 ......he was struck by her strength...
...and the sisterly love she showed in still thinking of him despite everything.
"......Nee‐san.
 Living with you...made me happy."
"Me too.
 I wouldn\'t have lasted this long without you.
 ......And that\'s why I was able to meet George‐san."
"Yeah.
 And I wouldn\'t have realized how dazzling Milady is......if it weren\'t for you."
"I won\'t abandon my emotions.
 ......I\'ll focus only on my feelings and ignore everything else, and I won\'t look away when I trample over your heart."
"......Me too. I won\'t use you as an excuse...
...to hide the way I really feel."
"Whether my love bears fruit...
or yours does,
 ......let\'s each agree to celebrate the other."
"Yes.
 ......I promise.
 And if I win,
 ......I will love Milady......and treasure you."
"Thank you.
 But if I win,
 ......I\'ll forget you and this island and leave this place forever."
"Yes.
 ......Whichever of us wins,
 that person will pursue their love with all they\'ve got.
 ......Even if they know that love will be unrequited."
"Yes.
 After all..."
{a:c:
""We are furniture...no more.""}
The boat carrying the relatives docked at Rokkenjima\'s harbor.
They left the boat one by one, making fun of Battler...
Gohda wasn\'t the only one to greet them. Kanon was there too.
"It has been quite some time, everyone.
 Allow me to welcome you to Rokkenjima."
"......I hope that your long journey went smoothly.
 Welcome to Rokkenjima......"
"Ah, good, good."
Gohda complimented Kanon in a whisper.
Kanon ignored this, looking just a little sour, and continued to greet the incoming relatives.
"This is your first time meeting Gohda‐san and Kanon‐kun, isn\'t it, Battler‐kun?"
"Uu!
 It\'s my first time meeting Battler too!
 *giggle*giggle*!"
"Gohda‐san\'s a splendid chef.
 He\'s the only reason anyone\'d ever want to come to this island."
"I am most honored.
 Battler‐sama, I do hope that you look forward to your meals during your stay."
"I can\'t wait...!
 I\'ll be looking forward to it!"
"It\'s good to see you again, Kanon‐kun.
 You seem to be in high spirits today.
 That\'s great."
"......Y‐you think so...?"
"Oh yes. Your face is looking brighter today.
 I can\'t tell if it\'s your complexion or if your gaze looks a bit more gallant."
"Hahah, it must be a growing phase.
 That\'s how a boy becomes a man."
"You usually look as though you\'re about to pass out from anemia.
 You\'re a bit different today."
"You\'ve got some vigor.
 A boy can change a lot in just three days.
 I guess this means even Kanon‐kun\'s gettin\' a bit more manly!"
"We aren\'t making fun of you, okay?
 We\'re all complimenting you. *giggle*"
......Kanon had sworn that starting today, he would start changing the way he lived bit by bit.
However, he had only meant to change within himself, and hadn\'t expected that it would show on the outside.
He was a bit shocked to hear that his expression had changed so much...
that people had apparently noticed as soon as he opened his mouth.
No,
 ......maybe the real surprise should have been that his normal expression looked so incredibly sullen in comparison.
Gohda led the way up to the guesthouse.
{n}Kanon brought up the rear, helping to carry some of Kumasawa\'s shopping.
"......Does my...face really look that bright today?"
"Hoh‐hoh‐ho...
 It looks that way to me as well.
 ......Did something good happen?
 *giggle*giggle*."
Even Kumasawa was saying it.
......Kanon, unable to see what his own face looked like, hung his head in embarrassment.
......When they reached the rose garden, they could see the others entering the guesthouse.
Then, he saw Jessica running towards him from there.
......Is even Milady Jessica going to say that I\'m in a good mood today?
Kanon hung his head even deeper.
And so, almost as though he couldn\'t control himself, Kanon spoke first.
"......Do I really look that different?"
"Huh?
 A...hahahahahaha.
 ......Well, you know.
 You aren\'t usually the type to come out and say hello of your own accord.
 That\'s probably why everyone was surprised..."
".....................
 ......I apologize for not going with you earlier, Milady."
"Huh?
 Oh, don\'t worry about that...
 I\'m the one who\'s sorry for asking you to come all the way out to Niijima with me just to meet everyone...
 I know how busy you must be today..."
"I......didn\'t have anything in particular to do.
 ......You were just so dazzling.
 ...So dazzling that I couldn\'t bear to be with you.
 ......I was just weak."
Jessica faltered, uncertain what Kanon was talking about.
{n}However, she realized that this was something too important to be laughed off.
"......Did something happen, Kanon‐kun...?"
"Shannon says...
...she\'s going to get married."
".........I see.
 ...So George nii‐san {i:is} going to propose this year."
Jessica thought that this change in Kanon\'s appearance was probably caused by a change in his state of mind. She thought he was sad that he and Shannon would soon be parting ways.
Kanon realized that Jessica was probably thinking this.
......So, he spoke to her clearly and honestly.
 Because he wanted her to know.
"I had long decided that if Nee‐san ever quit...
I would stop working here as well."
"......I know.
 ...So, are you going to quit too?"
"I\'m not sure anymore.
 ......I feel that, if I quit, I might again lose sight of......something that your dazzling sunlight revealed to me."
Jessica was stunned, unable to understand what he was saying.
......However, she did realize that he was trying to tell her something important.
And so, she was able to accept that his next words were neither a lie nor a joke...
"Milady Jessica, I...love you."
".........I,
 .........I love you too...!"
"You live your life like the sun...and I want to try walking that path alongside you.
 I have the feeling that, with you, I\'d be able to get away from the part of myself that regarded me with contempt and called me furniture."
"You aren\'t furniture, Kanon‐kun.
 And you weren\'t born just so you could become a servant!
 A boy your age should have the right to enjoy life much, much more...!
 Ha...hahahaha.
 I\'m the one who\'s dazzled.
 You\'re so dazzling......I can hardly see."
"These are my genuine feelings.
 .........I\'m...sorry for trying to hide them for so long.
 ......I apologize for hurting you on that day...in my cowardice."
"That\'s okay.
 Just hearing you say that......makes me happy."
"So,
 ......in order that I can continue to be with you,
 ......I plan to stop being furniture.
 I ask that you give me some time to do that.
 ......Please forgive this last bit of weakness."
"Th‐there\'s nothing weak about you...!
 You\'ve shown me.
 You\'ve shown me incredible courage by saying you want to change yourself from the way you used to be.
 So, I\'ll support you until the end, and I won\'t rush you until you\'re ready."
"......If I\'m the sun lighting your path,
 that\'s because I wanted to shine more brightly than anyone else so that you\'d look only at me.
 Without you, I\'d never have become like the sun.
 ......So, I\'ll wait.
 As long as needed."
"Thank you, Milady."
"......I...don\'t want to be ‘Milady’ to you anymore."
"May I......call you by your name?"
"Sure.
 .........Oh, but only when we\'re alone, okay?
 Otherwise, ...it might make things difficult for you."
"......Good point.
 Nee‐san and George‐sama are doing the same, it seems."
"If Shannon hadn\'t told you about the engagement, ......you wouldn\'t have said what you said just now, right?"
Kanon hung his head, at a loss for words for some time.
But it was true.
If Shannon hadn\'t told him about the engagement, he probably wouldn\'t have been having this conversation at this moment.
".........No, I wouldn\'t.
 ...Her words...allowed me to think seriously."
"Ah, come on.
 You heard about Shannon and you wanted to see what love felt like yourself, right?"
"Yes."
"......Th‐that\'s a pretty straight answer.
 ......W‐......well,
 when I watched those two, uh......I was pretty envious myself..."
In truth, the real reason was different for both of them.
They had been shown the courage that was needed to confess to the one they loved.
This was the reason for both Kanon and Jessica.
"......So, ......what should I...call you?"
"Just "Jessica" would be nice."
"......Just saying it like that......would be a bit embarrassing."
"Then you can use "san", at least at first.
 Why not try it out? Come on."
"J‐.........Jessica‐san......"
"Yeah. That\'ll do for now.
 And I\'d like to call you by your name, Kanon‐kun.
 ......You have a real name...besides Kanon, don\'t you?
 I\'ll bet it has {ruby:ka:{p:0:嘉}} in it, like Kanon does...
 Wh‐what could it be, ......ehehe..."
"......My name is Yoshiya ({p:0:嘉哉})."
"U‐......umm, ......how do you write it?"
Jessica tried tracing out various characters on the palm of her hand.
{n}......Then, Kanon used his own finger to write out his name on her hand...
"Like this...Yoshiya."
"......So, you\'re Yoshiya...kun...
 ......Yeah, that\'s a great name.
 ......Totally better than my weird name..."
"That\'s not true.
 Your name, Jessica, is just as—"
"Hey, say that again...!"
"Huh?
 ......Y‐your name, Jessica, is—"
"One more time!"
"Y‐your name, Jessica, is just as......um, ......is something wrong?"
"......*giggle*.
 It\'s nothing.
 Thanks.
 ...Yoshiya...kun."
The red, red flowers of the rose garden seemed to celebrate the two lovers whose feelings had finally connected...
......The scene was watched by one not human, who gazed out quietly from beneath the rose garden arbor...
".............................."
Come to think of it, those two had never called each other by their names until now.
Jessica hadn\'t known Kanon\'s true name.
{n}Kanon hadn\'t called Jessica by her name.
By calling someone by their name, people acknowledge the worth of that person\'s soul.
That is why names are sacred.
......Receiving permission to speak one means that your soul has been acknowledged.
"......Is that why...
...Father wants me to call him by his name......?"
No,
 ......that\'s probably wrong.
When Father sees me, it reminds him of that other me—the past me.
And I\'m sure that "me" called Father by his name.
However,
 ......that probably doesn\'t mean Father would be happy to hear me call him by his name.
After all,
 .........I am me...
......and not the {f:5:Beatrice} my Father knows well.
......What can I do...
...to help Father......?
How can I be useful to him?
That\'s the only reason I was born......
Hanging her head,
 {f:5:Beatrice} sat all alone in the Golden Land\'s arbor that was next to the rose garden...
This scene was watched by the Witch of Theatergoing and her miko as they sat across from each other...
".........Poor kid."
"I never thought I\'d see you feel compassion for Beato..."
"......It\'d be too cruel to call this Beato and the former Beato the same person.
 They\'re completely different people."
It may be that, by the rules, this Beato is {i:the} Beato.
......However, saying that would be horribly unfair to her.
".........Battler must be very depressed to have revived his former adversary and have things end up this way."
"I can sort of understand Onii‐chan\'s despair.
 ......However, I can understand how this child feels as well.
 ......No person can become a replacement for another.
 Not even the past version of themselves."
Compared to the young boy and girl who had found new versions of themselves and called each other by their true names,
 ......this witch looked very feeble.
The witch knew that she was an illusion created in the image of the person she once was.
And she also knew that it would only hurt Battler to try and pretend to be that person.
".........And even so, this Beato wants to be useful to Battler.
 ...How admirable."
"Is that the purpose of the witch known as {f:5:Beatrice}?"
"......That is what she claims.
 She says that she was created to be of service to Battler."
"So, the Beato who was born for Onii‐chan\'s sake eventually commits a serial murder...
and drags Onii‐chan into a bizarre game that she calls eternal torture?
 I don\'t get it."
"I believe you also understand that one can become a different person over a thousand years..."
......At the very least,
 {f:5:Beatrice} was once a pure creature who was born for Battler\'s sake.
It is also very clear that, in her current feeble state,
 she does not possess any of the courage or the motivation needed to bring about those horrifying serial murders.
If so, ......that means the sinister witch we all know...
must have changed during the thousand years since her birth.
"......We keep getting this "thousand years" business,
 but I get the feeling that those words are just a metaphor for a really long time in the world of witches."
"As you get closer to the world of gods, the concept of time becomes increasingly vague.
 Six years can become a thousand, and a thousand years can be nothing more than a quick nap.
 ......One can fit an eternity long enough to be deserving of the title "one‐hundred‐year‐old witch" in a mere two weeks..."
In other words, the pure Beato transformed into the cruel Beato...
...during those six years that could be called a thousand...
So, does that mean something bad happened during those six years that made her hate Onii‐chan?
"That doesn\'t make sense.
 During those six years, Onii‐chan not only stayed away from Rokkenjima, he even stopped using the Ushiromiya name.
 ......Onii‐chan had nothing to do with her change.
 Her hatred must be totally misguided."
"..........................."
"Oh, so this is where you were...
 Shall I make you some black tea...?"
"......Kumasawa‐san.
 ......There\'s something I\'d like to know."
"Hoh‐hoh‐ho...
 Very well, what is it?"
".........My name is {f:5:Beatrice}...
...isn\'t it?"
"Yes, that is correct.
 You are {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, Milady."
"However, ......the {f:5:Beatrice} that Father talks about...isn\'t me."
"......Well........."
"I think Father wanted me to be that person.
 But no matter how much I look like her...I\'m a different person.
 ......I think that might be why he\'s disappointed in me..."
"That isn\'t true...
 You are you, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama herself."
"......You have merely lost your memory of the past after being newly reborn...
 Even without your memory, you are still {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.
 You are the same person whom the Master loves."
"......So then,
 ......how can I regain those memories...?"
"Well............"
Beato looked at Kumasawa with hopeful eyes, as though praying that she would tell her the way.
......Kumasawa averted her gaze unhelpfully, as though trying to say that she would if only such a way existed...
"If I can\'t regain them,
 ......can\'t you at least tell me what kind of person the {f:5:Beatrice} Father loved was?"
"Th‐......that is something I can tell you, but......"
"{p:1:I was born for Father\'s sake}.
 So, I want to become the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice} that Father desires."
"......B‐......{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama......"
"I can\'t use magic.
 ......But if the witch Father desires could use it, then I will learn.
 I want to become the witch he desires.
 That\'s the only way I can repay Father for creating me."
".........That\'s admirable.
 Without the thousand years gone wrong, she really is an incredible kid."
"A chick of a witch......very interesting.
 ......I\'ve taken a liking to her, Ange.
 I shall allow this chick to make use of my study.
 Let us open the door which leads back to the world of witches."
"......So, you\'re going to make her read aloud the stories about her previous self.
 ...Yes, I want to know too.
 The tale of how the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice} {i:was created}."
"........................
 ...Very well.
 If you wish it,
 ......then let us open the door once again."
"......Kumasawa...
san..."
A spray of gold welled up around them.
{n}......It was a cloud of gold butterflies.
With a golden flash, the form of the old lady transformed into that of a witch in a dress......
"You must choose the path that you are to walk down.
 ......Let us call it a path of roses.
 The beautifully blooming roses may celebrate you and they may torment you with their thorns."
"......But even so, it is a path that you once walked down.
 ...You may pass through the same thousand years.
 You may pass through a different thousand years.
 If you wish, you may even return back the way you came."
"I\'ll move on forward.
 ......I don\'t want to spend a thousand years in this garden drinking tea.
 ......I, {f:5:Beatrice}, was born for Father\'s sake.
 So I want to live for Father\'s sake.
 Please tell me...about the Golden Witch."
......The great witch spread her arms,
 communicating {f:5:Beatrice}\'s unbending determination to the brilliant heavens.
At that moment, a brilliant light covered the two of them,
 and before they knew it, they were in a strange study.
There sat the great old witch who was the master of these archives, along with her miko.
...{f:5:Virgilia} gave a deep and elegant bow.
"......It is the greatest of honors to be in your presence.
 Lady {f:5:Featherine Augustus Aurora}, the majestic Witch of Theatergoing, Drama, and Spectating."
"Raise your head, child of man.
 ......I shall give that child the privilege of browsing my archives as she pleases for a time.
 ......Ange, my miko.
 See that she has no trouble."
"Sure, sure, as you wish, my master.
 You could just say that you want to see her story, you know."
"Miko of the Witch of Theatergoing.
 ......I leave {f:5:Beatrice} in your care."
"......Pleased...
...to meet you......"
".....................
 ......The {f:5:Beatrice} you\'re trying to become......was suffering from something.
 ...At the very least, you\'ve been released from that for now.
 ......Will you really go on a journey to regain those shackles...?"
"Y‐......yes.
 ......I want to become the Golden Witch.
 ......That is the reason I was born."
"In order that her journey through Purgatory may be a pleasant one,
 and that she may be granted protection as she travels, I ask your assistance by the name of the Endless and Finite Witch, {f:5:Publius Virgilia Maro}."
"Huh? Oh, uh...
 ......Let it be known that as the miko of the Witch of Theatergoing and as the Endless Witch and Apprentice Witch of Resurrection,
 I, {f:5:Ange Beatrice}, do accede to your request and all that stuff..."
{f:5:Featherine} snorted.
"......So,
 ......your name is also {f:5:Beatrice}......?"
".........Yes.
 I know a lot about you."
"Please teach me.
 What kind of person was I?"
"Sure.
 ......And I\'ll want you to teach me.
 Why did you become the person you were?"
"......In this archive, the fragments showing the tales of all your games up until now are stored as books.
 By reading them, you should be able to learn everything that has happened before now..."
"By reading them, can I become the Golden Witch......?"
"......To become the Golden Witch, one must solve the epitaph of the gold.
 ......And this trial cannot be skipped, not even by {f:5:Beatrice} herself......"
"I, I\'ll do my best.
 So please, let me read the books in this archive...!"
"......As worthy of admiration as ever.
 I have no idea why you want to go back to being like that so much..."
"I don\'t know what I was like then.
 ......But if that me can be of use to Father,
 that is what I want to become."
Ange sighed resignedly.
{n}......She had no words with which to stop this girl from following her noble sense of purpose.
...After all, Ange was the miko of the Witch of Theatergoing.
{n}She could do nothing except watch over the stage.
Yes—they weren\'t actually interfering with the play.
This was just a bit of directing...to shine the spotlight onto the tale of Beato\'s past.
Even this was nothing more than the Witch of Theatergoing watching a play.
"If you read, you will learn what kind of a person the old {f:5:Beatrice} was.
 ......However, you must decide what you will take from that experience...
 ......You are free to stay in the archive or leave the archive or even return to the archive again later.
 ......In compensation, I will watch your play."
"Watch my play...?"
"......It means you can do whatever you want."
"Th‐thank you very much, Augusauau......umm—"
"She likes it when you call her {f:5:Featherine}."
"Thank you very much, {f:5:Featherine}‐sama......"
After being welcomed in by {f:5:Featherine}, ......Beato set out on a journey to discover herself.
That tale connected the old tale with the new one.
 It wove them together.
......The thousand‐year‐old tale about her returned to its starting point, becoming a snake eating its own tail.
The ring of that snake began slowly, bit by bit, to turn into the shape of a small island floating on the sea.
That island......was Rokkenjima.
The thousand years of the witch born on this island...were tied to the island.
Was it a thousand years, or just six?
{n}......Or did this tale start even further back into the past?
{f:5:Beatrice} went out on a journey to find herself......
The wind had been strengthening since a while back.
The breaking waves had grown fierce.
{n}The ferryboats probably wouldn\'t be coming for a while now.
The crashing thunder told that the island had been sealed off from the outside world.
A thick rain poured down,
 mocking the fools outdoors who had to rush pathetically to find shelter.
No longer would anyone be able to leave this island.
{n}......And no longer would anyone be able to reach this island.
......No one, unless blessed with a miracle.
There was another flash of lightning.
{n}......The retinas of all who saw it were filled with white.
As that white faded away,
 ......an eerie silhouette pulled itself up at the raging water\'s edge...
As though suddenly remembering, it coughed violently several times,
 filthily spitting out the sea water that had filled its stomach.
......And then, tearing apart the velcro of her life jacket,
 she cast off the reason she had been able to float here without so much as a thank you.
"Hahahahahahaha,
 ahahahahahahahaha!!
 Gurgh,
 *cough*cough*cough*,
 haah, haah, haah...
 ......*cackle*cackle*, ahahahahahahaha!!
 Welcomed in by a storm, same as always! Very <good>!
 And now, you and I are going to have some fun...Battler‐san!!"The news about the drifter, Furudo Erika, quickly spread across Rokkenjima.
Erika was politely entertained, and it was decided that she would be treated as a guest until the typhoon passed.
In the dining hall, Gohda\'s wonderful dinner had ended, and everyone was relaxing and enjoying some after‐dinner coffee and cheese......
Apparently, Battler was a bit relieved that Erika had come and turned into a good scapegoat.
 It drove away some of the attention he\'d been getting piled on him for finally coming back after six years.
In fact, she turned out to be very talkative.
When the conversation turned to a sophisticated discussion of the mystery genre, even the adults were drawn in.
She was apparently so well versed that even Nanjo, who had a vast knowledge of the subject, was impressed.
"Wahahaha, good point.
 A strange family in a Western mansion on an isolated island during a storm.
 Now that we have a detective stopping by to take shelter from the rain, we\'ve got all the major factors lined up."
"Have no fear.
 No matter how difficult the crime, I will solve it.
 That\'s a detective\'s job."
"How reassuring.
 In fact, I would quite enjoy it if some kind of bizarre incident were to occur now.
 I just hope I don\'t have to play the part of the victim."
"Don\'t be imprudent, dear."
"Well,
 the history of the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} mystery genre is only about a century old.
 Its tricks and ideas are limited to a few recycled patterns, so there\'s nothing left to show.
 No matter what kind of impossible crimes or locked‐room murders might occur,
 it\'ll be nothing more than one of the same classes of tricks dressed up to look like something new."
"......The only reason mysteries still make for popular books today...
is because self‐proclaimed "fans", who work off pieced‐together knowledge and who have hardly read any of the classics,
 mistake classic tricks they didn\'t know about for something new and surprising through lack of proper study."
Everyone couldn\'t help but gape at this imposing claim...
If an aged critic had said it, that would have been one thing.
 ......But it showed incredible boldness for a young person like her to state that so strongly...
"Mystery...
is a genre that ended a half‐century ago.
 At least as far as I\'m concerned.
 ......However, thanks to the countless ignorant fools, I get to play my part as detective.
 *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*...!"
"By that argument,
 romance was perfected back in Shakespeare\'s time and anything after that isn\'t worth reading."
"That\'s a good point.
 Then I suppose that so long as you read Romeo and Juliet, you essentially understand all of romance, wouldn\'t you say?"
"Nah, that\'s ridiculous.
 .........Books aren\'t a competition—it\'s not about who\'s read the most—
but boasting that you\'ve read all you ever need to read is just as wrong‐headed.
 ......Just reading classics of the past and never anything new is being overly nostalgic, don\'t you think?
 That sounds to me like the excuse of an old person who\'s too lazy to read anything."
".....................
 ......That\'s fair.
 It seems I need to read at least as much as you before I\'ll be able to beat you in an argument."
"Me?
 Haha, I don\'t read."
"..........................."
Battler chuckled, ......but Erika knew from the previous game that "Battler" was actually quite an avid reader.
So, his words felt like more of a challenge.
"If you\'re so confident in your reasoning abilities, you must be really good at quizzes and puzzles, right?"
"Oh, right. Maria, didn\'t you bring a quiz book or something?"
"Uu!
 Brought it!!"
Picking up that Erika\'s arrogant statement had made the atmosphere a little tense,
 George smoothly changed the subject.
By now, it was more than clear that she wasn\'t the charming guest she had appeared to be.
Maria pulled a book out of her bag that had quizzes and puzzles written in it and started posing them to everyone.
It might have looked as though it would become a peaceful quiz party,
 .........but of course, that wasn\'t what happened.
In credit to all her big talking, Erika managed an impressive ratio of correct and immediate answers...
Erika took complete control.
 ......Her bragging began to escalate more and more.
George slightly regretted the choice he had made when changing the subject.
"106 matches.
 No need to even write a tournament chart for it."
The question "How many matches would you need for a tournament with 107 teams?" was answered instantly by Erika.
"This is less of a puzzle than it is a test of knowledge.
 There\'s a formula which shows that the number of matches is always the number of teams minus one.
 ......Well, if you just look at the examples showing three matches for four teams and seven matches for eight teams, it should be easy to figure out the pattern."
"Uu!
 Erika, that\'s awesome!"
"Erika onee‐chan, right?!
 Say it."
"Uu, Erika onee‐chan, that\'s awesome."
"Really impressive.
 .........So, you don\'t call yourself a detective for nothing."
"I couldn\'t very well act the part of the detective if I was incapable of handling puzzles of this sort."
"Incredible.
 I\'m sure you\'ll be able to become a real detective in the future."
"Well, I\'m pretty sure I already am one."
The cousins all thought about the answers to the questions, but Erika always answered first.
Rosa thought that it was a bit rude for Erika to say the answers out loud while people were thinking, instead of keeping them to herself,
 but since Erika was a guest, Rosa decided against mentioning it.
......In truth, Erika was perfectly aware of this when she answered the questions instantly.
Each time, she would grin broadly,
 as though saying "is it really taking you all this long to solve such an easy problem?"...
"......Since you\'re a great detective, you don\'t really need to take this so seriously, right?"
"You\'re right.
 Even though these are just childish questions, I\'ve been taking them a bit too seriously.
 ......I\'ll take more care, so let\'s hear the next question please."
"Alright, I won\'t lose this time.
 Maria, next question please!"
"Umm, ......you have one large piece of cheese.
 A single slice with a knife can split it into two parts.
 So, what is the lowest number of slices you can make to cut it into eight parts?
 Uu!"
"Oh, I know this one.
 So I guess I\'ll stay quiet this time."
George, acting like the adult he was, set up a mood that would prevent people from answering right away even if they knew the answer, in effect sending a warning to Erika.
It seemed that Erika understood, and she averted her gaze, snorting derisively.
"......To make eight pieces, four slices would be enough, right?"
"Don\'t be so foolish.
 It would hardly be a puzzle if that was the answer."
"Hahaha.
 That\'s right.
 These are usually set up so that a smaller number than you\'d expect is the answer.
 But still, how exactly could it be done?"
"......Oh, got it, got it.
 You can only do this because it\'s cheese."
"True.
 If you tried to do it with a birthday cake, there\'d be a huge fight."
"Wahahaha!
 That\'s right.
 You might be able to do this with cheese, but you\'d never cut a cake like this."
"Huh? Huh?
 All of you know the answer?!
 Dammit, am I the only one who doesn\'t?!"
"Oh, I\'ve got it!
 I see, so you have to think three‐dimensionally."
"Wait, even Jessica?!
 I don\'t get it! What do you have to dooooooo?!"
"Kihihihihihi, I know the answer.
 It\'s written right here.
 Kihihihihi."
"You didn\'t know the answer until you looked, right?
 *giggle*, can you work it out? Battler‐kun?"
"Aha, I\'ve figured it out as well.
 This is something you can do because it is cheese."
"Gyah?!
 Even Doctor Nanjo gets it?!
 Could it be?
 Am I the only one who doesn\'t get it?!"
"......If we tried cooking your brain a bit, it\'d probably become as flexible as cheese.
*giggle*giggle*......"
"It isn\'t something like "use zero slices with the knife and break it apart with your hands", right?"
"No way.
 It\'s special cheese that can only be cut with a knife."
"Think of the cheese in three dimensions.
 If that\'s hard, it might help to draw a picture on a paper napkin."
"S‐so, we have one large piece of cheese, right...?
 Then we use a knife to make eight pieces......
 ......Can the knife only cut in a straight line?"
"Yes, that\'s right.
 The knife only cuts in straight lines.
 ......Oh, but here\'s a hint.
 You can only cut in a straight line, but you\'re free to cut it wherever you want."
"Try thinking of various ways to stick the knife in."
"You should probably try to think out of the box a bit.
 Show us what you\'ve got, Battler‐kun."
You have a large piece of cheese.
How many times must you cut it with a knife to make eight pieces?
It\'s obvious that you could do it in four cuts.
Can it be done in even fewer cuts than that?
The hints said that it was something that could be done because it was cheese.
{n}If it was a birthday cake, you really wouldn\'t be allowed to do this.
".........Cheese.
 ...Cheese.
 ......Something you can do because it\'s cheese?
 ......Oh,
 ...oooooooooooohh!!
 I\'ve got it, I\'ve got it!!
 I was totally tricked! This isn\'t something you can think up with a stiff head...!"
"Seems like you\'ve finally hit on it.
 Hopefully it is the right answer."
"It\'s impossible to cut the cheese with anything except the knife, right?
 The knife can only cut in a straight line, right?
 There aren\'t any other rules, right? Right?!"
"Uu.
 Not really."
"Alright, then that\'s got to be it!
 Wheeew, that was a tough one... Almost like a riddle!"
"Hahahaha, it\'s just that you won\'t get anywhere if you always cut down from the top.
 You make two cuts from the top to get four pieces.
 If you keep it like that and cut across the side, splitting it into an upper half and a lower half, you get four times two equals eight pieces!"
"It\'s an answer you can\'t reach unless you think three‐dimensionally.
 In other words, the correct answer is three."
"......Huh?
 Really?
 I......thought the correct answer was one."
"Wahahahaha!
 What kind of magic did you use?!
 There\'s no way in the world you could manage it with one."
"*giggle*.
 This isn\'t a riddle, it\'s just a normal math problem."
".........Huh?
 Oh,
 ......really...?
 Nnnnn, I thought of the three‐cut method right away,
 ......but I figured that was too easy, so I guess I tried to twist it too far......"
"......Battler\'s answer is smaller than the one in the book.
 Is Battler right?"
"Yes, he is.
 .........Battler‐san is right.
 The right answer is "one slice"."
Battler was happy that someone had confirmed his answer.
 ......However, at some point, Erika\'s face had lost its cheeriness.
".........To think that a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} other than myself would answer "one"...and that it\'d be you, of all people."
"Your answer was "one" too, Erika?
 ......I guess you were also thinking pretty far out of the box."
"It would be truly foolish to arbitrarily decide the shape just because you heard it was a piece of cheese."
"That\'s impossible.
 Onii‐chan got it wrong, didn\'t he?
 How could you cut it into eight pieces with less than three slices?"
"How foolish, child of man.
 *giggle*giggle*......
 It says to cut it into eight pieces, but nowhere does it say that they have to be of equal size..."
"It\'s still impossible.
 Do you cut it with something other than a knife?"
"The rules say that only the knife can cut it, and that the knife can only cut in a straight line.
 However, to turn it around, the rules do not say anything besides that......
 In fact, the shape of the cheese is never specified."
"I get it...
 When you all heard "a large piece of cheese", you thought of a flat cylinder, like Camembert.
 ......I was thinking about sliced cheese, like the kind you might put on your toast for breakfast.
 ......After all, I don\'t usually have anything to do with full blocks of cheese that you\'d cut with a knife."
"......The shape of the cheese isn\'t specified in the rules.
 A mistake by the ones who made the book.
 I imagine that there\'s a picture of a flat cylinder of cheese there in Maria‐san\'s book."
"Uu.
 There is.
 Right here."
As Erika had guessed, the book Maria held had an illustration of a piece of cheese just as Erika had described it.
......With cheese of this shape, three slices really would be the correct answer.
You cut it in a + pattern from the top to make four pieces.
{n}Then cut it from the side to double that and make eight pieces.
However, since this illustration hadn\'t been shown, the interpretation of the cheese had been left to the answerer.
"......That is right.
 When the problem was stated, it never said anything about what the cheese\'s shape was or how flexible it was."
"Exactly.
 It seems that Battler‐san was the more flexible one,
 when it comes to both brains and cheese."
"I, ......I don\'t get it.
 How does making it sliced cheese let you cut it into eight parts with a single knife slice?"
"Why not try it with that paper napkin.
 Pretend it\'s sliced cheese."
"......It\'s like this.
 You fold it accordion‐style.
 ......How many times do you need to fold it to make eight sections...?"
"Six times."
To fold it accordion‐style, you alternate between upward and downward folds.
Once you\'ve done this six times, it looks like the side of an accordion.
"With normal cheese, it\'d break if you tried to fold it like this,
 ......but the rules say that this cheese can\'t break unless you use a knife, right...?"
"Yes, no problems there.
 After all, this is magic cheese that can only be cut by the knife."
"After folding it,
 ......if you start at the top and make a cut right down the middle..."
"......Y‐......you\'re right.
 ...There are eight parts."
"W‐wait a second.
 The parts aren\'t all equal this way, right...?!"
"......All the questioner said was to cut it into eight pieces.
 They didn\'t say anything about them being equal.
 ......Well, if you change the way you fold it, it is possible to make them all equal sizes, but I wouldn\'t want to confuse you stiff‐headed people with the explanation.
 Eheh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eheheh......"
"Oh......ooooooohhh............"
For a while, everyone was stunned......
Battler had reached a far better answer than "three" by thinking of the problem as a riddle.
Erika had already known both answers and had even spotted a mistake made by the book.
......The others could do nothing but stare at those two in surprise.
"I‐......incredible.
 ...So we were the stiff‐headed ones...?"
"What a......failure."
"We were thinking in three dimensions,
 ......but it looks like Battler‐kun and Erika‐chan were thinking in one dimension higher."
"......It seems the game with the witch has toughened you up quite a lot.
 ......Puzzles without specified rules—in other words, all things not covered by the red truth—are left to the observer\'s interpretation.
 ......It\'s the most basic of methods for constructing gaps in the witch\'s locked rooms."
"What are you talking about...?
 Is that a quote from some novel...?"
"........................
 Well, let\'s call it that for now, shall we?
 Anyway, I guess this means that all your brains are as stiff as rock‐hard cheese.
 *giggle*giggle*giggle*...!"
Without any signs of restraint, Erika looked at everyone and laughed sarcastically...
Only Maria didn\'t notice the venom in that laugh as she happily turned to the next page.
"Uu!!
 Then on to the next problem.
 You have three cups and six coins.
 Split up the coins so that there\'s one coin in one cup, two coins in another cup, and three coins in the third cup.
 Uu!"
"Wait a sec, that\'s easy."
"Just stick one coin in the first cup, two in the next one, and three in the last one and you\'re done."
"However, can you do the same thing with only five coins?!
 Uu!!"
"Here\'s another clichéd problem.
 Don\'t tell me that you all need to waste several precious seconds on a problem like this......?"
By now, Erika was gazing around with an unpleasant look,
 acting in a manner that was completely inappropriate both for a guest and for someone of her age...
She was no longer a guest who would be staying until the storm passed.
She had transformed into an annoying guest who wouldn\'t leave until the storm passed...
Everyone thought this, but they were unable to say it aloud...
"Uh, ......oh, right, speaking of problems with coins,
 I\'ve heard that you can tell whether someone\'s good with chopsticks or not by seeing if they can pick up coins with them..."
"Chopsticks!
 Yes, chopsticks, that\'s right.
 Chopsticks are the most elegant utensil on the planet.
 Poking things and chopping them up with forks and knives is so barbaric!
 Chopsticks are the best.
 For me, using chopsticks is truly an art."
Jessica was about to say "isn\'t a chopstick just a stick?"...but stopped herself just in time.
She realized that it was best to let George take control for now...
"I have some change here, so would you like to challenge me?
 I\'m pretty good with chopsticks."
"Th‐that\'s right...
 We trained George very well with chopsticks."
"True.
 One\'s upbringing shows in their table manners.
 Erika‐san was very impressive herself."
"I\'ll lend you some coins too.
 It\'ll probably be more fun with more of them."
"Jessica.
 Watch closely and learn."
"C‐cram it already...!"
"Alright, let\'s go.
 Let\'s see who can move the most coins over to their plate."
"Bring it on!!
 Chopsticks, chopsticks, haah haah!!"
......This time, George had steered the conversation into a good direction.
Everyone else understood, and they helped to egg on this chopstick fight and change the subject.
They were fully aware by now that Erika was extremely proud of her intelligence.
And apparently, she had the bad habit of using that to look down on other people.
She spun her chopsticks around her fingers with the dexterity of a stage magician,
 staring at the coins scattered on the table like a dog waiting for permission to eat the food placed before him......
......The unsettling sound of the wind had now blended in with the sound of rain, resembling the howl of some monstrous beast.
Just when it seemed to be crying out sadly,
 it would suddenly turn into a roar and rattle the windows, striking up even more fear and unease within me...
Light from the hallway poured in through the thin crack of the slightly open door...
...and it seemed to carry with it laughter that was warm and happy, but very distant...
I\'m sure everyone\'s in the dining hall or somewhere, having a good time...
I want to go there as soon as I can...
.........I\'m sure my family will be there...
{n}I hate being all alone in a place like this......
......Dad......
 .........Mom......
I stubbornly tried again and again to open the door,
 but the merciless chain just wouldn\'t let the door open any further than that crack.
On the contrary, feeling this close to a way out just made me more impatient.
......Gulping and trying to ignore the fear lurking behind me, ......I quietly closed the door.
That light coming out of the crack......is just a trap.
This is an iron shackle,
 trying to keep me locked in here for eternity by making me think I\'m just an inch away from getting out a door that will never actually open......
I need to get out of this creepy room...
{n}......As soon as possible...
When I closed the door, all that filled the room was that eerie sound of wind and rain.
The way the wind picked up every now and then and shook the window frames felt like a monster in a cage shaking the bars...
......I was so scared of that monster......I couldn\'t help but avert my gaze from the windows.
Gotta search.
 If I can\'t get out the door, I need to find another way out......
Just to the side of the door was a closet.
There was only enough space inside to hang overcoats.
{n}......Of course, it didn\'t connect to anywhere outside the room.
If this were hide‐and‐seek, it\'d probably be fun to hide in there.
However, inside this creepy room, ......it would be no better than stepping into my own coffin...
......If I go in there,
 ......maybe I won\'t be able to get out of the closet next.
This nonsensical fear sent a massive shiver up my spine,
 and I closed the closet door in a hurry......
There\'s......one door left.
When I opened it, there was the bath and toilet.
......Of course, there was no exit.
 There weren\'t even any windows.
If I turned the faucet, water would probably come out...
...then disappear down the drain and flow outside,
 ......but I couldn\'t get out that way.
......Unless I went into the bathtub, with the stopper pulled out of the drain, and smashed my flesh and bones to bits...
I had the feeling that this was the only way out,
 so the black stopper in the bathtub drain looked extremely terrifying...
I tried a lot of things, both mentally and physically, but there really was no way of getting out through the bathroom......
All that was left.........was the windows.
The view through the window was pitch‐black darkness.
{n}The fierce winds and rain were slamming against the glass...
The darkness on the other side of the window may have been unsettling,
 but I didn\'t really care where I went, as long as it was outside this room.
However, the window......
was clamped shut.
Right down the middle of the window, which was made to swing open like a set of double doors, were several ugly metal clamps.
It was even more unnerving than the chain on the door, like a rough operation scar on some bizarre monster.
The wind and rain slammed against and shook the window frame, making it creak loudly.
However, unlike the door, this wouldn\'t open even a crack.
......I\'ve......had enough.
Give it a rest already... What the hell\'s going on with this room......?
I\'ve had enough of this creepy room...enough, enough, enough, enough...!
It\'s impossible to go outside except by the door and windows.
And compared to that thick door, the window looks like it might be possible to break.
I\'ll smash it.
......If I swing a chair at it, the glass will probably break.
I might even be able to smash the wooden grid dividing up the window.
All I need to do is make a gap large enough to slip out of.
......I grabbed a fancy‐looking antique chair and headed back to the window.
Aa.........aaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh......!
I smashed the chair against it.
 Over and over.
The glass smashed with a violent sound, and the frame groaned and creaked.
I hit it again. Again.
 Over and over.
If I can just break through this wooden frame......!
......Dammit......what...the hell...
Even though all the glass has been smashed apart,
 ......even though the cold rain is blowing in and tormenting me, ......I just can\'t get that frame to break...!
They aren\'t iron bars.
{n}It\'s just a delicate wooden mesh...
It\'s fragile enough to make that creaking sound, so why doesn\'t it break...?!
No wait, maybe it\'s close to breaking.
{n}What if I try attacking it from a different angle instead of just smashing it head on?
I stuck my left hand outside through one of the holes in the broken window, grabbed the frame from the front with my right hand, and tried to break it by shaking it around from both sides.
My left hand started to grow ice‐cold from the frigid winds and rain...
......As I shook, fragments of glass sticking out from the broken frame poked into me, and my wrist was soon stained with blood.
But...if I can just get out of here, this much pain is no big deal.
But, ......I can\'t get out.
 I\'m stuck.
{n}It won\'t open... I can\'t break it......!
The more violently I shook the frame, the more the glass fragments tore into my left wrist, causing me intense pain.
 ......Wait, what\'s......huh?
 Ow, ...owowowowow?!
Before I realized it, the glass fragments on the frame had grown longer and more spiky.
It was as though an ugly beast was trying to chew my hand off with glass teeth.
It\'s not my imagination.
They actually {i:are} getting longer before my very eyes, .......aaaah, and they\'re chewing my hand to bits...!!
I tried desperately to pull my hand out, but it had already dug deep into my wrist, and I couldn\'t move it.
I put all my strength into it, but it just hurt more and more, and the glass didn\'t even budge...!
What...the...hell...?!!
 D‐dammit, let go......let go, let go...!!
With my right fist, I hit the glass over and over attempting to break it,
 but that just hurt my right fist as well and did nothing to release my other hand...
Just then,
 ............my left hand, which was still stuck outside and exposed to the rain,
 brushed against...
something slimy...
Wh‐......what?!
It couldn\'t have been a leaf blown about by the winds, or anything like that...!
I mean......it felt just like the touch of someone\'s rain‐soaked hand......
Then, ......it closed tightly around my left hand.
When I felt the five fingers, ......I knew that some person out in the darkness was touching my left hand.
And...
.........yes...
I know who it is......
It\'s the witch...
 The terrifying witch who controls Rokkenjima\'s night......
The two hands soaked in the freezing rain...
...gently caressed my left hand.
However, though I could tell this was happening from the touch, I couldn\'t see anything out there in the darkness......
Then,
 .........it felt about my fingers,
 ......and bent my ring finger upwards.
O‐
owowowooow...
 I‐
......it\'s gonna break......
gyaaah...!
......At that moment, I saw something in the darkness for the first time.
{n}It was white.
The darkness...
...grinned...
and bared its white teeth.
Then, ......that mouth full of eerily white teeth approached my bent‐back finger...
...and opened wide.........
Ee‐
.....eeek......
......
.........
It must have been laughing at me from the darkness.
After all, its creepy mouth had twisted upward in a huge grin.
I had a horrible idea of what it might be trying to do to my finger.
A shiver ran up my spine.
......I resisted as much as I could, but the fangs of glass just wouldn\'t release my left hand.
And then,
 .........
after giving my finger a playful nibble...
.........it bit down hard, crushing bone and tearing away flesh all at once, ......and bit it off......
Crunchriptearsquelch...
 Splat.
"......Did you hear something just now?"
"I think I heard it too.
 It sounded like a clunk......"
"It\'s probably just the wind hitting a window.
 Heheh, this is a beat‐up old mansion, after all."
"Yeah, it is pretty creepy.
 I remember spending a lot of nights all scared that the witch really was walking around the mansion,
 when I was a brat six years ago."
"Uu, exists!
 {f:5:Beatrice} exists!"
"............What\'s at the other end of this hallway?"
"There are guest rooms there, but they aren\'t being used now."
"Yeah.
 After all, we have the guesthouse now.
 Prior to that, we would always stay in these guest rooms."
"Yeah, I remember too.
 When I saw the guesthouse today, I was surprised at how beautiful it was."
"Well, that\'s because it was just built.
 I wish I could move my own room over there.
 Shannon, Erika‐san\'s room is in the guesthouse too, right?"
"Yes.
 We have prepared a room for her in the guesthouse."
"......And you say the guesthouse is a good distance away from the mansion.
 ......No matter what kind of trouble happens, we won\'t be able to hear what\'s going on in one from the other."
"Heh.
 Are you still in detective mode?
 Ihihi, when all of us wake up tomorrow and everyone says "good morning" to each other, sounds as though you\'ll be disappointed."
"*giggle*, true.
 It would be troublesome if our numbers haven\'t thinned by tomorrow morning.
 Right?"
"A‐...allow me to guide you all to the guesthouse..."
The adults were apparently about to begin a conversation that they didn\'t want the kids to hear.
{n}......The real family conference was about to start.
As the kids and Erika followed Shannon on their way to the guesthouse, they passed through the entrance hall...
"Looks like it\'s pouring down at its hardest right now."
"......Wouldn\'t it be better to watch TV or something in the parlor until it dies down a bit?"
"Mama said to go back to the guesthouse.
 Have to go or she\'ll get mad.
 Uu."
"We\'ll be way more relaxed over in the guesthouse...
 Screw dealing with the grumpy voices and faces of our parents."
".........*giggle*giggle*.
 It looks like everything\'s falling into place."
Erika giggled, an openly indiscreet look on her face.
"I\'ll go prepare some umbrellas for everyone.
 Please wait here."
"Oh, just a moment.
 I\'ve been curious for a while.
 ......Who might the lady in the portrait be?"
Well, to be honest,
 I already know that it\'s Beato\'s portrait.
......Still, we simply walked past it in the last game, which is no fun at all.
Erika whispered to herself, but of course no one heard her.
"......This is the Master\'s benefactor,
 {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama."
"I\'ve heard that she gave Grandfather a vast quantity of gold, meaning that she\'s to thank for the Ushiromiya family\'s revival."
".........She\'s just a witch of Grandfather\'s delusions.
 They say her ghost walks the corridors of the mansion every night."
"Hey, quit it...
 That story always freaked me out when I was little, so much that I couldn\'t stand being in the mansion at night."
"Oh, right, that\'s true.
 What about now, six years later?"
"I\'d totally forgotten, but looking at this portrait head on, I can feel that old fear coming back a bit."
"Uu.
 {f:5:Beatrice} isn\'t scary.
 At least, as long as you respect her.
 If you don\'t,
 .........ki{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi!
 Right, Shannon?!"
"Uh, ......yes.
 ......That rumor does exist among the servants as well.
 ......Rumors about servants patrolling at night glimpsing mysterious silhouettes......or gold butterflies..."
"Oh yeahhh, wasn\'t there that one servant just last year or the year before that fell down some stairs and got so badly injured that they quit?
 Wasn\'t there a rumor that it was {f:5:Beatrice}\'s curse?
 Ihhihihihi~!"
Jessica told it like a ghost story, trying to scare Erika, but Erika just laughed disdainfully.
"C‐come on, that\'s creepy...
 It was probably just an accident, right?
 Just a coincidence?"
"......It happened just after Grandfather had this portrait hung here, so it was probably the year before last.
 ......In fact, if I remember, this here is the very staircase that servant fell down, right?"
"Yep.
 After all, this insanely huge portrait really stands out.
 Shortly after it was put up, everyone was talking about what it might be.
 ......And then, when the accident happened right afterwards, people started calling it {f:5:Beatrice}\'s curse."
"So, these ghost stories about {f:5:Beatrice} started after the portrait was displayed...?"
"......N‐no.
 Rumors about {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama\'s ghost walking about had been around even before that.
 However, I think those stories grew in number after the portrait was put there..."
".........Before then, even though they had heard about the witch {f:5:Beatrice}, they didn\'t have an actual distinct picture in their heads of what she\'d be like.
 I imagine that this portrait made that picture distinct for them, strengthening the rumors even more."
"So, ......who started all the talk about the witch {f:5:Beatrice} in the first place?"
"Grandfather.
 He\'d get in a rage and start yelling about "my beloved witch {f:5:Beatrice}~".
 Though until we saw that portrait, we had no idea what she looked like."
"It\'s no surprise that you\'d get one or two ghost stories with a creepy portrait like this hanging around.
 You always get ghost stories cropping up around things like a portrait of Beethoven in the music room or the statue of the school founder."
"......True.
 Given that people have been spending time in an old, gloomy mansion like this with the sound of wind and rain constantly present in the background,
 it doesn\'t surprise me that a few ghost stories have arisen.
 ......Well, it\'s nothing more than a ghost story, a fantasy, a fairy tale.
 Worth less than the useless drivel of a half‐sleeping nitwit."
Erika looked up at the portrait and smiled at it defiantly......
Maria\'s face immediately soured, as though she felt that this smile was disrespectful to Beato.
"......Uu.
 {f:5:Beatrice} exists.
 If you say things like that, you\'ll definitely feel the curse of the witch."
"Oh, how frightening.
 Please, curse me if you can, {f:5:Beatrice}.
 ......*giggle*giggle*."
"Ihihi.
 So, if we find you mysteriously dead next morning, it\'ll be the start of a witch\'s murder case.
 ......You\'re the detective, right?
 Wouldn\'t having the detective get killed off in the beginning be a little too radical?"
"Ah, that would be troubling.
 That would get in the way of the crime scene inspection.
 ......I see, even the Knox rules don\'t prohibit the detective being killed."
"I have something good!
 ......It\'s a charm that\'ll protect you from {f:5:Beatrice}\'s curse...!"
"A charm?
 You have a charm for something like that?"
After fishing around in her bag, Maria pulled out a string of beads attached to a medal that had a scorpion drawn on it.
 ......It looked like a cheap prize from an arcade or something.
"What are these?"
"Uu!
 They\'re magic‐repelling charms!
 Their effect is very weak, but if you use them, you\'ll definitely be able to avoid {f:5:Beatrice}\'s curse all night long."
"I\'ve heard that spiderwebs are also useful for repelling magic."
"Uu.
 Beato\'s avatar is a butterfly, so that\'s probably why she doesn\'t like spiders."
"Huh?
 Wasn\'t it the evil spirits of Akujikijima that were weak against that?
 Kumasawa‐san knows a lot about that sort of thing."
"......Witches...and evil spirits?
 Heheh, this is getting a bit interesting.
 Would you mind telling me about it in a little more detail when we get to the guesthouse?"
"Here are your umbrellas.
 It\'s still raining very hard outside, so please take care."
Shannon handed out the umbrellas she had brought.
{n}Everyone headed towards the front door......
After that, when there were none left standing in front of the portrait,
 ......a gold butterfly appeared.
Then, expanding out into a spray of gold, it took a human form.
In the hall, empty now that the children had left,
 ......Beato stood alone and silent, looking up at her own portrait...
"................................."
Without a doubt, the figure depicted there was as like her as an image in a mirror.
However, it felt as though its eyes and expression...were just a little different from hers.
From her perspective, while the person in this portrait was almost infinitely close to herself, ......it was just as surely a different person entirely.
"............Who...are you?
 ......Please tell me what kind of person you are..."
Beato had already finished reading the fragments from {f:5:Featherine}\'s archive that showed the tales of all the games so far.
However, the witch called {f:5:Beatrice} who had been depicted in them...
had been so vastly different from her.
......At the very end, it had looked as though that witch and Battler had connected just a little bit as adversaries,
 ......but for the most part, {f:5:Beatrice} had just bullied and bullied Battler in nearly all of the tales.
Even though this was about her,
 she had no idea why {f:5:Beatrice} had tormented Battler so much when she had supposedly been born for Battler\'s sake.
......All she had learned from {f:5:Featherine}\'s archive...
...was that the former Beato was a completely different person who defied understanding...
"......What happened to you?
 .........I am an egg of you.
 A chick.
 ......Your wings should have existed for Father\'s sake.
 ......Just when did you have one of those torn off.........and end up so drastically different......?"
She had also been listening to the conversation Battler and the others had just been having.
{f:5:Beatrice} can\'t handle scorpion charms...?
 {f:5:Beatrice} can\'t deal with spiderwebs......?
It wasn\'t as though she would like to touch either of those if she had the choice, but nothing bad would happen if she did.
......Was being perfectly fine around those...
...proof that she wasn\'t {f:5:Beatrice}...?
Even though it was about herself, ......she didn\'t understand at all.
{n}So, she quietly gazed into her own eyes on the portrait.
It felt as though the truth hid behind those eyes......
......Beato slowly...
...approached the portrait......
And then,
 ......she lightly...
......touched it......
When she did, it felt as though the portrait rippled slightly.
......Yes.
 This is...a doorway.
A doorway to the long path that would lead her to the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}......
Beato felt a bit dizzy.
......She lost her balance, feeling as though the world was twisting around her.
Then, she couldn\'t tell which way was up or down......and was swallowed downwards.
With a soft, watery sound,
 ......Beato was sucked into the portrait...
The world inside the portrait.........was pitch black.
However, there was nothing unsettling about it.
It was a comfortable darkness, like when you put your head under the covers in bed at night.
Beato...realized.
 This was a world inside herself.
......So, despite the darkness, she felt a warm embrace.
As long as she asked for nothing, ......this world would ask nothing of her.
But she couldn\'t remain like this.
 ......She didn\'t want to spend eternity inside the darkness of this world.
Yes, I need to hatch out of my egg.
{n}This darkness is the inside of the shell that surrounds the gold butterfly called {f:5:Beatrice}.
".........I will be born...
for Father\'s sake.
 ......I will live for my father Battler\'s sake and be born to serve him."
She put her purpose, her reason for being born, into words.
{n}As if in response to those words, the seal on the shell began to melt away......
Cracks appeared in the darkness......and a brilliant light enveloped the world...
And so, .........{f:5:Beatrice}......was born.
"...............Huh...?"
"..................?"
There I stood.........along with another me.
For a second, I thought that the me in front of me was the real {f:5:Beatrice}, the one I wanted to be more like.
However, she was looking back at me with the same bewildered eyes, ......so I realized that wasn\'t quite it.
......That\'s right.
 ...I wasn\'t the only one born from the egg.
She was also born.
......My twin?
 No, it feels a bit different.
How can I put it?
{n}......Both of us are lacking something and immature.
Yes.
 Both of us are chicks, ......but we are also...fragments of the true {f:5:Beatrice}.
It felt as though the two of us together could become the real {f:5:Beatrice}.
......No one explained this to us.
{n}However, we naturally understood...
I decided to talk to this other me.
Unless I get to know her and become one with her, I won\'t be able to become the {f:5:Beatrice} Father desires......
In other words, the thing that Father wants from me...and was so heartbroken to find missing...must be something that she has...
".........H‐......hello......?"
".............................."
The {f:5:Beatrice} with her hair down looked at me dubiously several times, then finally spoke.
".........Why...do you have the same face as me......?"
She used the word "{c:86EF9C:warawa}" to refer to herself, just like the true {f:5:Beatrice}.
{n}......It looks like she really does have something that I lack.
"W‐......well...
 I don\'t know why either."
"I am the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}.
 And you are?"
"I, I am also...{f:5:Beatrice}.
 I was born for the purpose of serving Ushiromiya Battler."
"......I am the Golden Witch and the ruler of Rokkenjima\'s night.
 ......I know Ushiromiya Battler, but I have trouble imagining why I would have to serve a brat like him."
I realized that the thought I\'d had a second ago,
 ......that together, we could become the true {f:5:Beatrice}...must really have been true.
......Though the person in front of me does have the part that makes her a witch, which I lack,
 she does not possess the mission to live for Ushiromiya Battler\'s sake.
She has what I do not,
 ......and I\'m sure I have something she does not.
"We must be one person in two.
 ......I think we\'re something like twins."
"......No, that is not so.
 You are my little sister.
 I have been here since long before you were born."
"Huh?
 I, ......I had no idea..."
I was born later...
......So, does that mean the mission to live for Ushiromiya Battler\'s sake was born later on...?
However, I don\'t think my existence is something quite as faint and intangible as a mission.
......I have enough of a personality to think and act as I am doing now.
So, the witch Beato and I are separate people, both of us possessing something the other lacks.
In that sense, ......maybe it\'s fitting for us to call ourselves sisters, as she says.
"I, ......I want to know about you."
"I also wish to know.
 I understand that you are also "me".
 ......Why is it that you speak that way, and why must you serve Battler?
 As long as we cannot understand that, it seems both of us will remain immature."
"......I...want to become a complete {f:5:Beatrice}."
"Until you were born, I {i:was} complete.
 ......However, now that you have appeared,
 I believe that accepting you is my obligation.
 ......I also wish to know about you."
The witch Beato\'s tone was very slightly arrogant, matching with her self‐proclaimed status as the older sister.
However, since we both realized that we were the same person, there was no need to be unkind.
......This was probably because she understood, after meeting me, that her current form was not her real self.
"Where......are we?
 Is this...the hall of the mansion...?
 ......Oh—"
Beato gasped.
{n}Her portrait wasn\'t there.
......Did that mean that this was at least two years in the past...?
"Precisely. This is the hall of the Ushiromiya mansion.
 ......The night is my time.
 And the nighttime mansion is mine as well.
 That fool Kinzo is still so desperate to catch me or revive me.
 How truly ironic.
 For here I am, openly controlling the mansion each and every night.
 *cackle*cackle*!"
"So,
 ......what do you do here...?"
"......I have lost my body, and due to the effects of that hateful shrine, I have no magical power.
 However, I am reviving that magical power bit by bit every day.
 ......My ultimate goal is to undergo a spectacular resurrection and gloat to Kinzo.
 I cannot wait to tell him that I have succeeded in escaping his cage...!
 For now, I have become something of a ghost, wandering about and killing time every night, all in anticipation of that gloating grin."
"C‐can I come with you......?"
"Of course!
 After all, you are a part of me.
 How could a left arm refuse the company of the right?
 It would be senseless to refuse.
 I shall be pleased to have you, my little sister, the new {f:5:Beatrice}."
"Th‐thank you very much,
 O‐
......Onee‐sama."
"A somewhat embarrassing name.
 But it is not bad.
 Come, let us go.
 Let us take a walk through the nighttime mansion.
 *cackle*cackle*, let me introduce you to my boring everyday life."
The two {f:5:Beatrice}s changed their forms into two gold butterflies...
and fluttered silently into the depths of the shadowy mansion......"......Back then I was, and I guess I still am, a bit of a klutz...
 I\'d always forget where I\'d put things...
or intend to lock something but then forget......I caused a lot of trouble."
"Hahaha, I remember how Aunt Natsuhi used to get mad at you all the time."
"But eventually, Shannon managed to overcome her forgetfulness."
"Oh, and how\'d you do that?"
"......Heheh.
 It wasn\'t anything big, ......but I got into the habit of writing things down.
 I\'d write down wherever I put something important.
 ......For things that were part of the daily routine, I made a checklist and always made sure to check it......"
"So?
 Did you see {f:5:Beatrice} or didn\'t you?"
"Oh, umm,
 ......I didn\'t see her directly,
 ......but, umm,
 ......some very strange things did happen..."
She was talking about a certain summer night.
It was when Shannon was doing the nightly rounds......
{n}From her perspective, it was a ghost story.
From the witch\'s perspective, ......it was just the story of a little summer\'s night prank...
"My little sister.
 Do you understand the anti‐magic toxin that {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s possess?"
"N‐no.
 What is that, Onee‐sama?"
"Hmm.
 The time of witches has long since passed.
 ......Those vile {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s who claim to control everything came to deny our existence and possess a strong toxin."
"Is that toxin harmful to us...?"
"It is extremely dangerous.
 If it got to us, our forms would probably evaporate in an instant.
 However, one thing we do have in our favor is the fact that our existence is still extremely weak.
 Because of that, the toxin does not affect us greatly.
 At worst, it can only transform us into mist for a time."
"However, we\'d rather avoid it if we can, right?"
"Correct.
 Yes, I see that you are me.
 You understand quickly."
The older sister appeared to be haughty at first,
 .........but, perhaps because she was so happy to have met her double and little sister, she was more than willing to teach her anything she wanted to know.
The first thing she had taught her was that they were witches,
 a different type of being than {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s.
Beato had thought that she wasn\'t a witch because she couldn\'t use magic,
 but apparently, she was still a witch nonetheless.
Then she was taught that witches such as her, unlike {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s, were bound by various restrictions.
The greatest of those restrictions was the anti‐magic toxin possessed by {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s.
"So, in other words, we mustn\'t enter a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}\'s field of vision..."
"Correct.
 You can think of it as though {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} eyes radiate the toxin.
 If they see you, it is the same as your body being burnt.
 Though they are lesser in extent, being heard or sensed can also result in contact with the toxin."
"......So, it\'s dangerous just for us to get close to {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s..."
Wasn\'t Father a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}...?
{n}Why am I not burnt by Father\'s toxin......?
"If we stock up magical power and have it acknowledged by {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s, that toxin can be reduced drastically.
 In other words, by having our existence acknowledged by {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s, we make them lose their toxin,
 making it possible for us to appear before them once more."
"I see......
 Simply put, as we are now, we can only exist when {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s aren\'t around..."
"We are still very lacking in magical power,
 which makes us inferior to even a stray cat hiding from {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s in the shadows."
The main goal of the older sister was to gain a large supply of magical power and be revived as a Great Witch strong enough to have no fear of the anti‐magic toxin.
For that purpose, she had wandered around the mansion night after night,
 striving to regain her magical power and reduce the anti‐magic power of the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s...
The powerful previous {f:5:Beatrice}, whom she had read about in {f:5:Featherine}\'s library,
 had appeared openly in front of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s and had even toyed with them at will.
......According to her big sister, such a level of power was most impressive.
"To think that a witch could appear openly before humans and use magic at will!
 ......A witch like that would be so great that even I can hardly imagine it.
 Is that what we will eventually become?"
"Yes.
 ......She was like a witch from a picture book, appearing openly before the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s of the mansion and summoning magic and underlings at will..."
"Hmmm, how inspiring.
 If that is our future, it means that all of our hard work will be worth it."
"Yes, it will.
 ......Anyway, Onee‐sama.
 What does going around unlocking windows like this have to do with the hard work you\'re talking about...?"
It was the middle of the night.
 They were following behind servants who were checking the locks on the doors and windows and undoing those locks after the servants thought they had locked them.
......It felt more like a child\'s prank than the work of a witch...
"Heheheh, this is the path that leads to becoming a Great Witch.
 All journeys begin with a single step.
 To those who cannot understand, that first step may look quite foolish from time to time.
 However, it is still a momentous first step...!"
With pride, as though making the first step for mankind on the surface of the moon,
 the older sister undid the lock on a window with a click.
"Do you not understand, my little sister?
 Can you not see what makes something like this momentous?"
"............?
 No, Onee‐sama.
 ......I don\'t really understand."
The older sister closed her eyes lightly, smiled, and opened the unlocked window a crack.
Cool outside air flowed in, making the curtains flutter.
"Let us put it in the toxin‐filled words of a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.
 ......We are not supposed to exist on this island.
 I shall go further.
 "Right now, there is no one in this corridor".
 And yet, the lock has been undone, ......and the window has opened.
 ......Can you see how great a miracle, a work of magic, ......a proof of our existence that is?
 Even you should understand the coolness of this breeze..."
"......I do understand.
 It\'s nice and cool..."
"The coolness, the softness of the breeze.
 ......And the feel of the fluttering curtain touching your hair.
 ...All of these things show that we truly do exist here."
"So, ......by unlocking a window like this, we can leave behind proof that we really did exist."
"......And that is why I unlock them."
Of course, it wasn\'t just small pranks like opening a window.
......She could also smash windows and vases or leave behind strange fires and mysterious scribbles.
In fact, one time, she actually did play a large‐scale prank in the kitchen,
 piling up kitchenware in an eerie manner and leaving behind a bizarre scribble, which scared the servants considerably.
It had been a complete success.
It had been truly terrifying, and she had succeeded in making the servants acknowledge the existence of magic, weakening the anti‐magic toxin...
However, she chose to make her presence known by unlocking windows.
By doing this, ......she could release herself from the restrictions imposed by the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s\' toxin.
"One day,
 I will—no, we will become a single witch and control all of Rokkenjima.
 ......When that time comes, we will gain complete freedom and will be capable of stretching our wings as we please."
We won\'t have to be afraid of anyone\'s gaze anymore.
We\'ll be able to fly wherever we wish, disappear whenever we want.
 Laugh however we like, prank however we like, talk with anyone we want to.
{y:0:Human}{n:0:Human}s might ask things of us from time to time.
{n}They might fight with us or play with us too.
What wonderful things for us frail creatures,
 who cannot appear before anyone, to look forward to......
"......Right now, they are little more than pranks.
 However, as they pile up, proof that we exist will begin to gather.
 The servants already call me the witch {f:5:Beatrice}, master of the night,
 and are beginning to believe in me bit by bit."
"The more they believe, the more those {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s will lose their anti‐magic toxin..."
......I see...
 So, this means that Father has no anti‐magic toxin.
And.........that\'s because he truly believes in the existence of the witch I am, without any doubts.
I finally realized that, though I\'d thought him to be cold, Father did possess a kindness that couldn\'t be seen......
"I\'d like to become a great witch and appear in front of everyone soon."
"Mm.
 Eventually, we will be able to appear openly in front of anyone.
 By doing that repeatedly, we will make people believe in us, ...and eventually, we shall display even our magic for all to see.
 ......After that happens, we will descend upon Rokkenjima as the Great Witch you told me of. Ahahahahaha!"
"......The logic of the witch side is very interesting.
 It keeps me entertained."
"It does sound credible, in a way.
 When {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s are warned that they\'re about to enter a famously haunted place, a hot spot for ghosts,
 they\'re likely to start yelling "ghost, ghost!" at the drop of a hat."
"That\'s right.
 All phenomena are fundamentally neutral, indifferent, and dull.
 ......If one wishes to have them be accepted in a certain manner, they must first create a suitable environment..."
"If a person has charisma, people will interpret what they do in a positive way, even when they screw up.
 ......I see.
 I guess in that sense, the Beatos\' small efforts aren\'t for nothing."
"If it were just the mansion\'s locks being undone, everything could be resolved by saying that someone forgot to lock up or that it was some kind of prank.
 ......It is the rumors of a witch wandering about the mansion night after night that give form to the existence of the witch."
"An environment was established such that, if anything strange happened in the mansion at night, it would all be viewed as the work of the witch.
 ......I get it. If things reached a point where no one questioned that logic,
 it would mean the same thing as a witch existing in the mansion at night."
After the Beatos finished their mischief of unlocking and opening the window,
 they enjoyed the coolness of the wind and the brightness of the moon, then became gold butterflies and disappeared into the darkness.
......There was no way of knowing whether the window they had opened had actually been opened by them.
The servants might have forgotten to lock up,
 or one of the family might have opened it after the servants had locked up and forgotten to shut it again,
 or maybe someone had played a prank.
In the same way that none of those possibilities could be denied,
 ......it was also impossible to deny the possibility that a witch really had opened a window to enjoy the night breeze......
".........An outcome without an observer can possess an endless number of ways in which it might have occurred.
 ...Those {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s who can only conceive of a single possibility are unable to imagine anything."
"However, people who believe in the possibility of a witch can imagine that it was a witch\'s prank.
 ......When that happens, the scene of the {f:5:Beatrice}s\' prank that we have just seen is etched into the fragment as a fact..."
"......That\'s one of the foundations of magic.
 Decorating...the process."
With just a little magic, even a mass‐produced stuffed animal...
...can be reborn as a wonderful, unique stuffed animal filled with a mother\'s love.
If you doubt it, ......it will be burnt by the anti‐magic toxin.
{n}If you believe it, the magic will become the truth.
"..............................
 ......Not all magic is bad.
 ......Maria onee‐chan was right.
 ......Good magic exists too."
"The power to repel evil magic may be necessary for a child of man.
 However, it is part of the love of the human world not to burn away and defile love‐filled magic."
".....................
 ......Well, good magic is the only kind I\'m willing to allow.
 ......For all other kinds, the best remedy is to deny them and burn them away."
"Heheheheheheheh...
 A typical answer for a child of man."
"Getting back to the point.
 ......What all this tells me...
is that the ghost {f:5:Beatrice}, who was called the ruler of Rokkenjima\'s night, doesn\'t really exist.
 It\'s nothing more than a general term for any inexplicable occurrences that took place in the mansion at night.
 In other words, {f:5:Beatrice} isn\'t the name of a person, it\'s the name of a phenomenon."
If anything bizarre happens, it all becomes the work of the Golden Witch...
Any environment in which "there could be a witch" {i:is}, in fact, {f:5:Beatrice} itself.
"......That all piles up until we reach 1986.
 ......This is the veil that the true culprit is hiding behind.
 And the person hiding behind it is, without a doubt, one of the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s."
"Let us say that this holds true at this point in the witches\' tale of the past.
 ......However, I doubt you can use that argument alone to fight all the way through 1986......"
"..........................."
"Heheheheheheheheh......"
"Ridiculous.
 Someone obviously must have forgotten to lock up."
"W‐......well, you may say that, but...umm...
b‐but this isn\'t just something that happened once or twice..."
"In other words, you\'re a klutz, a fool,
 and a moron of a servant who forgot to check not just once or twice, but many times over?"
"......Shannon isn\'t the only one.
 That same window was always opened even when other servants did the rounds."
"Yeah, Mom even asked me if I\'d ever left a window open in the hall at night.
 I had absolutely nothing to do with it, but she still got pissed.
 Sheesh."
"I\'m sure {f:5:Beatrice} wanted to gaze at the moon.
 Uu."
"It is a bit creepy to have that happen over and over at the same window.
 ......And that time where the kitchenware was piled up in the kitchen, with a creepy magic circle scribbled there...that sounds even more freaky."
"......Y‐yes.
 They said it was an eerie magic circle drawn with something like blood......
 Ever since then, people have been scared to patrol the kitchen..."
"About the case of the eerie magic circle in the kitchen.
 Who witnessed that?"
"Well, ......uh, ......it wasn\'t me...
 I, uh......think I heard about it from a servant kid who quit.
 I wasn\'t on duty that day..."
"Then there you have it.
 In the same way that stories about popular haunted locations become exaggerated, you servants like to have a little fun telling ghost stories about the mansion at night, don\'t you?
 By doing that, you speak as though the witch exists and infect others with that belief."
"......So, all of the eerie things that were supposedly done by {f:5:Beatrice}...
are either the result of coincidence and accident, or completely cooked‐up stories that people fabricated for fun.
 ...Is that what you\'re trying to say?"
"Exactly.
 Of course there\'s no way {f:5:Beatrice} exists."
"Uu......
 {f:5:Beatrice} exists."
"I\'m glad you understand so well, Battler‐san.
 ......I imagine there does exist some human person with that name, or else multiple specific or nonspecific people who acted under such an alias."
"However, this "Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}" that we hope and fantasize might exist...
is completely and unequivocally impossible."
"Uu!!
 Uu‐uu‐uu!!
 {f:5:Beatrice} exists!
 I\'ve met her!!"
"Oh? Could you tell me about that in detail?
 You met {f:5:Beatrice}?
 And did she show you magic or something?"
"Uu!
 I see her all the time!
 Every time I come to Rokkenjima!
 And she always shows me fun magic!!"
Denying the existence of the witch would always have the immediate effect of infuriating Maria.
However, Erika, who didn\'t know to avoid this topic, had challenged her head on.
But no matter how Maria tried to smooth over the matter of {f:5:Beatrice}\'s existence, she stood no chance of defeating the ruthlessly intelligent Erika in an argument...
George and Jessica hurried to calm Maria down, but Maria\'s anger could not be settled by this point.
"<Good>!
 So, she showed you magic?
 Could you explain in detail what kind of magic?"
"She would always use magic to give me candy as a present!!
 Beato can create candy with magic!!"
"Are you sure she didn\'t just take it out of her pocket?"
"No, she didn\'t!!
 It was magic!
 It was incredible!! Tons of candies poured out of an empty cup!"
"W‐wow, that\'s some awesome magic..."
"That\'s right, that really would be magic...!"
"Yeah, it was magic!!
 It really was empty!!
 I checked inside it myself!!"
"Excuse me?
 What do you mean, you checked inside it?"
"G‐give it a rest, Erika‐san...
 She\'s just a kid..."
"Anyway, Erika‐sama, ...would you like some more t—
kyah—"
"<No thank you>.
 I\'m having a seriously intellectual discussion over here.
 You outsiders can stay out of this!"
"You\'ll have to tell me in more detail, Maria‐san.
 What do you mean when you say that you checked inside it?
 Fortunately, we have right here with us a tea cup that\'s just been overturned and emptied!
 Will you do me the favor of recreating the circumstances for me right now?
 Let\'s see it, if you would, let\'s see it!!"
After holding the cup of black tea, which she had just overturned and was still dripping, upside down over the table,
 Erika slammed it down hard and slid it over to Maria.
Erika\'s eyes glowed repulsively, like those of a snake about to snap up a frog.
Those eyes were ice‐cold and had a madness in them that made one want to avert their gaze.
On the other hand, Maria was glaring furiously,
 her whole body shaking uncontrollably, in the greatest expression of anger that a human can manage.
The look on her face was frightening...not at all something one would expect to see on a nine‐year‐old girl.
"S‐stop it, both of you...!"
"Uuu!!!
 I\'ll show you what {f:5:Beatrice} did!!
 Just like this!!
 She took the empty cup!!
 And she put it upside down on the table!!"
"Yes, and then?!
 Did she then immediately lift it up and candies flowed out?!
 Incredible, that really would be magic! ...{i:If it happened that way}!!!"
Battler and the others tried to get between the two and calm them down,
 but it was no use.
The two violently pushed aside the others,
 and, glaring at each other from so close that their foreheads banged together, they repeatedly slammed down the upside down cup on the table.
The sound of their foreheads banging together and the cup being slapped down...shattered the barrier between reality and illusion...!!
"It is magic, it is magic!!
 Beato used magic to make candies appear!!"
"Then why don\'t you reproduce it for us?!!
 Founder of Mariage Sorcière and Witch of Origins, {f:5:Maria{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aaa}!!"
"Lady {f:5:Erika}, this opponent is not worth your {f:5:time}.
 This battle is not worth {f:5:fighting}..."
"Shut up, ball‐jointed murder doll!!
 Alright!!
 How do you claim that the overturned cup was filled with candies?!"
"Just turning the cup over won\'t make candies come out!!
 Because you have to use magic to make them come out!!
 Beato can use magic because she\'s a witch!!"
"Oh yes, magic, she used magic!!
 How did she use magic?!
 Did she swing a magic wand and tap the cup to make candies pour out?!
 *giggle*, no, that can\'t be it, right? Right?!"
"Beato is a witch so she used magic!
 Magic is when you say an incantation and cause a miracle!!
 You can\'t use the magic that makes candy unless you say the incantation!!"
"Oh, sure, understood. <Good>, <good>, yes, <good>!!
 Let\'s see this incantation, let\'s see this magic, come on, what kind of incantation would a witch use? What kind?!?!"
"Come, try to picture it!!
 The inside of the cup is filled with candies!!
 Try to picture such a wonder!"
"Ooooooooooh? And then whaaaaaaat?"
"Look, the inside of the cup...
...is filled with candy!!!"
Maria grasped the overturned cup so tightly that it nearly cracked,
 ......and slowly...
......lifted it up...
Then, ......from the inside,
 ......as many cute candies as the cup could hold poured out...!
Maria looked at Erika with a full smile, as though saying "that showed you".
"<Good>!!
 Is this what you call {f:5:Beatrice}\'s magic?!
 Dlanoo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}ooor!!"
{e:170:

"........................
 ......As you {f:5:wish}."
"I won\'t let anyone deny Beato\'s magic!!
 After all, magic is magic!!"
"Magic is impossible.
 {p:2:You might be telling a lie about something that never happened}!!"
"A repetition has been {f:5:requested}.
 Failure to respond will be a violation of Knox\'s seventh {f:5:commandment}."
"Ahahaha, I\'ll respond! This is the truth!!
 {p:1:This story really happened}!!"
"{p:2:This wouldn\'t have anything to do with a trick in the actual cup or table, making this just a sleight of hand, right}?
 That would be against the rules, wouldn\'t it?!?!"
"Hidden devices and tricks are in violation of Knox\'s third {f:5:commandment}.
 However, if and only if foreshadowing has been presented, these are permitted by Knox\'s eighth {f:5:commandment}."
Knox\'s third commandment prohibits hidden doors and devices that have no clues pointing towards them.
However, by presenting foreshadowing and clues that point towards the existence of said devices,
 Knox\'s eighth commandment allows them to be used.
"{p:1:They had no tricks like that in them!!
 It was just an ordinary table and an ordinary cup}!!
 So it\'s magic, not a trick!!"
"......{f:5:Understood}.
 ......By Knox\'s ninth commandment, Lady {f:5:Maria}\'s account of witnessing magic is {f:5:permissible}."
"Ahahahahahahahahaha!!
 That\'s right, with the ninth at least!!
 Observers are always allowed to speak their personal opinions!"
"Otherwise, mysteries where the culprit is seen dressed up as a woman and it\'s written "I saw a woman" would all be disqualified!!
 Sure, that\'s fine, claim that you saw magic all you want!!"
"All truths are nothing more than claims!
 So, I\'ll make a claim separate from yours and smash right through yours!!
 That is the detective\'s duty, and the time we shine the mooooooost!!"
"You can\'t break through this, this is magic!!!"
"Since it is magic, only witches can use it, right?"
"That\'s right, only witches can use it!!"
"...So, if a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} like me could use it too,
 that would mean it isn\'t magic, right?"
"You can\'t use it!!!
 Only Beato can use magic!!"
"<Good>!!
 Then why don\'t I show you?!!
 I\'ll make candy appear from out of this empty cup!!"
"I\'d like to see you try!!
 Impossible, impossible, useless, useless! There\'s no way a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} can do it!!"
"Then please, please, please just relax and watch!!
 Okay, here we have an empty cup.
 Is that okay? It is, isn\'t it?
 Then we turn it over on the table like this!!"
"......Let it be known that this fight has no point..."
"....................."
"Okay, I\'m going to say the incantation for creating candies now...
 In fact, why don\'t we say it together?
 Come, try to picture it!!"
"The inside of the cup is filled with candy!!
 Try to picture such a wonder!!"
"<STOP>!!
 Maria‐san.
 Why do you close your eyes when you say the incantation?
 Why not witness the miracle of magic?"
"Humans are stained by the anti‐magic toxin!!
 If a lowly {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} saw it, the miracle of magic would be wiped out of existence!!
 That\'s why there\'s a rule that says lowly {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s have to close their eyes when using magic!!"
"I see, I see. Okay, I understand the protocol used by {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s performing magic!!
 In other words, not once have you ever witnessed the moment the magic happened! Isn\'t that right?!"
"Look, it\'s done!
 Please, lift up the cup...!
 After all, I\'ve used the magic to make candies appear."
"There\'s no way someone who makes fun of witches could use the candy magic...!"
"Then if it actually did work, all the better."
After glaring at Erika with the utmost of malice,
 ......Maria slowly stretched her hand out towards the overturned cup...
......There was no way that Erika, someone who made fun of witches like this, could ever use magic.
There was no way that there\'d be candy there...
"..............................So, how\'s it look inside?"
".....................
 ...............Ah—"
......And there........in a cute wrapper......lay a single...candy......
".........See?"
".................."
"......This is magic, right?"
Erika smiled gently......
A look of disbelieving shock rose in Maria\'s eyes...
...along with envy for this person who could use the same magic as Beato...
"Erika...
......you can...use magic too...?"
"See? It\'s magic, isn\'t it?
 What I did there."
"Y‐...............yeah!!"
"So, in other words—"
Erika smiled pleasantly.
 ......She and Maria had finally reached a deep understanding...
"You\'re a MOROOOOOOOOOOOOON!!!
"
"{p:2:While you had your eyes closed, I just lifted the cup up and tossed a candy in!!
 Call that magic?
 It\'s just a third‐rate triiiiiick, hyah{0}ha{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aah}!!!"
"There\'s my blue truth as the detective.
 And now, as the Witch of Truth, I present to you: my red truu{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}uuth!!!"
"{p:1:Your so‐called candy magic is nothing more than sleight of hand!!}
 {p:1:A mere trick that the fake witch calling herself {f:5:Beatrice} or whatever claimed was magic}!!"
"I mean, seriously, did you really get fooled by such a dumb trick?
 The magic your perspective speaks of can\'t be trusted in the slightest!!!"
"{p:2:Everything you ever thought was magic was just a trick that you didn\'t get!!
 There\'s no way there\'s such a thing as magic! There\'s no way magic exii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}iists}!!"
"......Huuuh?!"
"{p:2:P‐putting the candy in this cup might have been your sleight of hand,
 but that doesn\'t prove that Beato\'s magic was also a sleight of hand}.
 Uryuuu!!!"
"{p:2:However, you also can\'t prove that it could only have been done with magic!!
 You rotten stuffed animaaaal}!!"
"......For your attention: I beg to inform you of the following."
"Know that this meaningless battle ends here."
"You damn scraps of paper!!
 Why\'d you have to butt in at the good part...?!!"
"That is {f:5:enough}.
 Lady {f:5:Maria} has been shown that the magic which makes candy appear in a cup could possibly be a trick that she misunderstood to be {f:5:magic}.
 Therefore, her claim that it was magic is {f:5:dismissed}."
"{p:2:However, it might really have been magic when Maria saw it...!
 Just because it can be done by a sleight of hand doesn\'t disprove magic}."
"......Well done, Lady {f:5:Erika}.
 Congratulations on crushing Lady {f:5:Maria}\'s witch {f:5:illusion}."
Witch illusions are an attempt to make others acknowledge the existence of magic by claiming that something would be impossible without it. That is the attack used by witches.
If someone can argue back and say that it would be possible without magic, the witch illusion is defeated, and the witch must retreat.
The magic that Maria claimed to have seen had the possibility of being a trick, so it was unqualified to be acknowledged as magic.
That was only the result of this battle.
 It was still too early to bring the fight into the domain of denying everything else Maria believed in: the existence of {f:5:Beatrice}, witches, and magic......
However, battles will always end instantly when your opponent surrenders.
Erika had wanted to hit Maria with everything at once, defiling the witch and magic she believed in,
 and crushing it without a fragment of compassion...
"........................
 ......Tch!!
 Just one more step and I\'d have been able to take a heart as pure as the smooth sand just after a wave has pulled back...and tear it to bits.
 .........What a shame.
 This isn\'t any fun anymore.
 ...............Are you satisfied now?!
 Ouch, ...owowowow......"
Erika grumpily punched the arm of Dlanor\'s that was restraining her.
 However, that cold, hard, marble‐like arm just made Erika\'s hand hurt.
".........D‐diplomatic immunity...!
 This battle is over...!"
"For your attention:
 diplomatic immunity accepted."
"......Know that this fight is childish in the extreme."
"Did you say something?!"
"She did {f:5:not}.
 ......Let us {f:5:withdraw}.
 Lady {f:5:Maria} is no match for you, Lady {f:5:Erika}.
 There is no need to pay any attention to small fry such as {f:5:this}."
"............Hmph.
 ......You\'re right.
 How childish of me, tearing a kid\'s dreams apart.
 I\'m really sorry, okay?
 I apologize for my momentary lack of elegance.
 *giggle*giggle*.
 Let\'s go."
Erika\'s group turned their backs on Maria, who was still crouching down limply.
However,
 ......as detectives in famous mysteries have always done in the past,
 Erika clapped her hands, stopped, and turned around.
"Oh, that\'s right.
 ......Your thoughts...?"
"............?"
"All it takes is the presence of an overturned cup,
 and a deduction like this becomes trivial for Furudo Erika.
 .........Your thoughts, ladies and gentlemen?"
"...............!!!"
Erika\'s merciless words gouged themselves into Maria\'s heart once more......
*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*,
 ahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haa{0}ha{0}ha{0}hah{0}haa{0}haha!!!
Erika left, leaving an evil laugh behind her.
After bowing to Maria and Sakutarou, Dlanor left too.
......Gertrude and Cornelia followed suit...
After that, only Maria and Sakutarou were left in the lonely Golden Land......
"............Uryuu......"
"......Beato......is a witch......"
"Uryu...
 Beato is a witch..."
"It was magic......
......*hic*...
...it was magic......"
"It was magic... Beato used magic to give you candy...
 You don\'t need to doubt that...
 ......Uryuu...!
 Please believe in Beato...
 You know that magic can\'t bear fruit unless you believe..."
"Uuuuu......uuuuuuuuuuwaaaaaaaaahhhh......"
In the middle of an ice‐cold drizzle, which had started falling at some point,
 ......Maria sobbed...
Trying to at least protect her from the rain, Sakutarou used his large sleeves to cover Maria\'s head...
...and stayed there by her side......
"Okay, let\'s go, Maria...!
 Let\'s play cards together in the room upstairs..."
"......Erika‐san.
 As an adult, I cannot condone that conversation just now."
"My apologies.
 I\'m still just a kid, after all."
"......*hic*, .........*hic*......"
After seeing that wonderful candy magic brutally insulted by Erika,
 ......Maria had been crying this whole time...
"Haah...
 ......I started noticing it at the quiz party after dinner,
 but your personality is screwed up.
 ......Is this fun for you?!
 Are you enjoying tearing a little kid\'s dreams apart?"
"P‐please stop, Battler‐sama...!
 Please, for my sake, don\'t push any further here...!
 Please...!"
Shannon, who had been looking flustered, bowed her head deeply and implored Battler to stop.
{n}George, who didn\'t want Shannon pressured, fell in line.
"Let\'s go.
 Let\'s spend this year in the cousins\' room too.
 We can watch TV and play cards."
"......I\'ve heard that Erika‐san has her own room.
 Shannon, please guide her."
"Oh, no need to bother yet.
 I\'ll relax down here for a little while longer.
 I want to savor it a bit."
"......What the hell are you trying to savor...
 ...Pft."
Battler and the others could no longer hide their irritation.
They had no obligation to entertain their uninvited guest any further than this.
Erika herself understood perfectly well that no place would welcome a detective.
Battler and the others wanted to leave, and Erika wanted to stay.
{n}Neither had any desire to stop the other.
Jessica urged Maria, who was still crying, to come along...
Then, Maria stopped and spun around.
".........Got a problem?"
"Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi{0}hi!!
 They do exist here and there...{y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s that are practically lumps of the toxin that doesn\'t believe in magic!
 There are many boys like you in my class!"
"They don\'t believe in witches, or magic, or miracles, or happiness!
 You can\'t become a witch if you let the toxin of people like that burn you to ashes!
 I may not look it, but I\'m {f:5:Beatrice}\'s disciple!
 I\'m the Apprentice Witch of Origins!
 Kihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi!!!"
Maria, who had been sobbing until a second ago, seemed to have transformed into an entirely different person.
 ......She laughed...no, cackled eerily.
Battler\'s group stiffened up at this sudden change, but Erika was watching calmly.
Then, she smiled and gave a small nod in response.
"<Good>.
 ......You\'re not a bad opponent.
 Good night, Miss {f:5:Maria}.
 Let\'s fight in a more satisfying game next time."
"Sure. Let\'s. It\'s a promise.
 .......Kihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi."
"Y‐you stop that too, Maria...!
 Come on, let\'s go."
"What about you, Shannon‐chan?
 You can play cards with us, if you want."
"Come on, join us for at least one round.
 It\'ll cheer you up."
"Uh, ......ah...th‐then, just for a bit......"
Shannon couldn\'t remain in this suffocating lounge any longer either.
In part apologetic and in part trying to escape, she followed after Battler\'s group...
After that, Erika was the only one left in the lounge...
Still wearing a thin smile, she tapped a glass with her finger.
There was a light chink.
 ......A surprisingly boring sound.
Even so, Erika wore a thin smile, as though pleased...
"Hoh‐hoh‐ho, sorry to keep you waiting.
 I was just in the bath...
 ......Oh, where is everyone?"
"......You just missed them.
 They went upstairs.
 I\'m the one who called you here.
 ......I\'ve heard that you know a lot of stories about Akujikijima and the witch of the forest."
"Yes, well.
 Hoh‐hoh‐ho.
 They are trivial stories, but..."
"I don\'t mind in the slightest if they\'re trivial.
 Would you like a drink to follow your bath?"
"......Even I like to be helpful every now and then."
Erika stood up, opened the refrigerator behind the counter, and put ice into the ice pail......"......Erika‐chan, huh.
 She\'s an odd kid.
 ...Somehow, I just can\'t seem to get along well with the young kids these days."
"*giggle*.
 You\'re still pretty young yourself, George‐san."
"Hahaha...
 I guess it\'s because I\'ve always been the oldest of the cousins...
 It\'s always made me feel like I\'m not one of the young ones anymore."
George and Shannon could be seen surrounded by the rainy rose garden.
{n}Though the rain was still pouring down, there was hardly any wind at all.
The scant protection provided by the arbor was more than enough to house this secret meeting between lovers.
Following that fight with Erika, the group had decided to play some cards for a change of pace.
When that was over, Shannon returned to the servant room,
 .....and shortly after that, George left the room as well to meet Shannon here at the time they had arranged.
"I think kids around Erika‐san\'s age have a really hard time accepting themselves."
"......Yeah, that\'s true.
 Around that age, most kids are so determined to break out of the shell of childhood that they lash out in all directions with their beaks.
 Only once they manage to break through can they finally stretch their wings and fly high.
 ......I was like that too.
 When I was still inside that shell, I was a weak, deplorable man who didn\'t deserve any respect."
"Th‐that\'s not true..."
"No, it\'s okay.
 I realize it myself.
 Back then, I might have been the oldest of the cousins, but I was still a lazy, hopeless man.
 ......And it wasn\'t just with the cousins.
 At home, at school—I was like that everywhere."
......I hated being like that.
I wanted to break that shell and become a splendid adult like Mother and Father.
"But in the end, ......you did break out of that shell, George‐sama.
 ......Every time I\'ve met you these past few years, you\'ve grown beyond recognition."
"Thank you."
"......Did something cause you to make up your mind?"
"To break out of my shell?"
"Yes.
 ......I can\'t imagine that you grew so rapidly, like a butterfly breaking out of its cocoon,
 by just wandering around aimlessly.
 ......I thought there must have been some turning point which made you become so determined."
"......I fell in love with you, and grew thanks to the power of love...is what I\'ve told you so far.
 Haha, ......but the truth is, the turning point was a much more negative emotion."
"No way......
 It\'s hard to believe that someone who\'s always as bright and cheerful as you could have negative emotions."
"Well,
 ......my parents taught me to treat girls well.
 And I thought that I had succeeded in living that way."
"Yes.
 I think you\'re a really wonderful gentleman..."
"But that was wrong."
".........?"
"I didn\'t know how to interact with the opposite sex.
 I deified them excessively......and though I always behaved in a gentlemanly, ladies first kind of way,
 I was probably outright afraid of interacting with girls."
Of course, George had wanted to be around girls as much as any boy might.
However, he didn\'t know how to interact with them.
 He wanted to act like a gentleman, avoid being disliked by them, and treat them with care.
Of those feelings, only the words "treat girls well" took precedence,
 blossoming into a subconscious fear of women...
"You might call a man like that "gentlemanly" or "a late bloomer".
 .........Ridiculous.
 I was just a coward.
 Because of that, I started to wonder why I couldn\'t get a lover if I was so gentlemanly,
 and I eventually came to the conclusion that all the women in the world had no taste, and started to hate all of them...stupidly.
 .........That\'s what a truly pathetic man looks like."
How many years ago was it when I noticed?
 It started when I was in middle school.
At the time, I assumed that I was obviously the most gentlemanly of the cousins, so I would obviously be popular with women.
However, reality was completely different.
At school, I was pretty much completely hopeless.
......Far from being a leader, I was the bullied kid who got pushed around by everyone.
At the time, I figured I was just a capable and adaptable man, who could keep in perfect tune with his surroundings.
 ......How stupid.
Sure, I might have gained some measure of trust from girls.
......However, not only was there no one who would become my girlfriend, I didn\'t even know any girls I could call a friend.
"Of course.
 ......I was a man who always took a step back from girls, under the pretense of ladies first.
 Who would ever want to stand behind such a negative, unmotivated man?
 ...It\'s funny.
 I didn\'t even realize this, and thought I was a pretty attractive guy."
".........I can sort of understand how you felt.
 ...Just because someone puts in a lot of hard work to look attractive to the opposite sex,
 it doesn\'t mean it will necessarily work out as they planned."
"Oh?
 ......Has that happened to you too, Shannon?"
"Of course.
 ......One time, I wanted to catch a boy\'s eye so much, I tried to put on makeup even though I didn\'t know how and embarrassed myself...
 ......Eheheh, I remember a lot of embarrassing failures."
"The person that made me finally get over my conceit and open my eyes......was you, Shannon.
 ......No, it was all of you."
".........What was the turning point for you, George‐san?"
"Haha,
 ......envy, probably."
"That\'s unexpected.
 ......But envy for what?"
"I saw you and Battler‐kun having a really good time talking.
 ......That made me envious."
"............Me and...Battler‐sama?"
Shannon raced through her memories, trying to find a conversation that might have made George envious.
"Haha, it probably seemed trivial to you two.
 However, it still made me envious.
 ......I don\'t want Battler‐kun to hear what I say next, no matter what.
 Can you promise me?"
"O‐of course..."
".....................
 ......It\'s going to be a shameful confession.
 ...Still, I want you to hear it.
 I want to hear your answer tonight...only after I\'ve told you about my bad sides as well."
"............Okay.
 ......Let me hear it."
With a smile but a serious look in her eyes, Shannon nodded.
Tonight.
 ......She knew what he was going to ask her tonight.
George had the right to confess before asking that sacred question, and Shannon had the obligation to listen.
Shannon understood this, ......so she listened quietly.
"So this is what a Witch of Theatergoing peeps in on during her spare time?"
"......Stories of love are truly timeless.
 I never tire of them.
 ......However, I do find that maidenly expression of disgust on your face even more charming..."
{f:5:Featherine} laughed quietly.
Ange huffed and looked away,
 but she quickly realized that this would only entertain {f:5:Featherine} even more, so she tried to act unconcerned...
"Both Battler‐kun and Jessica‐chan have always been spirited.
 ......No, phrasing it that way is just dodging the point.
 ......Let me be frank."
George looked up at where the moon should be, high above the rain clouds...and spoke.
They were honest words, spoken from George\'s meek heart...
"......For a long time back then,
 I thought of Battler‐kun and Jessica‐chan...
as bad‐mannered kids.
 ......No, let me be more direct.
 ......I thought that even the way they talked was vulgar.
 .........It\'s true.
 I don\'t mind if you hold me in contempt for that."
"I don\'t.
 ......People are allowed to think anything they want inside their hearts.
 In fact, I think you were all the more commendable for not letting it show on the outside."
"Thanks.
 .........I secretly looked down on those two.
 I was so conceited that I truly thought I was just overflowing with gentlemanly charm compared to them."
I was at that age where having a girlfriend felt like a necessary condition for becoming a real man.
I truly believed that no girl could fail to admire a gentleman who treated girls as well as I did.
So, I really did assume that the girls I knew were attracted to me.
"I thought that Battler‐kun and Jessica‐chan, who always joked around and spoke in a rude, vulgar fashion,
 would never be able to get a boyfriend or girlfriend.
 ......I might have used that argument to distract myself when I still couldn\'t get a girlfriend."
"......I was a fool.
 They weren\'t inferior to me at all.
 I was the inferior one, with my deification of the opposite sex and my fear, which I hid under the guise of "ladies first"."
"That\'s been Battler\'s and Jessica\'s personality from the beginning.
 True, they were rude, and one couldn\'t have called them gentlemanly or ladylike.
 ......However, they did have the power to interact without worrying about their sexes.
 ...In fact, you might even call that their charm."
".........I sort of understand.
 People like Onii‐chan and Jessica onee‐chan can get along with anyone whether that person\'s a boy or a girl.
 ......Apologies to George onii-chan, but...guys who try too hard to act like a "gentleman"...I find them a bit creepy.
 ......It\'s like they have delusions about women or something..."
"People respect it when someone they are distant from is boring and harmless.
 However, they only like that person because he or she doesn\'t get in their way.
 ......No human being would want to deepen their connection with a boring person."
"......Of course.
 No idiot would want to be friends with an unmoving, unspeaking telephone pole.
 ......However, unmoving and unspeaking is exactly what you\'d want from a telephone pole."
"That\'s it.
 It seems as though George finally discovered that he wouldn\'t be viewed as an attractive man no matter how superior he was,
 and that he had been treated like a telephone pole the whole time..."
"Back then, my conceit was at its peak.
 ......So, when everyone gathered at the family conferences,
 I believed that I was the most attractive, and that all the servant girls who played with us were in love with me.
 .........And then the day came when I finally realized how pathetic I was."
".........Did I...say something inconsiderate then......?"
"No, it\'s the opposite.
 .........You didn\'t say anything at all.
 My conceited delusion that I was the only one ever reflected in your eyes...was crushed."
Just when did it start?
{n}......No, it must have started long before then.
I only failed to notice because my eyes were clouded with conceit.
"......One day, I suddenly realized it.
 ......You guys were getting along with Battler‐kun and Jessica‐chan far better than with me,
 ......playing around and having a good time."
......Yes.
 Those two, whom I had looked down upon so much, were radiating far more charm than I was.
You really looked like you were enjoying yourself that day.
The look on your face was far brighter than any you ever showed me.
"Hahaha, sickening, isn\'t it?
 ......I just assumed that you liked me,
 and even had some childish fantasy that we might end up dating."
"Based on nothing at all, I felt as though my girlfriend had been stolen from me and let myself feel hurt.
 .........Just how pathetic was I at that moment...
 ......When that happened, I finally realized how foolish I had been."
".........George‐sama......"
"After that, stuff happened and Battler‐kun stopped coming to the family conferences, but I heard about him from time to time from Uncle Rudolf.
 ......Uncle Rudolf cares more than he shows.
 Even though he gets in fights with Battler‐kun all the time, ...he\'s always paid close attention to his son\'s goings‐on."
"......Yes.
 I\'ve heard similar things.
 ......Even Asumu‐sama despaired at how alike they were.
 ......She was sure that Rudolf‐sama\'s blood was to blame for all the trouble caused by Battler‐sama\'s popularity with the girls at school."
"And Jessica‐chan too.
 I\'d heard that she\'d built up a huge number of friends, both boys and girls, and that she was always the center of attention.
 ......When I actually talked with her, I realized that this was no exaggeration."
That experience had......shown that the two I had looked down upon...
...were much more attractive human beings than I was...
"At first, I tried to imitate those two.
 ......It was pretty ridiculous.
 I thought that by joking around and speaking rudely, I could get that same charm they had."
"*giggle*.
 ......You did that?
 It\'s a bit hard to picture."
"It was pathetic...
 I wish I could forget that time for the rest of my life.
 In any event, I quickly realized that I would never gain any true charm by imitating them like that."
......I called it "respecting people",
 I called it "acting to fit in with the general atmosphere",
 .........but actually I was always just running away, and this cowardice was the reason for my lack of charm.
I resolved myself to overcome that flaw and be reborn.
......I finally understood the shell I was in, and I swore to break out of it.
Every time my resilience began to waver, ......I would remember that day.
 ......That day I saw you all forget about me entirely and play around happily.
 And the fact that those eyes of yours, which I always assumed were attracted to me, never noticed me at all.
.........I made an oath.
 This time, I would really make you take notice of me, and I would be reflected in your eyes.
 ......The truth is...that was the very first emotion, the start of me falling in love with you.
"...............It must have been...complicated."
"That day, I felt a desire for revenge against you all—no, against you specifically—for playing as a group and ignoring me.
 And before I knew it, that emotion had transformed into true love."
"......However, I swear this to God.
 Even though that was the reason I first started to take you seriously,
 ......there are no lies in the way I feel about you now."
"......I swear to love you for all my life.
 I will not lie about that for anyone or anything.
 And I am prepared to take you as my wife, even if it means having the entire world as my enemy."
"......George...san......"
"That is the confession I wanted to make to you beforehand.
 ......Before now, I\'ve called you my first love, love at first sight.
 ......That was a lie.
 ...It was only my selfish, twisted—"
"That doesn\'t matter."
Shannon smiled,
 ......but she spoke forcefully enough to interrupt George\'s words.
"Is there some rule saying that people can\'t get together just because they weren\'t each other\'s first love...?
 Is it betrayal to forget the first person you fell in love with...?
 Love......isn\'t that simple.
 Well, ......it might be simple.
 ......After all, love is easy.
 ......Always, whatever you feel now...
...only the honest feelings you feel now can tell you the right answer.
 So, things of the past or how our relationship started aren\'t important at all."
"......Then, ...I confessed for nothing...?"
"*giggle*, no.
 ......I\'m a bit glad to learn that even George‐san, who\'s always perfect at everything, has a human side to him.
 ......And it makes me happy to know that I\'m the only person you\'ve told this to."
".........Thank you.
 ...I was only able to become who I am because of you."
"Me too.
 I am as I am because of you, George‐san.
 ......So please, tell me without holding back.
 ......What kind of husband and wife will we be,
 ......and what kind of future will we build together?"
"When I have you as my wife,
 I will become an even more accomplished businessman than my father.
 ......And through all kinds of challenges and adventures, I hope to explore the limits of my potential.
 I want to reach that peak together with you.
 ......The view from there will be something no one can show you but me."
"It sounds fun.
 ......I\'ll be with you wherever you go."
"Of course, it won\'t only be an adventure as a businessman.
 ...I\'d like to create many things that only a couple can make."
"*giggle*.
 ......And what could that be?"
"Let\'s have some kids."
"*giggle*.
 .........Yes, my husband."
"I\'d like three of them at the least.
 At least one boy and one girl."
"And what if all three are boys...?"
"Then the next one might be a girl.
 We can make a fourth one.
 ......It doesn\'t matter how many.
 Let\'s enjoy the adventure of bringing them up together.
 And when those children eventually leave their nest, they\'ll make us some grandchildren.
 Before we know it, we\'ll reach a boisterous old age surrounded by many children and grandchildren."
"It sounds like fun.
 I wonder......what kind of a grandpa you\'ll be."
"And I wonder what kind of a grandma you\'ll be.
 However, I will always keep loving you.
 ......And when we eventually pass away, surrounded by our vast family, our lives will stretch behind us, unmatched by anyone else\'s."
George didn\'t just talk about his love in the present.
He swore to love her soul until the final moment...
when the lids of their coffins would be shut.
Then, George took a small box out of his pocket.
{n}......Even without opening it, she knew what was inside.
He took it out with a motion that was more natural even than the one he had practiced in the bathroom at the airport,
 and it was overflowing with charm.
"Sayo."
"Yes."
"Let\'s get married."
"Yes."
"Please, take this ring and put it on your finger."
".........Yes, George‐san."
That ring, which glistened divinely even in the dim light of the arbor,
 ......passed from George\'s hand to Shannon\'s finger.
Of course, Shannon had already decided which finger to put it on.
"I swear to resolutely stand against any fate which may attempt to get in the way of our future."
George proclaimed that he would reveal their engagement to the entire family on the next day.
"My parents might criticize this marriage.
 ......However, I will not let them stop us.
 I am going to inform them of our engagement, not ask for their permission.
 If Mother says that she will not allow our marriage,
 I plan to have myself disinherited, and we will leave this family together."
"I have been prepared for that since long ago.
 ......I swear once again to resolutely stand against all fates that get in the way of our future."
......George had said it aloud.
So, Shannon said the same thing.
"Me too.
 ......I swear to stand against all fates that get in the way of our future."
"*giggle*giggle*.
 ......Battler‐saaan, when will the crimes start?
 I\'ve just about had enough of this love show."
".....................
 ......Be quiet and watch."
"......Sure, fine.
 I\'d hate to yawn and let some spectacular bit of foreshadowing slip by."
"............Do you have no love?"
"Are there any mysteries which accept love as proof?
 No, there aren\'t."
Erika laughed coldly and stared down at the two on the game board.
Battler watched her quietly.
......Erika thought she felt a touch of pity in his gaze, and she averted her eyes uncomfortably.
"........................
 ...I do understand, more or less.
 Love can at least become a motive for murder.
 ......I can interpret this scene beneath the arbor to represent a possible motive for the crime if their engagement is somehow impeded."
".........Then again, no matter how much people talk of love with words that aren\'t red, it\'s all just an illusion.
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*!"
".........That\'s very sad.
 ......You can\'t even love anyone without proof given to you by a witch."
"Please put an end to this frivolous romance talk.
 I am your enemy, not some eccentric friend of yours content to engage with your ramblings about love."
"..........................."
"I can\'t understand you at all anymore.
 ......What on Earth did you figure out?
 Weren\'t you and Beato always insulting and trying to kill each other?"
"......What kind of truth could you have reached to make you change your emotions regarding her?
 ......Please don\'t tell me that feelings of true love have sprouted from your murderous rivalry or something ridiculous like that."
"......Lady {f:5:Erika}.
 Let us have him continue the game\'s {f:5:progression}.
 Boring love scenes such as this are best finished {f:5:quickly}."
"Ah, you\'ve got a point there.
 Sorry for butting in.
 Come on, let\'s move on."
".............................."
"......It\'s Shannon.
 I\'ve come back."
"Mm.
 ......The log for today hasn\'t been filled out yet."
"Yes.
 I\'ll do that right away.
 ......Kanon‐kun, thanks for keeping an eye out while I was gone."
"........................
 ......That was a pretty long break."
Kanon had already noticed.
 ......There was a silvery glint coming from the ring finger on Shannon\'s left hand.
"Then I will retire.
 ......Please do not hesitate to wake me if anything occurs."
""Goodnight, Genji‐sama.""
Genji disappeared off to the waiting room.
......After that, only Shannon and Kanon remained.
"......Thanks for giving me some time.
 I\'ll be staying here, so you can take a break now if you want."
"..............................
 ......In other words, it\'s my turn now."
".........Yeah.
 ......Sorry, ......but we aren\'t going to lose."
"And I......won\'t lose either......"
"Even though you\'ve always been a coward and let Milady take the lead until now...?"
"............Wasn\'t it you who taught me, Nee‐san?"
"What did I teach you...?"
"The past is immaterial when it comes to love.
 The present is all that\'s important.
 If that is true, then I think my present is in no way inferior to yours, Nee‐san."
Shannon and Kanon glared at each other with serious eyes.
{n}That period of tension vanished when Shannon chuckled.
"......Yeah, that\'s good.
 ......You and Milady have to give it your all.
 ......If you do end up together,
 ......make sure you build up a relationship wonderful enough that we can cheer you on with all our hearts."
"Well, you do have a huge lead on me."
"......Nothing to be done about that.
 That\'s what you get for your cowardice before now."
"I know.
 ......That is my...sin."
Shannon and Kanon fished around in their pockets, ......and drew out two small things that glittered gold.
They looked like......the left and right wings of a gold butterfly.
"We are furniture.
 ......In order to become {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} and receive the miracle that allows us to love, ......we must rely on a miracle of magic once again."
"......To think that her brooch would prove useful."
"It\'s the only magic within our reach."
It was the golden butterfly brooch,
 which {f:5:Beatrice} had once given to Shannon in the hopes of creating love between her and George.
Shannon had given it to Kanon, but he had let his emotions get ahold of him and had crushed it into pieces.
So, when the two wings they held were brought together, ......it would regain the form of a beautiful butterfly.
"......Then I\'ll be back soon.
 ......After all, they have asked me to play cards with them."
"Yeah.
 Good luck.
 ......I\'m sure Milady will be happy."
"......It\'s a bit embarrassing."
"Enjoy it.
 That feeling."
Kanon left the servant room.
 ......He went to go see Jessica and tell her what he had determined to do.
Shannon quietly watched him go.
The fragment of the brooch and the engagement ring let off a gold and silver glint......
"That takes me back.
 That\'s something I gave Shannon, if I recall.
 ......I always wondered where that disappeared to after Kanon stepped on it, but it seems they still had it all the time."
"......That\'s the golden butterfly brooch, isn\'t it?
 ......I read about the magical brooch that can save a love relationship in {f:5:Featherine}‐san\'s book."
And that had been the first moment that {f:5:Beatrice}, witch of the forest,
 had met with a human and given them her power.
Bit by bit, she had ascended from a mere ghost to the ruler of the mansion at night,
 ......and by making the servants believe in her, she had wiped away the anti‐magic power.
And then, ......it eventually became possible for her to appear openly in front of Shannon,
 whose magic resistance had grown particularly low and who had begun to believe in the existence of {f:5:Beatrice}...
To Beato, who had been unable to interact with anyone for many years, this conversation with Shannon must have been especially fun...
"That\'s why I generously gave her the butterfly brooch.
 ......*cackle*cackle*, I was in quite a good mood.
 ...It is no common thing for a heartless witch such as myself to be so gracious."
"But it\'s wonderful.
 You brought a pair of future lovers together."
"Of course, I did not do it to pamper them.
 ......It was in exchange for smashing that hateful spirit mirror that had repressed my magical powers.
 Thanks to that, I was able to regain much of my power all in one go."
"But then, one night, purple lightning smashed the shrine.
 Those of the surrounding islands called it an evil omen.
 Oooh, now that I think of it, that must have been a prelude to {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama\'s resurrection."
Kumasawa had the rest of the night off.
So, she had let Erika talk her into drinking a bit,
 and was chatting about the legend of Akujikijima and {f:5:Beatrice} in a happy, tipsy mood.
Erika would nod from time to time, but she listened very closely.
She wasn\'t actually taking notes, but she was gathering the information on the whiteboard inside her head.
......Then, she frowned as though noticing something out of place and held up her hand.
"Wait a second."
"Yes?"
"......That shrine was built by a traveling mountaineering ascetic to seal up the evil spirits of Akujikijima.
 Isn\'t that right?"
"Yes, that is correct.
 It was one who possessed a vast supernatural power, and who placed that power within the mirror—"
"And placed it within the shrine as a sacred mirror to seal the evil spirits.
 ......Something feels off about that.
 ......Why would a shrine to seal the evil spirits of Akujikijima also seal {f:5:Beatrice}?"
"W‐......well...
 That\'s, uh, because the power of the sacred mirror..."
"......I see.
 So it\'s this really convenient sacred mirror that works on both evil spirits from the East and witches from the West.
 ......Got it.
 I\'m still not satisfied, but I\'ll back off there for now.
 What I don\'t understand is why {f:5:Beatrice} can\'t stand spiderwebs."
According to the legend, the evil spirits of Akujikijima despised spiderwebs,
 so they were apparently used as wards against evil on the islands around here.
Actually, spiders are a useful bug.
{n}The farmers of the islands may well have treasured them.
It\'s very possible that the farmers called them wards against evil, tying them to the stories about evil spirits,
 in order to create a tradition of people treating this useful bug with care through the generations...
"But that\'s just the legend of Akujikijima.
 The origins for the legend of the witch {f:5:Beatrice} came after Ushiromiya Kinzo moved to this island,
 when rumors sprouted about the mysterious legend of the gold and his mistress who gave it to him as a witch."
"In other words, the evil spirits of Akujikijima and the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice} are completely different things.
 And yet, the same things are said about them."
"W‐......well now......"
The evil spirits of Akujikijima couldn\'t stand spiderwebs.
 So neither could {f:5:Beatrice}.
{n}That sort of reasoning has been applied all over the place.
......When it was pointed out that this was strange, Kumasawa was lost for an answer...
"The doorknob to Kinzo‐san\'s study has a scorpion magic circle drawn on it, which represents a charm against magic in Western sorcery.
 That\'s why the Western witch {f:5:Beatrice} can\'t touch it.
 ......I can understand that part."
"But there\'s no reason for {f:5:Beatrice} to dislike spiderwebs.
 I don\'t remember spiderwebs ever being included among things Western witches can\'t stand.
 On the contrary, wouldn\'t spiders be the friends and minions of a witch?"
"W‐......well......"
"In my opinion,
 ......these two legends about the evil spirits of Akujikijima and the witch {f:5:Beatrice}...
have become a little mixed together.
 In fact, maybe they\'ve been fully joined together as one."
"......The legend of Akujikijima is a fairy tale created by fishermen fearful of reefs in the Rokkenjima area.
 However, there was no visual image to go along with those evil spirits.
 Were they people, or monsters, or ghosts without legs?
 There\'s no mental picture of them.
 People are bad at imagining things without visuals.
 ......And then the legend of the witch called {f:5:Beatrice} came in."
"A witch is a lot easier to picture than evil spirits.
 And on top of that, Kinzo‐san had a portrait of {f:5:Beatrice} drawn and displayed.
 In other words, the lack of a visual image, which was the one weak point in the legend of Akujikijima, was finally completed.
 Perhaps the two legends became mixed together at some point after that."
"W‐well, I wonder......
 ...H‐......hohoho...
 It is a bit confusing for an old lady such as myself..."
Kumasawa laughed to smooth it over, wiping away a cold sweat...
She might have seemed confused, but she actually did understand what Erika was saying.
......In truth, she did have a rough understanding of how the legend of Akujikijima, which had been around before Ushiromiya Kinzo had come to Rokkenjima,
 and the legend of the Golden Witch, the story of the woman who had given Kinzo a vast quantity of gold,
 ......had changed over time.
She didn\'t want to admit it, ......but she knew.
{f:5:Beatrice}\'s "backstory", that she hated the spirit mirror and spiderwebs...
...had actually been based on the ancient legend of Akujikijima.
The "evil spirits" part of that legend had just been replaced by the witch of the portrait......
"......So,
 if there really was someone claiming to be the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice},
 I\'d really like to ask her...
whether she actually does hate spiderwebs or not.
 ......What happens when she touches them?"
"I‐it is said that witches and their minions...
......receive burns when they touch spiderwebs...
...so that is probably what would happen, I would say..."
"Hmph, that\'s not bad.
 A splendid witch trial.
 ......If the spiderweb touches her and she gets burned,
 then she\'s an evil spirit, not a witch.
 ......And if nothing happens, then it proves she\'s just a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}."
"In other words, .........whether she\'s burned or not,
 it will prove that the Golden Witch doesn\'t exist.
 ......The legend of the witch is nothing more than the legend of Akujikijima re‐boiled with a new face on it."
".........W‐.........well........."
"All it takes is the presence of a legend, and a deduction like this becomes trivial for Furudo Erika.
 Your thoughts, ladies and gentlemen......?"
Though only the two of them were in the lounge,
 Erika faced in the direction an invisible audience would have been if there was one,
 and shrugged...
And, to match Erika\'s imagination,
 .........the two of them actually were there, listening in...
".........Spiderwebs...?
 They burn if you touch them......?"
"..........................."
When Beato the Elder snapped her fingers,
 ......a graceful silver spider slipped down from the ceiling, hanging by a transparent thread.
Afterwards, only a single silver strand remained.
"..................Umm........."
Timidly,
 ......Beato stretched her finger out towards the spider\'s string...
And she............touched it......
".....................
 ......I\'m fine."
".........You are?"
"Huh......?"
Beato the Elder lifted up a white, pale finger, and after showing it to her little sister,
 ......she traced the silver string with it.
...There was a stench like a single hair being burnt.
Once again, she held her finger up in front of Beato, who was dumbfounded.
There was a thin burn line, as though someone had traced across it with a razor......
"What......does this mean...?"
"That\'s what I would like to know.
 Why are you unharmed?"
"I, I don\'t know.
 ......What I don\'t understand is why you do get burnt by touching a spiderweb..."
"......I do not know.
 It has always been like that since I first gained consciousness."
"Then, .........are you........."
Beato hesitated.
......However, her question was clear.
"No.
 I am not one of the evil spirits of Akujikijima.
 I am {f:5:Beatrice}, ruler of Rokkenjima\'s night.
 ......Even I do not know why I have the same weakness as this island\'s evil spirits of old..."
"Are spiderwebs the only things you can\'t handle...?"
"As this Erika said, I can\'t touch the doorknob to Kinzo\'s study.
 That scorpion magic circle burns me.
 ......For me, trying to open the door to that study is like trying to pick a red‐hot horseshoe out of a fire.
 .........What about you?"
"Huh?
 Scorpion magic circles, you mean......?"
The older sister snapped her fingers again.
When she did, the surrounding scene bent and twisted, and they had suddenly moved to the place in front of Kinzo\'s study.
And there......was the doorknob engraved with the scorpion magic circle.
"Those who research sorcery must have a refuge sealed off from both human and spiritual disturbances.
 ......It is no surprise that Kinzo chose to seal off his study and place a charm such as this here.
 ......And, unfortunately, that affects me as well, as I will show you..."
She gently grasped the doorknob.
As she did, a violent burning sound, unbelievably stronger than the one caused by the spiderweb, rang out.
"O‐Onee‐sama, are you okay...?!
 Your hand......aaaaaaahhh...!!"
Her hand......had been horribly burnt, and Beato couldn\'t help but avert her eyes...
"Fear not.
 This scratch will heal quickly."
Apparently, it would heal by itself if left alone.
{n}......The older sister seemed to heal at an inhuman rate.
"However,
 ......it seems that you can handle it just fine."
"..................G‐
......go."
She timidly poked the doorknob.
 ......Nothing happened.
Slowly, ......she touched it with her entire palm, but she felt nothing but a pleasantly cool sensation.
"......Strange.
 ......Though you are my double, you are different from me in several ways."
"While I might be able to touch the doorknob,
 ......if I ever get burnt like you did, I don\'t think I would heal that easily..."
".........It\'s as though you\'re a normal {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}."
"Y‐yes.
 ......Even I find it a little hard to believe that I\'m a witch...
 ......I can\'t use magic like you, and I can\'t get strange burns or heal from them later..."
".........Father believed...
...that I was a great witch reborn...
...but...
...I cannot believe that......"
"......Who are you?"
"I, I am {f:5:Beatrice}.
 ......I was born for Father\'s sake.
 ......And you, Onee‐sama?"
"I am also {f:5:Beatrice}.
 I used magic to give Kinzo gold, and later became a soul and the formless witch that haunts this island."
"..................Just who on Earth...
...are we......?"
"......Unlike me, it seems that you possess a body."
"Huh?
 Really......?"
"Yes.
 ......It occurred to me while listening to that Erika person.
 ......I am a witch who can use magic but has no body,
 ......and you are a witch who has a body but can use no magic.
 .........Eventually, perhaps we will become one, each filling in what the other lacks, and become the true, complete {f:5:Beatrice}."
"................................."
It did seem plausible.
Both of the {f:5:Beatrice}s were missing something.
If they were to become one, then surely they would be very close to the {f:5:Beatrice} that Battler desired...
"......Do you want...to try?"
"............Huh...?"
"Hold out your hand."
The older sister slowly raised her palm and held it out before Beato.
The large burn from a second ago really had started to heal already...
"It may be possible for us to become one.
 I want to know as well.
 By becoming one with you, ......I want to learn about my future self."
".............................."
Beato also raised her hand slowly,
 .........and the two hands...
...touched......
..............................
......But nothing happened.
Perhaps this meant that, while they were fated to become one eventually, that time had not yet come......
"......For me, being burned by spiderwebs is perfectly normal.
 However, you didn\'t even know about it.
 ......In the same way, you say that the reason you were born was for your father\'s sake.
 ......Apparently, that father is Ushiromiya Battler."
"I know him as a rare guest who only comes a few times a year,
 but I cannot understand what connection you and I have with such an infrequent guest.
 ......Surely, we must learn more about each other."
"Y‐yeah, you\'re right...
 ......I get the feeling that learning about each other......will lead us to something very important."
"On the other side lies the single future {f:5:Beatrice}.
 ......No, it may be more correct to say that it is the true form we are supposed to possess."
With their hands still joined, the two {f:5:Beatrice}s swore to fill in the parts the other lacked...
and regain their single form.
......Bit by bit, .........Beato was walking down the path that led to the former {f:5:Beatrice}............The eerie sound of the wind and rain.
Once again, I hazily regained consciousness on top of the bed...
The finger that the witch had bitten off...
...was still attached.
I didn\'t say "it was all an illusion"...
...just that it was still attached.
...After all, the pain and the teeth marks as though a witch had bitten it...
......were still there.
And yet, the window, which I had supposedly smashed, had been fixed as though it had never been broken in the first place...
.........How can I escape this creepy room?
Why am I locked up in this eerie room......all alone...?
I want to get out.
 ......I have to get out.
 ......Let me out of here.........
......The door was sealed with a firm chain.
I could open it a crack, but only enough to peek out into the corridor at best.
......It would probably be hard even to get just a fist through it.
The windows wouldn\'t budge either.
{n}They were no better than barred prison windows...
The bathroom didn\'t even have a window.
......The only thing that could get out through there was the water that flowed out if you turned on the tap.
......No matter how hard I tried, ......I couldn\'t think of any way out of here.
Shut in here like this, I was no more or less than a prisoner.
Unless someone came from outside to save me, ......I wouldn\'t be able to get out for all eternity.
.........In that case, couldn\'t I just call for help?
Yes, the tiny gap I could make in that door had to exist so that I could call for help.
But......could I make the words come out...?
I had tried to call out for help before,
 but for some reason, the words couldn\'t escape my mouth.
......I might have made some kind of mistake.
I might have just lost my voice in my haste and confusion.
I cracked the door open one more time.
The warm light of the hallway flowed in, making the darkness of the room stand out all the more...
Though I couldn\'t hear any voices, I did feel something peaceful.
......I was sure that everyone was in a room at the other end of the hallway, chatting happily about something.
If I could just call out, someone would surely come to save me......
".........Haah, .........haah, ............nng..."
Holding back some indescribable fear, I tried yelling once more...
"..................!!
 ...............!!!
 .....................!!!!"
But the result was the same.
It was like trying to yell underwater.
 ......All I did was get out of breath, unable to call out in the slightest.
".........Haah!!
 Haah, ......haah, ............haah............"
Even though I could say as much as I wanted if I just grumbled to myself inside the room,
 ......whenever I tried to make my voice reach outside, I choked and was unable to say anything.
I understood.
......My body wasn\'t the only thing imprisoned in this eerie locked room.
......My voice was, as well......
Thinking that I could use some other kind of sound to call for help, I tried opening and closing the door violently, making the chain rattle.
It did sound as though it was making a noisy clanking sound, ......but I was sure it was no good.
Even this sound......was imprisoned within the locked room.
No matter how harsh a sound I made, ......I was certain it would be quieter than a leaf falling by the time it reached the other end of the corridor......
I tried using the hateful chain that sealed the door to make a sound to call for someone,
 but that only deepened my despair...
"..................?
 ......This......chain......?"
That\'s insane...
Even though just a second ago, it was a stiff chain that looked like it was used to seal a monster away......
At some point, .........
it had transformed into a normal chain lock.
This changed everything.
{n}Now I could just undo it from the inside...!
I tried to undo the chain, but I couldn\'t pull it off, the chain not being long enough for that while the door was still open a crack.
 Of course.
"......C‐calm down......
 .....................*gulp*..."
I swallowed, ......and calmly closed the door.
Then, ......when I saw that the chain had slackened enough, ...I touched it with my finger to make sure.
......When I was little, ......I hated chains, because I could never get them undone right.
However, ......that was a long time ago.
{n}I could unfasten them normally now.
{n}......Anyone could... It was easy...
Clink......
At that moment, that terrible thought,
 that the demon who had locked me in this room might have been using this as a trap to give me hope and then make me despair even more,
 ......finally stopped haunting me.
The chain lock unfastened,
 ......and the chain dangled there right before my eyes.
......Now,
 ......there was no lock sealing this door.
Please,
 ......don\'t torment me anymore...
...and just...
......open normally......!
......Slowly......the door opened.
I had closed the door in order to undo the chain,
 ......so the warm light from the hallway had been cut off.
What if......I opened it again and that warm light was gone this time?
 ......I was even afraid of that.
However, that was............
......just me over‐imagining things.
Slowly,
 ......expanding before my eyes,
 ...no, this is normal for a door......
As the door let out an annoying creak,
 .........the exit from this cursed locked room finally opened......
"...............!!
 ..................!!!"
Ha...hahaha, I did it......I did it......!
Even my cry of joy was strangled.
{n}......But that didn\'t matter anymore.
{n}All that mattered was that I could get out!
I poked my head out and looked left and right down the corridor.
The warm corridor.
 I can sense people having fun at the other end.
 ......Everyone\'s right there.
 Let\'s go, right now.
"............Gyeh...k.........?!?!"
At that moment, something cold and heartless crushed my throat.
It was as though an iron loop had been fastened around my neck and pulled on hard from behind.
No...not "as though".
......Without my knowing,
 ......at some point...
...a thick, metal collar had been fastened around my neck.
When had this happened?!
 And when I turned around, I despaired even more.
From the inner side of the door I had just opened,
 ......a thick chain extended...
...which was connected to my collar.
I pulled on it, but it didn\'t even budge.
{n}When I shook it, the whole door creaked.
......What...
...th‐...
......the hell.........
The chain that connected to my collar......was attached to the inner side of the door.
Yes.
 The same heartless chain that had secured the door a short while back...had suddenly become a chain holding {i:me} in place...
That\'s insane... That\'s insane...!!
{n}Dammit, what\'s going on here?!!
I pulled with all my strength, trying to tear the whole door off,
 but I already knew from repeated experiments that it wouldn\'t even budge.
......I was sure this chain would disappear once I went back inside the room.
{n}But it would never let me leave it.
Though it had appeared to revert to being a normal chain lock, ......nothing had actually changed.
The fact that a "chain lock" bound me to that room was just as true now as ever...
"......Uuu......nnngh......aaaaaaaaahhhh......!!!"
Tears flowing down my face, I pulled with all I had.
{n}......It was completely useless.
 No matter what I did, I\'d never tear it loose.
And I wasn\'t even permitted to call out for help.
......I felt a confused anger at how the demon had mercilessly made me think for just an instant that I\'d escaped.
But no matter how much I yelled, no voice came out, and no one on the other end of the corridor could hear me...
Then,
 .........I noticed...
...an odd stain on the wall of the corridor.
It wasn\'t a stain.
 ......They were letters, traced out by a finger that had been covered in red paint.
".........?!
 ............?!?!"
Those letters, ......which looked like they had been drawn in blood,
 answered my biggest question...
The chain lock must be set.
You may unset it, but it must then be reset.
Unless it is set, this exit of yours will be unusable.
I instantly understood the meaning of that unsettling message.
{n}Then I tried it out, and understood completely.
When I return to the room and reset the chain lock, ......the binding around my neck disappears.
When I undo the chain lock again, ......that heavy feeling around my neck returns.
In other words, I cannot escape this room while the chain lock is still unset.
But that means all I need to do is set the chain while outside the room...!
I undid the chain one more time.
The weighty collar and chain appeared around my neck again.
I stepped out into the corridor and closed the door behind me, leaving only the slightest of cracks.
I stuck my hand through that crack, grabbed the dangling chain, and tried to reset it somehow.
......D‐......dammit......
......It\'s so easy to do from the inside...
......so why...
...is it so hard to do from the outside...?
The gap needed to be wide if I wanted to manipulate the chain well.
{n}However, that made the chain too short to reach.
To bring the chain even close to reaching, I had to close the door as much as possible.
But doing that meant that there wouldn\'t be enough of a gap to fit my hand in.
......Of course, that was perfectly natural.
Chain locks are made to be done from the inside.
They\'d be completely pointless if you could set and unset them from the outside.
That\'s why the length of the chain is specially chosen...
to prevent anyone from setting or unsetting it from the outside.
Maybe I could manage it with some kind of hard and thin tool?
If the gap of the door was just a finger\'s width across, the chain would have enough length to reach.
......If I could just bend a wire hanger so that it fits through the crack...
and work the chain with that......
That\'s right, there\'s a closet just to the side of the door.
 Could there be some hangers in there?
".........Found one...!!
 O‐......ohh, thank God...!!"
A single, cheap‐looking hanger, like one you might find in a laundry room, was hanging there.
......Really?
I\'m pretty sure that when I last looked a short while ago...
...nothing like this was in the closet...
Ah, who cares...!
 Quickly......quickly......!!
I twisted the wire hanger, bending the end with the tip around.
I formed a loop at the end to grab at things with,
 ......making for a sort of burglar\'s tool.
I then dashed out into the corridor again and closed the door almost as far as it would go.
My wrist could never pass through this.
But with the door closed this far, the chain should have extra length to spare...!
And this crack is large enough for me to stick the hanger through...!
Now it\'s just a matter of technique...!
{n}I\'ll definitely be able to do it if I try enough times... I\'m certain of it!!
".........Hah......haah.........haah.........haah...!"
It\'s harder than it looks...
.......But the chain {i:is} long enough.
{n}......It isn\'t impossible...!
I had finally gotten my hands on the one way to escape.
{n}......It was hard, yes, but it was theoretically possible.
If it was possible, then I would be able to get out.
{n}I would be able to escape from here...!!
""......Hihi......hihihihihihihihihi......""
"......! ...?!?!"
At that moment, ......I felt a heavy weight on the far side of the door.
It felt as though someone inside the room had leaned against the door...
...with their forehead.
And she...
...the witch...
...had laughed.
Then, I felt a powerful and strange force on the wire hanger.
......Is she trying to grab it away from me?!
Yeah right, like hell I\'ll let go!!
{n}Like hell I\'ll let my one key out of here get stolen while my guard\'s down!!
Fortunately, I had stuck my wrist through it so that I wouldn\'t drop it if my hand got tired.
You won\'t be able to snatch this out of my hands...!
""Hihihi, hihihihihihihihihi......""
The witch on the other side of the door watched me and laughed once more......
Then, ......I noticed something weird.
I looked at my left hand, which I had pressed against the door to hold it in place,
 ......and between the fingers of that hand,
 ......I could see something red.
.........It was...
......red...text.
I realized immediately.
At some point in time, even more bloody letters had been written on the door,
 and my left hand had been covering them up.
Still fighting against the vice‐like strength of the witch beyond the door, ......I moved my left hand to the side.
Where that hand had been...
...bloody letters had indeed been written.
It read.........as though someone had predicted that I\'d struggle this way from the very beginning...
...a message directly from the witch to me.
No matter the method,
 it is impossible to set or unset the chain lock from the outside.
All tricks done from the corridor......had been sealed by the red letters.
"N‐.........no way..............."
""Hihihihihihihi.
 ......Hihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi...!!""
There was suddenly a terrible sound, and the force that had been pulling on the hanger was suddenly released.
And....when I looked at the hanger that was finally free, I lost all hope.
As though it had been hit by the acid of the room\'s darkness,
 .........the tip of the hanger...
...had burnt and bubbled...
...and melted away.
Now it was pitifully short.
 It couldn\'t be used for anything...!
It would be useless to search for a substitute.
......All schemes to fasten the chain from the outside...had been sealed...!
Dammit...
...dammit, dammit, dammit...!!
I threw the remnants of the wire hanger against the floor,
 .......faced the hallway filled with a warm light,
 ......and called for help.
However, I just choked, unable to speak at all.
Everyone\'s just down the corridor.
{n}And everything\'s peaceful there!
I can\'t hear their voices, but I know!
{n}I\'m sure they\'re all having a good time playing cards!
{n}Please, someone notice me!!
 Someone...save me!!!
""Hi...hihihihihihihi...
...hi
hi
hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi!!""
Aaaaaaaahgggyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh{0}hh...!!!
"""......Ahahahaha, hahahahahahahaha."""
This time, it wasn\'t the witch\'s voice.
 ......It was the happy voices of everyone else, which I could hear from the other end of the hallway...
Someone, come over here...
...and save mee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}eee......
"Sorry, but I\'m out!"
George slammed his last card down, ending the game with his victory once again.
Everyone gasped in unison.
The cousins\' room was filled with laughter as they enjoyed their card game...
"Whoooooooa, so you really did have it, George‐aniki!
 Damn you...damn you, six of spaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}ades!"
"Your eight of diamonds was pretty nasty too.
 Aah, I was so close, aha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha!"
"Uu‐uu‐uu!!
 You\'re incredible, George onii‐chan! You won again!!"
"Yep, looks like we\'ve won again.
 Ahahahahaha."
Maria couldn\'t really hold her own in an all‐out battle.
So, she had teamed up with George, which was why she was celebrating his victory.
"......Gah.....................
 ......Utter defeat."
Kanon winced and let his cards drop to the table.
The game of sevens that Kanon and the cousins had been playing had been a fierce battle.
Normally, they would take things easy since Maria was there, so this sort of game was rare.
Kanon had started taking the game seriously, unwilling to lose,
 so George and Battler had responded and the battle had grown fierce.
Unlike Battler, who was carefree enough to enjoy it whether he won or lost, Kanon\'s mood changed drastically with every victory and defeat.
......It was less of a dislike for losing and more that he just wasn\'t used to playing games.
He wasn\'t used to the idea that "you win some, you lose some",
 so even a loss in a game played for fun was something he took very seriously.
Since he had resolved to win and had unfortunately challenged the veteran players George and Battler,
 the result was plain to see.
As Kanon slumped his shoulders, Jessica slapped him on the back.
"Hey, you almost had it...!
 Ahaha, but man, I love this stuff!
 Fighting all‐out!"
"......Whether I go all‐out or not, it\'s all meaningless if I lose in the end..."
"Are you kidding me?
 If you really give it your all, you can feel good about yourself even if you lose.
 If you lose after hardly trying, then you feel like grumbling and complaining about how you\'d have won if you\'d taken it seriously, right?"
"That\'s right.
 People who really give it their all never complain.
 Those guys are always cheery no matter what the result."
"That\'s right.
 And those people are scarier than anyone else.
 They always learn something from their experience and grow."
"......Very true.
 ...I was a coward, so I could never learn anything.
 ...So even now, I am yet to mature."
I am furniture, so it is useless to dream.
{n}Because he had rigidly believed that, he had distanced himself from everything and shut himself away.
However, during that time, Shannon had undergone many life adventures.
And now, her hand rested on the door separating furniture and {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s......
The old Kanon would only have seen this card game as a way to pass the time.
However, ......the new Kanon was now capable of gaining something new from this experience.
That could probably be called...growth.
{n}Furniture does nothing but rot with the passage of time.
Being able to grow......is a privilege given only to {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s.
"Thanks for playing with us.
 You probably had work to do, like filling in the log, right...?
 Seriously, thanks for going along with us."
"......Not at all.
 I had fun too.
 ......Or perhaps I should say......I now understand why doing things like that is fun.
 Thank you very much for forcing me to come."
"Let\'s challenge ourselves more and more.
 And let\'s go and find more and more things you didn\'t know about."
"......O‐
oh,
 so,
 about what we were talking about...
 Do you wanna try, like, ...g‐guitar?
 I, I mean, it\'s not like you have to or anything, but..."
".........It must be very difficult."
"Y‐yeah, I guess.
 But I\'ll do a good job teaching you, and I\'ll even practice with you.
 Well, I guess I\'m not that much of an expert myself, hahaha..."
At first, Kanon was scared of touching a musical instrument for the first time in his life, certain he would make a complete fool of himself.
......He knew that screwing up like that would make him feel bad.
......However, Kanon was starting to learn.
"It\'s only natural that I\'ll be bad when I first start.
 ......If I just try to run away from that, I\'ll never learn a thing for all eternity.
 I\'ll never achieve anything."
"Yep.
 Isn\'t that why people love it when they feel themselves improving?
 Even I sucked at making my left and right hands move at the same time when I first started...!
 But I slowly got the knack of it, and it started to feel more and more natural...!"
"........................
 ......I\'d like to reach that level too.
 If one path to that goal is playing music with you, Milady, ......I would love to do that with you."
"R‐really...?!"
"Yes.
 ......I\'m sure I\'ll be horrible when I start, and I might even make you lose hope in me at times.
 ......But if I\'ve given it my all, I can take failure in my stride.
 ......That\'s what I learned from you all just now."
"......Hahahahahahaha,
 you\'re embarrassing me..."
"Now, .........I love you even more, Milady.
 Because I averted my eyes for so long, even though you shone like the sun,
 I never noticed you when you were right there next to me..."
"Eheheheh.
 Then I\'d better work even harder to make you love me even more...
 Ehehihi, hahyahyahya..."
Kanon\'s serious and competitive words were more than enough to make Jessica shy.
However, Kanon\'s expression unexpectedly clouded......
".........Milady, the reason I love you is so clear.
 ......That\'s why...I can\'t bear not knowing."
"N‐not knowing what......?"
"......Why you would start to like me.
 .........Unlike you, I do not shine in any sense.
 ......Even now, I\'m just clinging to your back as you shine the way.
 ......I can\'t think of any reason why you would like a wretch like me."
"Th‐......that\'s not true, okay?!
 There are all kinds of good things about you, Kanon‐kun..."
"......Let me swallow my pride and ask.
 ......What about me made you like me, Milady?"
Kanon hung his head.
......He had never learned anything, so he had never been able to take the lead with her.
It made him sad and frustrated that he had always been the one‐sided recipient of her affection...
...and could do nothing but respond to it.
Jessica was lost for words.
......After all, compared to the reason that Kanon had fallen for Jessica,
 .........Jessica\'s reason......was a lot more vague.
She had listened to Shannon talk about her love with George,
 ......and at school, she and her friends always talked about relationships with boys.
There was nothing strange about a girl fascinated by the idea of romance developing an interest in a nearby member of the opposite sex.
......However, if she were to put that into words,
 she would be misinterpreted as saying that any nearby boy would have done just as well......
However, ......if nothing else, she knew what she felt at this moment.
She really did love Kanon, ......and she truly wanted a relationship with him.
They might end up together as a result, or they might not.
But whatever the outcome, she could accept it as long as she held nothing back.
That allowed her to stay true to her feelings, what she knew she felt right now, and act on them seriously.
However, ......she couldn\'t find the right words to tell Kanon this.
When Kanon saw Jessica bite her lower lip in frustration,
 ............he finally realized...
"......I\'m such a fool."
"Huh?"
"What about me do you like?
 ......That very question is foolish.
 It\'s proof that I\'m not serious about myself, and that I haven\'t been able to understand myself.
 ......It\'s horrible of me to try and make you say it for me."
"Th‐that\'s not true...!
 A‐after all, it\'s the first question any girl would like to ask after being given a love confession...!
 Th‐the question "What part of me do you like?"..."
"It was immature of me to ask you that.
 How could anyone like someone so immature?"
"W‐wait, that\'s not..."
Jessica panicked, trying desperately to explain how she felt.
However, Kanon was calm.
 And then, he spoke.
"In that case,
 .........I want you to grow to love me...
...the way I already love you.
 ......I\'ve decided to change myself so that can happen.
 I can\'t possibly hope for you to love me the way I am.
 ......But someday............no matter what..."
"......Yeah.
 I\'m absolutely sure you\'ll become a wonderful person, Kanon‐kun.
 A guy so cool that I can\'t keep my eyes off you.
 Until then, I\'ll stick by you all the way.
 ......We have all the time in the world...!"
"..............................
 ......Unfortunately, there isn\'t that much time left."
"......What about time?"
"When I talk about furniture......it usually saddens you.
 ......But this is something I must talk to you about.
 And it is also something I must fight for with all my soul."
"What are you talking about...?
 I don\'t want to hear any more of that "I\'m furniture so I can\'t fall in love" talk.
 You\'re a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}, not furniture...!"
"I understand.
 That\'s why I intend to become {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.
 But at the moment, I am furniture."
"Just do it, then! Become {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}...!"
"The witch taught me once.
 ......The single element of this world.
 She said it was love.
 ......It\'s something that {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s born into this world can take for granted."
"......However, it is not something that those not from this world, who were born as furniture, can take for granted.
 .........In order to gain it for themselves, they must have magic or a miracle."
......In the same way that Nee‐san and George‐sama...
...would never have ended up as they have without borrowing the power of that golden butterfly brooch.
"I don\'t really get this last part."
"......What is it that you do not understand?
 ......Let me hear it."
"Since this game began, ......a large portion of the time has been spent on Shannon and Kanon\'s determination to fall in love.
 ......I have no problem with interpreting that as a story of growth and teenage determination for a girl and boy who call themselves furniture.
 However, one of the assumptions they make feels really out of place to me."
"...............‘Why is magic necessary?’
 ......Is that it...?"
"Both Shannon and Kanon—no, I\'ll purposefully refer to them as "furniture".
 ......The {i:furniture} has always claimed that there cannot be love between furniture and {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s.
 That\'s where the magic of the golden butterfly brooch came into play—it was the miraculous result of that magic that love was established between Shannon and George onii‐chan.
 That\'s what they claim."
"Surely it would not be a stretch if they thought that forbidden love across class boundaries...
...could never bear fruit without a miracle of magic......?"
"Oh, I agree.
 Shannon and Kanon are both servants in love with members of the Ushiromiya family,
 so it makes perfect sense to me that they might disparage themselves as furniture while suffering from their forbidden love."
"......Then what is it that does not make sense to you...?"
"‘Without the power of magic once more, marriage will be impossible’.
 ......Shannon and Kanon both seem to share that view.
 ......That\'s the part that I just can\'t understand."
After meeting in secret for quite some time, George and Shannon had finally gotten engaged.
Both were fully prepared for it emotionally,
 and though there would be some trouble with the relatives, it had gotten to the point where it would probably be impossible for anyone to prevent their marriage.
".........Trying to stand between two who wish to be wed is as foolish as standing in the path of an arrow in flight and trying to catch it."
"Exactly.
 George onii‐chan has sworn to protect his partner for the rest of their lives and no longer fears opposition or disinheritance from his parents.
 ......On the contrary, he even considers them to be the perfect tests to demonstrate his love for her."
".........In other words, they will be married no matter what.
 No one can stop them.
 And they have both consented to the engagement."
"No one can stop them or impede them.
 Trying to break apart lovers is a foolhardy venture..."
"Yeah.
 And that\'s what\'s strange.
 There\'s no need for magic."
If George and Shannon...
...had wanted Eva\'s approval for their engagement...
.........then magic really might have been necessary.
After all, Eva had forbidden his relationship with her.
No matter how much George spoke on Shannon\'s behalf, the chances of Eva being convinced were virtually zero.
If that were the case, it would be understandable if they wanted a magical miracle to make Eva acknowledge their engagement.
"But George onii‐chan has already sworn to it.
 He doesn\'t care whether his parents approve of the engagement or not.
 ......Yeah.
 There\'s nothing standing in the way of their engagement.
 And Shannon should know that well herself.
 So why is it that now, on this night where the proposal went so smoothly, she\'s still praying for a miracle of magic?"
"......Without such a miracle, she will not have the right to marry,
 is what the furniture claim..."
"And there you go.
 It means that Shannon has accepted George\'s proposal,
 ......but she knows that there\'s still some kind of obstacle remaining that can\'t be overcome without a magical miracle.
 And that obstacle isn\'t something that they can overcome by their own efforts.
 That\'s why they need this miracle called magic."
"Why do they need magic?
 If two people love each other, what other miracle could they possibly need to be together?!"
"............Hmm, I see..."
{f:5:Featherine} listened to Ange\'s interpretation, smiling in a satisfied way.
......Apparently, she had already reached that conclusion and was enjoying watching Ange finally manage to do the same.
"And that same question applies to Kanon as well.
 ......The love between him and Jessica onee‐chan has just begun, but their emotions are pure.
 There\'s nothing standing in their way."
"They\'re already in a loving relationship even without the golden butterfly brooch.
 ......It\'d be no surprise if the relationship they\'ve started lasts for years and eventually results in marriage.
 There\'s nothing standing in their way either."
"......As long as they do not seek approval from Krauss and Natsuhi, it seems that they will not need a magical miracle either..."
"Exactly.
 ......Kanon watched how Shannon lived, and changed his own way of life.
 Then, he let his true feelings be known and started a relationship with Jessica onee‐chan.
 ......There\'s no need for magic anymore."
"......If it were a one‐sided love, then he might need a love charm or something.
 But their feelings are already mutual.
 They\'ve already communicated their intentions to one another.
 ......So why do they need a miracle on top of that?"
Both pieces of furniture are in relationships of mutual love.
{n}There shouldn\'t be any need for a miracle any longer.
So why...
...do they still desire a miracle of magic?
And on top of that, the single brooch is portrayed as bestowing only a single miracle.
It feels almost as though Shannon is hesitating because, if she uses up that miracle for herself,
 Kanon\'s chances at love will be automatically sealed away for eternity...
"So the question is this:
 ‘Why is furniture not allowed to love?’"
"......So, you ask why love is not permitted without the miracle known as magic."
"And also,
 ......there\'s that golden butterfly brooch that can allow the lamenting furniture to have the love they insisted they were incapable of.
 Just what on Earth is that?"
"Of course, it is a crystallization of magic.
 However, like most magics, it can be burnt by the anti‐magic toxin."
"......So, it can only have an effect for those who believe in magic and witches."
"Correct.
 So, Shannon, who was capable of interacting with me, was able to make use of its benefits.
 However, if Shannon had dropped it in a sandy beach and someone who knew nothing picked it up..."
"......If that person was shrouded in the anti‐magic toxin, they wouldn\'t be able to make use of the brooch\'s magic power..."
"Precisely.
 A witch\'s magical items often lose their power if they are not handed over directly."
"However, in just the same way that a witch can manifest herself if her existence is acknowledged by a great many {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s and the anti‐magic toxin disappears,
 the power of that magical item can also be preserved if it is believed in by a great many people."
"That\'s ironic.
 ......No matter what kind of magic we witches give out, everything depends on whether the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} we give it to can accept it."
"I have heard that the same goes for medicine.
 Even with the exact same medicine, {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s who know of the medicine\'s effect experience it to a greater degree."
"......Oh, I think I understand.
 When taking cold medicine, I\'ve gotten the feeling that it\'s more effective when you read the description on the bottle."
As she listened, Beato thought that magic sounded a bit like a charm.
When most {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s think of magic,
 they think of incredible miracles being performed one after another in front of a crowd.
However, this true magic that the older sister spoke of sounded almost like a charm,
 something that had no effect if the person using it didn\'t believe.
......Shannon\'s heart was captured by George bit by bit as he grew by leaps and bounds.
However, she had given up, thinking that one of lower status such as herself would never find love with him.
That was when {f:5:Beatrice} had given her the golden butterfly brooch and encouraged her.
Giving up means that you have zero chance of success.
But if, with the power of magic, you think there just might be some chance of your wish coming true,
 the probability then rises to something greater than zero at the very least.
Zero remains zero forever, but if even a faint probability were to exist,
 ......it would be no exaggeration to say that an impossible miracle had occurred, compared to the time when the probability was zero.
Humans can use magic to take "resignation", by which they themselves make the probability of success zero, and cancel it out.
When a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} does not give up, though their chances of success may be small, those chances do exist.
And the stronger their belief, the more those odds rise.
It was easy to imagine that Shannon had made earnest wishes upon the brooch, believed in its effect,
 ......and made many little efforts to get George to like her.
"The power of belief becomes magic......"
"And those who make others believe are witches."
Those who make others believe...
...are witches.
......That\'s an interesting way to put it.
 If you think about it, it\'s true.
Let\'s say a witch steps out into a spotlight, waves her staff in front of a crowd of onlookers,
 and makes a rabbit appear out of thin air.
The many people who see it will surely think that it was a sleight of hand.
They might wonder at how it was accomplished, but they would be sure that it wasn\'t magic,
 and they would applaud the splendid trick that had appeared to be magic.
But what if...
What if they conducted a sacred ceremony inside a great ancient temple in front of a crowd of believers...
culminating in the exact same thing?
......Would any of the people there think that was a sleight of hand?
In fact, in the ancient past, when magic tricks as a form of entertainment didn\'t even exist and divine spirits were worshiped,
 this would doubtlessly have been a miracle of magic...
"I‐in that case,
 ......would this...
...count as magic?"
"Oh?
 Will the witch who cannot use magic now perform it for the first time?"
"H‐......here I have an empty tea cup.
 There is nothing inside it."
"Mhm, it is empty.
 *giggle*, go on."
"I will take this cup,
 ......turn it like this,
 ......and place it upside down on the table."
"Heheheheheheh.
 And then? What next?"
"Umm,
 ......le‐let\'s both close our eyes and chant the incantation."
It was......the same magic that had been used to give Maria candies.
Beato the Elder grinned and closed her eyes.
When she saw this, ......Beato slowly chanted the incantation.
"C‐come, try to remember.
 ......What was inside the cup?"
"Hmm.
 Come, try to remember.
 What was inside the cup?"
As she chanted,
 Beato slowly opened her eyes and made sure that the older sister was repeating her with her eyes closed.
Then, a single gold butterfly appeared out of nowhere,
 ......fluttered down onto the overturned cup, and scattered away in a spray of gold.
"May I open my eyes now?"
".........Y‐yes.
 Please open your eyes and inspect the contents of the cup."
"Well now.
 ......Let us see how well your first bit of magic has worked."
Taking her time and dragging out the suspense a little, the older sister......lifted up the cup.
".........Aha."
"H‐how is it......?"
When the cup was lifted up,
 .........there lay......a single golden rose petal.
"D‐...does this count as...magic......?"
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*......
 Yes, it most certainly does.
 {p:41:You used magic to create a golden flower petal inside an overturned cup.
 It was a splendid bit of magic}."
"‘Without love, it cannot be {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen}’.
 That much I understand."
"It may be viewed as a trick.
 It may also be believed to be magic.
 ......It all depends upon the toxin of the individual..."
"Then again, ......while this can explain some of the magic that\'s been used in the past, it can\'t explain everything."
"To get back to the point, none of this stuff about believing in magic and charms can answer the question:
 "What is the golden butterfly brooch that can allow the lamenting furniture to have the love they insisted they were incapable of?"
 It\'s not enough for an answer."
"......To take what we heard from the two Beatos at face value,
 ......would it not make sense to consider that magic has the power to cancel out the furniture\'s "resignation"?"
"‘Why mustn\'t furniture fall in love?’
 "Why is the power of the magic brooch necessary?"
 ......Yes, it does seem at a glance as though what you and the Beatos are saying provides an answer, though a vague one.
 However, let me say this as a Reader.
 ......I can\'t accept this as you\'ve presented it."
"You cannot accept it, you say...?"
"......The fate that those pieces of furniture were fighting to overturn was something much more immense than this would allow for.
 I doubt they could reform their way of thinking just because they were given a charm for making relationships."
"It\'s true that the brooch gave Shannon the chance she needed to get together with George onii‐chan,
 but after that, she said she wanted to deepen their relationship without borrowing the power of magic, and she even tried to give the brooch back to Beato.
 She put the miracle of magic behind her at that point.
 ......In that case, why is she once again in need of its power?"
"Well now.
 ......Perhaps there is no way to say it except that love and marriage are very different things."
{f:5:Featherine} laughed lightly.
......She had probably formed a theory of her own and was laughing at Ange, who hadn\'t reached it yet.
"Let me hear it.
 What\'s your view?"
"I\'d like to keep that to myself for just a while longer.
 ......And of course, watching you form doubts and let your mind race is one of the joys of being read aloud to.
 If I gave you my views, you would accept them and stop thinking.
 Then, having you read aloud would be no fun."
".........So, you\'re having me read a mystery novel you already know the answer to, just so you can enjoy watching me blunder about."
"Well, I am the Witch of Theatergoing.
 ......If you wish to laugh at my bad taste, please do not hold back, my miko."
"‘Wa‐ha‐ha‐ha.’"
"Pft, ......*giggle*giggle*, haha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha..."
I understand that a part of magic is created by a believing heart.
And that magic probably permeates deep into the world of us {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s as well.
However, though it does permeate so far, the power that dwells within magic is small.
Visiting a shrine before an important exam to pray that you\'ll pass is something that many people do.
However, not many people will actually credit that visit as the reason for their success.
Praying like this contains no power except as a calming influence.
In love, where even a small chance and a little bit of courage can cause a major change,
 this power might cause a massive upheaval...
However, .........would the insurmountable fate that those pieces of furniture claim to be in the middle of...
really change because of something like that......?
I think that in the past, the magical power of the brooch as it joined Shannon and George was little more than a good‐luck charm.
However, at this point,
 the magical power that the pieces of furniture are seeking from the brooch, praying for their love to succeed...
......It\'s not something as vague as a charm.
It feels much stronger, like {i:a whole different interpretation of magic}.
If you believe in a sleight of hand, it becomes magic.
......But that\'s no more than a child\'s trick.
{n}And that only explains one part of magic.
They...are hoping for something.
They\'re hoping for something with much, much more power...
...for true magic, not a sleight of hand.
"......So then, just what kind of magic...
......are the pieces of furniture expecting from that brooch......?"
".........A golden butterfly...brooch...?"
"The Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}...
......gave a magic charm to Shannon in exchange for smashing a mirror—a charm that makes love succeed.
 ......That\'s what this is."
From his pocket, ......
Kanon pulled a wing of a gold butterfly.
Though it was just a single wing, it was easy to tell from its distinctive shape that it had originally been part of something with a butterfly motif.
"The magic of this brooch gave Shannon the chance she needed to start her relationship with George‐sama.
 ......However, before that magic was fully realized, she left it to me.
 ......So, thanks to the power of this brooch,
 .........I gained your affection, Milady."
"That\'s not true...
 I started liking you because of my own honest feelings..."
"......Thank you very much.
 ...You are {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}, so you do not believe in witches or magic.
 It\'s only natural.
 ......However, as furniture created by magic, my very existence here...
...is proof that the miracle of magic exists."
"S‐sorry,
 what are you talking about...?"
Jessica tried her hardest to grasp what Kanon was trying to say.
However, she couldn\'t understand it, and had to ask him to repeat it with a bitter smile...
"...........................
 ......Both Shannon and I...
...need magic to succeed in love.
 The key for that is this brooch.
 ......I stepped on it and crushed it, so we each have one part."
The brooch had lost its power when it was split in half.
{n}However, if it was ever joined together again, ......its magic would be revived.
It would revive the miraculous power that could join furniture and a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} together...
"However, a single brooch can only grant one person\'s wish.
 ......Only one of us furniture can be joined by this single brooch."
It was the single spark of love that the old {f:5:Beatrice} with her shrill laugh had sown on a day long ago.
That {f:5:Beatrice} had likened humans who were tormented by this spark to ripe fruit and taken evil pleasure in their suffering.
However, the magic infused within this spark...was real.
It was the only crystallization of magic that the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice} ever left in this world......
Its shine......grew brighter.
"Huh? ......Wh‐...what the...?!"
"It\'s okay.
 ......But please don\'t look right at it.
 It\'ll blind you."
"Gh, .........ghhh.........!"
It grew more brilliant still, shining like the sun.
Jessica didn\'t need Kanon to tell her to put her hands over her eyes......
As the light grew stronger, ......a sound like the roaring of the wind or the tide also grew in intensity.
It already drowned out the sound of the wind and rain outside...
Jessica could no longer even stand, and she crouched on the floor......
It was a flood of sound and light...
 And until it withdrew, Jessica could do nothing but moan......"Come on, it\'s okay now. Let\'s hurry."
"I, I hope Father likes sweet foods......"
"Oh yes, he does like them.
 In fact, he seems to enjoy eating pretty much anything.
 Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho."
After waiting for the master of the study to be out, Beato and Kumasawa entered the study.
Then, they quickly tidied away the books on the desk, set down the basket they had brought there, and began spreading out the contents.
Inside......were several cute cookies cut out in a butterfly shape.
They set out a cute plate and neatly decorated it with the cookies.
It was the kind of slight adornment that the person eating wasn\'t likely to even notice.
 The whole setup was filled with that sort of feeling.
"You spare no efforts for the sake of your beloved father."
"This is......all I\'m permitted to do right now."
"To think that I would give Battler cookies...
 Why should I, the ruler of the night, do so much for a guest who comes so rarely?"
Then, the study door swung violently open.
It was Battler, with Genji by his side...
Battler\'s eyes went wide for a second when he saw Beato there, but his expression quickly went blank again.
"......What are you doing here?"
"Father, ......please excuse me.
 I didn\'t come here to get in the way of your important game......"
"How were you able to get in here...?
 Wasn\'t this room locked?"
"......My apologies.
 I lent them a key because they wished to surprise you with a gift."
"See, have a look...!
 {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama baked these cookies with all her soul, hoping that you would enjoy them."
"Kumasawa‐san and Genji‐san taught me...
 I never knew Genji‐san was so good at baking cookies."
"Hoh‐hoh‐ho.
 He hasn\'t done it much of late, but Genji‐san used to cook many things long ago.
 He was especially good with sweets...!"
"Cookies...?"
"Y‐yes.
 It\'s a gift for you, Father.
 I sincerely pray for your victory in this important match..."
Battler looked at the plate on the study desk that was piled up with beautiful cookies...and the message card of encouragement lying next to it,
 .........and his face twisted with a complex expression, which might have had traces of both sadness and anger contained within it...
"............My lord..."
In not so many words, Genji prompted him to consider giving Beato\'s efforts some kind of acknowledgment...
Battler understood.
{n}......He had no reason to respond to this kindness with displeasure.
However, even though he understood that logically,
 ......all he could do was give a small exasperated sigh.
"......Thank you, I\'m very grateful.
 ......But I don\'t like sweets.
 Please take it away."
"M‐......my lord..."
"....................."
"Don\'t make me say the same thing again.
 ......Please clean it up and take it away."
"M‐my lord, couldn\'t you try just one bite...?
 {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama worked hard to make them for your sake..."
"......I\'m grateful for the sentiment.
 ......I\'m in the middle of a very important game right now.
 Important to both me...
and Beato.
 .........And it will be our last.
 So please.
 Try not to trouble me any more than necessary."
"That\'s just too sad for her...!
 I\'m glad that you are grateful for her feelings,
 but can\'t you show it by taking just one little bite...?!"
".....................Father..."
Beato looked at Battler sadly.
......Battler hung his head to avoid her gaze.
The expression on his face was more pained than any he had shown Beato before...
"..................
 ......Kumasawa, clean this up and take it away."
"My lord...!!"
"..........................."
Kumasawa implored Battler to listen, but he turned his back to her...
"......My...apologies...
 ......Let\'s clean this up, Kumasawa‐san..."
"I won\'t allow it.
 By making this gift, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama gave it her all to try and support you in your important game in the only way she could.
 To tell her to take it away without eating a bite yourself... How can you trifle with a woman so?!!"
".........Kumasawa."
"If you call yourself a man,
 you should at least try a bite when a woman makes you a handmade snack!!
 If you truly intend to trample on this woman\'s feelings, I promise you this,
 I will not back down even if it kills me! No I won\'t!!"
"K‐
......Kumasawa‐san,
 ......you\'ve done enough for me already......"
"I won\'t allow it!!
 My lord, do you think there might be poison inside them?!"
"..........................."
......Yeah,
 if Beato ever came to give me cookies......
......of course I\'d think that she\'d put some kind of crazy poison in them......
She asked me if I thought there\'d be poison in these?
How could anyone ever think...
...that cookies like these, piled up in such a neat and cute way,
 .......could possibly have something bizarre hidden inside...?
And...
......who could possibly believe...
......that {i:Beato}...
......would make something like this......?
Because of that, ......Battler couldn\'t bear to look at Beato\'s innocent reaction,
 which was completely free from any malicious thoughts of slipping poison into the cookies......
Beato quietly started to clean up.
 ......Every now and then, she sniffled.
Kumasawa had been glaring at Battler continuously,
 but she now gave a small sigh and helped Beato clean up.
However, the hardness didn\'t disappear from her expression.
".........My apologies, Father.
 ...Please excuse me."
"Don\'t call me that......"
".................."
"Don\'t call me Father.
 ......Beato never once called me that."
"Y‐......yes, as you wish...
 ......My apologies..."
Hanging her head so low that her chin touched her chest, Beato hurried out of the study.
After giving Battler a look, Kumasawa chased after her.
She shut the door a bit violently, and the footsteps of the pair rapidly disappeared off into the distance...
".....................
 ......I may be his little sister, but I\'m not sure how I feel about that."
"If she were anyone other than Beato, you\'d think of him as a true enemy of women, is that it...?"
"......I don\'t have a clue why Onii‐chan and Beato act so friendly together.
 Right now, I think of Beato as our greatest enemy, the one we must defeat.
 ......Still, even so...
 As a woman, ......I can\'t say I like Onii‐chan\'s reaction."
"Though I can understand Battler\'s feelings a little.
 ......What a sad state of affairs."
I still don\'t understand what kind of bad blood or connection there was between them.
However, Onii‐chan probably views Beato......as a friendly adversary, if not something more.
Onii‐chan\'s reason for defeating Beato isn\'t to destroy an enemy out of hatred.
 ......It feels like he wants to give a sincere answer to her questions.
Yes.
 I can\'t deny the fact that their fight isn\'t based on hatred...
but on a stronger emotion.
".........And on top of that...
...Beato really is something, to remain dedicated to Onii‐chan even after being treated so coldly.
 I agree with the other, older sister {f:5:Beatrice}.
 ......I can\'t understand why she\'s so dedicated to Onii‐chan."
"And, though it may take a thousand years,
 that single factor that you do not understand must be passed on to the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice} we know so well..."
"......Yes.
 I understand that.
 ......Knowing this Beato leads to knowing the Beato who is to come.
 ......It may explain the greatest piece in this crazy game, if not the game board itself..."
"Such a mysterious witch......"
Though she said those words, {f:5:Featherine} wore a confident smile on her face.
Her sarcastic confidence, as though she already knew the answer, was unchanged.
".........{f:5:Beatrice}.
 I want to ask you something."
"Y‐......yes, what would you like to know, Ange‐san...?"
Beato, who had been reading a fragment book in the shadows of the study, jumped when Ange called out to her.
"......Why do you call Ushiromiya Battler "Father"?"
"B‐because he created the piece that I am..."
"......In that case, why are you so dedicated to Ushiromiya Battler?
 Is there some rule that pieces must obey the creator who made them?"
"There is no such rule.
 ......Pieces are tools, ...like a knife.
 ......If the Game Master uses them well, they can be quite useful.
 However, if you use them incorrectly, they can hurt you as well.
 ......Whether the tool is used as a tool or a weapon, that has nothing to do with the tool\'s own will.
 It is merely the result."
"In that case, why are you so dedicated towards Onii‐chan?
 It\'s almost as though......that\'s your purpose as a piece."
"Y‐.........yes.
 ...That is the purpose for which I was born."
"Did Onii‐chan, the one who gave birth to you, give you that purpose?"
"You have that wrong.
 ......Battler merely set "a piece with that role" on the board as the Game Master.
 ......The one who gave birth to this piece...
was the first Game Master and the one who created this game, {f:5:Beatrice} herself..."
"......Aaah, this is getting confusing.
 ......In other words, you keep calling Onii‐chan "Father", but he\'s not actually your father.
 ......You\'re just calling him that affectionately,
 because you feel that you have to dedicate yourself to him."
"Y‐......yes.
 ......I think that\'s true.
 Father was the one who placed me on the game board.
 If he hadn\'t, my piece would never have had a turn.
 So, the reason I exist here right now and the reason I am able to devote myself to my purpose...is all thanks to Father."
"......I see.
 So that\'s why it makes sense for you to call him Father.
 ......In that case, who told you to devote yourself to Onii‐chan?
 ......Oh, right, that\'s the first Game Master, Beato herself.
 ......Aaaahh, this is so confusing."
"You wish to ask her why she must serve Ushiromiya Battler, correct?
 However, she cannot give you that answer.
 She was given nothing but the purpose itself.
 ......Only the person who gave her that purpose knows the reasons for which they did so."
"......I see.
 "Consider that as well, child of man", right?
 ......So, that means you already have an idea and you\'re laughing at my confusion."
"*cackle*cackle*.
 You really are just perfect for my miko..."
".........I will......do anything for Father.
 ...My existence will bring Father happiness.
 ......That is my greatest pleasure.
 ......And............"
At that point, Beato hesitated.
"What?
 And what?"
"Y‐yes...
 ......And...
......if I could one day have Father acknowledge my efforts,
 ......there would be no greater happiness for me..."
"Pft........."
".........What the hell.
 ......If you only wanted to serve him, I\'d say you\'re just another piece of the witch\'s furniture,
 ......but you want him to acknowledge your efforts?
 That\'s less like furniture and more like—"
Ange stopped mid‐sentence.
......That\'s less like furniture and more like...
......you\'re just a girl...
......who loves Onii‐chan.
..................I don\'t...get it.
The guiding force behind this Beato\'s actions...is that of a girl who adores Onii‐chan.
But then, what would that make {i:her}?
If {i:she} liked Onii‐chan, then she should have adored him and done things for him herself.
Why would she create "a piece of herself", a separate entity, to do it......?
This way, ......even if she does attract Onii‐chan\'s attention, it will be towards the piece version of herself,
 ......not the creator who made that piece.
If I ever fall in love with someone, I\'ll probably want to do things for them.
But of course, I would want to do those things myself.
After all, I would want him to notice {i:me}.
This love is destined to go virtually unrewarded...... No matter how devoted she is, she will never get anything out of it.
{n}And she\'s done this out of her own free will...
Beato\'s behavior looks no different from that of an average girl in love.
She\'s devotedly doing all she can for him, dreaming that her kindness will eventually be acknowledged.
......Why would Beato create a piece like this...?
Is putting it in terms of romance a bit too confusing?
 Then let\'s try using food as an example.
It\'s as pointless as creating "a piece to eat food for you".
No matter how much food your piece eats on your behalf, you won\'t get any less hungry, right?
You are the one who wants to eat.
{n}There\'s no reason for having a piece do that in your place.
For most jobs in the world, you can get someone else to do it for you.
 However, with love and food alone, there can never be any meaning in letting another person do it in your place.
That\'s right.
 ......This Beato was created as a "piece"...for an impossible reason......
......Though at a glance, she looks like just a normal girl,
 .........the more I learn about her, the less I understand, ......like an imaginary number......
"......Father hates it when I call him Father.
 ......And the "me" that Father desires...didn\'t call him by that name either."
"Right.
 The former "you" spoke to everyone without even using honorifics."
"..................
 However, ......simply possessing that knowledge doesn\'t mean I can refer to Father quite that informally.
 ......I\'d like to do my best......and make a start by calling him Battler‐san."
"I\'m surprised you haven\'t gotten discouraged after being treated so coldly."
"......Fath—
no,
 ......Battler‐san is in the middle of an important game right now.
 His opponent is the formidable Lady Erika, piece of the great Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}."
"......I stepped in at a delicate moment in his game, just as it was starting to reach the critical part,
 ......and called Battler‐san by that name he doesn\'t want to hear,
 ......so it\'s no surprise that he was in a bad mood..."
"....................."
Apparently, Beato still wanted to devote herself to Battler, even after being treated in such a cold manner.
Though to an outsider, it just looks as though she\'s being snubbed, ......it doesn\'t faze her at all.
It truly is the blindness of a girl in love......
"......Or is it that I can\'t {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} because I have no love?"
"At times, love can make the invisible {y:1:‘visible’}{n:1:visible}."
Beato once again immersed herself in the fragment book that told of her former self.
......She was trying to find something about the Beato that Battler desired.
Ange shrugged, as though saying "well, I don\'t get it".
{n}{f:5:Featherine} laughed when she saw this, and quipped that an "innocent young woman" could never understand.
{n}Ange grumbled something back unhappily.
Their interactions seemed to have no effect whatsoever on Beato as she sat in the shadows of the library......
After chasing all the others out, ......only Battler remained in the study.
There was no color in this dimly lit room.
However, ......for just the short time that the plate of cookies had been placed there,
 the room had seemed at least a little cheery...
Battler\'s gaze drifted over to the desk, ......which no longer had anything on it.
When he did, the cookie plate that had been there until a second ago was revived.
However, ......it was an illusion.
Though the cookies could be looked at, they could not be touched, much less eaten...
If Battler wished, he could make it possible to "touch them" or "eat them", ......but it would be an empty sensation.
It would only give the touch and taste that Battler desired.
......He no longer had any way of knowing...
...what kind of cookies they had actually been.
"..........................."
In a reception sofa facing Battler,
 ......a cloud of gold butterflies slowly gathered,
 ...and took the form of the old Beato.
"‘Come o~n, have a bite{p:0:☆} It\'s not every day that I\'ll make these by hand...!
 Have no fear, I\'m confident in how well they\'ve turned out.’"
"‘Pu ku ku ku!
 Hearing that from Milady makes them all the more dubious.’"
"......Seriously.
 ......Any cookies you made would obviously have some kind of strange poison in them."
"‘Shocking that you should think so.
 Even if I did put something in, it\'d be no worse than the kind that does this and maybe that to your you‐know‐what.
 Uhyahyahya!’"
"‘It\'s because you do that sort of thing all the time that Battler‐kun will never agree to eat them.’"
"‘Huh? Putting things in someone\'s food is pretty basic, isn\'t it?
 Fingernails, bits of hair, magic charms, fragments of love...ehe{0}he{0}he{0}he{0}he{0}he{0}heh!
 What would you people put in?’"
"‘Yes, ma\'aaam!!
 I wouldn\'t put anything in them! I\'d just eat them all myself!’"
"‘Obviously. Do you have to be so predictable?!!’"
"‘Well, they say a girl\'s gotta grab by all three sacks{p:0:☆} The first step is the stomach, right?
 Next comes the wallet...so what could the third one be?! *giggle*{p:0:☆}’"
"‘If I could catch a guy\'s attention, I\'d want to make him sacrifice his body, heart, and soul to me!
 That\'s why I pour all my power and affection into my cooking.’"
"‘Heheh, in any event, giving someone food that you\'ve cooked yourself is probably a frontal attack as old as time.’"
"‘Ridiculous.
 How pathetic to think that you require such tricks to grasp a man\'s heart.’"
"‘Ohh~?
 I\'d be very interested in hearing how much experience you have in grasping a man\'s heart, Onee‐sama!’"
"‘Battler, there\'s nothing weird in it, so have a bi~te.
 Don\'t think you\'ll ever get a chance to eat my handmade cookies again{p:0:☆}’"
.........There probably won\'t...be another chance.
I slowly stretched out my hand,
 ......out to the illusion of the cookie plate,
 ......and touched it.
Just before I did, it became a cloud of gold butterflies, ......and vanished into the darkness of the study.
The illusions of Ronove and {f:5:Virgilia} also disappeared.
{n}...However, the illusion of Beato alone still remained on the sofa.
"......Is there something that does not satisfy you?"
"............Are you really going to make me say it?"
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*.
 ......The more the new "me" differs from the form you wished for,
 ......the more you are reminded that I can never be revived again,
 ......correct?"
"..........................."
"*cackle*cackle*!
 If you let a good woman get away, you never get a second chance.
 So, only now, you\'ve finally realized what a good woman I wa~s."
"......Shut up.
 If you never appear again,
 ......that\'d be a relief."
"Hmph..............."
Beato lay sprawled on the sofa and looked up at the ceiling.
Battler also turned his back and moved to the window. ......For a while, there was silence.
"I think you understand, but......"
"......I do understand."
"The "me" you were expecting...has already disappeared."
"......I know.
 ......Even though that Beato is you without a doubt, ......she\'s a different being than the former you...
......and I can say with certainty......that you will never revive again..."
"My soul, femininity, sparkling personality, and splendid character were cultivated in a thousand years spent as a witch.
 Unless an exactly identical thousand years is traversed, it is impossible to become me.
 In short, ......from the very moment you decide to create me, my personal history will be different."
"Yeah.
 ............That damn {f:5:Bernkastel} has already guaranteed that you\'ll never revive..."
"However, you still hope for it, don\'t you?"
".............................."
"One day, the new "me" trips and lands on her head, and all her memories of the past are spectacularly restored!
 ......You\'re hoping for something like that, aren\'t you?
 Ahya{0}hya{0}hya{0}hya!
 A delusional plot like that wouldn\'t even pass in a light novel these days!"
"......Shut up.
 ......Don\'t pretend you didn\'t do the same.
 ......You waited and waited...
...for me to remember...
...and take notice..."
"..........................."
"........................"
Then, ......what?
Does this mean...
......that our relationship now...
...is exactly the opposite of how it once was......?
".........Hmph...
 ......Well, there was a time when I continued the game believing that you would eventually notice and remember,
 ......that a miracle would occur."
"..................How did it feel?
 ......When you were playing those games with me."
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*...
 As they say, look inside your own heart..."
"..........................."
......It\'s tough.
If only she didn\'t look so much like you, ......I wouldn\'t be so confused about how to feel about her.
"Well, do as you wish.
 In the past, I toyed with you and tormented you.
 .........Now\'s your chance for revenge against me.
 ......The new "me" will just wander about, ignorant of everything.
 You may boil or burn her as you see fit.
 Perhaps it will clear away an old hatred."
"............If she was you, I would.
 It\'d probably make me feel a lot better.
 ......But...
.........that Beato...
...isn\'t you."
"Who is she, then, if not me?"
"......Someone very like you,
 .........but a different person."
"However, there can be no doubt that she is also me."
".........Yeah.
 She is you,
 ......and at the same time,
 ...she\'s a different person."
"In that case, the new "me" is most unfortunate.
 She is being treated like a plaything in my place.
 ......*cackle*cackle*, how truly pitiable."
"...................................."
That might......be the contradiction inside me.
Because the new Beato seems like a different person, I can\'t accept her.
Even though I know she\'s a different person than Beato, ......she keeps reminding me of her.
"In that case,
 ......think of her as my daughter."
".........Your daughter.........?"
"Consider her a blood daughter of mine who closely resembles me.
 After all, she is my double, but hasn\'t lived a thousand years, so calling her that is not incongruous."
"......True..."
"Imagine that I have died, left behind a daughter, ......and entrusted her to you.
 That way, won\'t it become a little easier to think of how to deal with her?"
"That\'s actually a good analogy. ......It\'s unlike you."
"Do not jest.
 That is my daughter.
 She is the child I left behind after my death.
 .........You are free to press my likeness upon her.
 You may also let loose your pent‐up resentment on her in my place."
"......Making her bear my sins and torturing her as you please may allow you to give vent to your emotions.
 If that is not to your taste, you can also guide her down the right path so that she does not end up on the inhumane road that I have tread."
"......She was made to devote herself to you since the moment of her birth.
 If you wish, you can mold her into any shape you desire.
 .........With a miracle of a thousand years, she might even become me."
"......So, I could even strip her and drag her around with a chain, like you did to me once."
"*cackle*cackle*.
 Yes, at this point, even greater humiliation would be possible..."
".....................So she is both your double...
and...
your daughter,
 ......huh..."
Without a doubt, she is exactly the same person, the same piece, which was created once more by the rule called {f:5:Beatrice}.
However, when I can\'t accept it that way, .........I can interpret her as being Beato\'s daughter.
 ......This served as a clear guidepost on how to interact with her and smooth the uncertainty in my heart.
............And...
...finally...
......I could understand...
......how cruel I had been to her just now......
My tears poured to the ground, ......and when I followed them with my eyes...
{n}I noticed that a white card about the size of a business card had fallen onto the floor.
It was...
...the message card that had adorned those cookies.
I had rushed her, telling her to clean up and leave right away, which was probably why it had fallen to the floor unnoticed.
I picked it up,
 .........and read the message on it.
.........It was...
extremely short,
 ...pure,
 ......and sincere.
It brought tears to my eyes, ......so I was sure that I could read it.
......And yet,
 ......my eyes were so blurred with tears...
...that I couldn\'t...
......see anything.........
......The flood of light and sound slowly dissipated.
The silence that followed was not broken by any noise, not even the sound of the wind and rain outside that had been so clearly audible moments before.
Both Jessica...
...and George...
...timidly opened their eyes...
......Where in the world...
...was this......?
It was a strange room that they had never seen before.
It looked like a Western tea room.
......Its furnishings were stylish and expensive.
{n}It felt as though a dignified person must own this room.
Preparations for black tea were set on the table, ......and so was a chessboard, which seemed to be halfway through a game.
However, there was something strangely out of place.
The black and white checkerboard pattern made it feel like chess,
 ......but it looked like a very similar yet totally different game that no one knew of.
In the same way that it both looked like chess and not like chess...
...the furnishings of this room—no, the room as a whole—looked at first glance like a Western tea room...
...but also felt like something completely different...
".........J‐
...just where...
is this place......?"
"......Jessica‐chan and Kanon‐kun...
 ...............Shannon?
 Where\'s Shannon...?!"
"I\'m right here, George‐sama."
"And I am here.
 ......Milady, George‐sama.
 We apologize for bringing you to a place like this."
"......What on Earth is going on?
 ......You took out something that looked like a butterfly wing and it started shining, and then..."
"Th‐the same thing happened to me...!
 Kanon‐kun took out this golden butterfly brooch thing, it started to sparkle, and..."
"Milady, George‐san, first of all, please allow us to apologize.
 And please stay calm.
 ......Something strange is about to happen.
 That strange thing will probably test us."
"Test us......?
 ...Do you mean...
that trial you were just talking about...
...that we have to overcome if we want to be together?
 ......Is that it?"
"A......a trial?"
".........I haven\'t explained it to you yet, Milady.
 My apologies.
 .........But please,
 ...if your words just a second ago were the truth, ......please lend me your strength.
 I will......give it everything I\'ve got, so please......"
"......I...I\'m not getting any of this...
 Do you know something, George nii‐san?"
"A bit.
 .........I\'m just as surprised as you about what\'s happening now.
 But if they say that this is an unavoidable trial that\'s essential for us to go through, I intend to take on whatever may come."
"...............A trial......?"
"Kanon‐kun.
 The brooch."
"Yeah......"
The two of them brought the halves of the broken golden butterfly brooch closer to each other.
As they grew closer, the strength of their bright yellow radiance increased.
"......Jessica‐chan, I want you to brace yourself for this.
 I am already mentally prepared."
"Wh‐what are you talking about...?!
 I don\'t have a clue!
 What the hell\'s going on...?!"
"It\'s a trial.
 A test for a pair of lovers."
"H‐......huuh...?!"
George spoke those corny words without any hesitation.
It was such an embarrassing line that Jessica couldn\'t help turning red,
 ......but the expression on George\'s face, which was so serious that it was almost grim, forced her to tense up as well...
Shannon and Kanon were just as serious.
......With a glow in their eyes, as though they were taking part in a sacred duel, the pair of them brought the two gold butterfly wings together.
Then, the wings they held became a single brooch......and regained their magical power.
An even more intense light filled the room...
...and the scene was burnt into the retinas of all present...
...as the brooch shattered and two shining things flew out of it...
"People live for the sake of love!
 Yes, this world is love itself!"
"Oh, how great is the power of love...!
 Love is everything!!"
Suddenly, the voices of two people they had never heard before rang out.
What was this?
 Who were they...?
George and Jessica nervously opened their eyes......
When they did, they saw that two demons had appeared there,
 ......almost as though the brooch which had once been split in two had become them...
"Oh?! This is odd, Furfur...!!
 Why are we in a place like this?!"
"It really is strange, Zepar...!!
 There\'s no one but {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s and furniture!
 Where is the witch?
 Where is the witch capable of summoning us?!"
"Yes, we remember well the name of the witch of the contract, don\'t we?
 Why don\'t we try calling her, Furfur?!"
"Yes, you\'re right, Zepar!!
 We know the name of the witch of the contract, the Golden Witch!"
"Then let\'s try calling her name!"
"All together now..."
""{f:5:Beatriceeeeeeeeeeeeee}!!""
Given their manner, exaggerated like a theater play, and their slightly ridiculous style of talking,
 it would probably be hard to immediately comprehend the great power these demons possessed.
When the two demons called {f:5:Beatrice}\'s name, a cyclone of gold butterflies picked up throughout the room.
Then, it took the form of two Golden Witches...
"What\'s this?! There are two {f:5:Beatrice}s...!"
"Well, there are two of us as well.
 Why shouldn\'t there be two {f:5:Beatrice}s every now and then?"
"This is my double and my little sister.
 We two are the same and as a single person."
"P‐......pleased to meet you."
"It has been a long time, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama..."
"..........................."
"A‐......am I dreaming......?"
"......I feel the same.
 Still, it\'s too early to get dumbfounded."
Unlike Jessica, George had maintained his composure even during this bizarre scene.
......After all, Shannon had already told him what would happen next.
"Demons of the contract, it has been too long...!
 Zepar.
 And you too, Furfur."
"Ah, long time no see!
 You seem to be in high spirits as always!"
"But look at your cute little sister here!
 Those juicy eyes must have the taste of white peaches when they grow teary...!"
"Uh, ......ah, ...well, I wonder..."
Zepar and Furfur latched onto Beato from either side, wearing strange smiles.
Each movement they made was exaggerated yet polished,
 as though they were acting out a play.
"Leave it at that for now, demons of the contract.
 To think that tonight will be the last time we see that mischievous spirit.
 It will be dearly missed."
"The last time......?"
"The brooch, our vessel, has already been destroyed!"
"Eheheheheh, in other words, our role is now finished!
 Ah, yes, it has been fun, {f:5:Beatrice}!"
"However, it was decided when the contract was made.
 It was decided that we must lend our power one more time before our final farewell."
"So, this is truly the final miracle!"
"Once is enough for the miracle of love!
 After all, eternal love will never be needed a second time!"
"......There you have it.
 Lovers male and female!
 Gathered here are those cursed, absent a miracle, to unsuccessful love.
 The power of the golden butterfly brooch, which can grant such a miracle, is your last chance, and like it or not, this chance is limited to this evening!
 This miracle can be given only to a single pair!"
"..........................."
"......I won\'t lose."
"Yeah.
 ......Let\'s both give it our all."
Shannon and Kanon exchanged a serious gaze.
......Both had already readied themselves to fight for the sake of their love\'s success.
"I, I don\'t really get it,
 ...but I don\'t wanna borrow the power of some strange demon...!"
Jessica was finally starting to figure out the direction things were headed.
These demons......were probably planning to pit her and Kanon against George and Shannon.
"Let me be totally clear: we don\'t need your help!
 Kanon‐kun and I can handle our relationship by ourselves.
 I\'m not gonna be pressured into turning to some shady demons for help!"
"............Milady, please listen.
 ...If we don\'t overcome this trial,
 ......we cannot be together..."
"Jessica. Accept it.
 This is the only trial that can be imposed on upstart furniture wishing to be joined with a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}."
"More of this stuff about furniture and {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s!
 Yammer on about that all you want,
 it has nothing to do with us!!"
"You still haven\'t told Milady...?"
"......I didn\'t know...how I should explain it."
"Kanon‐kun, Shannon, and you, George nii‐san!
 Why are you listening to these creeps?!
 No one can stand in the way of a person\'s love!
 Why do we have to get approval from these demons?!
 It\'s none of their business!!"
"Well, it seems we have quite a troublesome blockhead among us.
 .........We could begin the game like this, but that would hardly be fair."
"C‐......couldn\'t you explain it for her?
 ...I don\'t understand that well myself.
 Is there some kind of problem with the love between Jessica‐san and Kanon‐san...?"
"Oh my!
 It seems you understand nothing at all!"
"With our blessing, the pair can cultivate their love at their leisure!
 No need to worry about suspicious demons!"
"However, without our blessing,
 your love will vanish, disappear, wither, and decay."
"How the hell\'re you so sure?!!"
""Because it is fate!!
 You may choose not to accept it, you may choose not to resist it!""
".........Oh, what happens if you choose not to resist it...?"
"That love will end.
 ......Well, an abstract explanation isn\'t so convincing.
 Well now, how could one explain the dead end fate you\'re in..."
"Ushiromiya Jessica, the future you two share is far more grim than you realize."
"If you don\'t gain the miracle of magic, disaster will most certainly befall you both."
"The infection within will fester...
and split the two of you apart.
 ......Even I will not be so boorish as to describe the details of that process.
 However, if you will not believe, Jessica, I will tell you how it ends.
 ......Kanon will stop being a servant and will leave the island.
 For all eternity."
"You will probably leave the island yourself in search of the one you love, but such a venture will doubtless be in vain!"
"Yes, and then you will mourn and hate!"
"Hate who?!"
"You!!"
"Me?!"
""No, the "you" of this moment!!""
With a dramatic gesture, the two of them pointed at Jessica.
......They were saying that, if she passed this by, it would be herself who would regret it later.
"Wh‐
......what the hell are you...
...saying......"
"When you have lost the one you love, you will realize...
how much you hate the person you were when you ran away from the trial to complete that love!"
"Yes, we\'re messengers from the "you" of the future!
 Please, at this very moment, take your love seriously and fight!"
"And if you don\'t listen to the message of the "you" from the future?!"
"The foolish snake eating its own tail will keep on gulping!"
"The endless cycle of suffering will swallow itself......and simply vanish."
"What the......hell are you talking about...?!!"
Jessica\'s confusion showed up on her face as anger.
......However, a memory of something she had heard a long time ago surfaced in the back of her mind.
......Unlike Nee‐san, I don\'t plan on working here for many years...
After just a few years, ......or possibly...
......If Nee‐san ever decides to stop working here, ......I think I\'ll stop working too.........
"Kanon......kun......"
"........................"
"If you give up on the miracle of magic and leave it to Shannon and George,
 ......they will be joined and leave the island.
 ......After that, Kanon will leave the island as well.
 That is an unavoidable fate."
"Th‐......then what if they can obtain the miracle of magic...?"
"Of course, Kanon will remain on the island, by Jessica\'s side for all time.
 ......He will probably be able to start learning music with Jessica as she wished for.
 ......How their relationship will progress afterwards is a matter for the two lovers.
 They may deepen their relationship slowly all by themselves, as Jessica wanted..."
"......However,
 ...if that happens, George‐san and I will not be joined."
".........For the sake of our own happiness and futures,
 ......we are fated to fight."
"A‐......are you kidding me...?!
 What the hell...?!
 So if we are joined, the other pair will split apart?!
 What kind of demon\'s game is this?!!"
"Don\'t be mistaken.
 You will not be taking something from each other.
 ......Without the power of the golden butterfly brooch, neither love is fated to bear fruit."
"A‐and who the hell decided that?!!"
"It is due to your sin of falling in love with furniture, which is not allowed to love.
 ......Didn\'t Kanon clearly reject you, saying that furniture was not qualified to love?!
 Knowing that, you chose Kanon as the one you loved.
 I won\'t let you get away with saying you didn\'t know...!"
"...............!"
Though she couldn\'t accept any of it, Jessica was unable to argue back.
Then, George spoke up with that soft tone that he always used to smooth things over.
......However, his expression was still ruthlessly serious.
"......Jessica‐chan,
 can\'t you think of it this way?"
"Think of it......what way...?"
"I love Shannon.
 I am prepared to overcome any and all trials and obstacles that stand in the way of us being together.
 .........What about you?"
"W‐well, yeah, ......one or two setbacks aren\'t gonna stop me, I\'m tougher than that..."
"Yes.
 That\'s what this is about.
 ......Right now, we are being tested.
 Tested to see who can display the strength of our feelings more strongly."
".........Are you actually......satisfied with this insanity...?"
"There\'s no need to be satisfied.
 ......When I gave Shannon that engagement ring, I swore to fight all trials and barriers that stand in my way.
 ......No matter how unreasonable or incomprehensible those trials might be,
 ......backing down is not an option."
George spoke clearly, ......then looked at Jessica with a cold gaze.
......By now, Jessica almost understood.
If she kept on grumbling and refusing this demons\' trial,
 ......the game between the two groups would automatically end with her defeat by default.
In other words, George and Shannon would win.
Then they would gain the miracle of magic, their love would be completed,
 .........and Jessica and Kanon would split apart,
 ......with Kanon eventually leaving the island and never seeing her again.
"......Personally,
 ......nothing would make me happier than you backing out of this trial.
 ......That way, I wouldn\'t have to fight you.
 And it would reveal just how little you actually feel for Kanon‐kun."
"Nn...............gah............"
It seemed as though George spoke ruthlessly, ......but he was actually being exceptionally fair.
If it came to a loss by default, Jessica would never be able to clear away her lingering regrets.
That would leave a bad aftertaste even for George.
"......We must fight fair and square for that single miracle.
 ......Even if I lose at the end,
 ......I\'ll be able to accept it if we both gave it our all.
 And because of that, I will be able to cheer on the victors from the bottom of my heart."
"............Hmph.
 ...George\'s determination is quite impressive."
"After hearing all that—"
"Are you still going to run away?"
The two demons giggled and challenged her.
Of course, George didn\'t laugh, but he too challenged her with cold eyes.
".........And Shannon......?"
"......Please forgive me, Milady.
 ......For the sake of being joined with George‐san, I am determined not to flinch in my resolve.
 .........Even if I know...
...that staying true to my heart...
...will mean the end of your loving relationship."
Shannon had never before spoken to Jessica with such serious and solemn words.
Jessica was surprised to realize just how strong the determination was that dwelt within her usually weak and clumsy friend.
"Kanon‐kun........."
"I......want to start a new life with you, Milady.
 ......Even if that life...
......means crushing Nee‐san\'s happiness...
......I will not falter now..."
Kanon was also doing all he could to be strong.
Yes.
All of them...
...were being serious and frank...
and abandoning any naivety they might have possessed.
All this about golden butterfly brooches and miracles of magic...
...and the trial that the demons were giving them—
none of it mattered.
Only one thing was being tested:
 whether or not they possessed the strong will to make their love come true.
Jessica clenched her fists, ......and hung her head, shaking, while biting her lower lip.
She was silent, but she would probably gain an unswerving will of steel before too long.
......She just needed a little time first.
The two demons who taunted people with dramatic gestures...
did not violate this silence that Jessica needed to resolve herself.
Love brings about conflict, and this conflict gives rise to determination.
As the demons of love, they could understand more fully than any others how noble that determination was...
".........Jessica‐san......"
"Furthermore, ......this magical miracle is something that can be received by you as well."
"By me too.........?
 Wh‐what......do you mean......?"
She had thought this had been about two pairs of lovers.
Beato was surprised to suddenly hear that this had something to do with her as well...
"With the miracle of the golden butterfly brooch,
 .........even your wish,
 ......that your affection for Battler will be acknowledged, can be granted easily.
 ......And without that miracle, you two will also...
............never be bound."
"..............."
"It means you\'re no outsider to this either."
"To cut across the marshes of love!
 That is your wish, is it not?!"
"We will not make light of your wish!"
"......Even your relationship with Battler will eventually fester and rot.
 ......Even you, with your optimistic attitude,
 ......must understand that this fate will eventually come to pass, barring some kind of miracle."
"...............Well........."
Beato hung her head sadly.
She wasn\'t about to let the cookie incident break her spirit.
......However, it would have been a massive lie to say that it hadn\'t hurt her...
The more she tried to get close to Battler, the more she hurt him.
However, she had been born in order to get close to Battler.
...She was like a hedgehog freezing in the cold and bunching together with others for warmth.
{n}She had approached him because of love, and had been hurt for it......
"If you understand that much, entrusting your fate to a miracle may prove to be of some interest.
 As they say, an unbought lottery ticket earns you nothing.
 Zepar, Furfur!
 Let my little sister join in too."
"Oh, of course!"
"Welcome, second {f:5:Beatrice}...!
 We were planning on including you from the very beginning!"
""After all, we are Zepar and Furfur!
 The demons of love!!""
"......I‐......is it alright if I......join in......?"
"If you want to, I don\'t see a problem.
 I won\'t prevent anyone from entering.
 We\'ll win against all hindrances and make everyone celebrate our union.
 ......Of course, it\'s the same the other way around.
 If you succeed in love by defeating us at our best,
 then both Shannon and I promise to sincerely support the pair that wins.
 Right, Shannon?"
"Yes.
 We will not lose.
 And even if we did, we would cheer you on from the bottom of our hearts."
"......I feel the same.
 I will not lose."
".........Well, if there\'s no way out of this fight,
 ......let\'s show \'em what we\'ve got.
 ......Neither I nor Kanon‐kun...
...have any intention of losing without a fight!"
"You feel the same, I assume?"
"Y‐......yes...
 ......If there is even a small chance that Father—
ah...
no...
......that Battler‐san will acknowledge me,
 I\'m willing to put myself on the line."
"Well said.
 Good going, little sister.
 Zepar, Furfur!
 The actors have gathered!"
"Then let\'s begin, Furfur!"
"Yes, let us begin, Zepar!"
""Let\'s begin this trial of lovers, the fight over a single miracle of magic...!!""Erika had returned to the room that had been given to her on the second floor of the guesthouse.
The next room over was empty.
 It was very quiet there...
Even pressing her ear against the wall wouldn\'t enable her to listen in on the voices in the cousins\' room.
Even with hearing power boosted by the detective\'s authority, it would probably be impossible to make out anything.
This room was the farthest down the hall, a long ways away from the cousins\' room......
"Last time, my room was right next to theirs.
 ......I see...so he\'s placed my room farther away this time."
"The powers of authority given to the Game Master permit this level of modification to the initial {f:5:arrangement}.
 It is, perhaps, a quite reasonable first {f:5:move}."
"Well, that suits me too.
 I have no desire to listen to those brats\' squeaky voices as they play cards."
".................."
This whole time, Erika had been sitting at the desk working at something.
{n}......She was preparing some of those duct tape seals from before.
She had asked Kumasawa for the stickiest tape available.
She drew a complicated, unforgeable signature on it with a permanent marker, then added slits through it.
By sticking this over a place that she wanted to prove had remained closed,
 she could create a powerful seal equal in strength to the red truth.
Those menacing seals had cornered Natsuhi so thoroughly in the previous game...
".........nn......
 ......Great..."
"Is something {f:5:wrong}?"
"......He got me.
 ......That Battler doesn\'t let anything get by him, does he?"
Erika shrugged and showed the piece of duct tape she had cut off to Dlanor.
By sight alone, Dlanor couldn\'t tell what had annoyed Erika.
{n}However, as soon as she held the tape, she realized the difference right away.
"......This won\'t be any {f:5:good}."
"Yes.
 It\'s barely sticky at all.
 This won\'t reach even close to the red truth."
Even duct tape can be of low quality, and it sometimes gets weaker with age.
The tape Kumasawa had found was a bit too weak even for normal use.
 It wasn\'t nearly sticky enough to be used as a detective\'s seal.
"It is possible to tear it off {f:5:cleanly}.
 This cannot serve as proof of a {f:5:seal}."
"......I guess Battler isn\'t as totally incompetent as I thought.
 He probably tampered with all the duct tape on the island using the authority of the Game Master."
Letting Erika get her hands on duct tape gave her a fatal weapon to use against witches.
 The previous game had proven this fact.
And so, Battler had removed that weapon from the entire mansion......
"Most likely,
 all possible substitutes for duct tape have also been tampered {f:5:with}."
"......Probably.
 Well, it isn\'t really so bad.
 At least this way, I won\'t have to look like a fool crawling all over the outer wall in the cold rain."
Erika tossed the duct tape aside and flopped spread‐eagled onto the bed...
"Well, detectives do have a penchant for puffing on a pipe while waiting calmly for a crime to occur.
 ......I doubt there\'ll be any part for you to play until the first twilight begins,
 so why not vanish off somewhere and take a smoking break?
 .........I imagine that looking at my face will do nothing more than tire you out."
"......I do not {f:5:smoke}.
 I am just a {f:5:kid}."
"Oh, really?
 ......I wish I could.
 ...Well, only if it really is as refreshing as smokers claim."
"......It seems...that you are not in high {f:5:spirits}."
".........Does it look that way?"
Erika answered lazily, still looking up at the ceiling.
{n}That in itself was half an answer...
The silence between the two was filled by the sound of the wind and rain.
It was so quiet...
...that it was hard not to listen to the ticking of the clock.
".........Lady {f:5:Erika}.
 May I ask a {f:5:question}?"
"Depends on what it is.
 Answer\'s probably <no> though."
"..........................."
"...............
 Well, we\'re just killing time anyway.
 What is it?"
Erika was probably bored as well.
{n}......Or maybe the sound of the rain was making her sentimental.
She assented, which was very unlike her.
"Why is it...
...that you hate {f:5:magic}?"
"......Oh,
 ......you mean that thing downstairs with Maria?"
"That was nothing more than a foolish trick to deceive {f:5:children}.
 Everyone knew {f:5:that}.
 ......Was it really necessary to go so far to destroy that {f:5:illusion}?
 ...I cannot {f:5:understand}."
It had been a childish fight.
 ......Erika didn\'t need Dlanor to tell her that.
"......Well, I am a self‐proclaimed intellectual rapist.
 I can\'t stand having magic confuse the truth."
"And so, you feel pleasure from exposing {f:5:that}?
 ......I sense a different {f:5:emotion}."
"A different emotion?
 .........What\'s that?"
"To me, it feels less like pleasure,
 ......and more like a different, negative {f:5:emotion}."
"Hah, ......you really are a murder doll, aren\'t you?
 Even your eyes are like knotholes."
".........My {f:5:apologies}.
 Please forgive {f:5:me}."
Erika rolled over grumpily, turning her back to Dlanor.
Because of this, Dlanor couldn\'t see her expression.
......Even so...
...for some reason, she could guess that this completely unobserved expression was one of pain...
Interpreting this to mean that Erika wanted her to go away,
 Dlanor gave a bow and made to leave.
Then, Erika suddenly spoke.
The words came so far out of the blue that Dlanor doubted her ears,
 and she had to ask Erika to say it again.
"......What did you just {f:5:say}?"
"I love you."
It really was......out of the blue.
Dlanor wanted to ascertain what Erika really meant,
 but the latter still had her back turned, and her face was out of sight...
"............Thank you very {f:5:much}."
"I was going out with another girl before, but I\'ve completely broken up with her.
 Others are gonna be jealous of us and say things that aren\'t true, but don\'t pay them any attention."
"................................."
"I\'m gonna devote my whole life to you, so I want you to do the same for me.
 Let\'s find happiness together."
Dlanor avoided asking what she was talking about and stood there in silence.
For a while, Erika kept on speaking in that dull and emotionless tone,
 repeating soppy phrases that might have popped up in some shoujo manga...
Then, unexpectedly, she once again followed up with a complete non sequitur.
".........A new wallet."
"..................?"
Of course, she had no idea what Erika was saying.
However, with her back still to Dlanor, ......Erika kept on saying disconnected words.
"A strange cat keychain.
 A different style of cologne.
 A music tape that\'s not his style...which he said he borrowed from an acting colleague.
 .........A colleague asked him to come and he couldn\'t turn him down.
 Work suddenly called him in.
 His buddy called him up and he couldn\'t get off the phone."
{e:090:He made too much curry.
{n}He started going to theater practice more often.
{n}He started folding paper towels differently.
{n}‘Thanks, I\'ve already eaten.’
{n}He knew more than before about cosmetics.
{n}‘Sorry, I was sleeping.’
{n}The toilet seat was left down.
{n}He spent the night over at his stage friends\' place.
{n}‘Me and my acting friends had a party here.
 Someone just left it behind.’
{n}The drain and sink were cleaned out.
{n}There were receipts and point cards from places he didn\'t usually go.}
{e:090:The muddy soles are evidence that you went out on Monday when it was raining.
{n}It matches the strange symbol on the calendar.
{n}None of your theater friends have hair this long.
{n}Leading questions.
{n}How do you know the plot of a movie you haven\'t seen yet?}
{e:090:Evidence,
 evidence,
 circumstantial evidence. Observation,
 surveillance,
 tracking,
 tailing. Information gathering,
 wiretapping,
 asking around,
 questioning.}
{e:090:I found plenty of evidence that I loved you.
{n}I found plenty of evidence that you loved me.
{n}But I can\'t find any evidence that you haven\'t been cheating on me.}
{e:090:Give it a rest.
 If you love me, then trust me.
 If you can\'t do that, then you don\'t love me anymore.
 How could I love someone like that?
 I\'ll treasure you for all my life, but I want to do well in theater just as much.
 You said you liked seeing me act, right?
 So why are you telling me to stop acting now?
 Why do I have to choose between you and acting?
 What\'s wrong with you? I\'m seriously tired of this, alright?
 Look, if all we do is fight when we see each other, maybe we both need some time to cool off, okay?
 I need to concentrate for my next performance anyway.
 One of my colleagues,
 she\'s suddenly told us she won\'t be able to perform.
 I need to rewrite the script by tomorrow.
 I don\'t have the time for this.}
{e:090:You know what, if you really find it that hard to trust me, we\'re through.
 Don\'t bother coming over again,
 just go home,
 I don\'t love you anymore.
 Stop crying, God you\'re obnoxious,
 go kill yourself, you creep.
 Stop shouting, dammit, I\'ve got neighbors.
 Just get the hell away from me and never come back.}
"......Without love, it cannot be {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen}?
 ............Hah.
 That\'s backwards."
"...................................."
"Because of love,
 you end up {y:1:‘seeing’}{n:1:seeing} things that don\'t even exist."
......It\'s nothing more than an illusion, one that no one except you can {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see}, and one that even you can never touch.
Without love, {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s would never need to {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} that fiction.
Because we can {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} it, ......we doubt.
 We suffer.
 We cry out loud.
".........Right now, I am happy.
 .........Though it may be temporary, I have become the Witch of Truth.
 ......As I am now,
 ......I no longer need to worry about being tormented by non‐red words."
"..........................."
"..............................
 ......What about you? How would you have countered my endgame?"
"How would...{f:5:I}?"
"That useless man wasn\'t fit to be my opponent.
 ......I was wondering how you would have countered it?"
"...................................."
Dlanor was suddenly thrust into the position of Erika\'s opponent in the witch\'s game she had once challenged that man with.
Dlanor shared in the fragments of Erika\'s past, allowing her to grasp the full situation.
The board was reproduced in full inside their heads...
The situation...was one‐sided.
Erika\'s side had constructed a blue truth based on countless bits of circumstantial evidence, had turned all of those into pieces,
 and was already cornering the opponent.
For some time, Dlanor thought in silence...
...and announced her by‐the‐book response.
"First {f:5:move}.
 ......
I request that you submit evidence that I have been {f:5:cheating}."
"Counter with the blue truth.
 I present eighty‐four points of circumstantial and physical evidence."
"Counter with the blue {f:5:truth}.
 I present six points of circumstantial and physical evidence that I still love {f:5:you}."
"<Good>.
 Blue and blue cancel each other out, but the number of pieces used to construct each is overwhelmingly unbalanced."
When both opponents meet with the blue truth,
 the decision is almost always based on which side has more pieces of evidence, regardless of the actual circumstances.
 ......This is especially true in the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} world.
So, by the standard rules, Erika would win...
"First point to me.
 Your next move?"
"............I will attempt to switch offense and {f:5:defense}.
 I ask that you, Lady {f:5:Erika}, provide proof that you are not {f:5:cheating}."
"Perpetual check.
 That\'s a forbidden move, since it\'d result in an endless repetition of the same question going both ways."
"Then I frankly declare that, despite a lack of proof, I still love you even {f:5:now}."
"Not red truth and therefore invalid.
 Even if it was red, that\'d be a stalemate.
 After all, I\'d have no move to counter with."
".............................."
Dlanor remained silent for a while.
She responded quietly to Erika\'s moves...
...as Erika drew closer and closer to checkmate.
A stalemate is a forbidden move in the game of witches, since it means the ruin of the game.
However, in chess, it also represents a draw.
Because of this, it is a splendid final move that the weaker player can pull off if they are already unable to win outright.
In this situation, Erika clearly had the advantage.
......It was natural that Dlanor, her opponent, would seek a stalemate to obtain a draw.
However, that only worked in chess.
{n}......In the game where witches fought over the truth, it was a forbidden move.
So, it was already checkmate from the very beginning.
{n}Dlanor had no way to turn the game around...
But that meant that regardless of what the real truth had been,
 ............this game would...
...............
"......Any other moves?
 O witch‐hunting archbishop, protector of the truth?"
".........{f:5:No}.
 ......I {f:5:resign}."
"See? There you go.
 ..................Hmph..."
Erika had succeeded in crushing her opponent with the truth she espoused...
...that her former boyfriend no longer loved her and was cheating on her.
Her opponent had no way to argue back.
.........After all, {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s are not allowed to use {m:-5:――}{m:-5:――}.
A splendid game, a splendid finish from a superior position.
{n}Regardless of the truth of her opponent, Erika could win.
{n}A splendid......victory.
Dlanor could only respond with silence.
And with that, Erika spoke no more.
{n}......She was probably done talking and wanted Dlanor to leave.
Dlanor understood this, but even so,
 .........she wanted to tell Erika just one thing before leaving.
"A splendid game, Lady {f:5:Erika}."
"It\'s only natural that the detective wins."
"Even before you became Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}\'s piece, you truly were a splendid wielder of the blue {f:5:truth}.
 .........However, Lady {f:5:Erika}.
 {y:0:Human}{n:0:Human}s are only allowed to use the blue {f:5:truth}.
 And the only thing that can counter blue truth is red {f:5:truth}.
 And {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s are not allowed to use the red {f:5:truth}."
"............In that case,
 ...how should your opponent have shown his {f:5:truth}?"
".........Who knows.
 ......Maybe he should have used that gold truth or whatever, which is supposed to be stronger than the red truth at times."
"...........................
 ......You certainly were the victor in that {f:5:game}.
 However, allow me to say this as a protector of the {f:5:truth}."
"What?
 ......I imagine it\'s something unpleasant, so say it and go away."
"......{f:5:Yes}.
 .........Our game did end with your {f:5:victory}.
 However,
 ......you still have not denied the six points of blue truth evidence that I showed to claim that I still loved {f:5:you}.
 ......Even you are {f:5:{y:0:Human}{n:0:human}}.
 You are unable to use the red truth that would disprove those {f:5:points}."
"Later on, I used the detective\'s authority to have all eighty‐four points transformed into red truth.
 By the power of my master...!
 I am {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}, yet superior to {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s.
 A detective and a witch.
 I am the Witch of Truth, Furudo {f:5:Erika}.
 Any other questions? Parting remarks?"
".........I have {f:5:none}.
 ......In that case, please excuse {f:5:me}."
Dlanor bowed and disappeared.
......After that, all that remained was a single Witch of Truth laughing off a bitter past...
with an equally bitter smile...
Erika glanced at the bedside clock and saw that it was almost exactly midnight.
"......Well, I suppose I should get a little sleep.
 The curtain has finally risen on the second day, October 5th.
 ......I wonder if the first of this game\'s murders is happening somewhere about now.
 I hope our victims leave us some interesting dying messages this time.
 Ehheh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eeh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eheh...!"
"Why didn\'t you discuss this with your mother?!!
 This is about the partner who\'s supposed to support you throughout the rest of your life!!"
"That\'s right.
 She\'s the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with."
"And that\'s why you need to choose very carefully, right?!
 How can you be so rash?!!"
Eva and George could be seen beneath the eaves of the guesthouse.
George had revealed his engagement with Shannon.
......Eva\'s anger had exploded almost instantly.
This had been no more than George had expected, so he had responded with an ice‐cold calm...
".........Don\'t tell me you consummated your relationship already.
 She told you she was pregnant to force you into a marriage, didn\'t she?!"
"How rude.
 I\'m a strong believer that chastity is to be preserved before marriage."
"Then why an engagement?!"
"I asked her.
 She accepted.
 What more could be needed?"
"No, it\'s all wrong!!
 Marriage isn\'t as easy as it looks in manga or whatever you\'re thinking of!!"
"What about her parents?
 Relationships between the two families?
 You\'re not some stray alley cat! You are Ushiromiya George!!
 How could you be so rash now, when you might even be selected as Grandfather\'s successor?!!
 Why didn\'t you consult me...?!!"
"I\'m consulting you right now.
 No, not consulting, I suppose.
 I\'m just informing you.
 ......I\'ve never pinned my hopes on being selected as Grandfather\'s successor.
 In fact, I\'d rather refuse if it did come to that.
 I want to build up my own country and castle from scratch, just like Father did."
"L‐look...!!
 Do you realize how hard your father worked to get where he is?!
 That\'s not something you could duplicate just by imitating him!!
 Do you have any idea how often he was saved by luck and coincidence?!!"
"And he got through it because he had you, his wonderful life partner, by his side.
 Sayo is the kind of person who\'ll support me and transform me into an even stronger man.
 ......You\'ve praised me for becoming the adult that I am, but that could never have happened without her."
"Huh...?!!!
 Listen, George!
 Just let your mother handle this for now.
 Cool your head and think very carefully!
 Shannon‐chan isn\'t the only person interested in you, you know...?!
 The girl you had that marriage meeting with, Ayumi‐san, really took a liking to you!!"
"That\'s the first I\'ve heard of it."
"I thought you knew...!!
 Her parents were also very impressed by you!!
 If you really dream to build your own castle like your father, Ayumi‐san is the one who\'d really be able to help you, right?!
 Do you intend to betray her feelings?!"
"......There\'s nothing to betray.
 There was never any special relationship between Ayumi‐san and me.
 We just had a marriage meeting and our parents got all fired up afterwards.
 You made us go out together several times, but we never even looked each other in the eye."
"Ayumi‐san is a well‐bred, modest woman!!
 She just couldn\'t look at you because you\'re a man and it would be embarrassing and ill‐mannered...!!
 If you can\'t feel anything from her unless she looks at you when she talks, I\'ll advise her of that.
 I\'m sure she\'ll look at you from now on...!!"
"You want me to marry Ayumi‐san because it will benefit you.
 ......You aren\'t pushing that engagement for the sake of anyone but yourself...!"
"George!!
 How can you say that?!!
 Have I ever failed to think about what\'s best for you?!"
"I haven\'t, have I?!
 How is the ‘parent’ ({p:0:親}) kanji written?!
 It\'s {nobr:‘stand’ ({p:0:立})} on top of a {nobr:‘tree’ ({p:0:木})} and {nobr:‘look’ ({p:0:見})!}"
"That\'s what we\'ve been doing, surveying your entire future from a height far greater than you have access to!!
 And from our vantage point, we can see that you\'re letting your momentary youthful emotions lead you down the wrong path!!
 That\'s why I\'m saying what I am even though I know you\'ll hate me for it!!"
"If I didn\'t care for you, we wouldn\'t be having this fight!
 I\'d just tell you to marry whatever strange girl you like and leave you be...!"
"You hear me, George?
 Leave this to your mother.
 There\'s no need for you to meet with Shannon‐chan anymore.
 We\'ll take care of everything for you."
"......Don\'t worry, we won\'t have Shannon‐chan mistreated.
 After all, it\'s thanks to her that you\'ve grown so much, right...?
 We\'ll take that into account.
 So leave the rest to us......
 George............"
"......................................."
Sometime during Eva\'s rage, tears had started to drip from her eyes.
As though those tears had caused him to hesitate, ......George turned his back and sagged his shoulders...
George was, after all, only a child of man...
......Though he understood that marriage required nothing more than the consent of both people,
 .........he couldn\'t get over his desire for his parents\' acceptance...
And so, he was torn between the tears of the mother who had always helped him and the fiancée he had chosen.........
...
or was he...?
".........I think it\'s......time.
 It\'s time, now."
"Huh............?"
"All my life,
 you\'ve done a great job raising me, and I\'m truly grateful for that.
 When I have children and become a parent,
 ......I\'ll become a parent like you.
 I\'ll be the kind of parent most worthy of respect in the entire world, one who can truly fight for his children\'s sake."
"George............"
With his back still towards her,
 ......George threw away his umbrella,
 ......and slowly stepped out from beneath the eaves into the rain.
Then, ......he slowly turned around.
It was, without a doubt, the familiar face of Eva\'s beloved son.
......However, he stood there now as his own man,
 self‐controlled and independent enough that the blood connection between them might even be forgotten.
"I think it\'s about time, now."
"......For......what...?"
"For you to let go......
of your son, Mother."
".........Geo—"
"Let\'s talk the rest of this out as people, not as mother and son.
 I am George.
 You are Eva.
 Let\'s drop the "because I\'m your parent" routine, speak for ourselves, and say what we really mean."
".........The reason you want to choose the person I marry......is for financial reasons, public appearances,
 ......and so that you can posture in that still continuing quarrel between you and your siblings.
 ......You have no other reason."
"..........................."
"You\'d do well to just come clean and admit it now.
 ......I\'m going to start speaking on my own behalf.
 I suggest you do the same.
 ...............You\'ll lose, I\'m warning you."
George\'s eyes...
...no longer contained any trace of his love and respect for his mother.
There was only a frigid glare as he gazed ruthlessly down at the witch who was trying to bind his future.
"......George,
 ......why...
...are you looking at your mother like that......?"
"Because I\'m not looking at my mother right now.
 ......All I see is a wall, a trial standing in the way of the future I\'m trying to grasp.
 ......You\'re your own person too.
 I know that you have dreams and ambitions, and that you\'re still chasing after those.
 And I think that\'s a wonderful thing.
 ......We also know how hard it is for a person to chase their dreams without giving up."
I need to inherit your wonderful strength.
I\'ve learned a lot from my parents, my friends, and Sayo...and I\'ve grown.
"And that final, finished product,
 after everything I learned and acquired,
 ......is the real Ushiromiya George!
 Now I\'ll overcome the final barrier—you!!"
"..................!!!"
".........What...?"
Eva had disappeared.
{n}The pouring rain landed evenly across the ground everywhere.
No, ......it was blocked very slightly in one place.
{n}However, there was no one there.
......Standing on the ground isn\'t the only way to block the path of the rain.
Then,
 ...........could it be.........
"............!!"
"Alright then... Sometimes it\'s good to be brutally honest!
 I\'ll speak my mind.
 So why don\'t you just lay it out there forever?!
 Ahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haa{0}ha{0}hah!!"
In the rain‐filled sky, with the moon that shouldn\'t have been visible behind her,
 ......was the Golden Witch of the future who had finally obtained everything of the Ushiromiya family.
Even the drastic change in his mother\'s appearance didn\'t faze George.
On the contrary, he seemed to be moved by her boldness.
Because his mother had honestly and truly displayed...
...her true nature.
Now, ......I can confidently show her...
my true self...
"Here we go, Mother.
 Here we go......Eva.
 This is my first step......towards escaping from your shackles...!"
"First steeeeeeep...?!?!"
With that first step, he felt something odd beneath his feet.
He knew that this sticky sensation, which didn\'t quite feel like mud, represented his mother\'s arrogance trying to prevent him from making that first step.
"I used to read to you all the time when you were little, didn\'t I?
 Do you remember your favorite story, "Journey to the West"?"
".........That takes me back.
 That\'s probably the first fantasy I really loved."
Sun Wukong, the Monkey King, wanted to become a god and was tested by the Buddha.
The Buddha told him, "If you can jump free from the palm of my hand, I will grant you your wish."
Then, Sun Wukong managed to reach what he thought was the end of the world, and found five pillars standing there......
only to discover that they were the Buddha\'s fingers, and that he still hadn\'t left the Buddha\'s hand.
"......Are you saying that\'s what my first step is like...?"
"Ehhehehhahahahahaahahaha!!
 Your resistance, your conflict, your anguish and self‐restraint and everything else!!
 All of it is a road I once traveled down...!
 This first step of yours would be overwhelmed by my life!!
 How long are you gonna turn a blind eye to it?
 Why not look?!
 At what you\'re standing on!!!"
On the pitch‐black earth soaked by the pounding rain...
...there were what appeared to be...
...ominously glowing bands of faint red, ......and George had placed his first step directly on top of one.
It was deep and viscous, and it held George\'s foot in place.
From Eva\'s perspective as she looked down from the sky,
 ......it looked like a vast red spiderweb that radiated out with George at the center.
".........That\'s right.
 This is me.
 This is me, tied down by a life of constant instruction...
...and raised solely for the sake of your ambitions."
"No, you\'re wrong about that.
 Let me make it so that you can understand.
 I\'ll show you.
 And then, you\'ll realize the truth forever!!
 Ahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hyah{0}haaah!!!"
The vast, red spiderweb on the ground scooped up George as easily as scooping scum out of a pot.
Then, it lifted him into the air like a deer caught in a net and swung him about.
{f:5:Eva}\'s insane laugh was as innocent as a grade schooler happily swinging about a bag filled with her gym clothes...
...and cruel in equal measure.
"...Gah...............gwooh.........kkhh...!!"
"*giggle*giggle*!!
 Come on, try to remember, okay?
 What happened on Tuesdays...?!!"
"Gyahh!!
 Guh, ......gggh............
 ......Of course I remember.
 ......That was piano lessons.
 I still cringe whenever I hear "I Stepped on the Cat"."
"You did violin in kindergarten.
 That\'s the sort of instrument you\'d expect smart kids to play, right?
 But you didn\'t seem to have the talent.
 So we switched you over to piano!!"
"Then, do you remember Wednesdays?!"
"I, .........I remember.
 That was the day for cram school.
 It was so far away, and a real pain to have to travel to..."
"And Thursdays?
 Ahhahahahahaahahahha!!!"
"Supplemental lessons.
 You were just terrible at subjects with memorization, weren\'t you?
 You could apply your knowledge but were horrible at learning by rote, a classic "he can do it if he tries" kid!"
".........That one stung.
 Those are the most annoying words a kid can hear at a parent‐teacher conference."
"‘You can lead a horse to water, but you can\'t make it drink.’"
"That\'s a British proverb, isn\'t it?"
"Making you motivated and keeping you that way...
was the hardest thing to do{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}oo!!!"
"Gah,
 ............gwah,
 gghhh...!!"
George was bound hand and foot by the bright red spiderweb, reduced to the witch\'s plaything...
She would innocently swing him around, then smash him about, all with an insane laugh.
 Again and again.
"Do you remember Friday?!"
".........Of course.
 As far as after‐school lessons go, that one was pretty unique.
 Having a parent present while I studied was a trying experience in multiple ways."
"‘Don\'t buy your child a fishing rod; go fishing with him.’"
"You do like a British education, don\'t you, Mother?
 .........Agh!!!"
"Those lessons were a pain for us parents too!!
 But for you, that was the most effective one!
 The monthly fee was high, and it was a pain to have to spend Friday nights there every week!!
 But it was the most effective!
 That\'s when I realized!!
 Kids don\'t grow unless their parents watch over them!!
 If children are sprouts, then parents are the sun!
 No plants will bud, and no flowers will bloom without the sun!!"
Still bound hand and foot, George was thrown, slammed, and smashed.
He could do nothing...
{n}He was still like Sun Wukong, unable to leave the palm of his mother\'s hand.
However, since he wouldn\'t surrender, he could still show resistance at any time...
"Then what about Saturday?! What about Saturday?!"
"......That\'s when the tutor came."
"He came to our house, which made it much easier, right?!"
"......It was painful to have to invite some other person into my own room, my sacred space, every single week.
 ......I hated the sweaty smell he left behind so much that I can still remember it."
"He was a wonderful teacher who drilled a scholarly attitude into you!
 His monthly fees were on par with a lawyer\'s consultation fee, and it was well worth it!!"
".........And then came Sunday, followed by Monday when I didn\'t have any extra school—the only two days when I could have some rest.
 .........How ironic.
 So it was those extra classes from Tuesday until Saturday that were holding me down all this time.
 ......I really was just like Sun Wukong."
"*cackle*cackle*!!
 Yeah, if you think you can escape from the palm of my hand, you can have that arrogance crushed by the Buddha\'s five mountains!!"
Sun Wukong, who wanted to become a god,
 was crushed by the five mountains of fire, water, wood, metal, and earth, and sealed away. These are the five elements that the days of the week, Tuesday through Saturday, are named after in Japanese.
Only now did George, who had always admired Sun Wukong, recognize this greatest of ironies.
"Just like Sun Wukong, you need some reflection and punishment for your arrogance.
 If you show that you\'re willing to reform yourself, I\'ll release you."
"That\'s not being released, it\'s brainwashing.
 ..................Ugh!!"
"There\'s no need to think about anything!
 Why not just leave everything to Mama forever?!
 I\'ll decide everything for you.
 That\'s the best kind of life for you!!"
"I\'ll arrange the most intellectual and selfless woman in the world for you!!
 I\'ll prepare your every success and even pave the way there!!
 And eventually, you will be chosen for the highest honor in the Ushiromiya family, the position as successor to the head!!
 {i:That\'s} when you can think about beginning life for yourself...!"
"A first step?
 Don\'t make me laugh. You still haven\'t even been born yet!!
 This isn\'t my web that you\'re caught in.
 ......You\'re inside my caring, nurturing wo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}omb!!!"
George was slammed against the ground over and over.
......It was heartless cruelty unlike anything one would expect a blood‐related son to receive.
However, ......in Eva\'s eyes,
 ......perhaps even this was a sign of love for her precious son...
The human‐shaped lump of flesh ensnared in the red net was slammed over and over, then thrown high into the air,
 ......where it was caught by a massive spiderweb suspended in the sky.
George hung there pitifully as though crucified, still covered in fresh blood and not even twitching...
Even if there had been some power to resist remaining to him,
 ......the red web holding him there would have held even that in check...
The rain, which had been falling non‐stop since the beginning, quietly tormented and pitied him...
".........Cool your head while you\'re sealed by the five mountains.
 ......I\'m not telling you to stop because I think Shannon‐chan\'s a bad kid, okay...?
 She\'s a great girl, the one who gave you the chance you needed to grow up."
"......But an ill‐considered engagement is a whole different matter.
 It isn\'t because there\'s a problem with her.
 Understand that..."
"......‘Don\'t criticize the friend.
 Criticize the behavior’...
......right?
 ......That\'s another piece of British advice."
".........I really did raise you to be a smart kid.
 ......No, I still am raising you.
 .........Inside my belly, that is...
 You just need to be nurtured a little longer.
 Okay, that\'s enough punishment, so apologize to your mother."
The spiderweb released George reluctantly.
Then, it threw him to the ground beneath the cloudy sky...
"Thank you, .........Mother."
"........................"
It was all George could do to get up on his hands and knees.
......Though he wiped the mud away and stood his ground, he still couldn\'t raise his head...
".........Everything you\'ve done so far,
 ......you\'ve done...
...for me, haven\'t you......?
 ......Thank you...
 .........Thanks for everything......"
"That\'s right.
 ......You must hate me right now.
 But one day, you\'ll be grateful.
 I\'m sure you\'ll understand how much I loved you."
"All those restrictive extra classes from Tuesday to Saturday...
......were your sincere efforts to raise me to be a great man......"
".........That\'s another British phrase.
 "To wrap a child in blessings is the greatest education of all.""
"...Thank you.
 ......I\'ll give you a British saying in return."
"What\'s that...?"
"‘Take one chop at every tree,
 and none of them will fall.’"
".........Hmm?
 ...And.........what does that mean......?"
"Maybe this one is clearer.
 ......‘To spend too much time in studies is sloth.’
 .........Francis Bacon."
The man drenched in mud and fresh blood...
...straightened his crooked glasses,
 ......and slowly stood up.
Though he was covered in filth, his appearance had a divine quality to it,
 ......something that could only appear on a self‐controlled man, not one who had merely been dozing in his mother\'s amniotic fluid.
"I cannot count the number of things I\'ve learned from Sayo.
 ......She taught me...
courage and chivalry, how to be ambitious and witty and humorous, and just a little stylish.
 It\'s ironic.
 ......Almost all of the things you say are so wonderful about me...
...didn\'t come from you at all."
"G‐
.........George......
......you\'re.........still...
...going on about...?!!
 Time to get back in Mother\'s womb!!
 I\'ll nurture you in a sea of warmth once more!!!"
As {f:5:Eva} howled, another bright red spiderweb appeared at George\'s feet and tried to scoop him up into the air again.
However, that instant...
...a powerful magic circle could be seen in the area surrounding George for just a moment.
Faster than he could be scooped up by the spiderweb, George jumped,
 and with a sharp kick of the heel and a magnificent forward flip, ......he cut the shackles of that spiderweb apart.
"............Wha......?!?!"
That smooth movement proved that he had possessed the power to escape from those shackles all along.
He had willingly allowed himself to be bound by that web.
"......Everything I owe you for what you\'ve done,
 ......I\'ve paid back now with pain.
 ......Now I can finally leave the nest for good.
 It really is necessary, isn\'t it?
 .........To have the occasional argument with one\'s parents."
"George, ......wh‐why would you disobey me so completely......for that stupid girl?!?!"
"It looks like it really is you...
who needs to let go, Mother.
 ............So, if you\'re ready...?"
"R‐ready for what?!"
"‘If you\'re ready...
may I fight back?’"
The curtain of spiderwebs that {f:5:Eva} shot out in defense were all too slow.
George weaved through them in that instant, and the next, he was right before her eyes...
".........Ahh, aaaaaaaarrggghhh!!"
{f:5:Eva} jumped out of the way of a kick that would have knocked her feet out from under her,
 ......then blocked the second half of George\'s double roundhouse with a high kick of her own.
"I guess there is one extracurricular activity I can thank you for."
"O‐...oh, and what day of the week was that......?!"
"It\'s all the martial arts classes you made me attend whenever I had a long break from school...!"
"...Ha, ......kyahhahahahaha!!
 I\'m glad, George, to hear you\'re grateful for at least one thing!!
 Your mother is happy!!
 Kyah{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}a{0}aah!!!"
 {f:5:Eva}\'s swift feet flashed like lightning.
Low,
 low,
 low,
 mid‐level attack.
As George\'s head fell forward, she caught it in both hands as though she was about to smash it against the ground.
It was then met with {f:5:Eva}\'s knee as it rose like a bolt of lightning from the earth.
"You should have learned Muay Thai too!
 It would have been more fun to have learned it with you!!"
"......You\'re right.
 I had the most fun when I was learning martial arts with you."
"Then now is the most fun!!
 Isn\'t this fun, George?! Isn\'t it?!!!"
"Do you find it fun, Mother?
 ......To play with your son like this?"
"Yes, I do!!
 You are my darling son, and I\'ll give you lots and lots of love inside my belly!!
 I even love the way you kick inside me!!"
"Got it.
 But this kick\'s coming from the outside of your belly."
George buried his knee sharply into {f:5:Eva}\'s abdomen.
An instant before she felt the pain of that fierce attack, {f:5:Eva} watched her son\'s kick with a proud smile......and then she vomited.
"Ghuurk!!!
 Gghh, ............gguurk!!"
"You\'re getting on in years, Mother.
 ......Maybe it\'s about time you held back on wearing childish clothes like that."
"G‐.........Geeeeeoooooooorge......!!!"
Her chin still covered in vomit, {f:5:Eva} looked up at George in twisted anguish.
She could see how pathetic her face was by her reflection in his glasses.
"Both you and I...
...need to leave our childhood days behind.
 So long, Mother."
The violent lightning and rain...
...made time freeze.
George\'s beautiful kick...
......had stopped an inch from Eva\'s chest.
However, the power of the red magic circle surrounding George...
...had already pierced {f:5:Eva}\'s body.
Though he had stopped without hitting her,
 .........blood poured out of {f:5:Eva}\'s back.
No wound had been left on her chest,
 ......but the heart inside it had been struck through......
{f:5:Eva} slumped backwards...
......and landed in a puddle with a splash.
There were no convulsions.
......Her life had been ended without leaving her even an instant to writhe about in pain...
"......I know you\'re somewhere over there.
 Gaap."
As he straightened his glasses, ......George spoke to the rose thicket behind him.
Then, a pitch‐black hole opened in the air there, ......and Gaap jumped out.
".........Impressive.
 ......Even considering that it was before her ascension, you managed to defeat {f:5:Eva Beatrice}."
"I thought you were there.
 ......Thanks for not interfering.
 I\'m glad we were able to keep it between mother and son."
"Don\'t thank me.
 I wasn\'t here.
 ............You summoned me just now."
"It doesn\'t matter either way.
 ......I have something to ask of you."
"Do I have some duty to listen?"
"...............Will you not do this for me...?"
With his back still facing her, ......George reset his glasses.
{n}The threat in his voice held the solemn presence of a king who ruled over demons.
His majesty made Gaap gulp,
 and she licked her lips before bowing respectfully to his back.
"I like studs,
 but I like monarchs even more.
 ......Your wish is my command, Your Demonic Majesty."
"......I want you to lay her body to rest in a place fitting for a woman who admired the head of the Ushiromiya family, and who lived her life with the misguided dreams of that position."
"So, in Kinzo\'s study?"
"No, .........
 ......The VIP room would be good.
 That never‐opened VIP room on the second floor of the mansion."
"............Ah, that room.
 As you wish, Your Majesty."
Gaap approached {f:5:Eva}\'s corpse and lightly tapped the ground with her right heel.
When she did, a large hole opened up, swallowed both Gaap and the corpse, and closed.
After a while, a small hole opened in the air,
 and the staff {f:5:Eva} always carried, which was marked with the One‐winged Eagle that symbolized the head of the Ushiromiya family, was spat out into a puddle...
Because the corpse would no longer have any use for it.
"...................................."
George slowly approached that staff,
 .........and stepped down hard on the tip.
When he did, the staff spun violently into the air,
 .........and after passing by the blue moon which honored the demon king,
 it flew into George\'s outstretched hand.
The instant he grasped it...
...another fierce bolt of lightning struck nearby,
 ............and by the time the flash faded, the staff he was holding had become a spray of gold butterflies......and disappeared.
It was as though George had held the staff up to the heavens and crushed it out of existence...
"And now, .........I\'ve finished my part.
 ......I\'ll let someone else have a turn."
"......I...
...I can\'t believe...
...you killed your own mother......"
"............It\'s the person who loves you first in the world,
 ......and the last one you have to separate yourself from.
 ......That\'s what it means to leave your home.
 This is the courage I am capable of showing to take Sayo as my wife."
"George‐sama........."
".................."
"Bravo, Ushiromiya George.
 An excellent start."
"......Even though it was just within the game,
 ...even though she was just a piece,
 ......I didn\'t like having to kill my mother.
 .........However, that was the trial you set me, so I saw it through."
He stared at the two demons.
The demons looked at each other, then showed their surprise with their now‐familiar exaggerated gestures.
"Wonderful!!
 Wasn\'t that splendid, Zepar?!"
"Indeed it was, Furfur!
 George‐kun\'s determination is the real deal!
 It seems I\'ve misjudged you!
 Please accept my apologies!"
George chose not to go along with this almost theatrical conversation.
He just quietly looked down upon the game board,
 .........found the piece representing his mother, which was right next to his,
 ......and tipped it over.
......This was the trial that Zepar and Furfur had set them.
"For the love of each other, take the life of another".
It was similar to the game within Beato\'s fourth game,
 where they were each given three options as part of a test to select the next family head.
However, a pair of lovers would never abandon each other\'s lives.
So, they were automatically left with just the option of sacrificing the life of another instead.
......In fact,
 it was merciful that the demons hadn\'t ordered them to take the lives of {i:everyone} other than themselves.
And besides, it only meant taking those lives as pieces on the board.
For the versions of themselves to whom the game board was the only world, this was a tragic parricide,
 ......but for these ones who sat around the game board in this witch\'s tea room,
 ......it was nothing more than a movement of the pieces, representing George\'s will to overcome his parents.
However, even if it was just a single life within one of an infinite number of fragment worlds,
 ......the fact remained that the demons had forced him to take it...
George appeared to have distanced himself from the events on the demons\' game board,
 ......but Jessica still seemed to resist the idea of stealing another person\'s life, even if it was only their life as a game piece.
"................................."
"......Heheh, are you getting cold feet?"
"N‐......no......
 ......Th‐the {f:5:Beatrice} that Battler‐san desires......would not be shaken by the likes of this..."
""Well then, who will take the next trial?!""
"It can be anyone! Please choose the next victim!!"
"It can be anyone! Let the next challenger step forward!!"
"If no one will step forward—"
".........That means I win, doesn\'t it?"
"Yes, that\'s right!
 Then congratulations are in order, Ushiromiya George!!"
"The key that leads to successful love between you and the one you cherish—"
""We bestow it now upon you!!""
"W‐.........wait......!!!"
As the demons delightedly named George as the victor,
 ......they were interrupted by the next challenger.
".........Jessica......san......"
"......I\'ll.........go next......
 ......Fine... I\'m game.
 ...I\'ll show you that my feelings for Kanon‐kun aren\'t just a silly, childish crush!!"As usual, this year\'s family conference was getting bogged down.
Everyone had decided to cool their heads for a moment, and a short break had been agreed upon...
The four siblings could say whatever they wanted,
 but Natsuhi and Kyrie, for example, were outsiders and found it difficult to speak freely in this sort of atmosphere.
A conference where you aren\'t allowed to say what you want can be tiring even as you just sit there quietly.
Even Kyrie couldn\'t help letting out a deep sigh...
".............................."
This was the second floor hallway of the mansion.
Rudolf had wanted to be alone during the break, so she had felt like doing the same...
...and had drifted up the stairs to reach this place.
Her expression was less tightly controlled than it was when her husband was around.
{n}......Kyrie wore a tired look that she didn\'t often show.
She pressed her forehead against the cool window glass.
I need to regain my spirit and support my husband.
 Even if I\'m not allowed to speak.
......That\'s the duty I\'ve won.
".....................Who is it?"
She suddenly sensed another person, turned around,
 and saw Jessica standing at the other end of the hallway.
"..........................."
"Oh, it\'s you, Jessica‐chan.
 ......Didn\'t you go to the guesthouse?"
"......Well,
 ......I just decided to head back to my own room for a bit to get a book."
"I see.
 And now you\'re on your way back to the guesthouse?"
"Y‐yes.
 That\'s right......"
"What horrible rain.
 Is the wind really strong...?"
"It\'s weak right now, relatively speaking......"
As Kyrie looked out the window, ......Jessica watched her back, looking agitated...
"......Auntie Kyrie...
 ......I\'m sorry, you just had bad luck..."
"Ah, Zepar!
 Jessica\'s roulette of fate has chosen Kyrie!"
"What will you do, Jessica?!
 The roulette has chosen Kyrie, but you may reject that choice and spin the roulette again if you wish!"
""It doesn\'t matter whose life is sacrificed for this trial...!!""
Jessica wasn\'t like George.
George had willingly chosen Eva to be his sacrifice,
 to signify his separation from his old life so that he could step into a new life married to Shannon.
However, Jessica hadn\'t thought of any particular target.
......So, she had left it up to the roulette of fate.
That "roulette" was nothing very grandiose.
 ......She had simply walked around at random, imposing a rule on herself saying that the first person she met would be chosen as the sacrifice.
And so, ......the roulette of fate had brought her to Kyrie...
Of course, there was nothing forcing her to keep to that rule.
However, it was the rule that she had decided upon, and she didn\'t want to break it now.
......Now that she was participating in this demons\' game, this was the one bit of justice that she could cling to...
Right now, she could attack that unprotected back...
{n}But Jessica still wasn\'t able to fully resolve herself.
"........................
 ......What is it?
 Do you have something to say to me...?"
Noticing Jessica\'s strange silence, Kyrie turned around.
{n}......That unprotected back was already gone.
Jessica realized that her hesitation had cost her her own first chance...
......She had taken on this demons\' game to prove her love for Kanon.
However,
 ......would it really be alright to sell her soul to demons...
...for the sake of love...?
Not wanting to let George, who had already come to terms with the situation, get any more of a lead on her, she had energetically consented to this demons\' game, but...
......her heart still wasn\'t ready......
"Umm, ..................
 ......M‐maybe I shouldn\'t be asking you this, Auntie Kyrie........."
"......What is it?
 It\'s rare for you to ask me questions, Jessica‐chan.
 ......I hope I\'m capable of answering it for you."
"Actually, umm, ............I...
have someone I like."
"Oh, really?
 That\'s wonderful, *giggle*.
 Then is it love you wanted to talk about...?"
"E‐......eheheh...
 ...Yeah, ......pretty much."
".........Alright.
 I\'ll help out if I can."
"Th‐thank you very much...
 ......Actually, umm......"
"Is it still one‐sided?"
"No, ......I guess you could say that it\'s just become mutual...
 But, well, .........there\'s this trial......for us to be joined together......"
"A trial?
 What are you talking about?"
"......There\'s the two of us and another pair of lovers......and we have to fight each other."
"A love triangle?
 Or a love rectangle...?
 Sounds complicated.
 ......And?"
"Only the pair who wins can be together...
 ......It\'s something complicated like that.
 So it\'s like, um—"
".........Sounds nasty.
 ......Love that can only succeed at another couple\'s expense."
"Yes...
 ......If we join up, ......then they\'ll fall apart.
 ......And the same the other way around."
"......I think I see where you\'re going with this.
 ......Something like this, right?
 "To what extent is a person allowed to climb over others in their own pursuit of happiness", ......right?"
".............................."
It was once again apparent......just how smart Kyrie was.
She immediately figured out the question that Jessica wanted to ask most...
"If you don\'t fight, it automatically means that they win and you lose.
 ......However, if you do fight and win, you cause the other pair to break apart.
 ......It\'s nasty either way.
 But the answer is obvious."
"............Yes......"
Kyrie giggled.
......If she wasn\'t willing to commit to her love, then that would show the measure of their relationship.
{n}If that was the case, she should just let the other pair of lovers win.
However, if this was a love she couldn\'t abandon,
 ......she couldn\'t abandon the victory either.
So, ......she had no option but to fight.
In the end, Jessica\'s hesitation was caused by guilt...
over forcing the others to split apart as the result of her inevitable decision......
"......I guess...
......I\'m just...
...being soft after all......"
"Yep.
 ......That you are."
"...........................
 ......But stepping over someone else for the sake of my own love,
 ......it feels......horrible..."
"In that case, what about the one you love?
 ......Will you give up on them?"
"......That\'s......"
"I can tell you one thing for certain.
 Doing that would feel even worse.
 You\'ll be forced to crawl through hell.
 ......For the rest of your life."
A hardness had entered Kyrie\'s gaze...
"......I was just six, so I didn\'t understand much about it at the time,
 ......but I found Mom\'s notebook among her belongings after she died."
"Was it a diary...?"
"It was more a collection of her thoughts.
 It was much less organized than a diary would\'ve been.
 ......I found it and read it right after she passed away,
 ...but I needed to wait a long time, until I\'d grown for several years, before I could understand it."
".........I see.
 ...So, did it speak of Kyrie\'s worries about her marriage?"
"It was......practically a book of curses.
 ......It cleared up several things that six‐year‐old me had always vaguely sensed."
When I was six, it seemed as though my parents were very close and had no problems.
......And though I did think it odd that Onii‐chan lived separately when he was meant to be part of our family,
 and I did wonder why he only came home every once in a while,
 I accepted it as the way things were.
"Did you not know about Asumu?"
"......I think Onii‐chan talked to me about her when no one was around, but there was no way an elementary schooler like I was could understand.
 ......After all, I never even saw a picture of her.
 ......Mom had sent all of the pictures with Asumu‐san in them to Onii‐chan, leaving none behind in the house."
In front of Ange, and even in front of Battler who only rarely came home,
 ......Kyrie\'s smile never faltered.
If she hadn\'t written her thoughts in that notebook, Ange would probably never have known them.
Rudolf had been particularly popular with the opposite sex since his school days—a typical playboy.
Audacious, over the top, and yet not lacking a little gentleness towards women,
 he had probably built up a formula for getting women to like him.
Plenty of women approached him, using various seductive tricks to try to win his favor.
Rudolf probably enjoyed that more than anyone.
Since the beginning, love had been a game to Rudolf.
He never thought of it as a trial and error process to find a single life partner.
He would intentionally spark jealousy between women and revel in the harem, lapping up their flirting.
......He may be my father, ......but he was an awful man.
"But at the same time, Dad must have looked down on those toadying girls.
 ......Mom, who had her own set of values and was extremely intelligent, must have stood out."
"......Though even that might have been due to the skillful way Kyrie tried to catch Rudolf\'s gaze."
"...........................
 ......Yeah, maybe.
 Mom was smart in many ways."
Like the other Ushiromiya siblings, Rudolf had strong ambitions and lofty goals.
Under the mottos of "who dares wins" and "it\'s not a crime if you don\'t get caught",
 he would set up businesses that were borderline swindles or bending the law, then bail out of them, and repeat that process over and over.
Apparently, he was already making use of that talent in his college years, cleverly making money by thinking up shameless projects and selling cheap tickets to parties for them,
 so much money that he could brag about how his wallet was always stuffed with a hundred 10,000 yen notes......
Many women fell for his charisma in being the man responsible for these radical projects, ...as well as his thick wallet and generosity.
......It would be a lie to say that Kyrie was not one of them.
However, what made Kyrie very different from the other women...
...was that she could also support Rudolf as a business partner.
Rudolf would laugh all the way to the bank as his large‐scale party succeeded.
 His female entourage would surround him.
And Kyrie would be the only one among them able to calmly point out several ways that income and expenditure could be improved upon,
 and even lay out a proposal for the next project.
"In that manner, ......Rudolf must have slowly begun to accept her as a partner."
".........Just like some people say men don\'t belong in the kitchen,
 ......there\'s also a sense that women should stay out of financial affairs.
 ......It\'s "normal" for women to be treated by men.
 ...The details of how those 10,000 yen notes were scrounged up are vulgar, so they don\'t ask, don\'t know, don\'t even care."
"So, you\'re saying that Kyrie viewed money from a man\'s perspective..."
In that regard, Rudolf noticed something unique about Kyrie.
He knew all about how much hard work it took to make just one of those 10,000 yen notes.
So, somewhere inside him, he looked down upon those extravagant women who never even considered the efforts he had undertaken.
......Among all of them, only Kyrie possessed the same sharp financial intuition as Rudolf...
Every time Rudolf thought of a new plan, he would talk to Kyrie about it, work out the kinks, and make it succeed.
In this way, Kyrie steadily worked her way up until she was the number one of Rudolf\'s large group of followers.
"But Mom was still a woman.
 ......I doubt she enjoyed seeing Dad pampered by all the other girls."
"......So, she would rather have been his only one, instead of his number one..."
"Yeah.
 Though she served as Dad\'s right hand, she slyly got rid of the other women in the shadows.
 ......It was only a matter of time before Mom would succeed in her love."
"When did Asumu come into the picture?"
"......She was one of those who swarmed around Rudolf‐san.
 ...No, not even that.
 She was just one of his fans."
"Did you ever talk with her...?"
"Of course.
 ......I knew her well.
 Ever since the very beginning, before Rudolf‐san even knew her name.
 .........I\'m sure she was quite intelligent herself.
 And cunning.
 ......I tried to use my intelligence to stick out, .........but she took the exact opposite approach."
"......By her...stupidity......?"
"*giggle*...
 .........I mean she was good at triggering his protective instinct.
 Out of all the girls who came to flatter and flirt with him,
 ......only she stood out with every action she made, unlike the flashy girls Rudolf‐san had tired of."
......Even now, Kyrie recognized the mistake she had made in letting Asumu and Rudolf get too close.
Kyrie had thought that by taking the role of his business partner, she had succeeded in making him entirely hers.
......She might have been a little conceited.
And her arrogance in trying to eliminate the relationships the other girls had with Rudolf might also have contributed.
Perhaps she sometimes tried too hard as a business partner,
 putting too much pressure on him, regardless of the fact that it was justified.
Bit by bit, Rudolf started to need a woman who could stay quiet and soothe him,
 ......without making him think about anything complicated.
.........That woman was Asumu.
"I am ruthless and intellectual.
 Rational and economical.
 ......In a plank of Carneades situation, I would push the other person off without hesitation.
 ......I thought that was the kind of partner suitable for him."
However, though that ruthlessness had made her reliable on the business side of things...
......outside of business,
 it might have disturbed Rudolf deeply.
At some point, ......though Rudolf still acknowledged Kyrie\'s skill, he began to yearn for a quiet, warm acceptance.
Asumu filled that role completely.
She would never talk about anything complicated.
{n}Even if he did, she would just shake her head to say she didn\'t know.
However, she would care more for him physically than anyone else, quietly putting a blanket on him and staying by his side until morning...
"......Yes, I did get the position of his business partner.
 ......But before I knew it,
 ......Rudolf‐san had grown a need for a mental partner, someone who could heal his heart.
 Foolishly enough, despite claiming to be the intellectual one, I never noticed."
"............And then...
...Uncle Rudolf...
married Aunt Asumu......?"
".................................
 ...Yes, that\'s right.
 She stole him away from me."
"........................"
"He had slept with a lot of women.
 ......By that point, he wasn\'t the kind of guy to let his emotions be captured by a woman just because he slept with her.
 After all, sleeping with women was just a game to him.
 .........That\'s why I used something other than my body to attract his attention."
"......Conceit.
 A woman\'s downfall..."
"Before long, they were both pregnant.
 ......Asumu‐san told Dad about it right away, but Mom did the opposite."
".........She must have been afraid that pregnancy would threaten her position as his business partner..."
"Apparently, Mom wasn\'t eating much at the time and was often out of sorts.
 Because of that, it took a really long time before she realized she was pregnant."
"When did she notice...?"
"......It was after Asumu‐san suddenly moved into Dad\'s family register.
 ......Mom learned about her pregnancy after that and plotted several times to split Asumu‐san and Dad apart, but..."
"Even though Asumu‐san.........always appeared to be so absentminded,
 ...once she got her hands on Rudolf‐san, she wouldn\'t let go.
 ......‘What do you want? Please stay out of our way’, she\'d say.
 ......And this coming from that sissy little girl who\'d curl up into a ball every time she got on a bus."
".........At that point, I realized.
 ...She had been the truly cunning one.
 ......Yes, even her fear of vehicles was another lie to catch Rudolf‐san\'s sympathy.
 ..............."
".....................My apologies.
 I must be boring you."
"Oh, ......no........."
"At the very least,
 I wanted him to register himself as the father of my child.
 ......And it does seem as though Rudolf‐san was prepared to do that.
 He made sure there was a hospital waiting for me, and even though Asumu‐san was close to giving birth herself, he gallantly came to see me.
 .........Even though she was already his wife.
 What an awful man, really......"
After that......is the tale I can\'t bear even to tell.
Both Asumu and I......had the same delivery date.
And yet, her pregnancy led to marriage, ......while mine was completely meaningless.
I swore to bring up my child well, so that Rudolf‐san would be proud to call himself its father.
Asumu‐san had won her battle against me.
{n}......However, I hadn\'t yet lost the war.
If I could make my child excel far more than Asumu‐san\'s,
 if I could make my child the one that Rudolf‐san most respected, I would be rewarded.
 .........That\'s what I believed.
"However, ......Kyrie\'s child was stillborn."
"Yeah.
 ......Asumu‐san gave birth to Onii‐chan.
 ......But Mom didn\'t give birth to anyone.
 ......Even Mom\'s final hope of being left a spot as Dad\'s second wife...was destroyed......"
Kyrie had fallen from his partner to his second wife,
 ......and then, unable to give birth to the bond of a child, ......she tumbled down......to being merely his mistress.
I can\'t imagine...
...how much she must have hated Asumu and her child, ...Battler.
"......But despite that,
 ......Mom was able to act in a very friendly way towards Onii‐chan.
 .........It was definitely a shock for me.
 To discover that my kind and gentle mother had held such negative emotions towards Onii‐chan......and managed to hide them."
"........................
 ......She must have despised Battler."
"I don\'t doubt it.
 ......If Asumu‐san\'s child had been stillborn and Mom had been the one to give birth to Onii‐chan,
 ......history might have changed in some way.
 It seems she thought that if that had happened,
 she might have been able to make things play out in a way that Dad would divorce Asumu‐san and marry her instead."
".........Was that...also written in that book where she kept her thoughts?"
"Yeah.
 ......It truly was a collection of random thoughts, fantasies.
 .........Mom\'s resentment, as she chewed on the corner of her tear‐stained bed sheets."
"There\'s just one thing I regret."
".........You mean...the pregnancy?"
"No, no.
 .........It\'s my arrogance I regret.
 ".........Rudolf‐san is already mine, so I\'m completely safe.
 ......I\'ll never lose to that Asumu girl.""
"......While she was screaming and shrieking on buses and planes, I was capable of properly managing the travel arrangements and expenditures.
 ......And so, I was overly confident......that I was the one Rudolf‐san trusted the most."
"........................"
"They say love needs to be nurtured, right?"
"Y‐......yeah."
"That\'s not wrong.
 ......You both need to water that tree, care for it, and nurture it.
 ......And at the end, it will finally bear the fruit called love.
 Did you know?
 It isn\'t over when it bears fruit.
 ......You have to harvest that love, or it will never be realized."
".........Harvest......?"
"You need to think about that yourself, Jessica‐chan.
 ......If you make the tree bear fruit without harvesting it, it can sometimes grow rotten.
 And bugs will often gather around it.
 In fact, ......sometimes thieves will come by and pluck it off the branch."
"..........................."
"Young kids like you, Jessica‐chan, think that love ends with nurturing.
 ......That\'s naive.
 ......If you don\'t harvest it, you will never be rewarded for your love."
"Harvest......love......"
"At a glance, it may seem to be a matter just for the pair of lovers, but that isn\'t true.
 Putting off the harvest because you assume you can do it at any time just gives the thieves a chance."
"......What if that fruit you\'ve worked so hard to nurture gets pulled off the branch the next morning?
 ......You\'ll regret that you didn\'t choose to harvest it the previous day instead of putting it off.
 ......That regret really hurts.
 ......It\'ll make you crawl through hell."
"........................"
"I was lucky.
 My hell ended after 18 years.
 ......So, I\'ll never misjudge myself again.
 ......That man is mine.
 I won\'t let him get away. I won\'t let him out of my sight.
 And I\'m grateful to my masters.........
for giving me that chance.
 My "absolute, certain willpower" in not giving up on that man no matter what was answered with a "miracle"."
By now, Jessica was speechless......and didn\'t even nod her head in understanding.
......This true form of love that Kyrie was telling her about...
was far, far more harsh than anything she had imagined...
"Now,
 ......I will do anything to keep Rudolf‐san by my side.
 And I will show no mercy to his enemies.
 ......If he wished it, I might not even hesitate to commit murder."
".........Because I finally gained that determination, on the 18th year,
 .........that absolute willpower...
...brought about a miracle for me.
 .........You know, miracles only come to those who can make them come true themselves."
Asumu\'s death was no murder.
However, Kyrie had often cursed her and hoped for her death,
 ......and finally, on the 18th year, she built up the determination to kill her with her own hands.
And then, ......she actually......got herself a knife with which to do the deed.........
That was when the miracle occurred......
"......Aunt Asumu passing away......was a miracle......?"
"Not really.
 ......That wasn\'t even close to a miracle."
"............Huh?"
"After all,
 ......if she hadn\'t died, I would have killed her.
 ......In other words, she was fated to die no matter what.
 ......The miracle was that, even though she did die,
 {i:I didn\'t have to get my hands dirty}.
 That\'s all."
......Until now, Kyrie had never shown Jessica...
......no, she had never even shown Rudolf...that glint in the deepest depths of her eyes.
It told plainly and clearly...
that romance and love are not the sweet and fluffy candies that young girls imagine them to be.
Jessica was overwhelmed by that pressure......and stunned silent.
{n}And she had to acknowledge it.
{n}This was.........the power of will that could make love be realized.
This was the level of willpower Kyrie showed in her support of Rudolf as his wife.
And it was the same for George.
......He already had the willpower to confront everything in the way of his love that transcended status,
 and he had proven that.
Now, ......Jessica could clearly understand.
This was the magnitude of George\'s determination,
 which had allowed him to coldly carry out his part of the demons\' trial...
Then, ......what about her.........?
Did she really have the resolve to make her love with Kanon bear fruit...
and to go through with the task of harvesting it.........?
"*giggle*, I\'m sorry.
 I only meant to give a little advice, but perhaps I scared you a little too much.
 ......*giggle*giggle*.
 Blame the weather.
 I just wanted to pressure you a bit, but I\'ve gone overboard."
Kyrie let a relaxed smile rise to her face.
{n}The tense atmosphere finally slackened.
......However, her words had been gouged into Jessica\'s heart.
"I don\'t know what your love has been like, Jessica‐chan,
 .........but if you have a rival and neither is willing to back down, you can\'t let yourself become complacent."
"......If you do, you\'ll end up like me.
 ............Every woman should have one time in her life...
when she would kill for the sake of love.
 ......I can tell you that all women in the world who call themselves mothers have been through that.
 After all..."
"Women who don\'t do that are chewed to bits by the others and forced to crawl through the hell of envy and regret for the rest of their lives.
 .........My hell lasted 18 years.
 ......I was lucky to be pardoned after just 18.
 ......That hell is still filled with women......who will never get out until they die.
 ......Unless they execute themselves in their regret."
"........................
 ......Wow, I......I have no words."
"*giggle*.
 ......I was trying to spur you on, but here I\'ve gone and frightened you too much.
 ...I\'m truly sorry.
 ......Love can be much more easygoing than that, okay?
 Love really is like playing with fire.
 Anyone can play easily and lightheartedly.
......But when you mess up and get burned, that scar stays with you your whole life.
 .........*giggle*giggle*giggle*."
Regrets in love will never fade.
That was all that Kyrie had been trying to communicate.
......It wasn\'t like Kyrie to tell her life story instead of just saying something like that directly—in fact, her past was a topic she usually avoided.
However, ......Kyrie might have felt as though Jessica deserved to hear.
Jessica had timidly brought up the subject of love.
......Perhaps Kyrie had opened up and told everything...
...because she had seen the fires of Jessica\'s determination in her eyes.
"Well, I\'d better head back.
 ......Let\'s keep what we\'ve talked about a secret, okay?
 Eheheheh..."
With a mysterious smile on her face, Kyrie turned around.
.........I wonder if I scared her too much.
Still, it\'s a hundred times better to learn of that hell from a warning.
......Once you\'ve fallen into it, it\'s already too late.
Good luck, Jessica‐chan.
Your love sounds like a handful, but don\'t let yourself be beaten.
Eheheh, it\'s not every day I get to act as a mentor...
"......Hmm?
 What is it, Jessica‐chan...?"
What—
A windstorm grazed Kyrie\'s head.
It had missed by a hair.
If Kyrie hadn\'t twisted her body slightly, that fist would probably have been buried in her face by now.
A bitter smile rose to Jessica\'s face when she saw that her first strike had failed to land a kill...
"Just so you know, I didn\'t try to sucker punch you because I\'m a dirty coward...
 ......I hoped to end it with a single painless strike before you realized what was happening..."
".........Didn\'t I tell you that I\'ve lived through the hell of jealousy?
 I\'ve come close to getting stabbed in the back a couple times before.
 I know how it feels just before a surprise attack."
"You mean you could sense it...?"
"That, plus the lie you told in the beginning."
"......A lie?"
"Come now.
 If you had come from your room after picking up a book and were on your way back to the guesthouse, you wouldn\'t have come through this hallway in that direction.
 ......Chessboard theory led me to seven possible reasons you might have had for lying,
 and this was the worst‐case scenario."
Telling a hasty lie to Kyrie would only put her on her guard.
If Jessica hadn\'t told that lie, her surprise attack would have succeeded.
".........Not bad.
 ......I should have expected that from you, ...Auntie Kyrie."
"Why me?
 You were planning to kill me from the beginning."
"It didn\'t matter who it was."
"Just my luck."
"It\'s what you said that gave me the boost I needed.
 .........Thanks a lot......"
".........Wha............?!"
Kyrie dodged the punch, placed her hand against that fist, and slammed it against the wall.
Ordinarily, being made to punch the wall should have caused Jessica to hurt her own hand...
...and roll around clutching it in pain...
However, Jessica\'s fist...
...had left what looked like a meter‐wide crater in the wall.
Instead of a look of anguish after smashing her fist against the wall,
 Jessica clicked her tongue in irritation at having missed...
"......Incredible.
 I see that you are your father\'s daughter.
 Have you taken up boxing too...?"
Impossible... Jessica is barehanded.
{n}She isn\'t holding any sort of weapon at all...!
"............Please don\'t resist, Auntie.
 Just one strike to the head...
 I promise you won\'t feel a thing."
Kyrie tried to look confident, but she couldn\'t hide her confusion at this unreal destructive force.
If that punch had hit, her head probably would have split open like Jessica had said, killing her without any pain.
"Here I come........."
".........!!!"
If Kyrie\'s kick off the ground and leap backward had been an instant slower, her gut would probably have been pulverized.
Though she had avoided it by a hair,
 Jessica\'s left body blow was followed by a terrible tornado‐like gust of wind, which blew Kyrie back.
"......Is this a dream?
 Am I still sleeping?!
 I...I don\'t understand!"
This Jessica looked like the normal Jessica, but something was different...!
{n}It wasn\'t human, and common sense didn\'t apply to it!
This had to be......some kind of nightmare...!!
Kyrie slowly stood up.
Then, she looked at Jessica, noticed the several meters between them...
and realized just how far that blast of wind had sent her flying.
"..................Feel free to hate me.
 ...But...
......just like you,
 ......I can\'t back down.
 .........I can\'t let...
...my love...
...finish half‐hearted."
".........What are you talking about...?
 What are you saying?! What on Earth is going on?!
 Someone, tell mee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e!!!"
The air around Jessica seemed to bend like a heat wave.
It seemed to be enshrouding her fists.
 ......And, it seemed as though something like a red magic circle had appeared beneath her feet.
She looked just like a Western demon standing amidst the flames of hell.
"...Flame upgrade.
 ......Mass upgrade.
 ......Armor‐piercing upgrade."
Each time Jessica muttered, her fists were surrounded by a pulsating, sinister, red light.
......Those fists, which were even giving off smoke,
 surely represented...
......the iron hammers of hell wielded by demons...
"G‐goodbye!! This is just a nightmare...!!"
Kyrie dashed away with lightning speed.
Yes—right now, that was her best option.
She was smart enough to realize that pinching her cheek wasn\'t the best way to wake up from this nightmare, and by now, this came as no surprise.
"......Ronove."
When Jessica muttered once more, a blood‐red magical barrier blocked off the corridor.
{n}Kyrie slammed into it hard and realized that her path of escape had been cut off.
"Gah,
 ......st‐
......stop this, this...madness...!!
 This is...
......a nightmare,
 ......it\'s a nightmare...
 ......Let me wake up...
......quickly......!"
"......Yeah, this is a nightmare......
 .........I\'ll wake you up right now, if that\'s what you want.
 .........Just one strike... Don\'t move......"
Jessica slowly stepped forward towards her, enshrouded in flames...
Each time her feet lifted off the floor......boiling steam hung around her footprints...
This was......a true nightmare......
 ......Kyrie clutched her head in her hands, shaking it over and over again......
"It\'s a nightmare, right......?
 This is......a nightmare, isn\'t it.........?
 Please, tell me it is......!!"
"Yeah, it\'s a nightmare."
"It is, right...?
 It\'s a nightmare, right......?
 Ah, ......aaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahh!!"
"I\'ll recognize that.
 ......This is a nightmare."
"I do too!!
 I recognize that this is a nightmare!! S‐so please—"
"I\'ll wake you up......with a single punch!
 Rrrraa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhh{0}h{0}h{0}h{0}hhh!!!"
"Ack.........ggha...gh...............kh...??"
Jessica\'s neck twisted at an odd angle,
 ......and she staggered backwards, her eyes rolled back into her head,
 as though she didn\'t have a clue what had just happened.
A demon stake......was buried at an angle into her forehead.
It pulled itself out of her, spun around, then became Leviathan and landed.
The hole left behind in Jessica\'s head spewed blood.
"Leviathan the Envious, right here......!"
"If this is inside a nightmare anyway, .........why not have the friend that shows up in my nightmares?
 My friend from the hell of envy.
 Thanks for showing up just in the nick of time."
"......It\'s too early to thank me.
 She\'s......not down yet...!!"
".........Gah............gah......"
Even though she had taken a deep gouge to the top of the head,
 ......Jessica just stood there, convulsing and white‐eyed, and didn\'t fall over.
The blood stopped pouring out of her forehead, ......and her blank, doll‐like eyes returned.
Then, she slowly pressed her own palm against the wound in her forehead.
 ......There was a sizzle, as though she had pressed a hot iron against it.
It was easy to imagine that she was doing this to seal up the wound.
If Kyrie didn\'t escape now, there would never be another chance...!
"Can you defeat her...?!"
"Impossible.
 ......She has a contract with one of the Great Demons... She\'s immortal...!"
"That is because of love!!
 That is why she is immortal!!"
"Yes, love is magnificent!
 Those with our blessings cannot be killed!!"
"Can we break that red magic wall?"
"Ronove‐sama is also a Great Demon.
 There\'s nothing I can do...!"
"Can we escape out of a window?"
"The windows are no good either!
 They were blocked by Ronove‐sama\'s barrier a while ago...!"
"Incredible. Does this mean she sold her soul to demons for the sake of love?"
"How could she make so many contracts with Great Demons...?!
 Aah, I\'m so jealous...!!"
".................................
 ......Armor upgrade.
 ......All‐attribute defense,
 counter‐attacking armor upgrade."
In response to these words, this time her entire body pulsated with a red light.
......She had upgraded herself with a defensive power that would ensure Leviathan\'s attacks would never work again......
"What is she talking about...?"
"......Self‐augmentation.
 It\'s a kind of enchantment.
 ......Right now, she has enough defensive power to prevent me from piercing her,
 and she even has the power to reflect the damage back upon the attacker!
 ......She\'s no longer {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}. She\'s a monster...!!"
"Oh, so that\'s all.
 Then not much has changed."
"How can you say that?"
"Just like in the very beginning, we still have no chance of winning...!!"
"..............................
 ............That hurt.
 ......But it won\'t...work again."
Jessica slowly...
...lifted the hand that had been covering her forehead...
...and there was no longer any hole there.
The hall was blocked by barriers in both directions, and even the windows were sealed.
 There was no way out.
"Is the door to this room sealed?"
"No, it\'s just locked.
 ......But it\'s just a normal room.
 It does have windows, but they\'ve already been sealed.
 In other words, that\'s a locked room, and a coffin for us...!"
"A coffin is just what I need. Unlock it.
 ......Aah, I\'m jealous, why are you the only one who can unlock it?!!!"
Leviathan\'s stake flew about at high speeds, ramming itself into the keyhole to that room.
The tip of the stake had become a key.
 As soon as it was unlocked, the door flew open.
Both of them fell into the room and quickly locked it.
This was probably...Krauss\'s study.
Its soothing furnishings brought about a sense of nobility that Krauss would probably like.
"Even if you lock it, she can just smash through it with one punch!!
 You\'ve just put the lid on your own coffin!!"
"However, if she wants to send us a killing blow here inside this coffin, she\'ll have to take the lid off first!"
".....................?"
With dim eyes, Jessica tilted her head upon hearing Kyrie\'s words.
"............What are you talking about...?
 ......How will such a small room...be able to protect you...?"
"This room may be a locked room.
 It may leave us with no method of escape.
 However, even you can\'t break into this room.
 That\'s what a locked room is!"
"......What are you talking about......?
 How does this tiny room,
 ......with its tiny door, make you think you\'ve gotten away from me......?"
With a confused expression on her face,
 Jessica looked wearily between her own burning fists and the door.
Then, slowly, ......she sent that pulsating, red light to her fists......
She repeatedly enchanted her fists to give them the destructive power for the killing blow.
"......I\'ll smash this door to bits........."
"If you think you can,
 give it a try."
"K‐Kyrieeeeeee......!!"
Responding calmly through the door, which was the only thing separating her from Jessica, Kyrie placed a single index finger on it as if to hold it shut.
Jessica slowly...
...raised a fire‐wreathed demonic fist......
"......So long, Auntie Kyrie......"
"Kyrieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!
 ............{0}......{0}..................?!?!"
"...............Oh........."
Jessica\'s fist slammed into the door in slow motion.
It was the same kind of slow motion often seen as a special effect at the climax of a movie.
However, this was no special effect.
......Jessica\'s fist really was...slowing down as though it was being sucked in......like a spoon sinking into a jar of honey.
That punch...was no longer a punch.
 It was no more than a knock.
"I\'m envious of you."
"...............Envy......"
"I crawled through the hell of envy for 18 years because of my arrogance and naivety in love.
 ......So I envy you.
 ......You\'re going to remember my warning, succeed in love, and walk a beautiful life, right......?"
"...........................Hah..."
"......Aah, I envy you.
 You\'ll get to live through the most beautiful time in a woman\'s life...for a full 18 years longer than I did.
 ...Aah, I envy you so much...!!"
Jessica tried to slam her fists against the door over and over again.
{n}However, as soon as her fist approached it, its speed plummeted.
She could barely knock, much less smash the door...!
"............Speed upgrade.
 ......Instantaneous force upgrade.
 ......Speed of sound upgrade."
"It\'s useless, darling."
"......Break............!!!!"
With full speed upgrades, Jessica\'s fist moved at the speed of sound, {nobreak:1,225 km/h}.
However, how long had Jessica been in envy to gain that speed?
She had started to envy George and Shannon\'s relationship about......two years ago?
{n}2×365=730 days,
 730×24=17,520 hours.
However, she wasn\'t envious all the time.
{n}It only happened when Shannon started going on about George.
{n}With Shannon\'s shift on about 3 days of the week, ÷7×3.
And it wasn\'t as though she would go on about George all day long.
{n}Her fond words for him would only leave a mark on Jessica for about......an hour?
So only one 24th of each day.
{n}17520÷7×3÷24=312 (rounded down).
The number of hours that Kyrie had been jealous was 157,680.
 {n}In other words, this was a scant 0.2% of the time that Kyrie had been jealous.
Even 1225 km/h, the speed of sound, becomes only {nobr:2.45 km/h} in the 1/500 world.
"......Understand?
 ......You\'re lacking in both love and envy."
"..................!!!"
Even Jessica\'s sonic fists...
...were no faster than a walking child in Kyrie\'s world.
Jessica ground her teeth, her fist still pressed against the door.
If someone could have seen this from both sides of the door, it would have looked as though Kyrie was holding it shut with a single finger...
"Way to go, Kyrie...!!!"
"See? This room is a locked room.
 At most, Jessica‐chan can knock on the door, but she can\'t lay a finger on us inside!"
"Ah, {f:5:Beatrice}\'s definition of a locked room."
".........What the hell...?"
"Then this locked room will be somewhat troublesome.
 It is impossible for a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} to carry out a locked‐room murder.
 ......Only magic can do that.
 ......Until you truly understand magic, you will not be able to break through it."
"You can\'t corner me any further...!
 As time passes, the relatives will eventually realize that I haven\'t returned, and they\'ll start searching the mansion.
 And then, you will be observed.
 Witches and magic alike disappear when they\'re observed.
 .........The nightmare is already over, darling!!!"
"......D‐......damn...it..............."
"Oh?!
 I can\'t believe Jessica is going to drop out all of a sudden!!"
"Oh, please give it your all!
 Do it for your beloved Kanon!!"
""Come, Jessica, believe in love and let us see a miracle!!""
"Let me make a correction.
 There isn\'t even any need to wait for time to pass.
 ......After all, there\'s an extension telephone right here.
 Of course, the internal phone line hasn\'t been cut."
"......I\'ll just...pick up...
......the receiver!!
 This is...my...
......checkmate!!!"
".........Construction completed.
 .........Locked‐room murder."
"......Aha.
 ......Yes, that is valid."
".........Permeation upgrade.
 .........Attack transmission,
 indirect attack power upgrade."
"Huh..............."
Jessica\'s fist, which was pressed against the door, glowed red...and then white hot...
Jessica didn\'t even swing her fist.
{n}She just kept it pressed against the door.
However, ......Jessica\'s "murder" reached inside the "locked room"......
Through the cracks in the study door, through the keyhole...burst the flames of hell.
Jessica couldn\'t see what was happening inside the room.
......However, even here, on the other side of the door, she could tell that the flames of hell had swallowed the entire room.
"Ggh...
......gyah...
.........gah...
............"
Kyrie\'s smoldering death throes could be heard from across the door.
Jessica clearly heard as Kyrie danced a dance of death amidst the hellfire,
 ......fell to her knees,
 ......and slumped over to the floor.
Slowly, ......Jessica tore her burning fist away from the door.
".........If you love the hell of envy so much,
 then burn.
 ......Burn in the flames of envy...for all time.
 .........There are probably some things that can be learned from envy.
 However, it\'s nothing to be praised, and it\'s no one\'s duty.
 ............It seems you were too proud after all,
 ......Auntie Kyrie."
"......A splendid......locked‐room murder."
"Could you take care of the mess?
 .........I\'d hate for her body to be burnt to a crisp when it\'s finally found.
 ......Do you think you could clean it up...?"
"As you wish, Milady."
Ronove transformed into a gold butterfly and entered Krauss\'s study through the keyhole.
......Then, he had to cross his arms and think...
...about how he should even start cleaning up Kyrie\'s unrecognizable corpse and this room that had ended up as a burning hell...
"....................................
 ......Haaah.........haah..."
Jessica finally let out the breath that she had been holding down in her chest...
Her normal {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} glint finally returned to her eyes...
......And then, ...she couldn\'t help but shudder at what she had done,
 ......even if it had been just a trial on the game board for the sake of her love...
"......Is that what you wanted, demons?!"
""Yes, well done, Jessica!
 Your love is the real deal!!""
"........................"
George welcomed Jessica with crisp applause.
......Beato timidly tried to join him, but Jessica yelled at them and she stopped.
"......It\'s just something that happened on the game board.
 There\'s no need to look so sad about it."
"I know that logically!!
 But still, ......how am I supposed to just accept it emotionally?!!"
".........Milady—"
"Kanon‐kun, ......I...love you...!
 I can\'t give up...!!
 That\'s why I\'ve shown how strong my feelings are...!
 I...didn\'t do something wrong, did I?
 I\'m not wrong, am I?!
 Uuu...aa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}ahh......"
"...............Milady..."
As Jessica started to sob, ...Kanon held her quietly.
{n}And he realized that he would have to carry on the determination she had shown him...
"You didn\'t make any mistake.
 ......And it also isn\'t a mistake to keep your human heart and be sad.
 ......I just happen to be a bit more of a stoic when it comes to that sort of thing."
"......Not everyone can match up to George‐sama\'s level.
 ......But, in any event, you have completed your trial, Milady.
 ......Well done. I admire the strength of your determination."
"Hmm, very true.
 Both George and Jessica...
have splendidly succeeded just the same.
 Very impressive, Jessica!
 ......That "locked‐room murder" just now was wonderful enough to fascinate even a witch like myself."
Jessica had used "magic" to kill Kyrie, who had holed up inside a closed room.
In that instant, Jessica had "constructed" a locked‐room murder,
 had it acknowledged by the demons, and raised it to the level of magic...
"The trials for the two of you have been completed!!"
"So then, who will take the next challenge?!"
"Will it be {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama?!"
"No, no, it might be Shannon!"
"No, this has to be Kanon\'s time to shine!"
""Come, speak up!!
 Who is next?! Who will take the next trial?!""
".....................nn—"
"What witch would hesitate at committing murder on the game board?
 Even excess shyness can kill love."
"..........................."
"Come!! Who will be next—"
"To carry out a murder of love?!"
"....................."
".................."
"............nn—"
The three who remained looked at each other.
......‘If the other two are going to spend a few more moments hesitating to raise their hands, I will raise my own instead.’
......All three thought this at the same time.
So,
 they all raised their hands at the same time.
......The ones they loved had already shown their determination.
{n}They had to carry on.Rosa could be seen in the parlor.
It seemed that the relatives all wanted to be alone now that they had dispersed for a short break.
Since everyone had avoided the parlor, the obvious place for people to gather,
 Rosa was able to have this relaxing and comforting room all to herself...
That didn\'t mean she looked relaxed.
{n}Her expression was heavy with gloom and weariness.
The cup of black tea that she had brought from the dining hall had gone stone cold......
"................................."
......Comforting silence.
Now that no one else was in sight, Rosa\'s heart finally awoke.
She was always treated like a kid in the conferences with her three siblings.
{n}She had no influence at all.
But, possibly because of that, she was apparently considered to be a neutral party.
{n}The siblings would often ask for her agreement, sometimes even treating her like an adjudicator or a judge.
"......I have to make use of that...
...and turn the discussion in the direction I want."
I have to find almost a hundred million yen by March.
That was supposed to be my great commitment, a burden I bore to help support......{i:his} business.
Now, ......I\'m not sure anymore.
If I can pay off the debt, ......will he call me again?
......Well, you can forget it.
Even if you do contact me after all this time, ......I\'ll be the one turning {i:you} down.
......But still,
 .........you are Maria\'s father, you know......?
Please come and see her,
 ......if only just once......
"......Love is quite a difficult thing...
......to stick to, isn\'t it?"
"Huh?!
 Wh‐.........who.........?"
Though no one should have been in the parlor, someone suddenly spoke to Rosa, and she jumped.
......Just when had it happened...?
 Kanon could be seen standing there.
Even considering that she had been deep in thought, ......to think that she hadn\'t noticed him at all......
"......You scared me.
 ...Sorry, I guess I was thinking so hard that I didn\'t notice you.
 ......Need something?"
"No.
 .........The reason you are currently in pain is because of love, Rosa‐sama.
 ......Am I wrong?"
"Th‐that\'s sudden.
 ......I\'m not sure what you\'re talking about."
"......Maria‐sama\'s father asked you to be the co‐signer on a loan,
 and you accepted."
"...........................
 ...What a troublesome kid.
 ......You were listening to Krauss nii‐san from the hallway, weren\'t you...?"
......True, earlier this day, in this very room,
 Krauss had seen through to the fact that Rosa was bearing a massive debt because she had become a co‐signer on a loan.
However, he hadn\'t said that her partner had been Maria\'s father......
Why......did Kanon know so much......?
"You are a very wise person, Rosa‐sama.
 ......You wouldn\'t have become a co‐signer...
without thinking carefully about the consequences."
"...............I hadn\'t yet moved to his family register,
 but I thought of the man I would soon marry as my partner.
 If he couldn\'t borrow the money without my name, I figured that helping him out was my responsibility as his future wife."
"......And did that future ever come?"
".............................."
No, it hadn\'t.
So afterwards......Rosa was always alone.
{n}And Maria......never had a father.
However, time moved on.
Maria, who should have been a symbol of their union, just kept growing,
 almost like a living hourglass measuring the length of the hell Rosa had crawled through......
Because of that, Maria\'s growth......hurt.
"......It\'s a cruel joke.
 ......I tried to forget that man several times.
 ......But you know, forgetting him doesn\'t get rid of that debt."
It was only natural.
 ......And so, whether or not she forgot her love,
 she had to do all she could to pay that money back.
"But you know, I also think of it this way.
 .........If I can manage to pay everything off, ......it\'ll mean that I\'ve passed the trial of love that he gave me.
 ......If I have to pay off my debt anyway, how can I abandon my reward, the love I could gain as a result, before it\'s over...?
 Don\'t you think I could put off thinking about that until after I\'ve paid it all back......?"
"..........................."
It may have been a trick of words that only those who have suffered through love could understand.
Even Rosa vaguely realized that she might have been deceived.
However, if she was able to succeed in paying back the loan, ......he might acknowledge her usefulness as a wife...
When that happened, she might be able to regain her love.
But if she had already abandoned that love, then what?
......This debt, this "trial that he had given her", would become completely meaningless......
Yes, for her, ......the debt itself appeared to be a trial of love.
In fact, the very fact that she looked at it that way might have been her blindness due to love,
 as well as proof that she still hadn\'t cast off her infatuation with the past...
Even now, she still suffered......
And that suffering would continue, ......at least until she paid back the massive loan, and let a good deal of time pass after that,
 ......until she could finally lay her feelings for him to rest...
".........Could this be......that hell Kyrie‐sama spoke of?"
"......Probably.
 ......Though I\'m not sure what you\'re talking about.
 ......There\'s no doubt that my world has been a total hell."
"And how can that be put to an end...?"
".........Who knows?
 If anyone did, ......the disease called love would never eat into anyone again."
That disease is a serious one.
{n}......It sometimes eats into a person for their entire life, .....spreading to and hurting the people closest to them.
{n}That disease was torturing her now as much as it ever had...
"Well, since you bring up Kyrie‐san,
 .........her story is like an aspiration to me, ......or a dream."
Though she had her man stolen from her, she persevered for 18 years.
{n}She never fell to despair, and instead continued to support Rudolf, lying in wait for a miracle......
"Maria is still only nine years old.
 ......I\'ve only waited for the first half of Kyrie‐san\'s 18 years.
 ......If I gave up after just this, ......she would laugh at me."
"......Do you think that a miracle will occur in another nine years?"
"..............................
 ......Doubting that would be the end of me."
"..........................."
"In a sense, I\'m a ghost.
 ......I am already dead.
 I\'m just living on without noticing."
".........A ghost waiting for eternity for a person who will never come......"
"That\'s right.
 .........That day, when I naively said that I wanted to support his dream, I was probably already dead.
 .........I guess that really was a regretful day, in the end.
 "I have dreams. I want to go overseas.
 I\'ll fly out of this tiny country, make it big, and come back to you."
 ......That takes me back..."
......At that time, I thought of lovers as a pair of people willing to acknowledge the other\'s radical dreams.
I\'d become a successful designer, announcing my new lines in Paris,
 getting jostled by the press...... He loved to talk about that dream, and I loved listening to him.
When I think about it, ......I really had my head in the clouds during that strange time.
............We both lifted the other up, as though we were drifting about in the air.
So, when he said that he wanted to get out of Japan, I applauded him and promised to support him.
Acknowledging each other\'s great dreams that might never be is a standard sort of pillow talk for lovers.
But once they started to translate into actual action, ........from that point on, I should have been serious and practical.
"......For a long time, I felt proud of letting him go on that day.
 ......No, I still do."
".....................
 ......But you still regret it."
".........That\'s right.
 .........If, on that day, I had sobbed and pleaded for him to stay, I might not have fallen into hell.
 ......Did seeing him off with a smile really make me a winner?
 Of course not.
 I basically lost by default by refusing to fight when the time came."
"...I only glorified that loss, ......saw him off with a smile as he went to take on the world overseas,
 and became intoxicated with the fantasy that I was some brave woman waiting patiently with her daughter for her man\'s return.
 .........Even though he never called me once after that, and mail sent to the address he gave me came back "forwarding address unknown"..."
"..........................."
"......Where I am right now...is hell.
 ......A hell where I\'ll regret until the day I die that I didn\'t fight when I was meant to.
 ......I\'ve even dragged my daughter into hell with me.
 ............I wish someone would just kill me.
 ......I want to be told that I\'ve already been killed, that I\'m a ghost."
"............In love,
 ......if you do not fight,
 ......you fall into hell."
"......Yes. Love is a fight."
"Will you win and gain,
 or lose and die?"
"But please, have no fear of death."
"After all, it is a peaceful sleep."
""What is truly terrifying...
...is the hell that finds the unsleeping ghosts who could neither win nor die.""
"......That hell has no end..."
"The battle of love is cruelest to those...
who could neither win nor die."
"......So, in love, you\'ve got to go for broke.
 Dying in battle.......is better than the alternative."
"They say the most torturous toxin for humans is made from rotting love.
 ......The suffering it brings......exceeds the tortures of the most twisted hells."
She said this as a warning to motivate her double and little sister,
 encouraging her to take on any trial, no matter how severe...
"............I understand."
After all, when my desire to have Battler‐san one day accept me wells up in my chest,
 .........I can feel the seed that resides there.
"......It is up to me to kill that seed or make it bud.
 ......But if I let it rot here in my chest, ......its poison will surely torment me forever..."
"And that, .........even for us thousand year old witches,
 ......is the most terrifying torture in the world..."
"Behold what happens to those who make light of love!
 This hell of Rosa\'s—"
"Is what happens to those who do not possess the courage to make the seed of love bud, and instead allow it to rot."
""One cannot end that pain by their own hands.""
.........Huh?
 .........Just now......was that a red light......?
"..................My apologies."
"......Huh...?
 .........What.........?"
Just now...
I thought...
...I saw something strange.
......I wonder if I\'m tired...
 ......It\'s probably just my imagination.
Rosa picked up her cup of cold tea.
When she did,
 ......she saw a small...
............red rose petal floating on the surface.
...
...
A
...
...
rose
...
...
...
...
...
?
".........I have heard that, in your youth,
 ......you loved to lie on that sofa."
"...................................."
It...
...wasn\'t a rose petal.
It was...
...a drop of blood...
......that had fallen from Rosa\'s eyes.
In an instant,
 ......Kanon had beautifully and precisely...
......cut just the single thread of Rosa\'s life...
There was no wound on Rosa\'s body.
{n}There were only......the few drops of blood......that dripped down from her eyes.
{n}Her pain, her uncertainties, and her worries......were all gone now.
Slowly, .........she collapsed onto the sofa and lay there.
That had been one of her most blissful habits during the most blissful time of her life......
"Sleep well, ......Rosa‐sama.
 ......Your hell...has ended."
Kanon took a blanket out of a cupboard...
......and gently covered Rosa with it...
It would have looked to anyone...
...just as though Rosa was sleeping peacefully......
......Those demons had not exaggerated when speaking of love as a battle and a trial.
In fact, although cruel, this could even be said to be an honest reflection of reality,
 in the sense that it made no attempt to hide the fact that to lose in love is to die...
"......Now my part is complete.
 ......Were you watching, demons?"
"......Oh......no.........!"
"How could you kill Mama?!!
 HOW COULD YOU KILL MAMAA{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}AWA{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}A{0}AAHH!!!"
One of the two great witches of Mariage Sorcière, {f:5:Maria}.
{n}Though she was just an apprentice, the power sleeping within her had impressed even {f:5:Beatrice} at the height of her strength.
In {f:5:Maria}\'s eyes, though Rosa was the black witch,
 ......she was also the vessel of the mother she couldn\'t help but love.
Her anger at having that stolen from her was near madness.
"How could you do that to Mama, to Mama to Mama to Mama!!
 Nngg{0}gy{0}y{0}y{0}y{0}y{0}ya{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}ahh!!!"
{f:5:Maria}\'s attack was too emotional.
Because of this, she didn\'t notice that Kanon had already disappeared in the span of a few short moments,
 ...and she released her barrage at what had become empty space.
In the meantime, Kanon jumped from wall to wall, around to {f:5:Maria}\'s back...
"...............Huh...h...?"
"......I don\'t want to kill past my quota.
 ......But I will defend myself...!!"
"............Uryuu."
"Wh‐
......what are...
...you—"
"......Diplomatic immunity!
 ......I won\'t let you target {f:5:Maria} or me...!"
"D‐......damn........."
The red‐trailing sword that extended from Kanon\'s hand dissipated in an instant.
He managed to make it reappear, but when he tried to use it on {f:5:Maria} and Sakutarou again, it vanished once more.
Because of Sakutarou\'s power, he was unable to make either of them the target of his attacks.
"......There you are.
 ......Since when have you been there......?"
"Uryuu...
 ......I won\'t let anyone bully {f:5:Maria}."
"D‐......dammit......!"
{f:5:Maria} finally noticed where Kanon was, and she slowly turned around...
Kanon made his sword materialize yet again,
 but no matter how often he tried, it kept fading out, like a flashlight with a bad battery...
"I won\'t let you get away now......
 ......I won\'t forgive you.........for the sin of stealing Mama away...
 ......I\'ll kill you.
 ...Just like Mama killed them, ...I\'ll kill you without mercy!!!"
As {f:5:Maria} howled, the entire parlor was surrounded by a cube of red, magic barriers.
It was a locked room symbolizing a barrier that Kanon could never escape.
"......Dammiiiiiit...!!
 Not......here......!"
Kanon cursed his bad luck.
Even though he had fulfilled his goal in the demons\' trial,
 ......if he was killed here, he\'d be dragged off of the game board...!
".........{f:5:Maria}.
 ......Don\'t overdo it."
"Yeah, I won\'t overdo it.
 ......I\'ll be a little more gentle than Mama was.
 ......Kuhi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hhi,
 ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haa{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haah
ha{0}haa{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hya{0}haa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}haahh!!!"
"......?!?!"
"Uryu, who is it?!"
"......Pardon me, Maria‐sama...
 In accordance with the contract with Zepar‐sama and Furfur‐sama, I come for your life...!"
"Shannon, ......don\'t get...
...in my way{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}yy!!"
"It\'s pointless, Shannon.
 ......No one can target {f:5:Maria}...!"
"Yes.
 I don\'t intend to target her in any way.
 ......I will simply protect myself."
A cylindrical red magical barrier surrounded Shannon as she stood in the center of the parlor.
Its brightness and thickness grew, and its radius quickly expanded, filling up the room.
It wasn\'t targeting {f:5:Maria}.
{n}Shannon was wielding this power to protect herself.
So, Sakutarou\'s power didn\'t make it disappear.
".........N‐......Nee‐san......"
"Are you going to let this be the ruin of your feelings for Milady?
 ......Get ahold of yourself...!"
"Ugh, ......ghgh, gghh.........!!"
"Uryu...uu.........!!"
By now, the shield with Shannon at the center had covered up the entire room.
 Its power crushed {f:5:Maria} and Sakutarou into the corner of the room.
Ironically, it was the locked‐room barrier {f:5:Maria} had set up to prevent Kanon from escaping that they were pressed against, and the two together had them completely trapped.
"...No...good......
 ...Can\'t......escape......"
"......*cackle*cackle*, kuhi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hii{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hhi{0}hi{0}hiihi!!
 That\'s right, this is a locked room...
 ......Ki{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi!
 This might be just perfect for that wannabe detective who\'s trying to deny Beato\'s magic."
".........Checkmate, Maria‐sama.
 ......May I?"
"Yeah, go ahead!! Crush me!
 ......Ki{0}hhi{0}hhi{0}hhi{0}hhi{0}hhi{0}hhi{0}hhii!!"
"Then, goodbye...!"
The entire room was filled with the red light of the shield, ......and the output and pressure were raised to their limits.
......Then, crushed between the shield and their own locked‐room barrier,
 ......{f:5:Maria} and Sakutarou lost their forms, scattered into a spray of gold, and disappeared...
"......Thank you.
 ......I couldn\'t afford to disappear here."
"If you lost in a place like this, you\'d never be able to let it go."
"......You\'re right.
 I could never let it go if I lost in a place like this."
"Zepar‐sama, Furfur‐sama.
 We have both finished our trial.
 Is that satisfactory...?"
"Well, that was truly splendid!
 A faultless performance from the both of you!"
"Then shall we finish with {f:5:Beatrice}\'s turn...?
 Oh, where did she go?"
"To the victim she has chosen, of course."
""Come, let us go there as well!""
......Natsuhi could be seen in her room.
Krauss had instructed her to retire for the night,
 but she couldn\'t afford to lie around sleeping on an important day like this.
However, she was aware that she was the type to get excited easily,
 and that this sometimes held her husband back...
So,
 ......though she didn\'t like it one bit,
 ......there was no way around it...
It was probably close to the time for the break to end and the family conference to begin once again in the dining hall.
Her husband would have to protect the Ushiromiya family honor from his greedy siblings......all by himself.
If she grew emotional by his side, she would just tie him down.
...Though she knew that quietly waiting here was the best way she could support him, ........that didn\'t make the waiting any easier.
Natsuhi opened a drawer and took out the small box she kept her treasures in.
{n}This was her secret box.
Inside was everything from valuable items to mere odds and ends.
......However, they were all precious, memorable treasures in Natsuhi\'s eyes.
She pulled a small pouch out of the box.
She emptied its contents onto her palm.
.........It was a kind of charm that her birth family had given her when she had married.
...It was a spirit mirror to ward off evil.
Her face was reflected in the mirror.
......She wasn\'t as young as she once was.
Recently, she had begun to see a bit of her parents and grandparents in her own face.
So when she stared at her reflection in the mirror like this,
 she felt as though her soul had returned to the side of her parents and the family she had been born into...
"......Father, ...Mother......
 ......I cannot support my husband......and I have only myself to blame..."
Of course, her face in the mirror did not answer...
 However, Natsuhi continued.
"......I am waiting here alone because I love my husband.
 ......However, I think love means being close to one another.
 ......Though I understand logically that staying here is the best way I can help him,
 .........I still feel wretched for doing it...
 .........It\'s tough, isn\'t it, ......waiting for the sake of love..."
A tear plopped onto the mirror.
Old, dear memories of her life at her parents\' house rose up inside her.
Now was the time......for her to follow her parents\' example...
When her father came home late, her mother would always sit up straight waiting for him, prepared for him to arrive at any moment.
......She would always wait for him, kneeling in the entrance hall,
 and no matter how late he came home, she would always wake up all her children and line them up to greet him.
At the time, I only thought of her as being exceptionally strict,
 .........but at this age, I finally understand how strong she was, persevering in her love for her beloved husband even after being left alone in charge of the house.
"Because of your love for your husband,
 ......you couldn\'t bear to be made to care for an unfamiliar child."
"......?!?!"
The sudden voice made Natsuhi jump up and look about the room.
When she did,
 ......there stood a Western lady wrapped in an extravagant dress.
"Wh‐......who are you?!"
"........................"
Natsuhi was confused.
 There was no one like this in this mansion.
However, though this was supposedly her first time meeting this person, it felt as though she had seen her somewhere before...
Her anger at the ruffian who had snuck into her private room...
...and her confusion over the appearance of someone she didn\'t know caused her mind to go blank,
 ......so much so that it took quite a bit of time before she realized that this was the witch of the portrait.
"......Though you murdered a baby you didn\'t know on that day 19 years ago, I won\'t hold that sin against you."
"Wh‐
.........what are you...
t‐
talking about......?"
Beato had chosen Natsuhi as her sacrifice.
{n}It was because of what Natsuhi had done to "Battler".
Beato didn\'t know much about the details of Battler\'s birth.
.........However, after discovering the fragment of the previous game,
 she had learned that there was a chance that Battler was the baby that Natsuhi had pushed off a cliff 19 years ago.
Although that was just a blue wedge that Battler had used to protect Natsuhi from being framed,
 ......Beato thought it might have been a confession from Battler himself,
 and if that was the case, to her, Natsuhi was an enemy who probably forced Battler to live a painful life.
"It was out of love for your husband that you killed that baby who lacked his blood, and it\'s out of love that I won\'t hold it against you."
"I don\'t......have a clue what you\'re talking about!!
 Get out!! This is my room!!"
"Therefore,
 ......when I kill you for the sake of my love, please don\'t hold that against me either."
Beato slowly stuck out her arms......and with both hands, she squeezed the air in front of her.
......That squeeze......tightened around Natsuhi\'s throat.
"Ggh...
......ah...
......eh........."
Natsuhi\'s heels lifted off the ground, and a faint, purple hand shape appeared around her throat...
Natsuhi frantically scratched at her throat, trying to stop whatever was strangling her, but there was nothing there.
......So, to an outsider, it just looked as though Natsuhi was standing on her toes in anguish, scratching at her own throat.
".........Both pairs of lovers have shown their determination.
 ......I don\'t think...that my feelings for Battler‐san are inferior to theirs...
 ......Just as I won\'t blame you for your sin of 19 years ago, ......I won\'t blame myself for this sin...!"
".........Eh
.........gah
.........gghh..............."
As Natsuhi twisted in agony, something she had been grasping fell from her grip.
It rolled over to Beato, who dropped her gaze to see what it was...
......It was......Natsuhi\'s spirit mirror.
When Beato peered into it, .........there was a loud crack like a burst of electricity.
That sound released Natsuhi from the invisible hands...
and made Beato topple backwards like a doll.
"*cough*...*cough*cough*......?!
 ........................?!??"
Coughing, Natsuhi tried to comprehend what was going on around her.
Beato, whose head was still reeling and foggy as though she had hit it against something hard,
 slowly attempted to get to her feet.
Her eyes were bewildered, as though even she didn\'t really understand what had happened.
"......Wh‐......what...
............what is this......?"
"That is...surprising......
 You could touch spiderwebs without trouble, ......but you cannot handle the spirit mirror...?"
"E‐even I......don\'t have a clue what\'s happening...
 What in the world......"
She had thought that only Beato the Elder possessed non‐human weak points,
 such as getting burned by spiderwebs and wards and having her power sealed by spirit mirrors.
However, ......for some reason, this spirit mirror alone could apparently affect her as well.
Even she couldn\'t understand what about the spirit mirror could have such an overpowering effect on her.
"..................!!"
But Natsuhi was different.
She instantly realized that the reason for the hesitation of this unearthly being, this witch of the portrait, ......had to be the power of the mirror.
So, she rapidly crawled across the floor and picked up the mirror.
Then, she stuck it out so that Beato could see it...
......Beato still didn\'t fully understand what was happening,
 so, still sitting down, she looked vacantly at it.
And this time, both of them understood the situation completely.
Beato realized that the mirror was working some hateful power against her.
And Natsuhi realized that the spirit mirror had the power to repel witches.
"......Gghh......uuuuuhhh......!!
 Wh‐...why is...the mirror......?!"
"It is because you are an evil witch.
 .........This miraculous spirit mirror repels all creatures of evil...!"
".........Don\'t......point it at me......!"
With the spirit mirror still held out, Natsuhi cautiously closed the gap between them.
She was cautious, so as to prevent the witch from suddenly lashing out and stealing the mirror, ......but she steadily moved forward to corner this evil.
"I...I do not know who you are.
 ......All I know is that you tried to kill me,
 and that you are a creature of evil who cowers before this spirit mirror.
 ......Begone, evil one...!!"
Beato didn\'t understand what was happening herself.
......She didn\'t know why she had to fear this spirit mirror.
However, when she tried to look at the bright light let off by the spirit mirror, it pierced her eyes.
She understood that she had to be afraid, even if she didn\'t understand why.
By now, Beato realized that this spirit mirror was both terrifying and harmful.
As it came closer to her, she felt an increasingly strong burning sensation over her whole body, as though someone was approaching her with a hot iron.
 She couldn\'t even open her eyes because of the mirror\'s bright, painful glint...
"Uuuuu...
...ah...
......aaaaaaaahhh.........ah..."
"Now, return to the world whence you came, wicked one!
 I, Ushiromiya Natsuhi, will not falter back a single step to evil!"
......It\'s......no use......
{n}......Why......?
Why is this......musty mirror...so...
If I...
...lose here,
 .........I\'ll be the only one...
......to fail this trial......
Just like...
...George‐san and Shannon‐san,
 ......and Jessica‐san and Kanon‐san,
 ......I want Battler‐san to see value in me...
...and treasure me...
I\'ve...
...finally managed to admit that,
 .........so I can\'t...
...............fail now............
"Are you giving up?!
 You, and only you?!"
"Believe!
 The miracle of love will surely occur!"
......I...
......love...
...Battler‐san...
I want him to notice me.
{n}And I want him to recognize and accept my feelings......
My reason for calling him Father as I dedicated myself to him...
...was that no one helps a parent expecting something in return, and that helped me come to terms with getting nothing back...
It was...a deception to fool myself with......
{n}......I......love Battler‐san.
{n}And I want him to recognize that.
I admit it.
 I won\'t hide from it any longer.
......I was born to love Battler‐san...and to have him love me back......
"......So,
 .........I can\'t afford...
......to lose here........."
"Begone, wicked one!!
 There is no place for you here!"
"Nn, ......gwaah...!!!"
Her determination had come too late.
If she had possessed it since the beginning, ......she would probably have finished off Natsuhi on the spot without any hesitation.
Because she had wavered, it had taken time to kill Natsuhi, ......and things had ended up like this.
But now, I am resolved.
I want to love Battler‐san.
 I want him to love me.
"......So I can\'t...lose here...!
 Because I......was born for Battler‐san\'s sake...!!"
"Yes, that is exactly—"
"What we wanted to hear."
".........Ah...?!"
Following a sound like a beetle banging off all the walls in the room,
 the spirit mirror was knocked out of Natsuhi\'s outstretched hand.
It fell onto the floor,
 ......and the stake flying around the room pierced through it with a crash.
"Lucifer the Proud, right here!
 ......You dare mock me by having a single old mirror as my first target in so long?"
".........Huh?!
 Ah, ......Lucifer...san......?"
"{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, you must complete your trial...!
 She\'ll get away...!"
"S‐......someone!!
 Help me!!
 Someo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}one!!"
Now that the spirit mirror she had been relying on had been smashed, and another strange demon had been added to the fold, Natsuhi could do nothing but run for it.
However, if Natsuhi made a scene and people gathered, the anti‐magic toxin would burn Beato.
Now was Beato\'s last chance.
"Th‐......thank you, Lucifer‐san...!
 ............P‐prepare yourself, Ushiromiya Natsuhi...!"
".........Gggah!!
 Ghghhgg...............kk......"
Once again, Beato choked the empty air.
This time, she wouldn\'t let her escape.
She had to end Natsuhi\'s pain right away, for her sake if nothing else.
 ......But......her strength......wasn\'t enough......
While scratching at her throat, Natsuhi fought to escape the room.
......Her shaking hand...stretched out......to the lock on the door.
A locked room is one of the definitions that makes a witch.
{n}Even unlocking the door would strengthen the anti‐magic toxin a little.
Since Beato was at her limit even within the locked room, if Natsuhi undid that lock,
 ......Beato\'s power would weaken immediately, and Natsuhi would surely escape into the hallway.
Their strengths were matched.
 However, Natsuhi\'s began to surpass Beato\'s slightly...
The power of the living to live is fundamentally stronger than the power of magic.
Of course, Beato was mustering all her might.
 However, ......Natsuhi was just slightly......stronger......
".........That\'s enough.
 ......Lucifer, do it."
"A‐as you wish!"
Lucifer transformed into a stake, and, like the time she had smashed Natsuhi\'s spirit mirror, flew violently around the room.
 ......Then, she struck Natsuhi\'s forehead.
Natsuhi......crumpled slowly.
When Beato saw this, she also fell to her knees, breathing hard.
"Say, Zepar!
 Does this count?
 {f:5:Beatrice} didn\'t complete the trial by her own strength alone!"
"You raise a good point, Furfur!
 True, this trial must be accomplished without borrowing the help of any other!"
"But maybe there are exceptions to that?!"
""After all, a pair in love are as one!
 This is not outside assistance!""
".........B‐......Battler‐san......"
"Did you really have to scare me like that on the first twilight?"
"F‐......forgive me...
 I didn\'t follow your instructions..."
"Instructions?"
"......Well, .........I didn\'t stay in my room......"
Beato hung her head apologetically.
{n}......When he saw this, Battler scratched his head uncomfortably.
"In that case, ......I should apologize too.
 ......I should have been more kind."
"N‐
...no,
 ......Father,
 ......I...I mean...Battler‐san, you did nothing wrong..."
"It\'s okay. Call me whatever you like."
"Huh.........?"
Battler had always looked at the new {f:5:Beatrice} sternly.
However, that was gone from his expression now...
"......True, the old you may have called me just "Battler".
 ......At first, I might have tried to force you to speak to me that way.
 ......But forcing that on you is pointless.
 You are Beato...but you\'re yourself.
 .........You can call me whatever you want."
"B‐.........Battler‐san........."
"Sure, that works great.
 ......Can\'t say being called Father is really my thing."
"...Y‐.........yes..."
Until this point, she had hesitated just to say Battler\'s name at all.
Even if she had known that Battler wanted her to say his name without honorifics, that would have been beyond her right now,
 .........and even if she had been able to call him that, doing so could have hurt Battler even more.
However, ......now, she was allowed to call Battler by his name.
If you just looked into her eyes,
 ......there would be no need to describe just how happy this made her feel...
"I heard from Zepar and Furfur.
 ......It looks like you\'re in the middle of some bizarre game."
"Y‐yes...
 I\'m sorry for doing this without asking......"
"No, it\'s fine.
 I never did know what you were going to do next—getting up to antics like this is really like you.
 ......And...well, I\'ve heard about the intent of the game.
 Apparently, you\'re supposed to tackle it as a pair."
"Yes, that is correct, Lord {f:5:Battler}!!"
"If you can emerge from our trial victorious—"
""We will bless the pair of you and bestow a miracle of magic upon you!""
"It looks like these guys were the ones giving power to Beato\'s golden butterfly brooch.
 So they\'re proven to produce results.
 .........We\'ve been stuck with each other for a long time now.
 Nothing wrong with playing this sort of game every now and then."
"......Battler‐san............"
"Oh, did you hear that, Furfur?!
 It looks like Lord {f:5:Battler} is joining in as well!!"
"That\'s no surprise!
 After all, we\'ve known since the beginning!"
""Welcome to our trial, Lord {f:5:Battler}!
 And who will your sacrifice be?!""
"......My work is already done.
 Go and check if you want."
"Very well, Lord {f:5:Battler}!
 Come, Furfur, let us go check!"
"Yes, let\'s!
 But Zepar?
 This means that all six lovers have completed their trial!
 What should we do next?!"
""The resolve of all six is the real deal!
 Let us test them further in the next trial!""
The two noisy demons disappeared.
It seemed that they had left to go check on the sacrifice Battler had killed,
 ......but it also seemed that they had done so in order not to bother Battler and Beato, who could finally look each other in the eye and talk......
"......What do you think of the tale so far......?"
When suddenly asked this question, Ange immediately came to her senses...
Then, realizing that she had become immersed in this woman\'s tale,
 she felt a bit defeated and tried to look displeased.
"Y‐......you\'ve cleverly tried to mix things up with all this about the love trial,
 but exactly six people have died, setting up the first twilight.
 Impressive."
"Oh, you\'re right.
 I didn\'t realize."
Amakusa clapped his hands as though he\'d been outsmarted.
{n}Even though he\'d figured it out before me, he played the fool.
"......That\'s simply because the number of lovers just happened to be six.
 The fact that it matched to the number of the first twilight was half coincidence, half design.
 ......It\'s a bit more interesting that way—feels more like fate."
"Humans have the bad habit of taking two meaningless phenomena and trying to link them together.
 Trying to make things seem like fate is a "trick" of books."
"I guess you aren\'t a fan of <destiny> and <miracles>, missy."
"They\'re like UFOs.
 Everyone knows about them, but no one has ever seen them."
"There\'s a <cool> metaphor."
"......So.
 Normally, I would move right along at this point, my only comment being that love and illusions are unnecessary, useless scenes for a mystery story."
"......But Okonogi‐san disagreed with that way of thinking.
 He thought that, by looking at things without love that way, the truth could never be reached."
"Ah, you mean President Okonogi\'s killer phrase?
 Without love, it cannot be {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen}?"
"Yeah, that.
 ......If I were to set aside the anger I feel towards this fictional murder of {i:my} family...
...and speak with respect for you as the one who wrote this tale, I\'d say there must be a point to this depiction.
 After all, you\'ve used up all these pages talking about love and trials.
 ......In other words, those are the themes and key words of this tale."
"......Oho.
 ......And there are many who claim that all words not written in red ink are not worth reading.
 ......It is an honor, child of man,
 that you have read the black letters as well."
"Stories are written because the writer has something they want to communicate.
 And some writers feel that it\'s unrefined to lay everything out too directly."
".........All of this about how you\'ll never reach the truth without love has shown up many times in the works before this one.
 This new work makes that even more striking.
 ......It means that that is the one thing the writer wanted to tell the most—the thing that they want the reader to think about the most."
......Thinking about it, there have been many scenes about love since Beato first appeared.
Even when she first appeared before Shannon, she spoke clearly about how love was the single element of the world.
And the golden butterfly brooch she gave her......was also an item for love.
She said that she enjoyed sowing seeds of love and watching complications arise,
 and when Shannon stopped borrowing her power, the reason for her argument was also love.
......After Beato\'s interactions with Battler started up in full, scenes about love were toned down for a while,
 ......but the "without love, it cannot be {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen}" definition of magic was mentioned repeatedly.
Then, in the tale right before this one, where Beato had become like a doll,
 the scenes shown made it seem almost as though Battler and Beato accepted each other as adversaries......or possibly something more.
In the end, Battler regained some kind of memory, and his impression of Beato underwent a complete change.
......And then there\'s this game.
From the beginning and throughout, the word "love" has been repeated over and over again.
"The tale you wrote keeps talking about love.
 However, that\'s not the assertion of Maria onee‐chan or {f:5:Beatrice}.
 ......It\'s the assertion of Hachijo Tohya."
"......Correct.
 That is what I wanted to tell.
 And it is my own sort of "answer"."
"Answer?
 ......You\'re saying the entire incident of twelve years ago was caused by a trial of love started by strange demons?"
"Ridiculous.
 I didn\'t come here to read a romance novel you wrote.
 ......What I want to know about is the truth you claim to have reached."
"......Foolish child of man.
 ...I have exhausted so many words, and yet you still do not understand?"
With an obviously condescending gaze, Hachijo shrugged.
It was clear that she was trying to provoke Ange.
She was probably hinting, "If you can\'t stand talking with me, you can get out."
 Perhaps even, "If you\'re going to read my noble work and fail to understand it—what\'s more, not even try—
you can get out for that reason as well."
.........Under normal circumstances, Ange would already have thrown a fit and left.
However, ......Ange couldn\'t do that.
Though she found it sickening that a stranger was playing around with her family\'s fates in these stories,
 ......after reading this far through her tale, she was growing increasingly certain of something else.
......Just as Hachijo\'s followers said,
 ......this tale really did......have the same presence, the same scent, as the tales written by {f:5:Beatrice}.
The author was certainly different.
However, the tale had the same scent......because its author had arrived at the real truth...
Ange was beginning to acknowledge this.
......Hachijo Tohya......was one who had reached {f:5:Beatrice}\'s truth,
 .........an "Endless Witch" like {f:5:Beatrice}, who could add to the endlessly stretching parallel worlds of the cat box...
"......If one has reached {f:5:Beatrice}\'s truth,
 ......they can create a new tale, whoever they are.
 ......With this new manuscript, I\'m sure some other than myself will appear and reach the truth.
 .........Those people will be qualified to create new tales of their own."
"So there will be more and more Endless Witches..."
"Yes.
 And these many Endless Witches will add to {f:5:Beatrice}\'s cat box tale.
 ......The more they add to it, the more people will reach the truth..."
"......When that happens, the very first Endless Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}, will finally be rewarded for writing such long letters, packing them in bottles, and throwing them into the sea..."
"................................."
"......You could have yelled at me angrily and risen from your seat.
 However, you did not.
 .........Why?"
"I hate to admit it,
 ......but I\'m starting to think that your tale has some kind of truth or hint within it."
I already have my own ideas.
{n}However, that\'s no more than looking with a single eye.
Unless I accept a different viewpoint from my own and look at things from more than one angle, I\'ll never be able to see the truth in three dimensions.
That\'s my interpretation of "without love, it cannot be {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen}".
"That is as it should be, child of man.
 ......Perhaps, as the last surviving member of the Ushiromiya family,
 it was fated that you would find the truth and become an Endless Witch.
 ......I exist only as a guidepost to awaken you as the true successor.
 ......{f:5:Ange Beatrice}."
Sometimes, I have no idea what she\'s saying......
{n}But I\'m positive she knows something.
And maybe......she actually has reached the truth, as she claims...
......To summarize, I couldn\'t understand the truth from just the two message bottles {f:5:Beatrice} left behind,
 ......and since then, I\'ve been reading tale after tale of hints.
"Then......these "hints" are challenges, provoking me to think."
".........Precisely."
"Perfect.
 ......I\'ll find this truth you say you\'ve reached.
 ......I was meant to visit this place after all."
"You were indeed.
 ......It is because you are yet to arrive there that I invited you here, child of man......"
Let the truth I {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} and the truth you {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} overlap.
Just as you see things with a single eye, so do I.
And now that I\'ve found you, for the first time, I too will be able to {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} the truth with both eyes...
"Fwaaah......aaaahhh...
 So, the first twilight has fiiinally happened.
 Everything so far\'s made me so sleepy."
"......You have some sleep in your eye."
"Huh? Wh‐where...
 ......Th‐that was immature."
"......Hmph.
 As you wish, let\'s get started.
 ......We\'ll begin with the first twilight."Erika was dozing off on the bed, so when a knock sounded on the door,
 it took some time before she noticed.
She looked at the clock and saw that not much time had passed since she had lain down.
".........Yes, who is it?
 I hope you have a good reason for knocking on the detective\'s door at an hour like this..."
"That\'s right.
 ......I have one thing to say before we begin this game."
"Oh, that detective proclamation thing?
 Knock yourself out."
"No, just the opposite.
 ......I say we raise the stakes."
".........Raise...the stakes......?"
"What\'s this?
 Now that sounds interesting.
 What do you mean?"
"......It\'s simple.
 Battler got a shot off at us in the last game.
 So, if Erika does the same in this game, we\'re only even."
"Wasn\'t the last game a tie...?"
"We threw a game we should have won easily.
 If that isn\'t a loss, I don\'t know what is.
 Right, Erika...?"
"Y‐yes, my master.
 We were expected to win that game if I hadn\'t failed so miserably..."
"......Ooooh, I get it.
 So this time, you\'ll intentionally fight at a disadvantage by not making a detective proclamation...and win despite that...!
 You\'re aiming to not only wipe out your loss from the previous game, but to totally flip the score upside down, right?"
"Y‐......you intend to challenge the game Battler‐san poured his heart and soul into with a foolish handicap like that...?
 That is not only presumptuous, it\'s quite rude...!"
"......Sure is.
 It sounds more like an excuse just in case they lose."
"True, you could look at it that way.
 If they win, it\'s a great victory,
 but if they lose, Erika\'s side has a nice little excuse... Isn\'t that a bit unsporting?"
"Don\'t worry, the bet will be evenly balanced.
 ......If Erika can win this game as a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} without the detective proclamation, it will be impossible for Battler and the others to pick up the pieces of the witch illusion."
"......But on the other hand, should Erika lose, I\'m going to hurl that garbage detective into the depths of oblivion along with the worst possible fragment."
".............................."
"......See?
 Balanced, right?
 The ultimate victory of destroying the witch illusion as a mere {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}, not a superhuman "detective".
 ......In exchange for that, she wagers her own destruction."
"I\'ve gotten tired of the never‐ending stream of bland and boring games that you and the former Beato played.
 ......So we\'re raising the stakes and settling it all at once."
"......Well, that is true.
 ......If Battler can {i:sell} this game,
 it will mean that Battler has "won" Beato\'s game, and the game will come to an end.
 ......In a sense, this is the kind of finale you can\'t pass up, right...?"
".....................
 ......I understand your position.
 ......Are you fine with that, Erika?"
".........Y‐......yes, of course.
 ......In order to regain my master\'s trust in me, which I lost with my previous defeat, ...I...I will risk even my own destruction..."
"Is that of your own will...?"
".................."
"........................"
"............What\'s wrong, Erika?
 Answer him..."
"O‐.........obviously.
 This is my own will.
 ......I will not lose...
 ......Even without the detective proclamation, ...I...I will defeat you no matter what...!!"
"............Battler‐san........."
"...........................
 ......Alright.
 If that\'s what you want, I\'ll accept your challenge."
"..................
 ......Th‐thank you very much.
 I\'ll make sure you regret it."
"Come to think about it, when Battler played for the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} side, he never had anything as convenient as the detective\'s authority.
 He was only allowed blue truth and repetition requests."
"Exactly.
 In a way, it was the previous game that was truly unfair.
 .........We failed to win despite that, which is why it was no different from a loss."
"..........................."
"Do what you want.
 If you feel like making a detective proclamation, just do it whenever you like.
 ......I\'ll consider it to be an option you\'re keeping available."
"......Why would I ever need to do that......
against an opponent as weak as you......"
"........................"
"Then get started, you two.
 I\'m already starting to get bored."
"......Leave it to me, my master...!!
 I will destroy the witch illusion for you without fail...!"
George and Jessica had been the ones knocking on Erika\'s door.
They were asking whether Battler and Maria had come to this room.
 ......Of course, they hadn\'t.
"A good while ago, they went downstairs, saying they wanted to get something to drink.
 We thought they might have come to your room..."
"Of course they didn\'t.
 ......Are you sure they didn\'t go to the mansion?"
"We called the servant room and dining hall of the mansion, but no one picked up..."
"......Please stay here, you two.
 I\'m going to go check the mansion."
"H‐hey, it\'s dangerous to go out this late."
"How could a stranger sneak onto this sealed‐off island?
 Stay in that cousins\' room of yours.
 I\'ll contact you if anything happens.
 Also, tell the servants in the guesthouse servant room not to leave the building.
 Bye."
"W‐wait a second, Erika‐san...?!!"
"............She is a strange kid."
After speaking her mind and not listening to anything else, Erika dashed down the stairs and rushed outside.
"......The first twilight usually starts in the morning, but it looks like we\'ve got an early fight this time.
 ......No crime has occurred in the guesthouse.
 So, that means the stage of the tragedy is in the mansion..."
Though she had an umbrella up, Erika got drenched as she sprinted.
She brashly licked the raindrops that dripped down her face......
......Erika was now at her most energetic...
According to her memory of the previous game, the entrance to the mansion would be locked at the same time the family conference started.
However, the lock was undone this time.
......Had someone unlocked it, or had the lock not been set, or had it not been possible to set the lock?
"Well, no point thinking about it now.
 After all, that might just be a whim of the Game Master\'s."
As soon as she entered the entrance hall, the door to the parlor opened violently.
{n}Out of it flew Gohda\'s large body.
"Ah, good evening, Gohda‐san.
 Is something the matter?"
"A‐...awawawa....awawawa!!
 P‐police...ambulance...!!
 Awawawawawa!!"
That expression really is wonderfully pathetic.
{n}Just fitting for the first one to discover the crime.
"Please calm down.
 How could the police or an ambulance get to an isolated island in the middle of a typhoon?
 I\'m sure the phones are out anyway, so please calm yourself."
Krauss and Rudolf\'s yells could be heard from the parlor.
Their shaken appearance perfectly signified the arrival of the first twilight......
"Well then, give me the victims, the locations, and a reconstruction of the situation."
"......Those who left to take a break didn\'t come back, so the adults went to the parlor.
 When they did, the door was sealed from the inside, and they couldn\'t open it.
 As they would learn later, the hat stand in the parlor had been used to bar the double doors from the inside."
"So you\'re trying to say that the door was blocked from the inside, and the windows were also locked from the inside...?"
"That\'s it.
 ......When they went around and looked into the parlor through the window, they saw Rosa lying on the sofa in an unnatural position, with blood pouring from her forehead.
 ......They then smashed the glass, entered the parlor, and discovered that Maria was also there, lying by the wall and covered in blood."
"......I see.
 I\'m sure there was quite an uproar.
 And the other crime scenes?"
"The entrance wasn\'t locked when you came into the mansion...because they had gone out through it to check the parlor from the outside.
 ......Since the entrance was locked before the adults went through it, they thought that the other people who had gone missing might be somewhere within the mansion in a similar condition,
 so they\'re now searching the entire building..."
"Are the locations of the dead the same as in that long‐winded, putrid delusion of yours that you showed earlier?"
"......They\'re the same."
"Rosa and Maria were in the parlor.
 As for the others, ......Natsuhi was in her own room, and Kyrie was in Krauss\'s study.
 Eva was in the rose garden......no, wait, she was moved to the VIP room, wasn\'t she?"
"Yes.
 They discover Eva\'s body in the VIP room."
"That makes five victims.
 Ah, that\'s one short for the first twilight.
 Who\'s the sixth, and where are they?"
"......?!
 Krauss‐sama! The chain on this room is also set...!"
"Cut it!!
 The culprit might be hiding in there!!"
"Gohda, do it!"
Rudolf and Krauss had brought rifles from Kinzo\'s prized collection.
They yelled at Gohda, who was carrying the bolt cutter, to cut the chain.
Victims had been found one after another at several locations inside the mansion.
The men who had lost their wives searched through the mansion in a rage, looking for the culprit.
This was...a guest room.
It had previously been a room where the relatives would stay,
 but it hadn\'t been used much since the construction of the guesthouse.
This forgotten room was locked from the inside by the chain...
"......Nnnnn, .........hyaahh!!"
As soon as the chain was cut, Rudolf pushed Gohda aside and flew into the room.
"Who\'s in there?! Show yourself...!!"
"There\'s someone on the bed...!"
"Let\'s get some light, Aniki...!"
Krauss pushed the switch on the wall, ......the guest room lit up,
 and the figure lying on the bed came into view...
"B‐......Battler......!!
 D‐......dammit, ......what are you even......doing in here......?!"
Rudolf crumpled to his knees and fell onto Battler\'s body.
No words could console him as he cried with a mad sorrow...
......In a single night, ...he had lost both his wife and his son.
During this time, Krauss checked the window locks and the bathroom and searched the closet to find if anyone was hiding there, but he found no one...
"Battleeer...! Battleeeeeeer......! Dammiiiiit......! Aa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}hhh......"
"H‐......how sad......"
"......It\'s hard to believe, ......but just like the others, ......this is a locked room."
"Wh‐......what, again...?!"
"Yes......
 My study where Kyrie‐san was, Natsuhi\'s room, the VIP room with Eva, the parlor with Rosa and her daughter...
 ...And now Battler‐kun in this guest room.
 ......They\'re all locked rooms...
 ...I don\'t......understand...
 Are we to believe this is suicide...?!"
"Like hell it is...!!
 How could {i:this} be suicide?!
 Aaaaggggghhh......Battleeeeeeer......"
"Oh,
 ......there\'s a surprise.
 To think that you yourself would be the sixth person."
"It\'s more interesting to kill yourself off every now and then."
"And all of the crime scenes are locked rooms.
 ......They\'re murders that couldn\'t have been performed without magic."
"Hmph, isn\'t seeing through that the point of this game?
 ...By which I mean, the murders {i:must} be possible to commit without magic.
 ......After all, if they really could be done only with magic, this wouldn\'t be a game."
"......That\'s an interesting way of thinking about it.
 ......Yeah, that is the sort of game we\'ve been playing."
This game is fair.
The goal is to explain, without magic, the strange crimes that the opposing side claims to have carried out using magic.
{i:If that couldn\'t be done}, it wouldn\'t be a game.
In other words, just as Erika said, it has to be possible to perform the murders without magic...
......To view it from the opposite angle, the witch side has a certain responsibility.
They have to make a crime that can be {i:reproduced with tricks and not magic}.
As long as the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} side can\'t figure out those tricks, the witch side can use all kinds of magic and illusions.
......In other words, in order to carry out a locked‐room murder with magic,
 it is necessary to create a crime that is possible to carry out by {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} hands.
".........By now, I understand.
 I see why, when I ordered the Seven Sisters to kill my classmates back at Saint Lucia,
 ......they couldn\'t do what I told them.
 ......And I understand the meaning of Mammon\'s words."
"Do you mean that "magic is only capable of that which you can accomplish by your own hands"...?"
At that time,
 if I had possessed the determination to kill my classmates,
 ......no, that\'s not it.
At that time,
 if I had been capable of killing my classmates,
 capable of going through with it...
......then the Seven Sisters of Purgatory would probably have pulled it off for me.
They could only accomplish what I could do myself.
......No, that\'s not it either.
{n}They could take what {i:I} had accomplished and turn it into "magic".
Of course, there were a great number of witnesses in that classroom, so that would probably have been impossible.
 ......Maria onee‐chan would call it "being burned by the anti‐magic toxin".
However, ......if I had called those classmates out somewhere without witnesses, ......and carried out murder myself...
...that would be when "the Seven Sisters of Purgatory" could "carry out a magical murder".
"......Even with magic, witches cannot do things that they cannot accomplish by themselves.
 ......They can only use magic to "embellish" the things that are possible for them."
"......How interesting it is.
 ......That those who accomplish something without using magic nevertheless speak of magic and call themselves witches."
"This Erika person has understood that since the beginning.
 ......That\'s why she will never surrender to witches.
 ...She is confident that it must be explainable with tricks.
 The old Battler was toyed with so frequently because he did not possess that confidence..."
"......Once this rule is seen through, the witch loses any chance of victory.
 ......That\'s why they have to make their opponent surrender before they see the truth of this rule.
 ......The longer the match is drawn out, ......and the more hints are given, ......the more overwhelming the witch\'s disadvantage becomes..."
Once again, my thoughts are spinning in circles.
......Why did Beato prolong this game until she lost?
....................................
Many victims had been found, and the mansion was still wrapped in chaos.
Hideyoshi\'s group seemed to have gone to the guesthouse, worrying about the safety of the kids there.
Krauss and Rudolf were in the hall, talking about what should be done next...
During a short gap in this chaos,
 .........Erika dashed all about the mansion.
She was checking the crime scenes.
Normally, with the detective\'s authority, Erika had the right to openly investigate the crime scenes to her heart\'s content.
However, this time, she hadn\'t yet invoked that authority.
 ......Because of that, and with her being a guest and an outsider, there was little to no chance that she would be allowed to investigate.
So, she was forced to quickly check all of the crime scenes now,
 while she could still run about as she pleased.
In the servant room, there had been a clear folder containing a plan of the mansion\'s interior.
Because she had borrowed that, she knew the location of every room in the mansion...
Erika efficiently made her way through the mansion, dashing into each crime scene in turn...
"Lady {f:5:Erika}, ......I believe you know, but allow me to warn you just in {f:5:case}."
"Yes? What is it?"
"It is true that you have an incredible photographic {f:5:memory}.
 ......When you combine that with the detective\'s proclamation, it becomes impossible for you to be fooled by {f:5:anything}."
"Oh, I know what you\'re going to say.
 ......Since I haven\'t made the detective proclamation, even my photographic memory could potentially be fooled.
 Of course, I understand that.
 ......Still, that doesn\'t mean I can afford to go without viewing the crime scenes directly."
"......After all, in the last game, my pride in that regard led me to commit a truly agonizing blunder."
"To take an extreme case, no matter how well you examine a person\'s corpse right now,
 the possibility will always remain that they were faking their {f:5:death}.
 It will probably be necessary to give Battler repetition requests to confirm the details of each situation {f:5:individually}."
"And I\'ll need to use the blue truth liberally in order to draw those out of him.
 ......I know that.
 Let\'s start with the basics.
 ......The lack of the detective\'s authority is no handicap.
 It simply means that I\'m fighting under the same conditions Battler once was."
Yes.
 This fight......is retracing the old days when Battler and Beato fought so fiercely.
I have no conveniences such as the detective\'s authority.
......I truly do just have to fight the same way the old Battler fought.
Thinking of it this way,
 it may be true that I was in a very blessed, unfair position last game, just as my master said...
It may be difficult without the detective\'s authority, which also holds my honor as a detective.
But I won\'t let that be a handicap.
I know what magic is, and I\'m fully aware of how to fight with the red and blue truths.
I know the way to fight in this game many times better than the old Battler did......
I quickly visited the VIP room, Krauss\'s study, and Natsuhi\'s room on the second floor, as well as the parlor and the guest room on the first floor,
 this time checking with my own eyes, as I had neglected to do in the last game...
First off, all of the scenes were made to look like locked rooms.
Probably of special note is the fact that the master keys have no relation to the tricks this time.
The locked rooms were all constructed...
...without relying on any elements that could be locked or unlocked from the outside by a master key or something else.
The windows were locked from the inside, and the doors were all locked and chained.
The master key can get around all of the locks on the doors, but the window locks and the chain locks are more trouble than they might appear.
I haven\'t yet used a repetition request to get confirmation that it\'s impossible to manipulate them from the outside, ......but I\'m sure he\'ll be able to say it in red.
 It\'d be stupid otherwise.
"......I understand.
 Right now, I am a mere {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.
 ......I can\'t even properly confirm the deaths of the corpses."
......Last time I neglected to check the bodies, ......and let a massive piece of "magic" get by me.
I won\'t fail like that again......
If I let that happen even once more,
 ......I won\'t be able to face the master I\'m so indebted to......
"We have checked all of the crime scenes and finished gathering {f:5:information}.
 Here is our {f:5:report}."
"Go ahead."
"First, all of the rooms employ window locks and chain locks...
to form locked rooms in a way that would be "difficult to interfere with from the {f:5:outside}".
 The only exception is the parlor, where Rosa and Maria lay {f:5:dead}."
"For your attention: I beg to inform you of the following.
 Let it be known that the door was barred with a hat stand."
"It is thought to be substantially the same as a chain lock, in that it can only be set from the inside."
"It is probably his goal to construct locked rooms where explanations using master keys are made completely {f:5:ineffective}.
 The parlor has no chain lock due to its very nature, so it is natural that something else would be used in place of a {f:5:chain}."
"......In that case, the interesting question becomes why he didn\'t choose one of the other rooms that do have a chain lock.
 There are several other guest rooms besides the one Battler lay dead in, all with a similar construction, correct?"
"Yes, that is {f:5:correct}."
"In that case, it would have been more aesthetically pleasing to lock them in there, so that everyone would be inside a room locked by a chain, yet he did not do that.
 ......This hat stand door bar in the parlor seems very suspicious.
 I should probably investigate it thoroughly with repetition requests.
 Also, regarding the bodies, ......in the last game, their throats were sliced wide open...
to the point that the deaths could be confirmed with certainty even without the detective\'s authority, but was there anything like that this time around?"
Of course, she had checked all of the corpses in all of the crime scenes this time.
......However, without the detective\'s authority, she had no guarantee that she would be able to see through any faked deaths "with certainty"...
The old Battler had also started fighting by doubting whether the victims were truly dead.
It was the same for Erika......
"For your attention: I beg to inform you of the following.
 Know that there were no corpses that could have been confirmed dead with certainty by physical means."
"For your attention: I beg to inform you of the following.
 We cannot eliminate the possibility that any one of these corpses might be a faked death."
"......Well, even if I make a repetition request to confirm their deaths, I doubt Battler will be so quick to answer.
 ......Sheesh......"
"I liked Beato\'s chain of six locked rooms better.
 ......But these locked rooms are more complete, considering that master keys are of no help at all."
"......There are two general ways of breaking locked rooms that Battler might be after.
 ......An illusion of a locked room, or an illusion of a crime.
 It\'ll be one of those."
"I get the first one.
 That\'s when something looks like a locked room, but it actually isn\'t, right?
 What do you mean by an illusion of a crime?"
".........An illusion that makes it seem as though a crime has occurred.
 In other words, are they really dead?"
"Come on, are you kidding me?
 If the person inside a locked room is alive, it\'s no different than if they were just taking a pee.
 ......Still, with this locked room,
 it\'s pretty hard to think of any other answer."
"What about the endless possibilities of manipulating the chain lock from the outside?
 We don\'t know if there are secret doors, ways to kill from a distance, chances of suicide,
 or even whether these are complete locked rooms in the first place."
"......I have a behind‐the‐scenes view of Battler\'s game board, so I can tell you this:
 these are perfect locked rooms.
 They can only be constructed from the inside, and there\'s no way to construct, deconstruct, or interfere with them from the outside."
"Can you say that in red?"
"That\'d be a little too rude to Battler, so no.
 If you do love me, you must see my words as red truth, right...?"
".........Then the locked rooms are perfect.
 In other words, this is an illusion of a crime."
"It does seem that way.
 If so, these locked rooms are all a ruse.
 ......I guess the whole Ushiromiya family got so fed up with Erika prattling on about being a detective and not knowing when to shut up...
...that they all joined together and set up a fake murder to make fun of her, or something?
 Wait, is that the right answer?
 I\'m, like, a {i:super} great detective{p:0:☆}"
"Unfortunately, ......this isn\'t a ruse.
 The victims have been thoroughly killed."
"Huh?!
 And you\'re not talking about "at midnight on the second day"?"
"No detective proclamation has been made, but she is very accurate when examining corpses.
 I could almost even give her examinations the red truth."
"So what does that mean?
 That they were definitely dead when Erika examined their corpses?"
"Yes, that\'s right.
 Well and truly."
"But you won\'t say it in red for her, riiight?
 *giggle*, and that poor Erika must want it so baaad."
"Well, she isn\'t even a detective this time around.
 I won\'t give her any red. *giggle*giggle*."
"But then, .......if that\'s all true, that\'s amazing!
 This time, ......Battler\'s really made a perfect locked‐room murder!"
"......Oh, perhaps he has."
"Will Erika be alright?
 It looks like an ordinary locked‐room murder at a glance,
 ......but this one is secretly pretty nasty.
 Won\'t this be a bit too much for Erika without her detective\'s authority...?"
"She is a self‐proclaimed "great detective".
 I\'m sure she\'ll pull through.
 .........If Battler and Beato are defeated by a mere {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} who isn\'t even a detective, they\'ll fall apart in the most exquisite way, don\'t you think?"
"......And even if Erika loses, we get to play by throwing her into the worst fragment and casting her into the depths of oblivion, right?"
"Exactly.
 No matter how the chips fall, it won\'t be boring for us."
"You really don\'t have one tear to shed or a drop of blood in your veins, do you?
 ...Still, wringing that black cat out like a towel and licking up the single drop that comes out is what brings me joy!"
"Beato\'s game board did entertain me for quite some time,
 ......but we\'ve already wrung everything we can from it."
"......It\'ll be over with this game.
 So if we\'re going to cap it off properly, we really must let Erika and Battler bet everything in one final face‐off."
"......Booo.
 I wanted to play this game with you forever.
 ......What a shame."
"Come now.
 I\'ve spent plenty of time with you already.
 ......Go find me another interesting game board.
 If you do, I\'ll play with you again..."
"Ahhhh..................you really don\'t ever let me get bored.
 ......Be like this forever, {f:5:Bernkastel}.
 Seeing your face twist with anguish is the one forbidden honey I\'ve found for myself."
{f:5:Lambdadelta} had guaranteed that it was a perfect locked room.
{n}{f:5:Bernkastel} had guaranteed that it was a perfect murder.
A perfect
 "locked‐room"
 "murder".
The witches hated to be a killjoy, so they wouldn\'t yet say anything with the red truth.
......Pursuing that would be the role of Battler and Erika......
"It seems like you had a pretty mad dash around the crime scenes.
 ......Satisfied? Is your inspection complete?"
"Yes, I\'m satisfied.
 So, about our war of red and blue, what are your thoughts?
 Shall we start right away?
 Or do it all at the end?"
"I don\'t like putting things off.
 I think the same goes for you."
"Then allow me to get started with the locked rooms of the first twilight.
 ......First, I\'d like to check.
 Do you intend to respond to my repetition requests?"
"That depends on what they are.
 I have no obligation to respond to all of them, and I won\'t reveal my reasons when I refuse."
"<Good>.
 ......Then let\'s start simple and confirm the definition of a locked room.
 Dlanor!
 Please read it aloud."
"{f:5:Understood}.
 ......We request that the following be {f:5:repeated}."
Dlanor unfurled the kind of scroll often depicted in Western fairy tales when an official reads a royal decree,
 and she read the contents aloud.
"First.
 "The rooms with the six people in them are all locked {f:5:rooms}"."
"{p:1:Acknowledged}.
 Of course, that\'s only until Gohda and the others severed the chains and destroyed the locked rooms."
At a nod from Dlanor, Cornelia, who stood behind her, started taking notes.
"Second.
 "The definition of locked room implies that it is impossible to construct from the {f:5:outside}"."
"{p:1:Acknowledged}."
"......In other words, no trickery done from the outside can construct a locked room.
 It isn\'t permitted for a chain lock to be reset from the outside by a skillfully used wire, for example."
"I didn\'t need you to tell me that.
 Dlanor, please continue."
"Third.
 "The definition of a locked room implies that all forms of interference between the inside and outside of the room are {f:5:prevented}"."
"{p:1:Acknowledged}.
 However, I won\'t rule out the kinds of interference that you\'d expect from a normal room, such as knocks, voices, and the extension telephone line."
"Fourth.
 "At the time of the breaking of the locked rooms, none existed within the rooms except the {f:5:victims} (Natsuhi, Eva, Kyrie, Rosa, Maria, Battler)"."
"{p:1:Acknowledged}."
This was to check that the murderer hadn\'t been hiding inside a locked room.
Because if the discoverers departed the scene after becoming aware of the locked‐room murder,
 and then the culprit slipped out of the room after that, it would have been possible to construct an illusion of a locked room.
Because Battler had acknowledged their statement with the red truth,
 this possibility—that the culprit and the victim had both been inside the locked room at the time of the crime, following which the culprit had hid under the bed and snuck out after the discovery of the crime—
had now been eliminated.
"Fifth.
 "No murder was committed after the breaking of the locked {f:5:rooms}"."
"I decline."
"......Why?
 Because the victims really were alive at the point when the locked rooms were destroyed?
 And the culprits were actually Krauss and the others who crowded in, who committed the murders then and there.
 In other words, because it was a murder after the locked room was destroyed. Is that the truth behind this...?!"
"No, that\'s not it.
 The murders will continue to occur, so he can\'t declare in red that no murders will happen after this."
"......Tch, a stupid technicality.
 You must understand what we\'re getting at.
 {p:2:Krauss\'s group cut the chains and destroyed the locked rooms, then killed the people inside}.
 I just want you to argue against this."
"Lady {f:5:Erika}, ......the undefined plurality of "Krauss\'s group" is {f:5:insufficient}.
 You should first check to see which humans entered the rooms after the locked rooms were {f:5:broken}."
"For your attention:
 ......excepting the victims, the only ones to enter the locked rooms were these four: Krauss, Rudolf, Hideyoshi, and Gohda."
"For your attention:
 this is based on hearsay.
 Be advised that there is no proof that others did not enter."
"I know that already.
 Let\'s have him repeat that.
 ......‘After the breaking of the locked rooms, the only ones to enter the rooms apart from me were these four: Krauss, Rudolf, Hideyoshi, and Gohda’."
"Sure.
 {p:1:Acknowledged}.
 However, this only applies to the current point in time.
 It\'s possible that some later development in the game will cause more people to enter."
"Repetition requested.
 "Krauss, Rudolf, Hideyoshi, and Gohda are not culprits"."
"........................"
Battler put his finger on his chin, deep in thought.
This word "culprit" was fairly broad.
 And it might serve to greatly restrict the darkness of the witch.
".........Why not answer?
 If we decline, they\'ll leave behind a blue truth saying that Krauss and the others were the culprits."
"........................
 ......You\'re right.
 ......I\'ll acknowledge it, but I\'ll make the language more strict.
 {p:1:Krauss, Rudolf, Hideyoshi, and Gohda—
these four had no involvement in murdering these six: Natsuhi, Eva, Kyrie, Rosa, Maria, and Battler}."
"And that means it was also impossible for any of the other humans, who didn\'t even enter the locked room,
 to have been involved in those murders either, doesn\'t it?"
"Who knows. Think about it yourself.
 If you think you can build up some blue truth for how a locked‐room murder can be committed without entering the room, then I\'ll respond with the red truth."
"......However, I only need to destroy one of the blue truths you\'ll be presenting from here on out.
 In other words, even if you do manage to use the blue truth and explain this away with some long‐distance locked‐room murder trick X,
 I don\'t necessarily have to counter that with the red truth."
These are the rules of the witch\'s game.
Ange checked these details with Beato in the fourth game.
The witch side lays out mystery after mystery and claims them all to be impossible to carry out except by magic.
The human side must use the blue truth to argue that they are explainable with tricks.
And if they cannot make a counterargument with the blue truth for even one of these mysteries,
 that mystery will be considered to have been "done by magic",
 and it will be impossible to deny the existence of a witch...
In other words, the witch side only needs to protect any one of its mysteries.
In contrast, the human side has to fully explain all mysteries with the blue truth.
And even if the human side manages to explain all of the mysteries with the blue truth,
 if any one of those is successfully countered by the red truth, the witch will win.
Therefore, just like the strategy that the old Beato adopted in her final game,
 it is sufficient for the witch side to put off their red text counterarguments until the very last moment,
 then make a single strike at their opponent\'s most fragile spot......
"In any event, ......you\'ve declined to repeat that last one, right?"
"Don\'t kid yourself.
 You\'re not entitled to have your repetition requests answered."
".........Ggh......"
From the perspective of the witch side, repetition requests are just a supplement to make sure that the human side hasn\'t misunderstood the question.
Therefore, they have neither a technical nor a moral obligation to respond to requests that are extremely broad...
"......Not bad. ......Looks like you can handle being a player on the witch side pretty well too."
"Your experience is no match for mine."
"Tch...! Dlanor!"
"Let us {f:5:continue}.
 Sixth, "the victims did not die by any method other than {f:5:homicide}"."
"{p:1:Acknowledged}."
"Of course, there were no suicides or accidental deaths."
"Seventh, ‘the victims—"
"That\'s enough, Dlanor."
"......Are you {f:5:sure}?
 There are still items..."
"Yes, that will do fine.
 I\'ve confirmed the status of the crime scenes.
 From here on, it\'s time for me to argue back with the blue truth."
"Fine by me.
 Let me hear your masterful theories."
Though Battler and Erika were enemies,
 ......it looked to Beato as though they were having a little fun doing it.
......She was probably slightly jealous of Erika.
Beato thought back on the books she had read in {f:5:Featherine}\'s archives, in which the old her and Battler had fought.
 ......That must have been fun as well.
During a short break in the family conference, a horrible, brutal mass murder had occurred...
Excluding Battler, the six people killed had all been women......
The men who had been left behind went mad with rage at the cowardice of it, broke down sobbing at the sadness of losing their wives, ......and went back and forth between the two many times......
"Why were they all girls......?
 How cowardly can a person be...?"
"What\'s wrong with us?!
 Here we are, under the same roof, and we\'re just smoking away, not noticing that members of our own family are being killed...dammit!!"
"......But...who......how...?
 They were not unprotected...
 The chain was set for all of them..."
"Who gives a damn about that?!
 I don\'t care how they killed them, I just want to know who!!"
"Hey, Genji‐san, Gohda‐san.
 Were the doors and windows to the mansion all locked during the family conference...?"
"Y‐yes.
 There can be no doubt...!"
"......In accordance with Madam\'s instructions, everything is always locked at the time of the night patrol.
 Tonight was a special case, but everything was locked up shortly after seeing the children off to the guesthouse..."
"That doesn\'t make any sense...!
 If that\'s true, how were Battler and Maria‐chan inside the mansion?!
 They shouldn\'t have been able to get in, right?!"
"If everythin\' really was locked up properly, that couldn\'t have happened...!
 Doesn\'t the two of them bein\' inside the mansion prove that the building wasn\'t completely locked up...? Right? Right?!"
He was arguing that Gohda\'s failure to lock up properly might have allowed a stranger to sneak in.
At the very least, none of them had known that Battler and Maria had visited the mansion.
If those two had come and found everything locked tight, they wouldn\'t have been able to get inside.
If they had rung the doorbell, Gohda would probably have heard them from the servant room, but Gohda said that nothing of the sort had happened.
 How they had entered the locked mansion was a complete mystery...
"Y‐you don\'t think......
 For example, what if Madam or someone happened to be close by the entrance...
and noticed Battler‐sama and Maria‐sama knocking or heard the bell......?"
"That couldn\'t have happened!
 You were in the servant room then, right, Gohda‐san?!
 There\'s a chime that goes off in the servant room when the front door opens!
 There\'s no way you\'d have missed anyone!"
"Y‐yes, but, you see......"
"......At that time, Gohda was serving drinks as you requested,
 so he was not in the servant room."
"Why was there only one servant in the mansion on such an important day?!
 Why was someone as important as Genji‐san on duty in the guesthouse?!
 Does that make any sense?!
 Why was the servant room left empty...?!!"
"......My wife was the one who put those shifts together.
 ......She probably hoped that Gohda would serve some fashionable drinks during the family conference as well, since he often thinks to do such things..."
"But Krauss nii‐san...!
 This is the family conference, right?!
 The most important day of the year, right?!
 Why was Gohda‐san left as the only person on shift in the mansion...?!
 If there\'d been just one more person, everythin\' would be different, don\'tcha think?!
 Well? Well?!"
With a half‐crying, half‐enraged jumbled up expression,
 Hideyoshi yelled at Gohda.
Of course, the culprit who killed everyone was the most to blame and the most despicable.
......However, even if he understood that,
 he needed to let off some of his emotions by hating someone he could see.
"............I understand how distressing this must be for all of you.
 ......However, please calm down."
"......I don\'t know whether Gohda‐san wasn\'t thorough enough when locking up,
 ......or whether someone let Battler‐san and Maria‐san in after they came back from the guesthouse, and then forgot to lock up afterwards.
 ......But whatever the case, it doesn\'t necessarily have anything to do with how the mysterious culprit snuck in."
"......After all, the mansion is massive.
 They might have come in much earlier and hid until late at night for all we know.
 ......I can understand the desire to suspect someone, but please calm down."
"......Our guest is right.
 ......The culprit is the one we should hate, ......not Gohda, who just happened to be on duty...
 ......At any rate, let\'s calm down.
 ......I feel as terrible as the rest of you.
 However, we must take the initiative now and regain our composure."
"Aniki......"
"We all feel sad and devastated.
 And none of us will ever forgive the one who did this.
 That is why we all need to regain our composure..."
"......H‐......he\'s right.
 ......I still have George.
 Krauss nii‐san still has Jessica‐chan.
 And Rudolf‐kun, ...you still have Ange‐chan waitin\' for you to return, right?
 It\'s still......too soon...to go riskin\' everything to take down the killer......"
"......The culprit is still on this island.
 And we can\'t be sure that this tragic crime is over.
 We need to stay calm and prevent any further tragedies."
Erika\'s words softly consoled them...and gently admonished them.
......If a servant had said the same thing, Rudolf would probably have jumped on him.
However, since it had come from the lips of the guest, a neutral party, ......it seemed to reach their ears.
"Let\'s stay cool.
 ......We have three grown men with us, and guns as well.
 Judging by the pattern of the murders, the chances that the culprit has a gun are low.
 ......In other words, as long as we keep our heads, the culprit will no longer have any way to touch us."
"......She\'s right.
 We can\'t let that murderer have his way on our island any longer."
"Let\'s find the killer!
 We\'re in the middle of a typhoon.
 They can\'t escape from the island, and there\'s only so many places where they can take shelter from the rain...!"
"This island is larger than you\'d think.
 Unfortunately, it would be difficult to search the island with so few people.
 ......After all, you all look ready to shoot the culprit dead on the spot if you were to find them now.
 If the culprit has fled into that dense forest fearing for their life, you won\'t find them easily."
"...........................
 ......Right.
 ...We should just wait patiently for the typhoon to pass,
 have the boat call the police for us, and let them thoroughly search the island...
 The police are incredible, y\'know.
 They\'ll bring hundreds of people and pick through it with a fine‐toothed comb.
 ......That forest may be deep, but they\'ll definitely smoke the killer out..."
"The most important thing now...
...is to make sure no more of our beloved family members are taken from us.
 .........Rudolf.
 If something happens to you, what will happen to Ange‐chan back home?"
"......Kyrie............Battler.........
 .........Dammit, ......dammiiiiiiit......
 ......I never......had a chance.........to tell you the truth........."
"........................
 ......Krauss‐san.
 I\'m sure that everyone in the cousins\' room is extremely agitated right now.
 ......If you show them that you\'ve regained your composure, I\'m sure that will help them relax a lot.
 ......Would you mind heading up there?"
".........Good point.
 We have to talk with everyone about what we\'re going to do next."
"Please go up with him, Genji‐san and Gohda‐san.
 ......I\'m sure that Shannon‐san, Kanon‐san, and Kumasawa‐san are all very agitated as well."
"Y‐......yes...!
 Yes, I\'m sure everyone is quite agitated......!"
".........Are you certain?
 ......Is there nothing more we can help with?"
"That\'s the very reason I want you to go with Krauss‐san.
 I want you there to help him if something happens.
 ......I\'d like for the rest of us to check that everything\'s locked up here.
 We\'ll head up soon, so please go on ahead."
"Understood......
 ......If you need anything, please call us."
Genji bowed and nodded to Krauss.
Krauss nodded to Erika, then headed upstairs with Genji and Gohda.
.........When only men are around in a time of confusion, it is easy for a composed member of the opposite sex to control the initiative.
Even without the detective\'s authority, she was able to control them quite naturally.
Erika had wanted to get rid of the servants for the time being......
"Okay.
 In that case, let\'s get to checking the locks."
"The problem is the big window in the lounge.
 It looks like it doesn\'t even have shutters.
 If they smash this, we won\'t be able to stop them from comin\' in."
"Don\'t worry, the sound of the glass smashing will be more than enough warning.
 We\'ll turn them to Swiss cheese!"
"......Quiet, please.
 I didn\'t have you stay down here to check the doors and windows.
 ......Please listen calmly to what I\'m about to say."
When Erika lowered her voice, Rudolf and Hideyoshi realized that she had something secret to talk about,
 so they brought their ears closer as soon as they regained their composure...
"Are you ready?
 This crime happened during a short break in the family conference.
 ......In that tiny span of time, six people were killed without anyone noticing—I can\'t imagine that was the result of any haphazard crime.
 This crime was committed by someone who knew the layout of this mansion well, inside and out."
"......W‐......well..............."
".........S‐sure, if they didn\'t know the inside well, then......
 B‐but still......"
A short while ago, they had lambasted Gohda, suspecting the servants of having made a blunder.
However, they had only thought that he had forgotten to lock up, and were attacking him for letting the mysterious culprit sneak in.
 .........They hadn\'t considered that one of the servants they knew so well might have taken those lives with their own hands.
...No, they hadn\'t wanted to think that.
People can\'t easily suspect someone they know well...
...of being a killer......
"At the time of the crime,
 the mansion was locked from the inside, and only those involved with the family conference existed there."
"So, what, you\'re saying {i:Aniki} killed Kyrie and the others?!
 Or am I supposed to suspect Hideyoshi nii‐san?!
 It\'s impossible, unthinkable!!"
"I\'ve never even considered suspectin\' Krauss nii‐san or Rudolf‐kun...!!
 All of us siblings were happily married!
 True, the Ushiromiya family may be strict with discipline and money.
 But that doesn\'t mean we treasure our own families less than any other family would...!"
"Yes, of course I believe that.
 I wouldn\'t dream that any of you would kill your own wives."
Erika had already received red truth proof from Battler that they were not the murderers.
 So, there was no need to argue that point...
Krauss, Rudolf, Hideyoshi...and Gohda.
 .........None of those four was the killer.
.........And yet, .........Erika said this......
"However, ......what about Gohda‐san?
 He was in the servants\' quarters the whole time during the family conference, in a position to act without anyone else\'s knowledge."
"Hold up, let\'s not jump the gun on suspectin\' Gohda‐san!
 He came to bring us drinks in the dining hall during the break.
 ......He was with us for a good long while.
 I can\'t imagine he had the time to kill six people...!"
"......But he might have been able to let the actual killer into the mansion."
"Precisely.
 ......Gohda‐san probably didn\'t kill them himself.
 However, it\'s very possible that he secretly welcomed the actual murderer into the mansion."
Rudolf and Hideyoshi, stunned, looked at each other.
They were all family.
 Even the wife of a sibling was still family.
 ......The siblings may have harbored hatred for each other, but they could never have hated each other\'s {i:wives} enough to kill them.
Although Eva and Rosa were part of the sibling circle of hate,
 there could be no reason for a sibling to kill any of the others who had died—Natsuhi, Kyrie, Battler, or the young Maria...
But......to a servant like Gohda......perhaps everyone was little more than a complete stranger.........
"I suspect the servants on two counts.
 First, the victims are familiar with them, and there were no signs of a struggle at any of the crime scenes.
 I\'m sure you\'re all well aware that none of the rooms were the least bit disturbed."
"......I thought that too.
 ......Kyrie\'s used to fighting, like hell she\'d get killed that easily without resisting.
 That woman wouldn\'t hesitate to bite your finger off...
 It does make more sense if the culprit was someone she knew, who suddenly attacked when her guard was down..."
"C‐come to think of it, same goes for my Eva...
 She knows a dozen kinds of martial arts.
 She spends every day practically wishin\' for some ruffian to attack her.
 She wouldn\'t have been killed off in a snap like that...!"
".........Then what about Rosa‐san, in the parlor?
 Do you think she would allow herself to be easily killed by a stranger, without resisting, while she had her only daughter with her?
 And this tells us something else that\'s important."
"Somethin\' important...?"
".........There\'s more than one culprit..."
"Y‐......you\'re right...
 Both Rosa‐san and Maria‐chan were in the parlor.
 The culprit must have killed them both at the same time, or they\'d have made a hell of a racket.
 And if they were able to do that, there can\'t have been just one of them..."
"When it came to Maria‐chan, Rosa was like a quick‐to‐anger mother bear.
 ......She wouldn\'t cower in fear, not even if someone pointed a gun at her.
 .........I see, so it had to have been people who wouldn\'t rouse Rosa\'s suspicion until the last second..."
"......I believe you can see already that the idea of an unknown outsider sneaking onto the island is actually the less realistic.
 Whoever they are, they\'re familiar with this island.
 And there\'s more than one of them."
There is more than one culprit...and they know the island.
Erika\'s reasoning......pointed clearly at the ones they should suspect and guard themselves against.
".........So, ......you suspect the servants......"
"Yes.
 Under the current circumstances, they are the most suspicious.
 ......The second reason I have for suspecting them is the fact that the locked rooms were formed with chain locks."
"Why do the chain locks make them suspicious?"
"......What if there was no chain lock on the locked rooms?"
"That\'s not much of a locked room.
 Anyone could make a room like that with nothin\' more than a master key."
"......Yes, ...I see...
 .........The servants had to seal them with the chains so that they wouldn\'t be suspected..."
"Exactly.
 ......By setting the chain, they don\'t have to worry about being suspected.
 ...To turn it around, if the chains weren\'t set, they wouldn\'t be able to avoid suspicion since they hold the master keys."
"So, ......the only ones with somethin\' to gain from settin\' the chains......are the servants......"
"I\'m not trying to protect them or anything, ......but if so, how did they actually set the chains?!
 Is it possible to set them from the outside?!"
"Considering how they are built, I don\'t think that would be impossible.
 ......Have you ever heard this story?
 Apparently, some mailmen who deliver to apartment mailboxes are known to carry loops of wire with them."
"Yeah, ......I\'ve heard of that.
 Apartment mailboxes often have similar adjoinin\' boxes around them for the nearby room numbers.
 I hear that sometimes, when the mailmen aren\'t bein\' careful enough, they accidentally deliver letters to the next room over."
"Those mailboxes are almost always locked.
 If you put the mail into the wrong one, you\'d have no way of getting it out..."
......In that situation, they are supposed to tell the owner of that mailbox about their mistake,
 have that person unlock the mailbox for them, and retrieve the improperly delivered mail.
However, the resident of that apartment would often be out.
 And going through that process would be a real pain.
Because of that, some mailmen would make a little tool out of wire with a hook at the end,
 and use that to fish the mistakenly delivered postcard out through the crack of the mailbox...
"......I\'ve heard something similar from a friend of mine at a building management company.
 ......They sometimes get drunks who lock themselves in a toilet stall and fall asleep,
 so to get them out of there, they stick a thin, metal tool through the crack in the door and undo the latch..."
"Exactly.
 All industries have little tools that can easily open things that normally can\'t be opened.
 .........It wouldn\'t be particularly surprising if the servants of a mansion had something of the sort."
"...........................G‐......good point..."
"......Once you figured out the knack of it,
 you could probably {i:set} the chain from the outside by using a wire as well.
 .........Yes, ......we can\'t be sure that it\'s impossible..."
......True, physically speaking,
 one couldn\'t say for sure that there existed absolutely no way to set and unset chain locks from the outside.
Chain locks allow for the door to be opened a crack.
If a person were to stick something through that crack, ......they should be able to manage it easily...
 ......It was very natural for Rudolf and Hideyoshi to think that way.
However, Erika knew better.
Though it might be possible in reality, ......it had already been declared with the red truth that these locked rooms could not have been constructed from the outside.
 In other words, it was impossible to manipulate the chain lock from the outside.
And yet.
 ......Erika was guiding their thoughts to put them under the illusion that only the servants could have constructed the locked rooms...
With an air of solemnly revealing some vital point,
 ......she steadily steered the situation in the direction she wanted.
Everything about her serious face for the last few minutes......was an act.
 No, to put it in her words, it was a detective technique for tricking suspects......
"I plan to tell Krauss‐san what I\'ve told you.
 ......I\'m not saying that all the servants are culprits.
 However, it is very likely that one of them is a culprit or has been assisting the culprit.
 ......We should split them apart and have people with guns keep an eye on them."
Rudolf and Hideyoshi looked at each other again.
......What she was saying made sense, and it sounded as though she was calmly smoking out the most suspicious people at this point in time.
With her accomplished conversation techniques, Erika was skillfully grasping the initiative.
 ......Even without the presence of the detective\'s authority, controlling human nature like this is trivial.
 Your thoughts, ladies and gentlemen......?"......How does it feel?
 To play on the witch side."
"It feels strange.
 .........I used to think that the witch side had such a huge advantage.
 But now that I\'m on that side, I see that that\'s ridiculous.
 It\'s almost like that party game where you stick knives in a barrel."
From the perspective of the human side, it feels like trying to shoot at a target hidden by mist.
But from the witch side, a random shot might become fatal.
"......And the old me played several games just like that."
"Yeah, it\'s almost like Russian roulette.
 ......Even so, you stretched those games out to the limit, believing that I would eventually figure it out."
"......It may be impudent of me to ask,
 ......but just what is it that you figured out, Battler‐san?
 At the very end of your games with the old me..."
It was a strange question.
In the past, Beato had always been the one posing it to Battler.
{n}But now that Battler had figured it out, Beato was the one asking him about it...
"......It\'s the exact opposite.
 ......In the past, only you remembered, ......and only I forgot.
 But now, it\'s the other way around.
 Only I remember, ......and only you have forgotten."
"Would you mind telling me what it is...?"
".........Telling you would be...easy.
 ......But I don\'t want to tell you.
 I\'m not trying to be mean.
 ......I just want...to believe in a miracle myself, just a little bit."
".....................A miracle...?"
Yes, this was the single miracle seed that Battler had preserved.
......If Beato could remember a certain something without being told,
 ......that would prove that Beato had revived in the truest sense.
So he wouldn\'t tell her.
......It was Battler\'s final seed...
which existed because he still couldn\'t abandon his hope that Beato might revive.
"If you can\'t tell me, then I won\'t ask.
 ......If I have upset you, please forgive me..."
"Don\'t worry about it.
 I\'m just clinging to the past.
 ....................."
As she watched that sad smile, Beato\'s chest tightened.
......He was looking at her...and seeing the old her.
Yes......I must become my former self...for his sake.
My older sister who gets burned by spiderwebs, and I who don\'t, must become one.
......Surely, it\'s more useful to him if I go on a journey to find myself now...
...than if I simply watch over his game.
"How do you feel about this game?
 ......Do you think you can win?"
"Yes, I believe I can.
 I\'ll win......and end this eternal torture, just like Beato wanted."
"When it ends.........what will happen to the world...?"
"Who knows.
 ......I\'m really not sure.
 ...But that\'s what we wished for.
 ......So, no matter what the result is, I intend to accept it."
".........I wonder what will happen to me..."
Beato was...uncertain.
Even she was probably no more than a piece in this game.
......If the game ended,
 then would she, one who had been born out of that game\'s rules, ......disappear...?
"The game will probably disappear.
 ......But now, I completely understand magic.
 ......So, I\'ll be able to carry you off the game board.
 ......I think that was your wish."
"My......wish...?"
"..................
 ......The rest is a secret.
 ......I\'ll be waiting for the miracle......for you to remember all of that by yourself."
After smiling bitterly for just a second, Battler laughed and told her not to worry.
Apparently, it was best if she avoided talking to Battler about her previous self...
"......Well then, I\'ll go check on my opponent for a bit.
 ...I can\'t wait to see what kind of twisted logic that idiot thinks up next."
"The old Battler‐san did a lot of that too.
 ......My favorite was the one from the first twilight of the second game, when you said the culprit killed everyone by feeding them small bombs."
"Aaaaahhh, the highlights of my dark past...
 Please forget that ever happened..."
"Yes, I will try."
Battler became a cloud of gold butterflies and disappeared into the darkness.
Beato remained bowed until he had disappeared completely......
To fill in his place, a single gold butterfly appeared......and became Beato the Elder.
"......Did you call me, little sister?"
"Yes.
 .........I want to know more about you.
 And......I want to know what the real me is like.
 I want to become like that."
"Of course, I also want to know about my future self.
 ......We revealed everything about ourselves to each other for that purpose.
 ......However, we did not become one.
 I cannot understand what we must do to become our single self."
".....................What can we do to become one......?"
"I have high hopes for the trials of Zepar and Furfur."
"You mean the miracle of magic given to the victors?"
"I wonder if that magical miracle means becoming one\'s full self.
 ......I will be able to attain my true form.
 You will be able to fulfill Battler\'s wishes.
 Battler will also be happy, and all of us will suddenly have what we want."
".........I...can\'t get away from this trial, can I..."
"Which means you cannot afford to lose to the other two pairs."
"......George‐san and Shannon‐san, Jessica‐san and Kanon‐san.
 ......I can only grasp happiness......by trampling over them..."
"The conditions apply equally to all.
 ......If one of the others succeeds in love, the other two pairs, including you, will be trampled over."
"......Why must the scales be so unbalanced, I wonder?"
"Unbalanced?"
"Some people will find love, others won\'t.
 ......So I can understand placing those two groups on the two plates of a set of scales.
 But the scales for our trial have three plates, and two must lose for one to win... It seems horribly unbalanced..."
"Who knows?
 It might mean that successful love is worth two destroyed loves.
 ......Your words do not inspire confidence, little sister.
 If you cannot put your desire to answer to Battler\'s expectations before your concern for the losers, victory will slip through your fingers."
".........You\'re right.
 ......I won\'t give up our victory.
 ......I don\'t like doing this to the others, ......but there will be no hard feelings between us."
If I do lose...
......I\'ll give my strongest blessings to whichever couple wins.
So, I\'ll fight with all my heart and soul,
 ......so that I have no lingering regrets,
 ......and I\'ll win that miracle of magic.
"How was it?
 How did the red and blue shootout over the first twilight go?"
"I was just gathering information to start.
 Battler seemed pretty fired up."
She had just returned from a fierce fight with Battler, fought using the information gained through repetition requests.
It was the old, familiar kind of fight, reminiscent of the time when the red text had first appeared,
 or when the blue text had first been permitted...
"And the result...?"
"First, in all cases, it was the victims themselves that constructed the locked rooms.
 Also, those locked rooms were perfectly preserved until Krauss\'s group broke them open.
 Also, I confirmed that during that period, all forms of interference from the outside were impossible."
Erika reported this proudly as though it had been a great battle, but {f:5:Bernkastel} looked bored as she listened.
After looking at her blankly for a second, {f:5:Lambdadelta} spoke her opinions frankly.
".........Wait a second.
 Doesn\'t that mean this locked‐room murder was perfect?"
"Wha......uh......"
The victims had sealed the locked rooms themselves.
And that state had been preserved until Krauss and the others had broken the locked rooms open.
{n}And no one had been inside the locked rooms except for the victims.
{n}And Krauss\'s group, the ones who had broken the room open, were not the culprits......
......Erika\'s battle had proceeeded in this way, with her detailed repetition requests winning her several other little red truths just like these.
Normally, simply collecting such vital information would have been enough.
However, the witch who was her master was tired of boredom,
 ......and she had been expecting a much more flashy, argument‐winning victory instead of this bland result.
"H‐however, ......this time, I don\'t have the detective\'s authority, so there\'s a chance that my examination of the corpses could have been in error.
 S‐so, if we suppose that a drug which mimics death was used to fool my examination, umm..."
"You mean Purupurupikopuyo?"
"N‐no, not that...!
 It\'s not impossible for certain well‐known drugs, such as insulin, to bring about a temporary state that mimics death.
 ......Battler did not counter that with the red truth.
 In other words, my blue truth worked...!
 I...I\'d say we\'ve started with a victory."
To sum up Erika\'s report,
 all she had done was listen to the red truths Battler had wanted her to hear.
Only the information Battler had wanted to provide had been presented, and she hadn\'t been able to strike at any weak points.
She was like a kid who had gone out shopping, then forgotten her job and only bought candy...
.........However, this was all the players on the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} side could do.
Without the detective proclamation, she could only fight by collecting dull bits of information like that.
......All the same, her master had been expecting more than that sort of dull fight...
So, ......she had tried to give her report energetically, ......to make it seem as though they were in a superior position...
But no matter how much she tried, the cold expression of her master remained merciless...
"......Your blue truth {i:worked}...?
 You mean it was too ridiculous for him to bother cutting down.
 ......Impressive powers of deduction, Great Detective..."
"I...I did try to examine the corpses with care, to the best of my abilities...
 ......However, I don\'t have the detective\'s authority, .........so we can\'t be certain..."
"Wait a second, weren\'t you the one who decided not to make the detective proclamation?
 Didn\'t you say you wanted to raise the stakes to make up for your disgrace last time?"
"............W‐......well..............."
"What\'s wrong?
 ......Are you saying you can\'t win against Battler without the detective\'s authority......?"
"N‐......not at all, my master.
 ...I...I can easily defeat an incompetent buffoon like that, even without the detective\'s authority...
 ......It\'s just......this style of fighting is a little different from what I\'m used to, and I haven\'t gotten the hang of it yet......"
Compared to other human beings, Erika would rank as extremely talented.
Her knowledge and powers of memory and insight were ahead of the pack, and most likely, no human could be more suitable for the role of detective than her.
However, no matter how superior she might be to other humans,
 ......that didn\'t matter in a game of witches.
In a witch\'s game, it\'s either 0 or 100.
{n}In other words, everything is either the red truth, or it isn\'t.
If a normal human\'s abilities were worth a 10, her exceptional power would probably rate a 99.
 ......However, it could never be 100.
Since it was less than 100, it wasn\'t absolutely certain.
{n}So it didn\'t count as red truth.
For example, ......the examination of the corpses that Erika had worried over in the fight just now.
If she had performed it with the detective\'s authority, she could have said with 100% certainty whether they were alive or dead.
However, without the detective proclamation, it was 99%.
 ......There was a 1% chance that she made a mistake, and that overturned the foundation of the examination.
The reason Erika had gained the detective\'s authority and become the Witch of Truth...
...was that {f:5:Bernkastel} had supplemented her talent of 99 with an additional 1...
Just because {f:5:Bernkastel} wouldn\'t give her that 1,
 ......in the world of witches, Erika\'s 99 was treated exactly the same as zero...
Even her talented assistant Dlanor couldn\'t be put to proper use without a power of 100.
When working under an Erika who had lost the detective\'s authority, Dlanor\'s red longsword lost its power.
Dlanor also found it vexing that she couldn\'t provide adequate assistance...
......She had tried several times to convince Erika to use the detective proclamation, but Erika had stubbornly refused each time...
"Why not just do it? Make that detective proclamation.
 If you do, you\'ll be unstoppable.
 Dlanor could even use her red longsword and the Knox Decalogue."
"............Why not do it...if you want......?"
"N‐......no."
There was no need for anyone to explain...
By now, it was clear that Erika hadn\'t abandoned the detective proclamation by her own will.
"......When Battler reached the truth in the previous game,
 ......this game was already finished.
 This isn\'t really the sixth game.
 ......It\'s a finale game so that Battler can have a chance to serve as Game Master at the end.
 Everything was already decided last game."
"Yeah, pretty much.
 The games won\'t continue forever, and I\'ve lost my bet with Bern.
 .........In this game, Battler will prove that he\'s reached the game\'s truth,
 and then Beato\'s game will be destroyed in a big victory for the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} side.
 And a big victory for Bern too.
 ......Well, supposedly, but you look unsatisfied for some reason."
".....................Because I am.
 I didn\'t want such a boring victory."
"The victory you wanted was for Beato\'s game board to be torn to bits,
 and for Beato\'s true, pathetic form to be exposed, humiliated, and trampled on.
 ......But this victory of Battler\'s isn\'t quite like that, is it...?"
"......All this about love......and promises.
 ......To end the game quietly and let her rest in peace?
 ......That sort of ending would make anyone vomit."
"I didn\'t give Battler all that advice so that he could end things like that.
 ......I had his little sister turned to scrap meat behind his back.
 I had his parents and family killed horribly over and over again.
 That was all to spark a desire for revenge against Beato."
"And now............what kind of an ending is this...?
 Have I won?
 Of course not! ......Battler\'s gotten his hands on a victory that neither you nor I can stand."
"...I came all the way out here to see {f:5:Beatrice} lamely and pathetically torn to bits,
 and I endured a staggering period of boredom just for that one purpose.
 I didn\'t come here to sip from a.........rotten yogurt fragment like this!"
"Ahh, your angry face is wonderful too, Bern.
 ......I get it, so you wanted at least one final something to get the bad taste out of your mouth."
"It\'s all the fault of this moron piece screwing up last game!
 Because of you, the first game board in centuries that looked like it might be a bit of fun for me...
is all...
wasted...!!
 Filth,
 trash,
 scum!!"
"...M‐......my apologies, ...my master......
 ......I will definitely...bring you a victory, ......so please forgive me......"
"If you couldn\'t win with the detective\'s authority in the last game,
 how do you expect to defeat Battler now that he\'s the Game Master...?
 You don\'t have a chance at winning even {i:with} the detective\'s authority.
 ......So why bother with it?"
"I......uh............"
"Yeah, if you can\'t win anyway, then who needs the detective\'s authority?
 A certain loss becomes even more certain, big whoop."
"And therefore, if you manage to win in this even worse situation,
 ......that would be a miracle worthy of me.
 If and only if you can do that, I\'ll be able to forgive you."
"Y‐yes.
 ......I will surely...show you that miracle...!"
"You
 {i:wish} you could, disgusting pukespittle."
"The best you can do is take part in the worst punishment game ever for the worst game ever,
 with your only weapon, the detective proclamation, taken away from you, humiliating yourself until you have no dignity left,
 and through it all, you\'ll roll onto your back like a dog and beg for my affection.
 Your purpose, pukespittle, is to make me laugh."
".........uugh..."
{a:c:
"......Sounds like you\'re having a great time in here.
{n}Am I interrupting?"}
Gold butterflies gathered in the darkness and took the shape of Battler.
Though he had just arrived, he seemed to realize immediately that the mood was dark.
".........Ah, Battler.
 I had a look at your first twilight.
 Quite impressive locked rooms.
 I\'m sure you\'re more talented than Beato."
"It\'s just a rehash of the locked rooms Beato made in the past.
 I\'ll take that to be a compliment for Beato."
"It seems your fight with Erika wasn\'t bad either.
 Think your serial murders will move along smoothly?"
"......Who knows?
 My role isn\'t to carry out serial murders.
 It\'s to use that process to demonstrate locked rooms that are impossible without magic,
 and thereby achieve victory for the witch side and prove that I have fully understood this game.
 ......No, there\'s one more thing."
"What......?"
"To settle the score with Erika, since our previous duel ended in an even tie."
".........Battler......"
"Ev...en......tie...?"
{f:5:Bernkastel} noticeably grimaced.
{n}Erika averted her eyes and hung her head, timidly...
"I know what you\'re thinking.
 That wasn\'t a draw,
 you should have won easily so it counts as a loss."
"Hey,
 it\'s not polite to eavesdrop."
"......Look in a mirror.
 It\'s written all over your faces."
"No way...!
 Where?!
 Hey, what\'s going on?!
 If you tell me it\'s written in ink only morons can\'t see, then death, death, super death for you!!"
{f:5:Lambdadelta} pulled a mirror out of thin air, peered into it, and made a comical fuss.
 She was apparently playing the fool in her own, special way.
".........Erika."
"Wh‐......what is it?"
"That storm of red and blue from you and Dlanor in the last game...was spectacular."
"......Th‐.........thanks."
"What happened to Dlanor this time?
 Are you by yourself?"
".........{f:5:No}.
 ......I have been waiting {f:5:here}."
Dlanor had been just standing around in reserve,
 hiding her presence in the dark shadows...
"Well, when she can\'t use her red longsword, Dlanor is just useless pukespittle.
 There\'s no point having her around, so I\'ve dropped her from the action."
"............All I can do now is keep records of Lady {f:5:Erika}\'s {f:5:reasoning}."
"Why won\'t you fight with her?
 Why can\'t you use that red longsword?
 ......Erika\'s reasoning...and your longsword.
 They were strong because they worked together."
".............................."
Dlanor didn\'t answer.
 She just glanced slightly at {f:5:Bernkastel}\'s expression.
......However, that glance was the same as a clear answer for Battler now.
Battler fully realized the situation......
"You.
 You\'re the one who told Erika not to use the detective proclamation."
"......Oh? Whatever do you mean?"
"This fight is between me and Erika.
 .........We\'re going to fight with all we\'ve got.
 That way, we\'ll be able to accept it whether we win or lose.
 There\'s no need for a puppeteer behind the scenes like you."
"......Come now, I\'m no puppeteer.
 I\'m just a theatergoer trying to relieve her boredom."
"A theatergoer is someone who sits quietly in the stands and watches.
 That\'s not what we call someone who jeers at the stage and threatens or manipulates the performers."
"Sorry for being an ill‐mannered patron.
 ......You might not know it, but I\'ve already paid a huge admission fee to watch this play.
 Sorry, but I intend to enjoy it until I get my money\'s worth."
"If you get in the way of the game\'s progression, I can use my authority as the Game Master to boot you out of this game."
"If you want to, go ahead.
 If you chase me out, then I\'ll head back with my piece, Erika.
 This game will be cancelled, and you won\'t be able to prove that you\'ve reached the truth.
 ......Theatergoers are observers.
 A truth with no observers might as well be fantasy.
 ......If you want to end Beato\'s game, you need a theatergoer as an impartial witness."
"......Our truth is between us, and that\'s all it needs to be!
 If you\'re going to interfere any further, I will boot you out by force.
 ......Then you can writhe around in boredom for a few centuries until you find another way to kill time."
"Then go right ahead!
 Erika, this game is over! Good work.
 ......You were completely useless.
 You weren\'t able to overturn the dishonor of your loss, so as promised, I\'ll throw you into the worst fragment...
and cast you into the depths of oblivion with the empty popcorn buckets!!"
"M‐......my master...!
 I promise...I promise I will win...I promise I can win...!!
 So please, ......let me fight Battler to the finish...!!
 I don\'t......want to lose and......g‐get thrown in the d‐...depths of......oblivion......
......*hic*.........*hic*......"
"......Well, I\'d {i:like} to watch your battle until the end.
 ......But {i:Battler} says he\'ll toss me out.
 Well, any ideas, Lambda?!"
"Okay, okay......I realize you\'ve been irritated ever since the last game, Bern, but calm down a bit.
 ......And Battler, don\'t provoke Bern so much.
 This kid can\'t control her emotions sometimes."
"Shut up...
 Who can\'t control her emotions...?!"
{f:5:Bernkastel}, who, at one point in time, had never showed any expressions at all,
 was now twisting her face into all kinds of displeased and ugly shapes.
When {f:5:Lambdadelta} made fun of that,
 {f:5:Bernkastel} clicked her tongue and looked away.
As they say, nothing can stop poison but poison.
 ......Apparently, {f:5:Lambdadelta} was the only one who could rein {f:5:Bernkastel} in.
"......Erika, you want to fight Battler, clear your name, and get Bern back into a good mood, right?"
"Y‐......yes..."
"Battler, you want this "final game" that\'ll prove you\'ve found the truth...
to have a proper, tidy conclusion, right?"
"......Yeah.
 This is a face‐off between me and Erika.
 I won\'t let anyone get in my way,
 and I won\'t let anyone get in Erika\'s way either."
"...B‐.........Battler............"
"If both of you wish to fight, then that should be respected.
 ......Leave Bern to me.
 I\'m the only one in the world who can calm that kid when she gets into a bad mood."
"......You\'re the same sort as her, ......but at least you can be reasoned with."
"...........................
 ......You shouldn\'t underestimate me.
 I just like seeing Bern grimace.
 That\'s the only reason I\'ve taken a liking to this game of yours.
 .........If you go on thinking I\'m easy to handle, you\'ll get worse than burned."
".........Hmph."
"Dlanor can\'t use her red longsword because the detective proclamation hasn\'t been made.
 If Erika makes that, she\'ll regain her power right away. Right?"
"......{f:5:Yes}.
 When that time comes, forgive {f:5:me}."
"Erika."
"What...?"
"Make the detective proclamation."
".....................
 ......No."
"Do you really think you can beat me as I am now without the detective\'s authority?"
".........I...I can win......"
"......Lord {f:5:Battler}.
 ...Lady {f:5:Erika} is herself a {f:5:piece}.
 She cannot disobey her master\'s {f:5:orders}.
 All she can do is gather the power permitted to her......and fight for {f:5:survival}."
"And Dlanor, your power can\'t be used at all without the detective proclamation?"
".........In order to unsheathe the Red Key, authorization is {f:5:required}.
 One of the preconditions for applying for that authorization is the detective {f:5:proclamation}."
"Is there any other way to obtain that authorization besides the detective proclamation?"
"Wh‐......what are you saying...?!
 I‐if you\'re doing this out of pity for me, I don\'t need your help!"
"Quiet.
 You\'re no challenge on your own and it\'s boring me stiff.
 So zip it, you non‐detective detective."
"......Ghh.................."
"The Red Key has an extremely close relationship with the red {f:5:truth}.
 ......If and only if a "truth" is provided, I am permitted to draw the Red Key for items that pertain to {f:5:it}."
"What do you mean by a "truth"...?"
"...........................
 ......For example, ......there are Lady {f:5:Erika}\'s duct tape {f:5:seals}."
"Ah, ......those."
"Lady {f:5:Bernkastel} has already acknowledged that those seals are equivalent in value to the red {f:5:truth}.
 Therefore, I am authorized to draw the Red Key for truths pertaining to those {f:5:seals}."
"Those caused me a lot of trouble last time,
 so I had all the sticky duct tape removed from the game board this time around."
"......A splendid {f:5:move}."
"............Erika was proud to be able to call herself the detective, wasn\'t she?"
"{f:5:Yes}...
 ......Though her only goal was to irresponsibly reveal mysteries, ......it was a matter of pride for {f:5:her}."
"Then, she must really be suffering now that she can\'t make that proclamation."
"...............Only she could tell you {f:5:that}."
"................................."
Battler took a deep breath, then hung his head in thought for a time.
......Erika was his enemy,
 but she was the player on the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} side, and without her, there would be no game.
It had been the same way with the old Beato.
Battler had one‐sidedly viewed Beato as the enemy.
 However, though Beato had thought of him as the opposing player, she hadn\'t considered him to be an enemy on a personal level.
......I will fight my rival ruthlessly in accordance with the rules.
However, that doesn\'t mean I need to hate Furudo Erika herself.
....................................
 ......I will not {i:misplay} Beato\'s game.
"Erika.
 You\'re free not to make the detective proclamation.
 So do what you want and fight me with just your {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} powers."
"I\'ve been prepared to do that from the beginning...!"
"However, you have talented people on your side.
 ......Dlanor, ......Gertrude, and Cornelia.
 You aren\'t alone.
 You have allies."
"Except that they\'re unreliable, powerless, and useless pukespittle."
"Dlanor.
 ......Just like I was supported by {f:5:Virgilia} and Ronove in the past, Erika needs support as well.
 I know from repeated experience that playing for the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} side is tough."
"......{f:5:Yes}.
 I will assist her with all the power I {f:5:possess}."
"For your attention: we are in agreement."
"For your attention: know that it is our job."
"Hmph.
 You can\'t even use the red truth!"
"Erika.
 ......I will give power, not to you, but to your allies."
"Huh?!
 Wh‐what do you think you\'re doing...?!
 I\'d rather die than receive your pity!!"
"For the trio of Dlanor, Gertrude, and Cornelia,
 ......Erika,
 I will allow you to use three rooms\' worth of those duct tape seals."
To fully seal one room, multiple seals are needed to cover all the doors and windows.
If he had just said "three seals", she would only be able to fully seal up one room at best.
So, Battler was generous and measured them by room instead of by seal...
"......Lord {f:5:Battler}......"
"As the Game Master, I will also acknowledge that these seals have the same effect as the red truth.
 ......This way, you\'ll also be able to wield that red longsword in battles based around those seals.
 Right...?"
".........{f:5:Yes}...
 .........But...are you {f:5:certain}?"
"Winning against Erika when she\'s less than a detective is hardly a victory.
 If Erika\'s upping the stakes, then I should have the right to do the same."
"Whew, what a man!
 Aren\'t you lucky, Erika?!
 Now you can use a bit of red without making the detective proclamation and irritating your master."
".........Y‐...you\'ll regret this...
 ......These three seals......will be your death......!"
"Sounds like fun.
 Come and kill me."
"......Gah.........khhhh..."
Though it was only for three rooms, it was the red truth that Erika had been dying to use.
Now, she finally had enough leeway to fight as she pleased.
......She ground her teeth at being pitied by Battler, but her tears were not those of shame.
"......{f:5:Understood}.
 Three rooms\' worth of duct tape seals, {f:5:accepted}.
 ......Regarding this matter, should we consider them as being accepted retroactively, back when Lady {f:5:Erika} received the non‐sticky duct tape from {nobr:Mrs. Kumasawa}?"
Erika had borrowed duct tape from Kumasawa to make seals with.
However, Battler had made it so that those were not sticky...
If he made it so that there never was any problem with the stickiness of that duct tape, the transition could be made smoothly.
"Sure, that\'s fine.
 ......I\'ll rewrite the tale.
 ......The duct tape that Erika received from Kumasawa‐san late at night on the first day was sticky enough to work as a seal,
 but there was only enough left to use on three rooms.
 ......I\'ll apply that from here on out."
"{f:5:Understood}.
 ......Lady {f:5:Erika} will also retroactively adjust her movements, starting before the discovery of the first twilight and taking into account that the application of this privilege is now {f:5:possible}.
 ......As soon as these changes affect the progression of the game, they will be reported to the Game {f:5:Master}."
".........Letting you do it retroactively, even though you know which rooms the crime will occur in...
 ...That gives you a pretty big advantage.
 You won\'t have to waste tape on other rooms."
"It seems you\'ve grown quite arrogant since becoming Game Master.
 You\'re having fun, aren\'t you?
 Giving out charity to your pathetic opponent."
"Quiet.
 And don\'t misunderstand.
 ......I\'m not being arrogant or going easy on her.
 .........Erika, use this weapon and fight me with all your strength.
 And I will crush you with all of mine.
 So hold your head high as you use those three.
 That is all."
Battler made to leave the room with a flick of his cape.
As he did, he thought he heard Erika let out a strained voice calling him to a stop.
".....................
 ......What is it?"
".............................."
"If you have no business with me, I\'m going.
 Make sure you talk with Dlanor.
 Don\'t listen to those obnoxious witches, whatever they tell you.
 As long as they\'re on this game board, they\'ll obey my rules."
".........Tha‐.........thank you........."
"..........................."
"...Thank you......
 ......I\'ll...fight with all I\'ve got...
 I\'ll come at you with all my strength, .........so, ...I\'ll defeat you no matter what, so,
 ......so, ......if you do win against me, .........please...
......crush me with all your strength...
 *hic*......
 ......Please......don\'t leave......a speck of me behind.........
 ......*hic*......!"
".....................
 .........You got it.
 ...And don\'t you go easy on me, either.
 ......This is the final game.
 I\'m playing to prove to Beato that I\'ve reached the truth.
 ......At this point, who wins and who loses has no effect on that."
"I\'ve accepted you as a worthy adversary, and now I simply want to settle the score.
 .........In the game, let us suspect each other over everything as enemies.
 But as fellow players, let\'s trust each other.
 ......That\'s how this game is supposed to be played."
"......Yes......
 ......Thank you......
 .........Thank you............uuughhu......"
Battler departed into the darkness, became a cloud of gold butterflies, and vanished...
{n}Erika remained behind, sobbing......
......uuughhu......*hic*......
 Just
 kidding{p:0:☆}
"You\'re easy pickings, you stupid man.
 ......You fell right for it and gave me the tape...!
 ......You gave...the great Furudo Erika...
......duct tape...!!"
It was hard to imagine that the person who had been sobbing pathetically and this person now were the same individual.
 ......That\'s how vile her face contorted to be...
The two witches were also cackling with ugly smiles...
"I totally feel him.
 When you become Game Master, it feels like you\'ve become God and you get all sure of yourself, you kno~w?"
".........It was the same for you, wasn\'t it, Lambda?
 ......You lost because you made a bonehead mistake involving walking corpses.
 .........Bonehead Game Masters, bonehead blunders, bonehead arrogance, bonehead beatings, bonehead Battler, billions of boneheads.
 *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!"
"Bonehead beatings, bonehead Battler, billions of boneheads.
 Ahahahahaha, I like the way it rolls off the tongue.
 Nice one, my master.
 *giggle*giggle*!
 Bonehead Battler, billions of boneheads, bonehead Battler, billions of boneheads."
"If that bonehead Battler honestly thinks that Erika\'s at a disadvantage, then it was nice knowing him.
 ......A detective proclamation isn\'t what you need to kill an idiot."
"Just a corner of tofu for them to hit their head on?"
"Make that {i:soft} tofu."
"Add some gochujang chili paste and you\'ve got a snack that\'d go great with some wine.
 *giggle*giggle*giggle*!"
The three giggled together...
It had all been an act to get the duct tape for the seals from Battler...
Even though he had taken pains to ensure that the duct tape that had tormented him so much in the last game was rendered unusable in this one,
 ......he had fallen for Erika\'s act,
 ......and she had gotten what she wanted, even if it was only three rooms\' worth.
The illusion that Erika was at an overwhelming disadvantage was just an act.
......A trap to trick Battler and make him hand over the duct tape.
"With this, I can kill Battler perfectly...!
 I figured out his moronic locked rooms long ago...!
 A perfect locked room?
 Dumb{-}aa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}ass!!"
"I\'ll show you a real perfect locked room!
 And I could cry for joy at the fact that you gave me the weapon that will finish you...!
 My master! And Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}...!
 Thank you so much for assisting with my performance!"
"It was fun.
 No need to thank me."
"......Plus I wasn\'t acting.
 *giggle*giggle*."
Despite getting the feeling that {f:5:Bernkastel} had just said something a little curious, Erika was in too high spirits to care.
That pudding‐for‐brains moron, thinking he\'s done something so noble!
I\'ll make you regret it, kuhihihi!!
"Alright!
 Let\'s use these seals at our leisure...!
 You were a great help too, Dlanor.
 It seems that Battler trusts you, so he believes every word you say."
"..........................."
"Don\'t tell me your conscience is hurting.
 You little murder doll."
"............{f:5:No}."
Dlanor looked at Erika in a slightly lonely way.
......Then, after shaking her head slightly, her gaze turned hard, and she looked at the darkness Battler had disappeared into.
".........You knew that this was a no‐holds‐barred {f:5:fight}...
 .........Foolish, Lord {f:5:Battler}.
 This is, without a doubt, the result of your {f:5:arrogance}."
............{nobr:Mr. Battler}, ...this will prove {f:5:fatal}......
"First of all, congratulations are in order, wouldn\'t you say, Furfur?!"
"Yes, because we have learned that each and every one of the lovers possesses a strong will!"
""This is a victory for love...!
 That, we shall celebrate!!""
......Everyone had long since gotten used to these two overdramatic demons.
George spoke quietly with an annoyed expression.
"We\'ll only celebrate that after we\'ve passed your trial and someone has been given the miracle of magic."
"I agree...
 ......We\'ve all passed the first trial.
 What\'s next?
 ...I won\'t hold back anymore... I\'ll do whatever it takes..."
"......Yes. We won\'t lose."
"Neither will we."
"Yeah.
 ......And of course, the same goes for Battler‐kun\'s group."
".........Of course.
 I doubt anyone here is so naive that they hope to win by having the others relinquish victory."
"Right...
 ......Anyone weak enough to drop out wouldn\'t be qualified to be here right now."
Even Beato, who seemed to be the shakiest one of the six, was strongly determined.
The two demons nodded, taking note of the six\'s continued resolve.
"So, what\'s the next trial?
 Don\'t tell me you still haven\'t decided..."
"Well, we thought at least some of you would drop out."
"We didn\'t think that you all would remain.
 This is a happy miraculous miscalculation due to love!"
"Cram it.
 ......So?
 Are we going to play musical chairs or something to make sure someone drops out this time?"
""Yes, precisely that!""
"We\'ve decided to have this trial eliminate one group no matter what!"
"For this trial, we will borrow from the second twilight of the epitaph—"
""‘Tear apart the two who are close!!’
 Ahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!""
"......I don\'t understand."
"Zepar‐sama, Furfur‐sama......what sort of trial is this?
 ......Do you mean we\'re going to kill each other...?"
"That\'d settle things quickly."
"Though it\'s not exactly civilized."
"Love is carnivorous."
"......We can\'t all just find happiness together......can we..."
"This is what they call a zero‐sum game.
 It\'s an economic term, but maybe you\'ve heard of it...?"
"N‐...no, my apologies......"
"In a zero‐sum game...all the wins and losses cancel out to zero.
 ......In order for someone to win, someone else must be forced to lose.
 ......It\'s the ruthless way of this world."
".........Heh.
 ......If only everyone...
could be happy.
 .........But I guess......there\'s no way an ideal world like that could exist."
"No, there is!"
"That is the Golden Land!"
"......The Golden Land...?
 What are you talking about......?"
".........That\'s right.
 If you reach the Golden Land, ......all love will be satisfied.
 ......However, like heaven and hell, that\'s not a place in this world."
"That\'s an offer I would have to refuse.
 ......Love has meaning because we find it in this world.
 I could never support a sad lovers\' double suicide where we are only united after death.
 ......I will see my love through, alive.
 I won\'t lose to anyone."
"......George‐san..."
The door to the Golden Land is opened by solving the epitaph\'s riddle......
It is said to be a place where love and lives are all whole and can be revived......
"We\'re straying from the point.
 ......Tell us about the second trial already."
"Right.
 ......What\'re you trying to make us do with this "tear apart the two who are close" thing...?"
"It is quite simple!"
"The only possible way to tear apart two lovers is by the sad farewell of death!"
"The second trial is to kill one of the six!"
"Of course, any lover with their partner killed is disqualified."
"In short, one pair of lovers must drop out during this trial!"
"......You say "kill" so simply.
 ......What are we supposed to do?"
"You can fight to the death—"
"Or you can decide by a lottery of some sort."
"Like hell we\'re gonna choose by drawing lots.
 Let\'s have a duel, fair and square."
"......Though if we do that, I imagine that Battler‐kun, who is the Game Master,
 and {f:5:Beatrice}, who is still the Golden Witch despite having no memory, ......will have a substantial advantage."
"Ah, ......w‐......well, I wonder about that..."
"Don\'t worry!
 For this trial, we have made everyone\'s powers completely equal."
"Even the Game Master, Lord {f:5:Battler}, is taking this trial on an even footing with everyone else."
"In that case, ......it\'s fair......"
"Is it completely and purely even?"
""Yes, perfectly even!
 In a one‐on‐one fight, the luck of the moment would determine the outcome!""
"As all is perfectly equal—"
"It\'ll probably take a while to finish a fight."
"So perhaps the trick would be to attack in advantageous circumstances?"
"Duels that take time are, of course, wonderful too!"
"Why would anyone leave it up to luck?
 .........Of course we want the fight to be in our favor."
".........In that case, ......a three‐way struggle...?
 ......Wouldn\'t that mean we\'d all be stuck...?"
Beato was the first to notice.
If all six of them were truly on an even footing, and they wanted to fight so that they could win, they would have to fight as pairs and concentrate their attacks on a single person.
However, if they did so, that person\'s partner would naturally join in to fight back as a pair.
In other words, it would never end up as two against one.
It would be two against two, and a battle like that could go either way.
However, if that were to happen, the third pair watching all this...
could team up with whichever pair they liked with no risk to themselves, defeating the opposing pair with certainty...
"Sounds troublesome.
 ......It means that it isn\'t to your advantage to move first."
If you take the initiative to fight, it\'s a matter of luck.
{n}If you sit and wait for the others to start fighting, it\'s certain victory.
......The fight would never begin in circumstances like this...
"......Maybe we could just have everyone fight the person next to them one on one.
 ......Then, as soon as one fight is settled, the trial will be over."
Unless everyone could abandon any naive hopes for a two‐on‐one fight,
 this trial would never begin and never end.
In that case, they could make a gentlemen\'s agreement and have everyone duel at once,
 which would be no different from drawing lots, ......but at least it would be fair...
"That won\'t work.
 If we do that, everyone will just defend instead of fighting proactively.
 All they need to do is wait for someone to lose before they do."
Shannon\'s point was a sound one.
If both fighters just glared at each other without attacking,
 then neither would lose.
They would only have to wait for someone other than themselves to lose first.
This brought them back to the starting point.
 ......No one would fight proactively.
"In the end, no one will move, and nothing will be resolved..."
".........Since we\'re in this mathematical situation where we all have the same strength, ......it\'s almost like a puzzle."
"True.
 ......Dueling would have been an interesting proposition if our strengths were unknown.
 ......However, since we\'ve been told that we\'re perfectly even, a duel would be no different than rock‐paper‐scissors."
"......In that case, ......why not use rock‐paper‐scissors to decide it......?"
"Are you crazy...?! I\'m not gonna do that!
 Even if someone does lose, there\'s no way they\'d accept their loss!"
".........If they don\'t accept it, then they will be attacked by the four winners.
 ......In a world where all are equal, the losers will have no chance of surviving..."
"True.
 ......Huh.
 Is rock‐paper‐scissors actually the most reasonable way to settle this?"
"It is extremely reasonable.
 However, if you were to ask me whether I\'d be reckless enough to entrust my fate to a random number generator, the answer would be no."
"Please do consider that problem...!"
"This is the second trial we have set for you!"
""Think, and fight to the death!
 Please decide who the sacrifice will be!!""".........Tr‐...true, it isn\'t unthinkable...
 The servants are the most suspicious..."
"It isn\'t as though we have any physical evidence, so we can\'t tie them up and throw them in a closet.
 So, we need to make sure that they are always within sight of those with guns, and that we keep an eye on them all the time."
"Aniki, we should also gather the master keys.
 ......Only the servants could have created those locked rooms.
 They must have done something with the chain locks using some tool or setup that only the servants know about."
"......They have all served us for a long time.
 I can hardly imagine that they would commit murder..."
"I hear that Kinzo‐san is not long for this world, and the inheritance problem is still very shaky.
 ......In addition, there\'s that story about ten tons of gold being hidden somewhere.
 A possible payoff like that might be enough to convince certain people to commit a crime..."
"I don\'t want to think about it, .........but there\'s also a chance that the old bastard is running some bizarre occult ritual.
 The servants of the One Wing are his pawns, and they might have been the ones to carry out the murders.
 ......How about Dad, anyway?
 Have you been able to contact him yet?"
"N‐no...
 We aren\'t getting through on the extension line either...
 The culprits might have broken it.
 ......And Father does often leave the receiver off the hook when he\'s in a bad mood...
 When I knocked, umm......I only received a grumpy reply...
 ......We can\'t contact him, but that study is well protected.
 It\'s probably safer there, so it might be best to have him stay there..."
Flustered, Krauss tried to explain away Kinzo\'s silence.
Battler, the Game Master, hadn\'t made "Kinzo\'s death" a major theme for this game, so the conversation didn\'t go any further.
They stopped talking about Kinzo without Rudolf thinking anything was particularly suspicious.
"Anyway, we can\'t let the servants out of our sights.
 I just had a talk with Hideyoshi nii‐san about this, and we decided to split everyone into two rooms upstairs and hole up in there."
"Why two rooms?
 Just one would be more secure."
"Well, if we tried to stick 12 people in one room, we\'d suffocate.
 Plus, I want to isolate the people we need to keep the closest eye on.
 There\'s Genji‐san, the head of the servants. There\'s Gohda‐san, who is larger than any of us.
 And though he may be young, Kanon‐san is male too."
"I think we need to pay those three special attention, Aniki.
 This way, we can isolate that group, and you and I can keep a close eye on them.
 With two guns, the pair of us could cooperate on a moment\'s notice.
 If they make even a single suspicious move......boom!"
"......Alright. Let\'s do that.
 ......But Rudolf.
 We can\'t be certain that they are the culprits.
 Don\'t be too pushy."
"..................You\'re telling me not to be pushy?
 ...We must be getting old."
"Right now, Hideyoshi‐san is upstairs, dividing everyone into the two rooms.
 The ones being isolated, we\'ll collect into the cousins\' room, and the others will go into the next room over."
"Ah, right, Aniki, what about Jessica‐chan...?
 She insists on being in the same room as you."
".........Jessica..."
"We were planning to have five people in the cousins\' room and seven in the adjacent room.
 If Jessica‐san wants to go to the cousins\' room, it\'ll be split clean down the middle.
 If this was a wolves and sheep puzzle, there are currently three servant wolves and you two sheep in that room.
 I think adding in Jessica‐san would be a good idea to balance things out."
For a while, Krauss crossed his arms and thought.
The cousins\' room would surely be more dangerous, so he wanted his daughter to go into the next room over.
......However, in an emergency situation like this, he also wanted to keep his daughter where he could see her.
"Let\'s let her stay with us.
 ......We might need her there to make sure we remain good dads and uncles."
".........Yes.
 I am keeping up a pretense of rationality right now.
 ......But I can\'t guarantee that my sadness at losing my wife won\'t change to anger..."
Even without any physical evidence, the servants were certainly the most suspicious.
During the long haul ahead of these two men, their weariness and anger and sadness...
...could make them lose their reason and act out in anger...
After thinking deeply, Krauss decided to accept Jessica\'s request,
 in part to prevent this from happening...
"......I think that\'s a good idea.
 I\'m in favor."
"I agree.
 ......It\'s enough that only Rosa and I lose children..."
".........Rudolf......"
In this way,
 all of the survivors excepting Kinzo split into two groups and holed up in two rooms on the guesthouse\'s second floor.
One group was in the cousins\' room.
{n}Krauss, Rudolf, Jessica, Genji, Kanon, Gohda.
{n}Six people.
One group was in the next room over.
{n}Hideyoshi, George, Shannon, Kumasawa, Nanjo, Erika.
{n}Six people here too.
Perhaps as the result of the killer\'s doing, the external phone line had been cut off,
 and they would have to wait for the ferryboat coming the next day before they could contact the police.
However, the weather report had said that the sea would be stormy throughout the next day because of the typhoon.
......When that happens, the ferryboat takes the day off.
{n}So, it would probably be two days before the boat came.
In other words, they were going to have to spend a full two nights holed up in here...
While Erika and the others held their planning meeting in the lounge, food and blankets had been brought in to prepare for the long road ahead.
The sudden tragedy had everyone on edge, but it was already well after {nobr:2 a.m}.
If they really suspected the servants, then the observers couldn\'t afford to fall asleep at the same time.
Either Krauss or Rudolf should probably take a nap right away...
"......Not bad.
 Even without the detective\'s authority, you\'ve managed to control things very skillfully."
"A man who\'s lost his cool is no different from an agitated dog.
 If you treat them properly, it\'s easy to control them."
One of the benefits of the detective\'s authority was being able to take charge of the situation.
This ability was the reason that Erika had been able to order a large number of adults around at will,
 in spite of being both an uninvited guest and a young girl.
However, she didn\'t have that power this time.
......So, Erika had taken charge by making good use of her natural conversation skills and techniques for controlling men...
"The detective\'s authority is the same as magic.
 ......It can\'t do what you can\'t do.
 So, Erika\'s authority was only recognized because she already had that much talent."
".........Magic is not something that is given to lazy or powerless humans."
"Right.
 On the contrary, people who can hide their great efforts are the ones we call witches."
The absolute nature of the detective\'s authority could even act as magic.
However, it didn\'t seem as though Erika had done nothing to earn that convenient power.
......I probably need to accept it.
Even when she isn\'t given any special powers by the witch she serves,
 ......she\'s very competent on her own.
"But Erika, why did you split them into two rooms?
 I was thinking you were going to gather everyone into one room."
"......I would have if I had the detective\'s authority.
 This is a move to preserve my right to investigate at will."
"Ah, ......so that\'s it.
 ...I see. Not bad."
Since Erika was being "protected" as a guest, it was hard for her to move about freely.
In truth, she wanted to take some time to reinvestigate the crime scenes at her leisure,
 without being interrupted by anyone.
She had already inspected the scenes once as she ran through the mansion, but that probably wasn\'t perfect.
However, they wouldn\'t have let a guest into the crime scenes, so that had been her only option back then.
......She wanted some time to herself and freedom to investigate more,
 in part so that she could check the locked rooms and causes of death more closely.
"......How is that related to splitting everyone into two rooms and having them stay there...?"
"That\'s where her silver tongue will come into play.
 Watch."
"Yes. That\'s the only reason I split them into two rooms."
The cousins\' room was filled with a quiet tension.
This room had six people.
Krauss, Jessica, and Rudolf.
......And then the most suspicious ones, the male servants Genji, Kanon, and Gohda, who had been forced to hole up in here.
Jessica leaned against Krauss\'s shoulder, wrapped up in a blanket.
She was drowsy, but apparently couldn\'t get to sleep.
It was no surprise.
 In this bizarre situation, it would probably take a lot longer before she could accept her mother\'s death...
......Kanon thought that this was the sort of time he should stay by Jessica\'s side,
 but that looked like it would be hard to do in front of Rudolf\'s intimidating glare.
Rudolf stayed completely silent,
 but his inner emotions showed clearly in his eyes.
So, without even asking,
 Genji, Kanon, and Gohda all understood that they were under suspicion.
Sometimes, Gohda would ask if he could help in an attempt to correct this misunderstanding,
 but that seemed to have the opposite effect.
The only good option available to him...
...was to stay quiet so that he didn\'t aggravate Rudolf...and sit still at the end of the sofa...
In the next room over, there were also six people: Erika, Hideyoshi, George, Shannon, Nanjo, and Kumasawa.
The format of the room and the suffocating atmosphere were the same as the cousins\' room,
 ......but even so, it was relatively calm there.
George sat holding Shannon, who was hanging her head despondently the whole time.
Kumasawa and Nanjo sat nervously as they listened to Hideyoshi explain the situation...
"We don\'t know how many enemies there are...
 ......However, we\'ve got a gun right here.
 And of course, I\'ve shot one before!
 I\'m not talkin\' about the Hawaii Shooting Center here!
 It\'s been long enough that I can confess, but I once defiantly fired off one of them occupyin\' forces pistols...!
 You see, back then, the black market was controlled by foreign gangsters—"
He probably wanted to make everyone feel secure by convincing them that he could be relied upon.
Hideyoshi went into one of his old stories that everyone had heard many times, and that had gotten more extravagant each time they heard it.
It didn\'t make them any more confident in Hideyoshi\'s abilities,
 ......but it did seem to calm things down a little by bringing in a sense of normality.
"......Why has a crime like this happened...?
 I hope the boat can come tomorrow..."
"That seems unlikely...
 ......It looks as though we\'ll be staying here for two nights.
 ......Now is a good time to get some sleep..."
"Haha...
 I don\'t have the nerves to sleep soundly in a situation like this..."
"......George‐sama......"
The pain and anger of losing his mother quietly tormented George.
 ......Sleepiness probably wouldn\'t be coming to him for a while...
Erika suddenly clapped her hands as though she had just remembered something,
 then whispered in Hideyoshi\'s ear, interrupting the old story, which he had grown very engrossed with.
".........Sorry, I\'m just going to the cousins\' room for a second.
 ......There\'s one little thing I just need to check on with the servants over there."
"Can\'t you use the phone?
 You just need to dial the room number."
"Oh, have you forgotten?
 It seems the culprit has broken the telephone lines."
"What\'s this? Are you sayin\'...
...you\'ve found some kind of contradiction in their statements?"
Erika had created a strong impression with her detective‐like behavior up to this point.
 So, Hideyoshi immediately assumed that this was something vital to do with the crime.
"It\'ll be easy to check, ......but it might open up a much larger seam.
 ......I\'ll be quick about it.
 Please don\'t let anyone leave this room."
"Even if you\'re only goin\' next door, it\'s dangerous to go alone.
 You sure you don\'t want to take someone with you?"
"We cannot fully trust the servants or Nanjo‐san.
 ......You\'re in charge of this room,
 and George‐san is needed to support you.
 We cannot spare anyone.
 ......Don\'t worry, the detective never gets attacked."
Erika had already worked hard to look like a sharp, clearheaded person.
Hideyoshi relaxed and agreed, thinking that it was just next door and wouldn\'t be a problem...
"If I\'m not back in about an hour—no......
 It\'s probably better if I don\'t wander around too much.
 I\'ll stay over there until morning.
 It\'ll be better if I wait until it gets light before I come back."
"Good thinkin\'.
 Be careful."
"*giggle*
 I\'m just going to the next room over.
 ......Take good care of this room.
 ......Please don\'t let anyone go outside.
 ......We\'ve already brought everything we might need into this room to ensure there\'s no reason to leave."
Food, drinks, blankets, medicine, towels, tissue paper, everything.
The women also had their cosmetic pouches.
They could spend 48 hours without being short of any physical goods.
"I know.
 ......We aren\'t just here to protect ourselves.
 ......We\'re also on the lookout for the culprit, if he\'s among us.
 I understand..."
"......<Good>.
 Goodbye, then."
"Where are you going, Erika‐chan...?
 We promised that no one would go outside."
"Oh, Erika‐chan remembered somethin\' important she had to do.
 She\'s goin\' next door.
 Don\'t worry, she\'ll be fine."
Hideyoshi suspected that Shannon might be one of the culprits.
Since he also knew that Shannon and George had a special relationship,
 he apparently thought it would be prudent to mislead George about Erika\'s actions and motives.
Hideyoshi slowly opened the door and checked both ways down the corridor, his gun raised.
"It\'s okay.
 No one\'s there."
"That\'s far enough.
 For all we know, Shannon‐san might take George‐san hostage as soon as you leave the room, right...?
 It\'s careless even just to show your back to them, as you\'re doing now."
"Y‐you\'re right...
 Then be careful.
 ......Tell me all about it later."
"Sure.
 Bye then."
Pushing Hideyoshi back inside, Erika closed the door.
She then waited for the sound of the lock on the inside......and her smiling eyes slowly opened wide.
Her expression had become ruthless and intelligent.
With this, Erika had managed to obtain a period of several hours...
...during which all of the suspects were sealed up and she alone was free...
"Fiiiiinally, I can investigate to my heart\'s content...!
 But first!
 Ushiromiya Battler!!"
"Don\'t use my full name."
"Allow me to confirm the location of all characters present.
 Repetition requested!"
"Of course, I\'m not obliged to respond, remember...?"
"If you don\'t, I\'ll just say that someone sneaked out while I wasn\'t looking, and that this person was responsible for the bizarre crimes that are sure to follow.
 If you want to show me an impossible murder, you should first confirm their locations...!"
".........Sure, why not.
 I\'ll listen, at least. Let me hear it."
"From now on, let\'s refer to the room next to the cousins\' room as "the next room over".
 Does that work for you?!"
"That\'s easy to remember. Got it.
 ......And?"
"When I check the characters\' locations as I am about to, I am not concerned with whether they are alive or dead.
 Think of it as the location of their body.
 And of course, I\'m referring to the current point in time.
 Here we go."
"‘The six first twilight victims are located at the places where they were discovered.
 Natsuhi is in her room, Eva is in the VIP room, Kyrie is in Krauss\'s study, Rosa and Maria are in the parlor, and you are in the guest room!’"
"........................"
"Don\'t tell me you\'re already going to decline?!"
".......Don\'t worry.
 {p:1:I acknowledge it}."
First off, it was acknowledged that the victims\' locations were the same as the rooms that had been shown by the witch side\'s illusion.
"<Good>.
 I\'ll continue.
 "Hideyoshi, George, Shannon, Kumasawa, and Nanjo are in the next room over!""
"{p:1:Acknowledged}."
The people in the room Erika had just left had been specified.
It was the role of the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} side to check every one of these seemingly obvious little details.
"<Good>.
 I\'ll continue.
 "Everyone else is in the cousins\' room!""
The word "everyone" drew a slight reaction from Battler.
......The intuition he had built up from all of his previous games told him not to answer this one instantly...
"......I decline.
 Acknowledging that would mean that Kinzo\'s body would also have to be in the cousins\' room."
"Ah, pardon me.
 It has already been shown that Kinzo no longer exists, so please remove him from the word "everyone"."
".........Why are you using the word "everyone" for the cousins\' room alone...?
 You could just mention the names of Krauss and the other five individually,
 ......so why are you being so vague?"
"It\'d just be too much of a pain to read out all of their names.
 .........Or is there something wrong?
 Does using the word "everyone" create a problem with some trick of yours...?"
"................................."
If Battler had been told to repeat "Krauss, Rudolf, Jessica, Genji, Gohda, and Kanon are in the cousins\' room",
 he would probably have responded with the red without thinking too much about it.
Yes—normally, Erika would have mentioned the name of each person inside and had him repeat it precisely.
Battler hesitated to repeat, feeling some kind of unease because of the use of the word "everyone"...
"Excluding Kinzo and me, there are 17 people on this island.
 Six were killed and are lying in the mansion, and five are in the next room over.
 Which means the remaining six are in the cousins\' room.
 This would be the normal way of thinking of things."
".........However!
 It is extremely dangerous to assume that because there are 17 people on the island, if we subtract six, then five, then six again, that means we\'re left with zero humans whose location has not been checked.
 I\'m pretty sure that this sort of trick involving names and numbers of people caused you a lot of trouble with Nanjo\'s murder in the third game."
"............Good point.
 ......That trick worked because the 18 names given didn\'t match up with the 18 people who actually existed,
 leaving room to add in an unknown person."
"Exactly.
 And so, I can\'t feel secure just by checking their locations by name.
 ......That\'s why I used the word "everyone".
 That word can prevent you from using a new trick that I haven\'t even thought of."
"........................I see.
 ......Pretty crafty of you..."
If Battler was planning a new trick like the one used for the murder of Nanjo in the third game,
 where the names and number of people would be used to create false alibis...
...then even naming off all 17 people and checking their positions left a trace of uncertainty behind.
And if he skillfully managed to slip somebody past the names and numbers of people...
"For example,
 let\'s say that an unknown assassin X is hiding on this island.
 ......Let\'s call him Purupurupiko‐Man."
"......I see.
 Even if you list everyone\'s names and check their locations, this Purupurupiko‐Man guy would fall outside the net."
"Precisely.
 Even hearing "there are only 17 people on this island, and here are the locations of 17 people"...
is insufficient.
 There\'s already a precedent for this."
".........However, the word "everyone" is just too broad.
 Can\'t you word it a little differently...?"
"......No, ...if we run away from the word "everyone" here,
 there\'s a chance that Erika will be able to use that as a basis for making Purupurupiko‐Man the culprit for everything.
 ......In my old fights with you, I also nailed several riddles with no basis other than the unknown person X."
"The word "everyone" carries heavy significance.
 ......Make sure you think ve~ry carefully first."
Erika wore a full but evil smile, confident that she had made a powerful move.
......Players on the witch side must eradicate all possibilities that would be possible for humans.
If I don\'t crush any chances for this ridiculously‐named Purupurupiko‐Man right now,
 ......he\'ll be used to explain everything the witch does.
That was a move I liked to use in my old games with Beato.
Back at the very beginning of the fight, my counterattacks were all based on an unknown 19th person X.
Because of that, it had been necessary for Beato to restrict the number of people on the island and eliminate any unknown person hiding somewhere.
......In that case, this time is the same.
So, just like Beato did, I need to get rid of any leeway in which that X can exist.
The number of people on the island has already been declared, but since she\'s suspecting tricks involving the names and number of people,
 saying the same thing again won\'t satisfy her.
............In that case, I have no choice but to respond to her repetition request and use the word "everyone".
That word has a disturbing ring to it...
...and though I haven\'t figured it out yet, ......it feels like there\'s some kind of demonic killer move hidden within it...
Damn. After insulting Beato so much and saying that the witch side had a huge advantage,
 ......I\'m feeling this much pressure from just a single repetition request...
"......<Destruction>, right?"
"You mean the chess term?"
"Yes.
 ......It\'s a technique of putting pressure on an enemy piece, forcing it to move and making them weaken their own position."
"......I\'m threatening you with the broad and powerful piece called "everyone", pressuring you to move.
 ......With this, you will be able to perfectly guarantee the alibis for all of the survivors,
 and it\'ll probably make it possible for you to trap me in the later impossible crimes.
 ......What are you so afraid of? Shouldn\'t this be a powerful move for you?"
"But it\'s a move that you\'re pressuring me to make.
 ......You\'re trying to make me weaken my own position in some way."
"No matter how good a move seems, it is a bad move when it is what the opponent wants...
 ......However, it will be hard to avoid the word "everyone" here......"
The red truth can cut the weak reasoning of the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} side apart over and over.
......In the past, I feared its ruthlessness.
However, I quickly learned that it could be used as a basis for a counterattack.
"......The red truth is a secret weapon, a treasured sword.
 ......Now I\'m painfully aware of how Beato felt."
It can kill with ease, ...but it\'s not something to be used with abandon.
Using it carelessly can corner the witch side instead......
"......What will you do?
 You can defer the decision if you want?"
"No, .........
 .....................
 ......Okay, I acknowledge it.
 {p:1:I acknowledge that everyone else is in the cousins\' room}."
"<Good>!
 Thank you very much, Battler‐san.
 What a beautiful, decisive move.
 ......Oh, I\'m in trouble.
 If a letter from the witch were to appear in this situation, why, whomever could I suspect?"
She said she was in trouble, but her face didn\'t look troubled at all.
......On the contrary, she looked as though she had just succeeded in making a very important foundational move.
In the witch\'s game, even a single mistaken move is fatal......
In both chess and shogi, you can\'t take back a move once you\'ve made it.
......That last exchange had left a bad aftertaste, as though flesh had been torn and bones broken......
"That should be enough of confirming everyone\'s position.
 ......Shall we continue the game?"
"Yes, we shall.
 Dlanooooooooooor!!"
"Yes, Lady {f:5:Erika}."
"Let\'s get started right away.
 Let\'s use the privilege our merciful Game Master has given us...!"
"Yes, {f:5:understood}.
 ......Gertrude, Cornelia.
 We will use two rooms\' worth of the three sets of seals we were {f:5:given}...!"
"For your attention—"
"We hear and obey...!"
"Seal the cousins\' room and the next room over.
 This means that everyone other than the victims has been sealed.
 No matter what happens after this, the humans within the seals won\'t be a problem!"
"By the seals on the doors and windows,
 {p:1:the complete sealing of both the cousins\' room and the next room over has been {f:5:guaranteed}}."
For just an instant, that red longsword had returned to Dlanor\'s hand.
She had been given permission to draw it,
 thanks to the red truth that she had finally gained.
......When the fight concerned these two sealed rooms from now on,
 Dlanor would be able to use that merciless blade, the Red Key...
This overwhelming power could slice even the Game Master in half.
For a while, Erika and Dlanor grinned at each other,
 entranced by the ruthless red light that was burned into their eyes...
"......Senior Aide,
 allow me to ask a question."
"What is it......?"
"It is my understanding that the players on the human side are to interpret the problems posed by the witch as the work of humans."
"......You are not mistaken."
"Then why are Lady {f:5:Erika} and Supervisor Dlanor...
fighting to lower the number of "humans who can commit crimes"...?"
......Cornelia\'s question was very simple.
Those two had made this move boldly and treated it like a powerful one,
 so it almost made it seem as though this move would greatly damage the witch.
However, if you thought about it, ......Erika was just strangling her own neck...
"We still do not know what sort of crime will occur in the future.
 Would it not be more advantageous to the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s if there are more people whose locations are not specified...?"
".........Be advised that now is not yet the time.........for the Lady or the Commander to reveal their thoughts."
"I apologize for my idle chatter...
 ....................."
Cornelia looked like she wasn\'t satisfied.
In the previous game, in order to help Kinzo escape from his study, Battler had made desperate efforts to crush his locked room using a variety of methods.
As a result, Kinzo had escaped into the darkness of the night,
 and it had later been possible to treat him like an elusive phantom.
In other words, locked rooms were advantageous to witches and disadvantageous to humans.
{n}Witches proposed locked rooms, and humans destroyed and denied them.
{n}Those were meant to be the standard tactics of this game...
And yet, Erika had created locked rooms herself......and sealed a full 11 people in them.
In other words, ......this was the same as abandoning the right to use those 11 people...
...when explaining all of the later tricks......
Battler had also once sought to confirm the locations of certain people,
 but that had been to check whether certain pieces existed with which he could break locked rooms, a completely different situation.
...Why had Erika taken these 11 people, who were supposed to be her pieces, ......and sealed them in a locked room?
Cornelia didn\'t have enough experience out on the field to understand this move,
 which only looked as though they were trapping themselves......
"A disturbing move...
 What on Earth is Erika planning..."
"......It isn\'t necessarily an attack.
 It\'s the same in chess and shogi.
 Strengthening the guard around your king is a valid strategy."
"In other words, the seals around those two rooms aren\'t an attack...but a defense...?"
"That seems likely.
 Thanks to that, it\'s hard to lay a hand on the survivors.
 It\'ll be tough to carry out the second twilight."
"......Ah, ...I see.
 The witch side has an advantage when more mysteries are presented......"
"Yeah.
 After all, if even one mystery goes unsolved, the witch wins.
 Each new locked room we present increases our advantage."
The mysteries that the witch side sets up are equivalent to attacks.
The human side must perfectly intercept all of those.
......It\'s almost like a penalty kick face‐off where conceding a single goal means defeat.
So, the witch side wants to increase its number of attacks.
The human side wants to lower the number of attacks......
When Battler had fought on the human side, he hadn\'t thought of the survivors holing up in a room as being particularly useful.
However, from the witch side\'s perspective,
 this strategy was simple but effective.
What made Beato incredible...
...was the way she had bluffed and sneered at that as though it was useless.
......On the inside,
 she must have been very worried about how to break down all of those barricades in each game.
 Right now, I\'m sure of that......
"I see, so strengthening your guard to make it hard for a crime to occur is one way for the human side to fight..."
".........However, that\'s a simple move.
 ......That "great detective" Furudo Erika wouldn\'t have looked so proud of herself after playing a move like that."
Would {i:Erika} be happy after playing a defensive move...?
Though this move looks as though she\'s restraining herself, ......it\'s also extremely unlikely that Erika, of all people, played a defensive move......
"I\'m sure......that this is an attack, not a move made for defense.
 ......Though I don\'t know what kind of attack it is."
"Next is our move...... What shall we do?"
".........For the moment, she has, at least apparently, spent her turn on strengthening her guard to stop the second twilight, instead of reasoning about the first twilight.
 ......If they push, pull back; if they pull back, push.
 In that case, it\'s time for us to attack."
"But how should we attack...?
 The guesthouse is well guarded."
"Yes, it appears as though the entire area of the guesthouse is now under Erika\'s control.
 ......However, there are certain pieces, like bishops and knights, whose specialty is cutting behind enemy lines."
Battler snapped his fingers, ......and a single gold butterfly appeared from the darkness,
 ......then flew up to the chessboard, trailing gold dust behind it.
It landed without a sound,
 ......then transformed into a black piece representing the witch\'s darkness.
"X‐ray.
 ......That\'s also a chess term."
"Yes.
 ......It\'s when a square seems to be under an enemy\'s control,
 but you observe that your own pieces do actually exert enough influence, so you attack—it\'s a high level technique."
"......Erika.
 If you really believe that you can defend against my next attack just by sealing up all the survivors...
...that\'s a naive idea."
Battler raised his new black piece high.
.........His target was a single open space deep behind enemy lines.
"How will you handle it...?
 This is my.........response."
"Haah.
 Now I can finally stretch my wings.
 First off, let\'s take a midnight stroll to the mansion."
"You would take a stroll in the middle of the night to an eerie mansion where a killer might be {f:5:hiding}?
 ......You must be very {f:5:eccentric}."
"By no means.
 I had to wait a long time to be free like this.
 I feel like it\'s free time after a swimming lesson."
......Now that {f:5:Bernkastel} was nowhere in sight, Erika was regaining her high spirits.
She wasn\'t exaggerating when she said she could spread her wings.
Dlanor knew that she was staking her own destruction on this game.
......And she was not in a favorable position by any means.
Dlanor could do nothing but assist Erika so that she could fight to the best of her abilities...
"Alright.
 ......The locks on the first floor of the guesthouse are perfect.
 The entrance is sealed up with a chain lock."
Before leaving the guesthouse, Erika did a check of the first floor,
 making sure that nothing was out of place.
Then she found a flashlight and umbrella in the servant room next to the entrance.
"Then let us {f:5:go}."
"Yes.
 We at least have to check the cause of death for all six."
She unset the chain, unlocked the door, and opened it.
{n}The freezing outside air poured in......
"......It appears to be quite windy {f:5:still}."
"Well, this body is just a cage of flesh to me.
 I don\'t care if it gets wet or cold.
 ......Let\'s go."
When Erika dropped her gaze to open her umbrella, ......she noticed something lying at her feet.
"...............!"
"It\'s............one of the usual {f:5:letters}."
It was one of those letters sent by the witch......with the seal of the One‐winged Eagle on it.
It had been wedged under the outside mat in front of the entrance,
 ......as though someone had predicted that Erika would eventually come this way while heading for the mansion.
Due to the guesthouse\'s large eaves, the envelope had avoided the rain entirely.
"......So, it\'s here already.
 ......Almost as though it was waiting for me."
She bent over and picked it up.
 ......She then tore it open recklessly and pulled the letter inside out of it.
A message had been written in neat handwriting...
"Welcome, Furudo Erika‐sama......it says.
 ......Oh, so it\'s calling me by name?
 They totally saw this coming."
"What does it {f:5:say}......?"
"It\'s an advance notice of a crime.
 Well, a post‐factum notice, technically.
 ......Apparently, they have taken Ushiromiya Battler\'s corpse.
 They\'re asking me to try looking for it."
"......So this isn\'t the "tear apart the two who are close" of the second {f:5:twilight}?"
"Well, disappearing corpses happened a few times in Beato\'s games too.
 There\'s nothing really new about this."
Erika shrugged and scorned the letter.
However, ......this letter was a real attack.
All of the survivors were sealed in the rooms on the second floor.
And, after Krauss and the others had gone around checking doors and windows,
 Erika had personally made sure that there was nothing at this spot.
So, this was an attack saying that someone who shouldn\'t exist had placed the letter, and that this "someone" was a witch.
......That was also an attack that the old Beato had often used.
"Haah, sheesh.
 If the way you show it is the same, please tell me that the actual trick isn\'t the same too.
 .........Dlanor.
 Please call Battler here."
"{f:5:Understood}.
 ......Lord {f:5:Battler}, we wish to take our {f:5:turn}...!"
"Got it.
 Let\'s have it."
"I\'m ever so sorry.
 I actually don\'t have a new move to announce."
"............?"
"The truth is......this is an apology.
 There\'s something I need to apologize for."
Apologize......?
Battler and Beato\'s eyes went wide.
However, though Erika said that she wanted to apologize,
 she had a confident look on her face, as though even that apology would be a new move.
......So, Battler glared at her dubiously, without letting his guard down.
"It\'s about those retroactive seals.
 ......I had actually already sealed one place.
 I apologize for taking so long to report this to you."
"......You already sealed something?
 In other words, you\'ve already used up all three rooms\' worth?"
"Yes.
 I promised that I\'d report on it right away, but I completely forgot until just now.
 You have my sincere apologies."
"You don\'t look like someone who\'s sincerely apologizing...
 ......Well, that\'s fine.
 I\'m the one who gave you that privilege.
 ......So?
 Where and when did you place the seals?"
"Dlanor."
"Allow me to {f:5:report}.
 ......Battler\'s guest room was sealed at the time of Lady {f:5:Erika}\'s inspection of the {f:5:corpse}."
".....................!"
Beato tried not to let it show on her face,
 but Erika didn\'t miss her eyebrows twitching slightly and her gaze flicking over to Battler.
"Normally, I would have liked to seal all five of the locked rooms, but I didn\'t have enough duct tape.
 ......Out of respect for the Game Master, I sealed only the room with Battler‐san\'s corpse."
".........So you were kind enough to close the lid on my coffin."
"I remembered a short while ago,
 and I was planning to tell you when we reached the mansion and investigated the guest room with your corpse in it.
 ......However, when this letter appeared, I figured I should report it right away."
"Wh‐why did you think that...?"
"Well,
 .........after all, Battler‐san has been playing this game not knowing that his corpse was sealed in the guest room.
 ......Because of that, .........I thought, possibly......
that it might......change things regarding the appearance of this letter."
".........The cousins\' room and the next room over are currently {f:5:sealed}.
 Sorry for the late report, but the guest room with your corpse in it is also {f:5:sealed}.
 And there are 17 people on the island excluding Lady {f:5:Erika}.
 The existence of an 18th person has already been denied in a previous {f:5:game}."
"So when I thought about......the person who could have placed the letter.........and erased your corpse,
 .........I thought that maybe, .........heh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eheh,
 ......just maybe, ......things might be......different......"
Erika laughed nastily while staring into Battler\'s eyes to see if he was panicked or disturbed...
"...............Battler‐san......"
".....................
 ......Stay calm.
 Erika has just made her report a bit late.
 There\'s nothing to be nervous about."
Erika had suspected it since the beginning.
It was possible that Battler actually hadn\'t been killed and was still alive.
And, if he was alive,
 ......then the letter that had suddenly appeared was easy to explain, ......even though all of the "survivors" were sealed up.
Judging by Beato\'s faint agitation, ..........maybe.........Erika\'s guess had been right on the mark.
Battler had played dead and somehow misled Erika\'s examination.
And then, when everyone had holed up in the guesthouse, he had snuck out of the guest room.
......He had placed the letter about the disappearance of his own corpse at the entrance to the guesthouse,
 and then he had gone into hiding......
If this was the truth, then the seals that had been placed on Battler\'s guest room at the time of Erika\'s examination...
were now very significant.
In short, if he had used this trick,
 then Battler would have "broken the seals" when he left his guest room.
The trick would not be workable {i:without breaking the seals}.
Since the survivors were all sealed in the guesthouse,
 breaking the seal on the guest room would mean acknowledging that at least one of the victims was actually alive.
If Battler had known about the seals earlier, it was likely that he would have advanced the game in a very different way to avoid this.
In other words,
 it was very likely that an announcement about the seals would have had a large effect on the rest of Battler\'s game.
Erika was saying: "if Battler, playing the part of a corpse, had remained inside the guest room to avoid breaking the seals,
 then perhaps the plot would not have included this letter"...
......If the truth was that Battler was actually alive and had placed the letter there,
 then, now that Erika\'s seals had come into play,
 .........there was a chance that he would find a contradiction in his trick somewhere down the line.
That sort of contradiction is called a logic error.
"A logic error......?
 I think we heard about that really early on in this story."
"......It\'s an illegal move, the greatest and worst form of error—and one that the witch side must never commit."
"Ah, I remember.
 It was something about the two sides of the tale not matching and creating a contradiction."
"Do you remember the part about magic for making candy appear inside an overturned cup...?"
"Yeah.
 Maria onee‐chan and Erika were fighting about that.
 ......It was just a sleight of hand where someone slipped the candy into the cup while Onee‐chan had her eyes closed."
"That\'s right.
 Since Maria did not observe the process of the trick and was only given the result,
 she accepted the "magical fantasy"—that the candy had appeared by magic inside the cup—and magic was established..."
"............Okay, so a logic error would be...
...‘a trick that has become impossible’."
Thinking back, the time when Erika and {f:5:Maria} fought fiercely about this magic with the red and blue truth...
was really the opening battle of this tale.
Let\'s try to remember that exchange.
......The heartless conclusion was...that it had all been a trick.
{n}Making the candy appear in the cup by magic had been nothing more than Beato\'s claim.
"Magic can only do things that one can accomplish."
In other words, the only results that magic can leave behind are those that can be accomplished without magic.
Allow me to say it straight out.
 There are two general types of magic.
If you summon giants...
and make towers grow from the ground...
......but, when the lid is taken off, nothing has happened in the rose garden, that\'s one type of magic.
That is just "fantasy", an "illusion".
It\'s a "lie" with no observers, taking place only where there is “absolutely no anti‐magic toxin”, to use the words of a witch.
Magic that doesn\'t have to produce a result is the easiest kind, and it is a "lie".
 It is the same as a worthless delusion, a fantasy, a daydream.
Even Battler saw through it partway through the third game.
Then, there is another kind, which we might call true magic: "magic with results".
The cup trick is an example of "magic with results", because the observer checks and actually confirms the cup is empty, a candy does appear inside the cup,
 and the observer is actually able to obtain that candy.
I have noticed that, unlike the magic of illusions, magic with results must follow one big rule.
The rule is...that only the unobserved process of what you accomplished can be transformed into magic.
I\'ll say it even more plainly and ruthlessly.
{n}In short, all forms of magic are tricks.
"The only results of magic are things that can be accomplished without magic."
......Ironically, this also proves that magic doesn\'t exist,
 ......but out of respect for the witch\'s game, let\'s call it "making the game solvable and fair for the human player".
"......So, this time around, "the candy in the cup" is "a mysterious letter that appeared in front of Erika".
 ......In other words, it has to be a trick, a sleight of hand.
 By claiming that the witch set the letter there by magic, Onii‐chan is trying to create "magic with results"."
"Correct.
 Since all of the survivors are sealed within the locked room of the guesthouse,
 ......it is possible to embellish this suddenly appearing letter and say that it was "strange magic", and "only a witch could have placed it there".
 ......But even so, it must be a "possible trick" in the end."
In order to break through the trick with the candy and the cup,
 Erika had countered with the blue truth saying that the candy had been snuck in there while Maria\'s eyes were closed.
That was the correct answer, so Maria hadn\'t had any red that she could use.
......But what if she {i:had} used it?
For example, what if Maria had used the red truth at that time to say...
“until Maria lifted the cup up, the locked room of the overturned cup was preserved”...?
"The red truth can only be used for the truth, right?
 If you could lie with it, it\'d be a massive violation of the rules."
"True.
 Denying your own trick with the red truth is a large violation of the rules.
 However, if you instantly switch over to another trick that doesn\'t violate that red truth,
 although slightly unfair, that red truth is admissible."
"......So in that case, in order to avoid contradicting the red truth that "the locked room inside the cup was preserved",
 the witch side would need to immediately propose a different trick compatible with that red truth.
 ......Like the excuses of a politician when he keeps backtracking as new evidence is shown to him."
"Yes.
 ......Well, for a red like this, she might be able to get away with some painful excuse.
 ......Maybe there was some device in the table, or maybe it was a trick cup with a fake bottom...
 .........But if those possibilities had been denied in red beforehand, they would not work either.
 .........The more red truths there are, the harder it is to talk your way out."
In actuality, the candy had been put in the cup while Maria\'s eyes were closed.
However, if, when Erika saw through that, Maria had used the red truth to say that the locked room of the cup had been preserved...
......the witch would have to rush and revise the scenario to a new trick that "still worked logically" after that new red.
Revising the scenario is an unfair move that would never be allowed in mysteries.
However, the very act of revising the scenario takes place inside the witch\'s head, which is an unobservable world.
So, she could claim that she\'d been using the trick with the fake‐bottomed cup {i:from the beginning}, and no one could deny that.
......So, ......even if it really was a trick done while Onee‐chan\'s eyes were closed...
...as long as the witch leaves herself a way out, she can even switch between truths (i.e., tricks).
Rather than calling this an action allowed to witches,
 it would probably be better to say that it is only allowed for the Game Master, the one who creates and writes.
But even still,
 the new trick must not contradict any of the previously stated red truths.
If the red truth makes it so that "the trick no longer makes logical sense",
 then there will be a mismatch between the two sides of the story: the illusory result that the Game Master claims was done by magic, and the true result that was brought about by a trick.
There will be a contradiction, and things will no longer make logical sense.
We call this a logic error...
And that means......the destruction of the witch\'s game.
"This world is a game that is possible to explain with humans.
 ......In other words, it must be possible for all the magic to have been done {i:by tricks instead}.
 ......If it\'s impossible to do with tricks, then the human side has no move and we get a stalemate."
"No, that\'s wrong.
 That is precisely the fatal and worst possible illegal move known as a logic error.
 ......If the witch side commits such an error, the game is instantly destroyed and they suffer a fatal defeat..."
"Erika has probably seen through to Onii‐chan\'s trick.
 ......Without the detective\'s authority, Erika can\'t perform a proper examination of the corpses.
 Because of that, he continued to play dead, ......snuck out of the guest room, and placed the letter at the entrance to the guesthouse."
"However, because Battler was so overly gracious in giving out those retroactive seals, things went wrong."
".........Stupid Onii‐chan."
"Panic is unwarranted at present...
 ......It is yet to be specified with red truth that the seals around the guest room are intact.
 ......He is free to break the seals.
 If he does not, then he can probably have it so that someone other than Battler was alive, and swap them in as the person who placed the letter..."
"That\'s right......
 It\'s not just Onii‐chan—the other corpses haven\'t been confirmed dead with the red truth either.
 ......So far, there wouldn\'t be any problem if they were all faking."
"Exactly.
 It is not yet the stage to get flustered.
 ......He merely has to change his move so that Erika\'s seals and the placement of the letter don\'t contradict each other."
".........And revising the plot without contradictions is one of the moves available to the Game Master."
"However, ............taking a scenario one has imagined and revising it partway through can sometimes create flaws in the tale.
 It would be a very painful move to make when the first twilight has only just ended."
"......It would seem that Battler was the one with an enemy piece deep behind his lines...
 This hidden piece will probably cause him pain and discomfort with each step from now on, like a pebble caught in one\'s shoe......
 ......This single pebble.........might kill Battler........."
"...................................."
"This still isn\'t quite a logic error.
 And we are at fault for the delay in reporting that we had sealed the room retroactively.
 So, I have no problem with letting Battler‐san retroactively rewrite the plot concerning this letter."
"......Retroactively rewrite the plot...?"
"Hmph, I see.
 ......If "I" placed the letter there, then that would be impossible as soon as "I" was sealed in that locked room.
 In which case, this letter shouldn\'t have appeared here."
"Correct.
 So, I thought you should have the chance to revise that small contradiction."
"......We have discovered this letter {f:5:here}.
 ......We are saying that we do not mind if you want to undo that, or if you want to use a revised {f:5:scenario}."
"All it takes is the presence of a letter and some duct tape,
 ......and a move like this becomes trivial for Furudo Erika.
 ............Your thoughts, ladies and gentlemen...?"
.........Damn, what a dirty move......
{n}Well, ......what else should I expect from Erika...?
And I also made a promise with Dlanor......to play an all‐out, merciless game......
..............................
Yeah, it\'s true.
 I had been planning to make Battler actually be alive,
 and then to have him slip out of the guest room, resulting in his disappearance and the placement of the letter.
However, if I revise the scenario now that my move\'s been spotted,
 it\'ll be the same as admitting that it was spotted.
Even if I have to be stubborn about it, I don\'t want to admit that I was seen through here.
I don\'t want to acknowledge a pathetic plot change where I try to sneak out of the guest room and end up breaking the seal.
I want......to change over to a different trick, so that the letter will be placed and my corpse will be hidden...
while still preserving the seals on the guest room...
......It doesn\'t really have to be me who places that letter.
I can still revise the logic without contradictions...
"But Battler‐san, even if you can place the letter somehow,
 how are you going to make your corpse vanish afterwards?
 ......The guest room is sealed.
 If you don\'t find a trick to erase the corpse from the locked room right now, a logic error will occur."
"...............I still have time.
 ......Let me think until the last second.
 ......Dammit........."
With a painful laugh, Battler unconsciously scratched at his head...
"Anyway, ......we\'ll leave the letter like this.
 ......I can\'t say "oh, sorry about that, having the guest room sealed makes a big contradiction so I\'d like to revise my move"...!
 It would be an admission that she caught me."
".........Heheh, I feel like a ninja hiding above the ceiling.
 Even though I was noticed and stabbed by a spear, I just withstand the pain, wipe up the blood, and act as though nothing happened.
 .........False courage works well enough.
 ......I can\'t let her know that this one hurt..."
".........Battler‐san........."
"Heh, heheheh.
 Hey, Beato.
 What does my face look like right now......?
 I\'m sure it\'s the same expression you had when I managed to hit you where it hurts in the past...
 ......Heh......heheheh...
 ...Dammit..."
Beato couldn\'t think of anything to say...
......Useless words of comfort would only get in the way of Battler\'s thinking now.
"......What would the old you do...?
 The old you, who created all of the locked rooms that tormented me so much in the past...
 .........What kind of trick would she use to erase my corpse from a locked room...?"
"Nn...............nn..............."
Beato trembled and groaned.
......The old her had been an expert at locked room tricks.
{n}If only that memory, that power, could revive, ......she would be able to help Battler......
.........There\'s still time to think......
{n}............There\'s still time...
Nice going, Erika......
 That was......a dirty move......The entrance to the mansion was locked, but Erika had a master key, so she opened it without any trouble.
She had gotten Krauss and the others to take the master keys from the servants,
 and at that time, she had used a little sleight of hand to pilfer one of them...
"Well {f:5:then}.
 Where shall we go {f:5:first}?"
"Why ask?
 ......Let\'s go and hear Battler‐san\'s answer."
Grinning, Erika cut across the entrance hall, passed by the dining hall, and headed deeper and deeper into the mansion.
......She headed for the guest room Battler had lain dead in.
Battler could put off deciding whether the seals would remain intact or not until the moment right before Erika witnessed them.
However, once she did witness them, ......the Game Master would have to show what had happened to them.
In the witch\'s game they were in now, ......the simple act of going to check the seals around the guest room was an attack.
".........Are you ready, Lord {f:5:Battler}?"
"Yeah.
 ......Or as you would say it,
 ............come, step forward."
"<Good>!
 Then allow me to examine your response.
 So, let\'s see, ......are the seals broken or are they not?
 Has the locked room been preserved, ......or has it not...?!"
The piece Erika held high in the air......was the white queen, which represented herself.
Her target......was Battler\'s territory.
 She cut straight in...!
Erika dashed down the hallway with a sickening smile and clung to the guest room door like a spider.
Then, she closely examined the seals she had placed retroactively.
"............Heh...
...heh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eeh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eeh{0}heh!
 ......Are you sure...?
 .........Are you sure,
 ...Battler‐saaaaaaan...?!"
"I‐......is this alright, Battler‐san...?"
"......Yeah, I can\'t back down here.
 ......After all, even if I\'m sealed in here, ......there are ways of placing the letter."
"But Erika is probably about to enter the guest room.
 And then, she will observe your dead body.
 ......What are you going to do?!
 If the body is there, then there\'s no problem.
 ......The letter\'s prediction will have missed, but it\'s not as though there\'s a penalty for that.
 ......But you......intend to fight this head on...!"
"There are times...
...when a man is challenged head on...that he has to respond, no matter what it is he\'s up against."
"......I must not...pull back here.
 .........I\'ll take this challenge.
 I can search for a way out all I want to later...!
 I managed to do that with Kinzo\'s study last time...!
 .........It\'ll be fine... I can do this...! I can do it!!
 Do your worst, Erikaaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aaa!!!"
"{p:1:We have confirmed that the seals to the guest room are {f:5:undamaged}.
 Since the time Lady {f:5:Erika} confirmed Battler\'s presence, this locked room has been {f:5:preserved}}."
"<Good>!!
 I\'m breaking the seals!!
 Rip, tear!!
 Heh, hehi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi!!!"
Erika destroyed the duct tape seal on the door in ecstasy...
It looked as though the intellectual rapist had finally laid her true nature bare.
"......Okay,
 ......I\'m opening it......
 Show me,
 ......Battler‐san,
 ......your naked scenario...!!
 Hehihi{0}ha{0}ha{0}haa{0}ha{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhh!!!"
Like a ruffian pushing down a weak girl,
 ......Erika mercilessly and greedily threw the door open.
Then, finally, ......the inside of Battler\'s guest room was observed by Erika.
Battler had to show it.
.........Was there a corpse, or wasn\'t there?
"<Come ooo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}oon>, Battleee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}er{-}r{-}r{-}r{-}r{-}r{-}r{-}r!!"
"Aaaaaaaaaaahhh, here\'s my respooooooonse!!"
Battler grabbed a black piece from the board and raised it high.
......Aah, ......that piece.........
Beato had no memories of the time she had been an expert at this game.
And yet, ......for some reason, she realized that this was a move from which there would be no coming back.
Once a piece was moved, it couldn\'t be taken back...!!
Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!
......The guest room was covered by a silent darkness.
It was pitch black, and nothing could be seen.
 ......However, there was a light switch just off to the side of the entrance.
If that was pressed, the room would be lit up, and everyone would see whether or not there was a corpse on the bed.
".........Should I turn on the {f:5:lights}?"
"No, ......wait a second, please.
 .........Battler‐san, I have a proposal."
"............Let me hear it."
"I think you already know,
 ......but this time around, I am not after the classic sort of victory of identifying the culprit.
 ......My enemy is not the lowly culprit killing the pieces, .........but my opponent, you yourself."
".........I know.
 ......So, ......you\'re after a logic error."
"Heheh......"
"......I\'m seriously regretting it now.
 ......You were acting so miserable that I fell for it completely, ......and I gave you a ridiculous privilege."
".........It was your {f:5:arrogance}.
 ......It will cost you {f:5:dearly}."
"..................Damn......it......"
"......So, ...what is your proposal?"
With a firm voice, Beato urged her to continue.
{n}Until just a second ago, she had remained behind Battler\'s back, a bit flustered.
......However, she was steady now.
......She saw that Battler had let his emotions take control and had been lured into making a bad move...
...and realized that it was time for her to stay cool and support him.
Erika\'s proposal couldn\'t be anything good.
{n}And on top of that, Erika was sly.
She probably wouldn\'t make a proposal that would be easily rejected...
"In a moment, I will turn on the light.
 The top of the bed will be lit up, and it will be decided whether or not Battler‐san has disappeared as the letter predicted."
"......If he\'s there, great.
 There\'s nothing strange at all.
 The letter\'s prediction would just be wrong.
 ......Of course, the argument would probably switch over to "then who put the letter there?",
 but for the time being, the location of the fight would move outside this locked room."
"........................And...if he\'s missing...?"
Beato already knew.
{n}She knew the move that Battler had made a second ago.
......Battler had......already disappeared from this room......
Therefore, they would need to prepare a different disappearing trick,
 one other than "he was actually alive and left through the door".
The situation is simple.
First, this room is a locked room.
{n}Also, Battler\'s life or death status has not been confirmed.
In other words, it would pose no problem if he was alive.
Under these conditions, they had to make Erika think that Battler disappeared.
He could escape from the room,
 ......or if that\'s impossible, he could hide somehow and wait for her to leave, making her think that he disappeared.
"Inside this tiny room,
 ......I will begin our endgame,
 ......the chase after the king.
 It will be over in just a few moves.
 You\'ll be unable to construct the logic needed to allow Battler to escape from this room,
 .........and the tale will be destroyed—game over."
".........Fighting to keep that from happening is our job.
 ......What is this proposal of yours?"
"An endgame fought over a logic error should be a bit more precise.
 ......Once again, we will fight with the red and blue truths,
 but we need a judge on the same level as the Game Master to observe and see that he doesn\'t create any logic errors with the red truth."
"......Th‐that seems reasonable."
"There\'s nothing special about this.
 ......Back when the old you was the Game Master,
 you were under the observation of your guardian, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}.
 She judged all your red truths to be valid."
".........So, you\'re telling us to show {f:5:Lambdadelta} our cards?"
"I\'ve been looking at them since the beginning.
 ......It\'s okay, don\'t worry.
 I\'m impartial in my judgments."
"C‐can you say that with the red truth...?"
"Yep.
 {p:1:I swear that I am impartial in my judgments}.
 .........I was very impartial in the last game, wasn\'t I?"
"......That goes double for trials where things will be interesting either way, doesn\'t it?
 .........Accept her challenge, Battler.
 Erika is going to corner you.
 Understand?
 .........She will duel with you and kill you in this room.
 ......If you\'re a man, accept the duel......!"
"S‐......sure, fine.
 .........We won\'t get anywhere if every single impossible murder I present is accused of being a logic error.
 ......It\'s true that we need an impartial observer to guarantee that the game is legitimate."
"Then I\'ll come around to your side.
 ......Let me take a look at your hand.
 ...............Hmmmmm......?"
{f:5:Lambdadelta} understood what Battler had up his sleeve.
......And she confirmed that Erika\'s first move had indeed gone straight through his heart.
Just as Erika had guessed,
 Battler was alive, and after Erika had examined his "corpse", he had slipped out of the room,
 ......placed the letter by the guesthouse, and hid himself somewhere.
Once the duct tape seals were retroactively placed on the guest room,
 ......he suddenly became required to show that they had been torn.
However, if he had done that, it would have been the same as admitting that he had been seen through and that he had lost.
Unwilling to admit that, Battler had claimed that the seals had been preserved, with false courage,
 and was now rushing to revise his logic.
True, he could still escape for a few more moves.
......However, Erika was planning to corner and kill him here...
"......Battler.
 ......You\'re fighting with some pretty incredible cards here."
"Cards...?
 ......Does this game of chess look like a card game to you?"
"......To me, it\'s always looked like you were playing a game of poker.
 So, by moving to this side and looking at the cards you hold, I understand everything."
"...............This is an awful hand.
 It\'s basically the lowest‐ranking hand there is...
 And Erika knows that\'s exactly what you have."
"............Heheh...
 What would you do?"
"I\'m the judge. I can\'t give you advice.
 ......But let me tell you my impressions."
"No, that\'s okay."
"......This hand gives me the tingles.
 ......You\'re...intending to use this "nothing" hand...
...and a big wager...
...to bluff Erika into folding, aren\'t you...?
 ......She\'s not going to fold, you know.
 ......If anyone should be surrendering their chips and folding now,
 ......it\'s you..."
"......Thanks for the advice.
 .........Battler‐san.
 I agree with her.
 ......Let\'s back down from the fight in this room.
 We don\'t have any winning cards..."
"Are you hoping for a card change to turn this hand into something half decent...?
 ......But you\'re playing chess, aren\'t you...?
 In the world of chess, ......if you rely on luck, ......you die......"
By "hoping for a card change",
 .........she meant relying on luck and hoping that, even though he couldn\'t think of anything now,
 he might later be able to think of a good plan for how to make this locked‐room trick hold up.
Battler, if you start this battle...
...without a trick up your sleeve,
 .........you\'re marching to your death...!
If you ever plan to back down, it has to be now.
When Erika presses the light switch,
 ......you just have to be lying on the bed.
......That\'s......all there is to it!
"......Lambda.
 I don\'t know what you\'re talking about, but you\'re chatting too much.
 A judge needs to be impartial."
"True......
 ......Then, good luck, Battler.
 ......I\'m hoping for a precise, chess‐like battle.
 ......You aren\'t......playing poker, remember......"
"Are you ready, Battler‐san?"
"Yeah, I am......
 ......Turn the lights on whenever you want."
"For the rest of the fight in this room, the progression of time will be stopped.
 This way, all the moves for both players will be made at the same time,
 and the first move made will be treated no differently than the last move.
 ......It might be difficult to understand what I mean, but this is a rule to protect the logic,
 and it will protect you as well."
"......From here on out, you will be rebuilding the trick in this room using all the twisted logic you want.
 ......And that means it\'s possible that you might think of a good idea partway through the fight."
".........Normally, it\'s unfair to revise your plot partway through.
 In order for that to be acceptable, ......you need a world where logic thought up "after the fact" does not come "too late"—
a world stopped in time, where everything happens at once."
"Of course, Erika can take advantage of this rule as well.
 ......If you revise your trick to be a new one, she can deal with that in a different way."
".........This is pretty complicated..."
"It\'s simple.
 ......It\'s like a corrupt politician\'s war of twisted logic.
 ......You lie shamelessly.
 When evidence is shown revealing your lie, you retract it,
 say that you just remembered wrong, then change to a new lie that doesn\'t have any contradictions."
"......The fight goes between a lie, then evidence exposing it, then another lie,
 ......like a fight between two snakes spinning around trying to eat each other\'s tails."
"<Good>!
 ......Just think of it as a world in which you\'re allowed to use twisted logic based off of your opponents moves as often as you want.
 ......I used that myself when sealing this room.
 So, I thought it was only fair to let you do the same."
".........You have no shame, do you...?"
"OK!!
 Then, both players, begin!
 Erika goes first, right?
 No, maybe we start by checking the bed—see what Battler\'s staking on this?!"
"Yeah, let\'s start by checking the {i:bed} for Battler.
 ......Erika, begin."
"Leave it to me, my master!
 <Light>...<on>!"
With a click,
 ......the sound of the light switch rang out,
 ......and the bulb turned on, lighting up the room.
......Battler\'s bet...
...on the bed...
...was......
".........Dlanor.
 Confirm it with the red."
"{f:5:Yes}.
 ......Ushiromiya Battler—"
"No, it\'s my move.
 ......I\'ll say it.
 ...............{p:1:Ushiromiya Battler is not on the bed}."
"<Good>.
 .........You did well not to run away from the fight.
 I\'m impressed."
"......It\'s a high‐stakes battle, so it\'ll cost you a lot if you\'re the one who loses.
 I hope you\'re ready..."
"*giggle* No one would raise the stakes unless they felt confident in their advantage."
"......Dlanor.
 Keep a record."
"As you {f:5:wish}."
At Dlanor\'s nod, Cornelia, who was hanging back, started taking a record.
She wrote down that Battler\'s corpse, which should have been on the bed, was not,
 ......and also that Battler hadn\'t backed down from this locked‐room game...
"As previously announced, Battler\'s first move is to have the corpse vanish.
 ......Now it\'s Erika\'s turn.
 Go ahead."
"......I present the possibility that Ushiromiya Battler is alive and hiding somewhere in this room.
 I proclaim this with the blue truth."
"Invalid.
 If you want to use the blue truth, give me a specific location."
"......Pfft.
 ......In the last game, Beato did that in Kinzo\'s study,
 and Dlanor made Swiss cheese of her, right...?
 I guess this is revenge...*giggle*..."
"Before I start searching, I have one blue truth I can use without a search.
 {p:2:There is a possibility of a hidden door X that is impossible to discover.
 He\'s hidden behind that, so it is impossible for me to find him}."
"{p:1:Knox\'s 3rd:
 It is forbidden for hidden passages to exist}.
 ......That right?"
"......
{p:1:No hidden places that are impossible for Erika‐san to find exist inside the guest room}."
"Knox\'s 3rd, ......{f:5:valid}."
"<Good>.
 ......Then let\'s get started with the search."
......Erika slowly began to walk around the room......
Until the endgame had started, Erika had been energetic,
 jumping about impatiently like a hungry dog.
However,
 ......now that it had actually begun...
......this was a stifling battle of wits...
.........where each breath made her tense...
Even the quiet sound of the rain......was distracting......
"Now that I\'ve searched the room, I request a description of its layout."
"......The guest room is divided into two rooms, the bedroom and the {f:5:bathroom}.
 Currently, you have searched the entire bedroom {f:5:section}.
 There is only one {f:5:exception}."
"............I\'ll leave that one place be for the time being.
 So, were there any irregularities discovered in the bedroom?"
"There were {f:5:none}.
 {p:1:Except for one location, there is no one to be seen in the {f:5:bedroom}}."
"......What\'s this "except for one location" business?
 Stop being annoying and make it public."
"There\'s a reason a face‐down card remains face down.
 ......I\'ll turn it over if it\'s needed, so look forward to it. ......*giggle*."
After thoroughly checking the bedroom, ......Erika headed for the bathroom door.
Since he wasn\'t in the bedroom, it was natural to think that he was in the bathroom.
And, since the guest room was made up of two rooms, if Battler wasn\'t in the bathroom either,
 ......it would mean that he had managed to vanish from the locked room.
.........Except for that single location which Erika had intentionally left unchecked......
"I\'m checking the bathroom."
"......Lady {f:5:Erika}.
 ......The sound of water can be heard from {f:5:inside}.
 Also, there is a faint {f:5:heat}."
"Ooh......?
 ......Don\'t tell me he\'s taking a shower...
 Is it locked or anything...?"
"No, it isn\'t locked.
 Go ahead and open it."
"......Then, if you\'ll excuse me."
Slowly, ......Erika put her hand on the doorknob on the bathroom door......
......She tried to push it open, but felt a strange resistance.
Of course, it wasn\'t the resistance of the lock.
......It felt......as though it had an unnatural load on it......
Out from the slightly open crack poured the hot air from the shower.
However, it was unlocked, so there probably wasn\'t anyone taking a shower.
After letting a dumbfounded expression rise to her face, Erika slammed into the door with her whole body, knocking it open...
"Hyaa?!
 Wh‐...what?!?!"
As soon as she opened the door, a tempest of hot air and water blasted her.
Erika was thrown for a loop, unable to understand what had happened.
After falling backwards on her butt, she realized that boiling hot shower water was spewing out at her, and hard.
"Wh‐
......what is this......?
 ......What a screwed up.........prank......"
Cursing, Erika wrapped the blanket from the bed around herself, and tried to enter the bathroom once more.
This time, she was able to figure out what was going on.
It was......an elaborate prank.
A wire fixed the shower nozzle in place so that it pointed at the entrance.
The pressure and heat were turned up to the max,
 so that anyone who went through the door would be met with a wave of hot water.
The pressure was very strong, which probably accounted for the weight she had felt when trying to push the door open.
She tried to make the nozzle point in another direction,
 but not only was it fixed in place by the wire,
 it was also fixed in a place high enough that Erika couldn\'t reach it with her height.
She tried to turn off the pressure, but that was also held in place by wires.
She couldn\'t manage anything with her bare hands.
 She would have to get a tool that could cut the wires.
However, when she glanced into the bathtub, which was filled to the brim with very hot water,
 she saw a bundle of wires and a pair of nippers that had been used to cut them lying at the bottom.
If she used those, she could turn off the pressure...
"......Ah, owowowowowowow!!
 ......Damn you...!!"
The blanket she had used to protect herself from the shower became more and more drenched with boiling hot water.
{n}At this rate, she\'d get burns even through the blanket.
She needed to turn the water off quickly...!
Looking next to the bathtub, she spotted a long‐handled body brush hanging there.
......Perfect...!
Erika used that to skillfully scoop the nippers up off the bottom of the tub.
Fortunately, it was a shallow Western‐style bathtub.
If it had been a deep Japanese one, it would probably have burned her badly.
Making sure not to touch the hot metal parts, she carefully took the nippers...
...and cut the wires around the faucet...
......Take that, ......and that......!
"Haah, ...haah!
 Haah......haah!!"
She finally closed the faucet and the heat from the hot water storm died down.
......For a while, Erika was forced to cool her almost burnt arms under running water...
"......What a {f:5:calamity}."
"Would you like a bath?
 I can wash your face with this brush."
"Allow me to {f:5:pass}."
"Oh. ......That\'s a {f:5:shame}."
Erika had finally regained enough of her composure to be abusive......
She closed the faucet completely, ......and silence returned to the bathroom.
After that, all that remained was Erika\'s heavy breathing.
She turned on the fan to get rid of the hot steam.
She left the bathroom for a moment until that was finished.
......It was pleasant, like stepping into an air‐conditioned room on a hot summer\'s day.
".........Now that was a ridiculous trap.
 ...However, that wasn\'t here at the time I examined Battler\'s "corpse".
 Therefore, the appearance of this trap proves that Ushiromiya Battler was alive.
 ......Well, I never thought he was dead anyway."
"......He merely decided to openly reveal a card that had already been {f:5:exposed}."
"Let\'s check the inside of the bathroom.
 Was Battler seen?"
"{f:5:No}.
 {p:1:No one was seen in the {f:5:bathroom}}."
"<Good>.
 With this, we...
{p:1:have confirmed that except for one location, Battler does not exist in any place inside the guest room}."
"......Give that a rest.
 Just where is this one exception?"
"A coffin.
 .........Ushiromiya Battler\'s coffin, that is."
"......Ashes to ashes, the dead to their {f:5:coffins}."
".........This room is where you plan to finish me off, right?
 ......Fine.
 Let\'s have it."
The previous period of silence, complete except for the rain, .........was suddenly replaced by the overpowering smell of a burning fuse.
Though it was extremely quiet,
 ......the room was filled with tension......as though you could be sliced in half if you relaxed for an instant.
A cloud of gold butterflies gathered on the room\'s round table......and turned into a witch\'s chess board.
It was finally.........time for the siege.
"Blue truth.
 {p:2:You did not vanish from this room.
 You just hid yourself to make it seem as though you\'d disappeared from a locked room.
 The place you are hiding......is the "one exception" that I haven\'t investigated yet}."
As Erika lightly raised her right hand, ......
a single gold butterfly appeared from the darkness behind her,
 ......flitted between the index finger and middle finger of Erika\'s raised hand, and became a white piece.
Then, .........she lifted it high into the air......
"{p:2:This is the one exception.
 ......The walk‐in closet next to the entrance}!!"
Bang!!
.........Like a white bolt of lightning striking the earth,
 ......the white piece...
...homed in on a weak spot in Battler\'s territory,
 ......and slammed onto the board......!
"Yes, it is {f:5:here}...!!!"
With a crash, the door of the closet, which was just off to the side of the guest room\'s entrance, was impaled by a spear that represented the blue truth.
 Dlanor had spun around and thrown it.
The door was completely pierced,
 ......and the spear stuck in so deeply that if a human had been hiding in it, it would have struck through their chest as well.
 ......Its still quivering handle was a testament to the force with which it had been thrown.
"......................................."
"{p:2:There are no places in which to hide other than {f:5:this}.
 You are currently hiding in {f:5:here}}."
".........What do you say, Battler‐san...?
 Have you been struck through the heart in a single blow,
 for a literal smothered mate...?"
"................................."
"......Battler‐san.
 ......It\'s our move now."
"Yeah.
 ......I thought it would be like that, Erika.
 You intentionally left one spot open so you could stuff me into that coffin.
 ......It\'s the same move that trapped Kinzo in Natsuhi\'s room last game.
 ......I saw this move coming."
"Oh, ......did you?
 ......Then let\'s see your response.
 ......But let me make a prediction."
"Let\'s hear it."
"......In two more moves, I will have you checkmated.
 That\'s my prediction."
"Then I\'ll make the same prediction."
"......I\'ll checkmate you in just two more moves."
"...............Sounds interesting."
"......These predictions contradict each other.
 .........Who will be the liar, I wonder......?"
The air crackled and sparked.
 ......The silence would hurt one\'s skin.
"Then go {f:5:ahead}.
 ......It is your {f:5:turn}."
".........It\'s useless.
 Your lowly coffin won\'t be able to trap Battler‐san."
"Here\'s my response."
Slowly,
 ......Battler held his hand over the chess board.
A gold butterfly that had appeared from the darkness rested on Battler\'s finger and became a black piece.
......That black piece was the king, .........which represented Battler himself.
"............You assert...
...that "{p:2:Battler is hiding in the closet}", ......and this is my response.
 .........Take this."
"{p:1:Ushiromiya Battler does not exist within the guest room.
 ......There are no exceptions, including the closet}."
Like a black bolt of lightning this time,
 ......Battler slammed his piece down on the white piece of Erika\'s that had cut deep behind his lines, ......smashing that piece completely.
As gold sprayed everywhere and a faint cloud of gold dust hung in the air,
 Erika\'s piece melted beautifully into the darkness......
"......I see, so he hid in the closet at first,
 ......and then slipped out of the room while Erika was occupied by the shower!"
"It\'s the same technique he used to let Kinzo escape from the study in the last game.
 Distract the observation of the observer, and disappear into the darkness."
"......<Good>.
 Of course you\'d say that, of course you would.
 ......I\'d already foreseen that move."
Next was Erika\'s turn.
......A gold butterfly fluttered in front of Erika,
 ......and she grabbed it right out of the air with a swipe of her hand.
She then lifted that hand into the air.........and raised the white piece high.
"Let me announce a retroactive move.
 This occurs back in the very beginning, right after I broke the seals and entered this room.
 ......
{p:1:At that time, I immediately closed the door, reset the chain, and sealed this room}."
"Objection.
 {p:2:Gohda severed the chain back when the crime was first discovered.
 Since the chain lock is not functioning, it is impossible to use it to create a seal}."
"Objection overruled.
 {p:1:Erika repaired the chain lock}.
 ......See?"
"......That\'s impossible.
 ......How could she have repaired a brass chain?"
"It is possible to repair.
 ......Have you forgotten, Beato?
 The duct tape seals.
 ......
{p:1:Erika used that duct tape to join the two cut ends of the chain together, "sealing" them.
 In other words, the chain was repaired by the duct tape, and this room once again became a locked room locked from the inside}."
"O‐objection.
 Erika‐san has already used up her duct tape seals, hasn\'t she...?!
 She shouldn\'t be able to use them anymore...!"
"Objection overruled.
 {p:1:The use of the duct tape wasn\'t limited by the number of strips, right?
 It was by the number of rooms.
 ......The only restriction was to limit it to only three rooms.
 ......Erika chose this guest room to be one of those rooms.
 So, Erika has the right to seal as many places as many times as she wants within this room}."
".........ng......gah........."
"......That\'s right.
 ......I......gave her permission to do that."
"This is the price you pay for your {f:5:arrogance}.
 .........Pity is the evil liquor that the arrogant most {f:5:prefer}."
"So,
 with this retroactive move,
 {p:1:I proclaim that the chain lock has been repaired by the duct tape seal and has regained its original functionality.
 And, thanks to that, I locked the room upon entering it and made this guest room a locked room from the inside once more}."
The white piece Erika held aloft......represented the seal formed by the chain lock.
This move would draw out Battler\'s king and drag it to the guillotine!
"Die, Battler."
The piece for the chain lock was slammed down on the square of Battler\'s king\'s throat.
"Repetition requested.
 "The lock created by the chain is currently intact"."
"....................................!"
Battler\'s face contorted.
{n}......Beato, who was watching from behind, grimaced even more.
This move......was very painful.
If his logic was that he had hidden in the closet until Erika passed by...
and then used the uproar in the bathroom to escape,
 ......then the chain lock must have been unset.
In other words, he couldn\'t respond to this repetition request.
And if he didn\'t respond, Erika\'s very next move would be to use the blue truth.
She would say, "you hid in the closet, then used the disturbance in the bathroom to escape.
 Since you then couldn\'t set the chain lock from the outside, you left it undone"...
 And she would be right.
......That...would be checkmate.
{n}As Erika had predicted, she would strike the finishing blow on the second move.
.........And on top of that, she would probably use the disappearing Battler...
to fully explain almost all of the tricks behind the crimes that were to follow.
......Losing the battle over this locked room would steal a major deciding piece from Battler...
But what if...
......he {i:was} able to respond to the repetition request?
What if he could say "the lock created by the chain is still intact"?
That......would be fatal to Erika.
It had already been shown with the red truth that this guest room could only be made into a locked room from the inside.
So, ......this hopeless locked room would instead become Erika\'s coffin.
With a riddle this tough, Erika would probably be forever unable to solve the mystery of Battler\'s disappearance.
And even a single unsolved riddle would mean victory for the witch side.
Battler......
wanted to respond to this repetition request if at all possible.
However, ......if he responded...
{n}If he answered by saying that the chain was still set...
......he would have to abandon the logic saying that he had escaped while Erika wasn\'t looking.
Because after his escape, he wouldn\'t be able to set the chain lock again.
The new riddle would put Erika in a much more difficult situation, but it would require him to construct a different escape method.
Even a move such as him leaving the closet during the chaos in the bathroom and hiding in another place—say, under the bed—
wouldn\'t work because he had already proclaimed that "{p:1:Battler does not exist within the guest room}".
If he could construct logic that allowed him to escape from here while leaving the chain lock intact,
 ............then Erika would be the one facing a fatal blow.
However, ......if he didn\'t have that logic.........if he failed...
......it would be a logic error.
The worst and most abominable illegal move that would instantly end the game in his defeat.
{n}He would have no way to recover.
.........For Battler, ......deciding how to respond to this repetition request...
...was a very advanced and difficult decision......
Either way, ......Erika would probably corner Battler.
"......In that case, .........the choice is obvious."
"B‐......Battler‐san.
 ......There are already many red truths guaranteeing the locked‐room status of this guest room.
 ......How do you plan on escaping from this...?!"
".........If I can just do something about the chain lock......
 ......If I can just do that........."
If I can somehow deceive the chain lock,
 ......I can make Erika have to deal with a terrible locked room!
It will probably finish her off.
But in order to do that, I need to make a trick for escaping this room,
 which remained sealed until Erika returned to it,
 and which was sealed by a chain immediately after Erika entered—
and on top of that, I have to make sure that the chain that can only be set from the inside remains in place...!
If I can do that...if I can figure out a way...
...then it all ends here...!
But I still can\'t think of that trick...!
Right now, Erika is asking me to repeat whether the chain lock is still set or not.
I need to decide whether I\'ll take that challenge or back down...and I need to do it right now...!
If I have a certain‐win trick, then this is where I should fight...!
But if I don\'t have that trick,
 ......I should just acknowledge that I slipped out of the closet, undid the chain, and escaped...and back out of the fight......
If I say the chain was set without a trick up my sleeve,
 .........then it\'s impossible for me to escape.
 In other words, it\'s a logic error......!!
"Even if we lose the fight in this room, there will still be chances left to us.
 We\'ve still only started the second day, haven\'t we?
 We have plenty of time to construct another impossible murder."
"......No, that\'s no good.
 If I admit that I fled from the room, it\'s the same as admitting that I\'m the culprit!
 ......If I back down from the fight in this room, ......it\'s the same as accepting my defeat in this game."
Battler\'s point was a valid one.
If Battler was the only one alive and free to move while all of the other humans were locked in the guesthouse...
 ......Erika would probably name Battler as the perpetrator for all of the following impossible crimes and base her blue truths around that.
If Battler wanted to forcefully turn that around on her,
 he would have to rewrite his tricks and logic so that "someone other than Battler" would be set up as the perpetrator.
To fix up one flaw, he would have to create new flaws,
 ......and the flaws might eventually pile up and kill Battler.
Even running away would mean tightening the noose around his own throat.
The first truth...that Battler is the culprit...has already been hit upon!
But I\'m still going to stubbornly refuse to give in......and somehow......fight to get out of this......! ...I need to fight...!!
This is the make‐or‐break moment.
 I\'ve definitely been cornered into a dangerous spot.
However, ......if I can nimbly switch gears, everything might turn around at once...
If I can just make this chain my weapon......
I can kill Erika...!!
"Wait, ......are you actually going to respond to her repetition request...?!
 Do you have any logic for how you can escape without undoing the chain lock?!
 .........No, you don\'t!
 If you respond, that\'s it...! ......You\'ll lose instantly from a logic error!
 It\'s clear which choice you ought to make!"
"Yeah, it\'s clear.
 .........No matter what move I choose, it\'ll turn for the worst just as Erika wants.
 ......If it\'s horrible either way,
 ............I\'d like to choose the move that has the biggest reward if we win......!"
".........You\'re going to call, even though you have no logic for escaping and no trump cards?
 ......You\'re planning on accepting her repetition request and taking her on...?!"
"I might not have so much as a single pair in my hand.
 ......But......with just one more card, this hand might become a straight, a flush,
 ......or even a royal straight flush.
 .........If hell waits for me after both options,
 .........I\'ll take the one that\'ll finish her off if I win...!"
"Th‐......that\'s an insane move.
 ......Sometimes, when madmen jump into the path of death,
 .........a miracle will occur......"
"It\'s impossible!!
 H‐......how are you going to escape this locked room without removing the chain?!!"
"......There\'s only one difference between heroes and madmen.
 ......It\'s whether they win or lose.
 .........If you\'re going to bet big, ......I\'ll be watching with interest......"
If I can finish things with this move, ............then as I predicted,
 ......I can kill Erika on my second move.
I still can\'t think of a trick for escaping this locked room.
However, ......there has to be something......there has to......
And once I think of it, ......I can make a magic illusion of me changing into a butterfly...
and slipping like smoke out of the crack in the chain‐locked door...
......If I have even a drop of that mad mage\'s blood in my veins,
 .........if I can have just a shred of the glorious miracle he was able to bring about,
 ......share it with me now......!
"......So, Battler‐san?
 Let\'s have that second move that you predicted you would checkmate me on."
"Please provide your answer to Lady {f:5:Erika}\'s repetition {f:5:request}.
 ......Will you {f:5:respond}, ......or will you {f:5:decline}...?!"
Slowly......
...Battler\'s hand.........stretched out to his king piece on the board.
He......lifted it up...
...and slowly...
......held it aloft...
...tracing a large circle in the sky......
Would Battler respond......or wouldn\'t he?
{n}Would the lock caused by the chain be preserved, or wouldn\'t it?
Would Battler\'s king.........crush the piece of the chain lock that stood right in front of it...?
......Or would it slip away like a ghost......and escape......?
"This is.........my response.
 ............As predicted, ......on my second turn...
......you\'re through.
 .........Here it comes,
 ......Furudo...
...Erikaaaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aaa!!!"
Battler\'s king became a black lightning bolt and crashed down onto the board...
Where had it gone?!
On top of the piece of the chain lock?
{n}Or past that piece...?
".........I will respond to the repetition request.
 {p:1:The lock caused by the chain is intact}."
Battler\'s king...
......had left the chain lock piece in its place...
......and had...
...{i:slipped past it}......
"Heh, ......heheheheheheheh......
 ......Yes, it sure would be cool if you could say that the chain lock was still set, wouldn\'t it......?
 That certainly would be cool, I admit......
 ......But do you know what they call someone who\'s so full of himself...
that he jumps into the path of death just because it\'s cool......?"
"............No clue......"
"Ushiromiya...Battler.
 ...
...
...
...
...
 That\'s
 what
 we
 call
 him,
 foo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}oool!
 I file a motion for a logic error!!"
"With that last red truth, you have just cut off your own logic!!
 May the impartial judge issue a judgment on this matter immediately, please!!
 Great Lady {f:5:Lambdadeltaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aaa}!!!"
"Motion received.
 ......{f:5:Lambdadelta}.
 Does this make logical sense? Your inspection, please."
"Motion received.
 ............Battler.
 .........Show me.
 Let me see......your cards........."
".........Battler......san............"
"......It is a royal...
straight flush, right......?
 If you\'ve got nothing,
 ......you won\'t get out of this with just a "sorry", okay......?"
".....................
 ......Yeah.
 I have no intention of apologizing."
"......If it\'s a logic error, the game board will be blown away.
 ......You inherited this game board from Beato.
 .........It\'s the one memento you possess...
of your precious Beato.
 So you\'ll never be able to accept a logic error."
A logic error only becomes established when the witch admits to it.
As long as they keep thinking about new logic by which they could escape, ......they will not die, cannot die.
However, ......that is like being imprisoned in an endless living hell of the mind.
"......Even if you do manage to crawl around forever after falling into the darkness of thought,
 ......you\'ll just be eternally trapped in a hell where you constantly think of ways to escape the locked room while denying the logic error."
"......Are you sure?! Are you sure?!
 This is the next worst thing to the depths of oblivion, you know?!?!
 It\'s like the difference between falling from the roof of a ten‐story building and falling from the roof of a hundred‐story building!!"
"............Lambda.
 Battler has already finished making his move.
 Players can\'t take back a move once it\'s made.
 ......Act as the impartial judge you swore to be, carry out our motion,
 and see whether or not Battler\'s escape from the locked room is logical...and whether there has been a logic error or not."
"Be slow, accurate, and meticulous like an archeologist.
 ......And, be as fast as a guy at an ice cream shop when he forcefully and skillfully scoops out that sweet, fragrant vanilla/soy sauce ice cream!!!"
"Y‐...yes, I know that.
 .........Battler,
 .........I\'m taking a look now."
".....................Battler‐san......"
"Beato, ......do you think......I\'ll lose?"
"......I don\'t want to think that.
 ......You fought with the old me many times...
...and finally reached the miracle that I so wanted you to find.
 ......So, ......I\'d like to believe.........that you\'ll accomplish a miracle...
......once again...!"
".........The woman called {f:5:Beatrice}...
 ...She fought on that same border between reason and madness...
......the whole time.
 ......She fought with a mixture of anger, sadness, and several other emotions towards me that can\'t be described with words.
 .........And in the very last game,
 ......at the very last moment,
 .........she managed...
......to seize victory."
That might have been......the rank of the hand in Beato\'s grip as she fell.
Beato passed away...
...without realizing...
...that she had already won.
In that final game,
 ......the true victor.........
was Beato......
"She entrusted me with this game board.
 ......That\'s why...I\'m going to win.
 .........So, I need you alone to believe in me.
 ......{f:5:Beatrice}..."
"If believing......will bring about a miracle..."
"........................Please."
"I\'ll believe in you......!!
 Battler‐san...!!!"
"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh, this is pissing me ooo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}ooff!!!
 Please just check it already, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}!!
 There {i:is} no valid logic!
 There doesn\'t exist any way to get out of this locked room!!
 You were overeager, Battler‐san!
 Sure, if you could win with this, that\'d be cool!"
"If you managed to disappear even though the chain was still set, that\'d be amaaaazing! So cooool! How mysterious! Hold me!
 Squeee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}eee! Aaah{0}hah{0}haa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhh!!
 Like hell you caa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aaan!!
 Like {i:hell} you can do that!!
 If you could do that, you really would be a witch!
 If you could vanish your way out of this locked room like a puff of smoke, I\'d have to acknowledge it!
 It\'d be the work of a wii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}iitch!!!"
"Quiet, Lady {f:5:Erika}!
 ......Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} is conducting her {f:5:inspection}."
".................................
 ...............Pass through, one move.
 ...Go back,
 ......corner."
With sweat gathering on her forehead, ......{f:5:Lambdadelta} inspected the movements of the pieces from Battler\'s side.
She was as accurate and meticulous as an archeologist, ......just as {f:5:Bernkastel} had told her to be.
"................................."
After gulping stiffly,
 ......Lambda looked between the formation of the pieces on the board...
...and Battler\'s face,
which remained tense but steady.
"......Lambda.........?"
".........I have...
......finished my inspection......"
"There\'s no way the logic works......!"
"...............Please......God......"
"..........................."
".........Erika."
"What...?"
"I\'m very sorry."
"Wh‐.........which way am I supposed to take that...?!!"
"It was fun.
 ......Now, this is the end."
"For hell\'s sake, ......which way am I supposed to take thaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aaat?!!"
"Silence!!
 I have finished inspecting Battler\'s move.
 .........The verdict is—"
{a:c:
"......Valid."}
"Va......lid.........?"
"......You lie...!!"
"I judge it to be valid.
 ......He\'s presented logic that doesn\'t violate any of the red truths, and I\'ve finished checking it.
 ......The move by the player on the witch side, and the red truth given in response to the final repetition request, is valid.
 .........Battler.
 For the first time, ......I have to say I think you\'re incredible..."
".........See?
 ......In your game, ......a miracle will always occur if you believe."
"B‐.........Battler...san......!!
 I...I\'m sorry...!!
 If only I had believed more strongly, ......you wouldn\'t have been cornered like this......!! Waaaaaaaahh!!"
Beato flew onto Battler\'s chest, sobbing...
Erika staggered backwards, ......shaking her head back and forth dizzily.
And {f:5:Bernkastel}...?
............Her face was like an expressionless mask.
Then, ......slowly...
......it became a smile...
And for some reason,
 ......it seemed the sign of some horrible emotion......
"Well......{f:5:done}......
 ......To think...
...that you escaped the room...
...without removing the chain...
 ......Simply {f:5:splendid}......"
With her small hands, .........Dlanor slowly started to applaud quietly.
......She was followed by Gertrude, and then Cornelia.
......And then by Beato and {f:5:Lambdadelta} too.
{n}.........Applause......filled the room.........
"O‐......Onii‐chan......
 ......H‐......how did you........."
"......I see.
 ......Yes, a move that cannot be seen by one whose thoughts are trapped within the locked room..."
"Impossible,
 ......im...
...possible......
 ......Eee...
eeeeeeeeeeek.........!"
As {f:5:Lambdadelta} watched Erika, who was stunned and moaning in shock from despair she couldn\'t accept,
 ...she had to take her hat off to the strength of Battler\'s heart and intelligence at this critical moment...
...and to the power of his miracles.
......Incredible, ......Ushiromiya Battler.
I was so wrong to think that your power and Beato\'s would cancel each other out and bring an eternal draw...... I\'ve suffered total defeat.
 .........And Bern, who realized your true strength,
 but thought she could get you to do what she wanted...
...well, she\'s suffered total defeat too.
Bern is the witch who waits for miracles.
{n}You are the witch who summons miracles.
.........You...
...are not Bern\'s piece.
......In this moment,
 ......without a doubt,
 ......you have surpassed Bern......
......The fact that you only took a moment to think up a trick to escape this locked room...
......really is...
......nothing short of stunning......!
As Erika predicted, ......Battler had been hiding in the closet.
Then, during the chaos in the bathroom, he had snuck out of the door.
 ......Erika had guessed this much.
She retroactively set the chain lock and sealed it to prevent Battler from doing this very thing.
The chain lock cannot be reset from the outside.
{n}So, it should have been impossible to escape from the locked room.
However, ......by thinking outside of the locked room, ......Battler broke through.
......We can use anyone to explain it, ......but let\'s go with the piece of Kyrie, his mother.
Just like Battler,
 the other victims of the first twilight have not been confirmed dead with the red truth.
In other words, ......just like Battler,
 ......the others—including Kyrie—can still move.
And their locked rooms are not sealed, so they can go out as they please.
......Kyrie......came to save him.
Kyrie followed behind Erika, ......and waited in the hallway while the latter entered the guest room and sealed the door from the inside.
......Then, after Battler undid the chain lock and escaped,
 .........she entered the room in his place......
Then, ......Kyrie reset the chain lock from the inside,
 ......and hid in the closet, ......just like Battler had done......
Yes.
 ......It is true that Battler isn\'t inside this guest room right now.
However, that doesn\'t mean that no one else is inside it.
......Kyrie took Battler\'s place in the closet,
 .........the one exception that Erika left unchecked, and is there still......
Kyrie...
......saved......Battler............
{a:c:
{p:1:
Ushiromiya Kyrie
 {f:5:cannot save} Battler
}.}
............Huh.........?
"Wh‐......what do you mean......?"
"......
{p:1:Ushiromiya Kyrie......cannot save Battler}."
"...Wh‐......why not?!
 There\'s no red saying that Kyrie can\'t save Battler!
 Wait a second, ......how are you using the red truth?!"
"It\'s valid.
 .........Dlanor\'s red truth is valid."
"Applying for authorization to unsheathe the Red {f:5:Key}."
".........Granted.
 Dlanor, do it, please."
"H‐............how......?
 ......How...can {i:you} authorize that?!?!"
"It\'s valid.
 ......I guarantee this red truth by impartial judgment."
".........Without telling us your reason?!"
"We\'ll reveal that soon.
 ......Very soon."
"...B‐......Battler hasn\'t proclaimed Kyrie dead with the red truth yet...!
 It\'s allowed for Kyrie to be playing dead!
 And the duct tape has already been used on three rooms, making it impossible for you to seal Kyrie\'s room...!"
"So how can you use the red truth to say that Kyrie can\'t save Battler?!
 That red truth has no basis!!"
"We\'ll tell you its basis soon.
 ......But more importantly, Lambda......?
 ......The logic with Kyrie has ceased to function.
 ......You should probably find another piece to switch places with Battler, don\'t you think...?"
"...........................nn,
 ......y‐
...yes.
 ......There are still pieces that can save Battler."
Reconstruct the logic.
......All we need is someone who can switch places with Battler—it doesn\'t have to be Kyrie.
"Then let\'s switch it to Natsuhi.
 ......Ushiromiya Natsuhi switched places with Battler...!"
"Dlanor. ......Do it."
"As you {f:5:wish}."
Dlanor\'s red longsword......smashed Natsuhi\'s piece into little bits...
How...?!
How...
...can Erika deny this logic...
...without the detective\'s authority?!
"{p:1:Ushiromiya Natsuhi cannot save Battler}."
"Th‐then Eva!
 Ushiromiya Eva!!"
"{p:1:Ushiromiya Eva cannot save Battler}."
"Then Rosa!
 Maria!!"
"{p:1:Save your br{f:5:eath}.
 Neither Rosa nor Maria can come to his ai{f:5:d}.
 ......{f:5:Death‐death‐death‐death‐}
{f:5:death‐death‐death‐death}!
 <Die the DEATH>!
 <Sentence to DEATH>!
 <Great equalizer is the DEATH>}!!"
"O‐objection!
 Erika‐san doesn\'t have the detective\'s authority!
 ......How can she use any red except for the duct tape seals...?!"
"Objection overruled.
 ......The lack of the detective\'s authority does not imply that no red truth can be used whatsoever.
 ............There is a way.
 ......Isn\'t there?"
"Yes, ......there is.
 There are......a few exceptional red truths......that even {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s without the detective\'s authority can use."
"......That\'s crazy...
 ......There\'s no way something like that exists!"
"Yes, such a thing cannot {f:5:exist}.
 ......However, ......there is a certain action permissible only to {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s without the detective\'s authority,
 ......and it can become a truth of such overwhelming credibility...
......that witches can easily raise it to the level of red {f:5:truth}."
"A certain action permissible only to {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s who...
...aren\'t the detective.........?"
".....................Y‐......you don\'t mean...
 ......Erika......you didn\'t......"
"......I...I\'ve got it.
 ......Yes, ...if I\'m right,
 ......these red truths are valid..."
"I...I don\'t understand!
 Was there some power that could only be used without the detective\'s authority...?!"
".........There is.
 ......There is just one."
"So, you\'ve finally realized.
 ......That\'s right.
 ......And it was for that reason, and that reason alone, ......that I abandoned the detective\'s authority this time around.
 ......You told me I could make the detective proclamation whenever I wanted, right?
 .........Well, unfortunately,
 ...I am no longer capable of making that proclamation."
"Knox\'s...
......which one was it......"
"{p:1:Knox\'s 7th.
 .........It is forbidden for the detective to be...
the {f:5:culprit}}."
"B‐but that\'s...
......wh‐.........whaaat?!"
......Finally, Beato realized everything.
Yes, ......the detective\'s authority bestows several powers that are useful for reasoning,
 but it eliminates one single privilege.
That is Knox\'s seventh commandment.
{n}......It is forbidden for the detective to be the culprit...
"......In this game,
 ......it is impossible for {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s without the detective\'s authority to examine corpses perfectly."
"......So, ......there have been several tricks where the dead have all been faking and walking around where they please.
 ......You probably thought you could use that logic to create several impossible crimes after this."
"......When I said that I wouldn\'t make the detective proclamation,
 somewhere on the inside, you must have said "I\'ve won"."
".........You\'re pretty sly yourself.
 You gave me the duct tape seals, seemingly out of mercy, but that was because you planned to have all of the first twilight victims survive,
 band together, and carry out the crimes.
 That\'s why you gave me only three rooms\' worth, which wouldn\'t cover all six people."
"No matter which rooms I sealed, at least one of your pawns could move freely.
 .........You must have been plotting to use that to corner me.
 ......But too bad.
 Your naivety is deeply tiresome.
 ......You stupid man!"
"..................I admit it.
 ......I admit that I fell for your monkey show...
and that in my pride, I tried to show you some mercy.
 .........That\'s right.
 ......Even without the detective\'s authority, ......there is a way.
 ......A way for a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} to make sure that a corpse examination cannot fail."
Is the human lying in front of you alive or dead?
You can answer that question by examining the corpse.
With just a quick glance, your chances of being right are fifty‐fifty either way.
Various bits of knowledge and experience can be used to obtain a more precise result.
.........However, no matter how much you do that,
 while you can reach up to 99%, you can never reach 100% accuracy.
......That\'s what most people would think.
However, there is one way.
{n}......One way to conduct a perfect examination.
"Kill them.
 .........It\'s as simple as that."
".........Erikaa...aa......"
"Without the detective\'s authority, I can\'t tell whether the victims are dead or faking.
 So, I needed a way to be sure.
 ......And, if possible,
 it would be preferable if they were removed from the game board,
 so that they couldn\'t make a mess of things later on."
"So, I dashed all over the mansion,
 visited all the crime scenes,
 and............
{p:1:I killed everyone all over again}!"
"Wh‐......what on.........earth..............."
".........Of course, she couldn\'t just kill them however she liked.
 ......It had to be a perfect way of killing, good enough that their deaths could be determined with the red truth.
 ......Erika made sure of that."
"The manner in which they were each killed differed,
 .........but afterwards,
 {p:1:she completely severed the heads of all those she killed}.
 ......That method of killing is solid enough to be called a red truth, right...? Lambda......?"
"......I‐...............it\'s valid.
 No human could survive...
......after being decapitated...!"
"C‐could you have severed all of those heads without getting any blood on you?!"
"For example, you can take a large trash bag from the kitchen and grab the knife through it.
 ......Then, if you cover the entire corpse with the trash bag as you do your work, you can block nearly all of the blood spatter."
Naturally, I prepared a separate knife and bag for each person I killed, and left those items at the crime scene.
Of course, I didn\'t humiliate myself by walking around with them, leaving blood in the hallways and dirtying my clothes.
There will probably be trash bags left at the crime scene with my fingerprints on them,
 but since the game ends before the police come, and the bags won\'t be used as evidence of anything,
 they can just be left there without a problem.
"......Are you insane?
 ......What kind of...
mystery would...
ever allow something like that......?"
"I can\'t believe I\'m hearing {i:that} from a witch on the fantasy side.
 Oh, and don\'t worry.
 I didn\'t kill you.
 ......I found you last and didn\'t have time to sever your head,
 so I just sealed your whole room with the duct tape you gave me."
"......Then again, that might\'ve been because I knew this would happen and wanted to watch you flounder.
 .........*giggle*,
 ......*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!
 Oh, that\'s right.
 ......Just like I can say that I killed them in red, I can say one more thing."
At that point, Erika stopped for a second,
 ......and still,
 ...aaah, is she really capable of an expression even uglier than all the ones before......?
With that...
...greatest of all faces, ......she spoke.
"{p:1:All five people I killed......were very much alive until the moment I killed them}.
 ......Everyone faithfully played dead as best they could until the moment just before I killed them, okay?"
".........Maria‐san was quite the little trouper.
 .........After all, even though her mother had already been killed in the same room,
 .........she kept on playing dead without even noticing......
 *giggle*, {nobr:*giggle*giggle*—}"
"Hahahahaha,
 ahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha...
he{0}ha{0}hyah{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haa{0}ha{0}haaa{0}haaaah!!"
They\'re devils...
Up to now,
 ......many witches and demons have appeared in this tale,
 ......but this is the first time...
...I\'ve seen...
...a true devil......
"You bastards......
 ......You bastards......
 ...Uu......uugyaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhh!!!"
At last, Beato understood the entire plot of this tale.
This tale......was just the story of a prank.
Someone must have come up with the idea of playing a slightly harsh trick on their inconsiderate guest,
 who loved to show off her intelligence and act the part of a great detective,
 ......and several people had agreed to go along with it.
The ones who would play the victims went into their assigned rooms, set the chain and the lock from the inside,
 ......and played dead......to create a fake locked‐room murder......
......If you think about it that way, the rooms chosen for the corpses seem to make more sense.
It was only natural for Natsuhi to "die" in her own room.
......If you\'re going to play dead, it\'s only natural that you\'d want to lie down on your own bed.
Eva\'s vanity is strong, so she must have volunteered to "die" in the VIP room.
Kyrie was in Krauss\'s study.
......That was probably well air‐conditioned and comfortable.
Rosa and Maria were in the parlor.
A soft sofa would have been a great place to play dead.
......Maria had gone the extra mile to make it look more realistic by lying dead alongside the wall.
Battler was in a guest room.
 The temperature here was also nice.
{n}The bed must also have been fairly pleasant.
...Yes.
 The victims for this first twilight had all died in comfortable rooms.
In the past games, the corpses had often been found exposed in the courtyard or under the rose garden arbor.
In the cold gardening shed or in the boiler room......
This time, there were no victims in any such inhospitable environments.
This...
...is probably the truth.
This was the story of a prank, where no one was dead in the first place...
And then...
......this......devil...
............turned it into a genuine murder case......!
"......You do have the right to speak ill of Lady {f:5:Erika}.
 ......However, ......at this moment, you have the obligation to present new logic that does not lead to any {f:5:contradictions}."
"Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
 Corpses to corpses...!
 So, Battler‐san? Let\'s continue the game!!
 Please present a different human to switch places with you.
 If you don\'t, your trick.........will become a logic error......"
There\'s now......no one who can come to the rescue.
Erika\'s killed every last one of them!!
"D‐......dammit......dammit, dammit, dammii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}it!!"
"......Battler‐san, please, calm yourself...!
 Now\'s the time to wipe our tears away and fight...!
 Even if you\'ve lost five pieces who can save you, there\'s still eleven in the guesthouse!"
"Y‐you\'re right...
 ......Krauss, Hideyoshi, Rudolf, ......George, Jessica, Shannon, Kanon!
 Genji, Gohda, Kumasawa, Nanjo!!
 It doesn\'t matter who, as long as someone comes here!!
 Somebody, somebody, hee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}elp!!"
"But there\'s no waa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}ayy{-}y{-}y{-}yy{0}weh{0}wehh{0}wehh{0}wweh{0}wweh{0}weehhh!!
 Take a look at thiii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}iiis!
 Gertruuuude,
 Corneliaaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aaa!!"
""For your attention: we beg to inform you that we are here and ready.""
"Bwaattleeer‐swaaaaaann!!
 You gotta seee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}eee thiiiis!!
 Whaaaaaat\'sssss the deeeeeeal?!"
Erika, who was now so excited that her pronunciation was tumbling all over the place,
 pointed at two doors.
It was the hallway on the second floor of the guesthouse...
{n}......They were in front of the cousins\' room and the next room over.
"Look, here, here!
 There\'s {i:something} stuck to the {i:doo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}oor}!!
 Whuzzis?! Whuzzis?!
 Hey, do {i:you} know, Gertrooo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}ood?!"
"......For your attention: know that it is the duct tape seal of the cousins\' room."
"<OH YEAAAAHHH>!!
 <VERY GOOOOOD>!!
 <One more>!!
 Wuzzabout the thing on THIS doorrrr{-}r{-}r{-}r{-}r{-}r{-}rrr?!?!"
"Be advised that it is the duct tape seal of the next room over."
"<Oh, very GOOD>!!
 Okay, you two!
 And all of you watching at home on your TVs!!
 Pleease have a look at the duct tape seals on both doors!!
 So, what do you think of them...?!
 Are they broken? Are they not broken...?
 Please, the red truth, loudly so we all can hear!!"
""{p:1:For your attention: I beg to inform you of the following.
 Know that neither is broken}.""
"{p:1:Know that an unbroken seal is proof that all have hitherto been denied passage}."
"{p:1:It needs no second telling, but be advised that passing through without breaking the seal is impossible}!!"
"{f:5:Good}.
 ...Battler, it is as you {f:5:see}.
 ......There no longer exists anyone who can come to your {f:5:aid}."
The victims of the first twilight have all been killed!
{n}And the guesthouse is still sealed!!
No one can come to the rescue...!!
"Uug......
kh...
...gghh.........!"
Erika had anticipated this moment all that time ago,
 ......and that was why she had made the strategic move of suddenly sealing these two rooms.
This resolved the confusion Cornelia had felt back then.
Why wouldn\'t the human side player want as many free humans as possible?
 That was a natural, simple question to ask.
However, once you seal up {i:all} of the humans,
 ......there is no room for magic to intervene.
Why is magic magic?
{n}Because the people who saw it say that it was magic.
Then, is it possible for magic to exist in a place with no people?
{n}......There\'s no problem with that because there\'s no anti‐magic toxin, right...?
Wrong!
 Magic in a place that isn\'t being witnessed is no different from a delusion, a daydream!
Magic with results must be carried out by human hands.
{n}If all humans are sealed off, then magic cannot be created.
This was Erika\'s strategy for this game......and her beautiful...checkmate!!
"Well now.
 ......Who\'s going to come save you?
 Please tell me who the "real" person is who switched places with you, remained in the guest room in your place,
 and set the chain lock from the inside.
 ......If they even exist."
".........Well, Battler...?
 You have a broken thread of logic.
 ......Who could have come to save you?
 You are currently in the middle of a logic error."
"Uugh...
......w‐
......wait...
 I\'m still......thinking......!"
"......Battler, you have two rights and one obligation.
 ......Your first right is the right to build a new thread of logic to reconstruct your locked‐room trick.
 Your second right is the right to come clean and admit to your logic error.
 And your one obligation...is to choose one of those two options."
"There is some mercy.
 There\'s no restriction on the amount of time you have to make that choice.
 .........*giggle*, that\'s right, your time is endless, eternal."
"I...I\'m sure there\'s still some way,
 .........some twisted logic or loophole or...
...anyway, ......I\'m sure there\'s still some way......!"
"I\'m thinking about it!
 What about you, Beato?!
 ......Let me know if you find anything...
 .........I\'m sure the old Beato......could have managed something...
 She built up several locked rooms like this...!!"
Beato felt awful...
......Why was she Beato, and yet not?!
Surely, the old her would have thought up a trick under these restrictions.
If only she could do that, she could guide Battler to victory......but she couldn\'t do it as her current self!
"*giggle*.
 Yes, I\'m sure you\'ll think of a good trick.
 Eventually, surely, probably, maybe.
 ......Pretty sure it\'s impossible though.
 *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!"
"......So then, Battler.
 ......Let\'s go back to the guest room.
 From now on, that will be your world."
Once again, ......they returned to the slightly chilly guest room.
It was the same room as before, of course,
 ......but it felt as though an unsettling darkness had crept in...
"Here\'s the room you\'ll spend your days in from now on.
 .........You just need to escape from this room by any means you want."
"......However, there are conditions.
 ......As I believe you know, these are all things you forced on yourself."
"......First,
 {p:1:this room is a locked room created from the inside.
 The seals on the windows are intact, so there can be no escape from there.
 Of course, there is no way to escape by leaving through the bathroom}."
"{p:1:......I\'ll make it simple.
 There is no exit to escape from except for this door.
 However, the chain lock on this door is set.
 You can unset and reset it all you want, but you can only do so from the inside.
 Furthermore, you are free to go out through the door, but leaving while the chain lock remains unset will not count as an escape}.
 You have to show that you can escape from this room with the chain lock still connected......!!"
"......But...
...he couldn\'t possibly......"
"He couldn\'t possibly do it?
 He made this locked room himself...!!"
"We have set up...just one exit other than the door.
 ......That one\'s in the bathroom."
"My merciful master has arranged for a last way out if you fail to think of any trick to escape.
 ......Please listen up!!"
{f:5:Bernkastel} guided Battler to the bathroom.
It was just a normal bathroom.
The setup intended to surprise Erika and buy Battler time was no longer working.
However, the bundle of wire and the nippers that had been used to prepare that trap...
still lay in the empty bathtub.
"Are you saying......that I can use these to help me escape.........?"
"Yes, please feel free.
 It\'s a present.
......However, no matter what you use, you can\'t lock the room from the outside.
 And you can\'t fool the seals either, okay?
 These tools aren\'t here to help you pull some trick with the chain lock.
 ......They\'re here to let you escape from this room in a more direct way..."
"......H‐......how am I supposed to use these......?"
"........................
 ......Not bad, Bern.
 ......I see......that your mind\'s as grotesque as ever........."
"There is an exit that leads directly outside from this bathroom.
 ......Can you find it?"
"......Y‐......you don\'t mean............"
"D‐did you figure it out, Beato...?!
 Please, tell me...!!"
"That\'s...
.........i‐
......impossible........."
"Please, where is it?! Tell me!!
 We can\'t let the game end like this!!"
"There......"
"Huh? Where......?
 Under...the bathtub......?"
"Can\'t you see it? There\'s a round hole that leads straight out of this room."
"......It\'s a bit small though......"
"Y‐
......you...
......you...
......aahh...
...nngggyaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhh......"
"It\'s the drain right there at the bottom of the bathtub.
 You can get out through there without touching the chain lock.
 But your body is a bit too big to get through this exit.
 ......That\'s why I decided to lend you those tools there."
Escape......through the drain...?
 How...?
She couldn\'t mean using those nippers for a hundred years to widen that hole, right...?
Battler and Beato......had already realized.
......They had figured out this demonic way out that the demons were proposing......
"Just use those nippers...
...and cut your body into pieces that can fit."
"......Pinch, rip, snip.
 ......You can sit back in the tub under a hot shower...
...and start from your toes...snip then wash, snip then wash...
 Just keep doing that and, oh, what do you know,
 you\'ve suddenly managed to escape from the locked room."
"‘Oh, what do you know’ is right, my master...!
 It looks like both siblings are going to end up the same way...!
 Heheh......heh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eeh{0}eh{0}eheh!!"
"But Bern...?
 If he does it that way, the hand holding the nippers will be left at the end."
"That\'s why we have the wire...
 ...Beforehand, Battler will have to wrap the wire around his wrist, then stretch the other end out into the corridor through the crack in the door.
 ......You should be able to fit just a wrist through the crack left by the chain lock."
"......If you can make yourself that small, I\'d be happy to pull that wire from the hallway and save you."
"My master, if you do that, I want it!!
 Battler\'s wrist...
eheheh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eeh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eheh!!"
"And what would you use that for...?
 But no, I\'ve already decided to use it as a back scratcher.
 When the time comes, I\'ll scratch your back with it. What do you say?"
"Y‐yeees, my master...
 ...Master\'s going to scratch my back...
with Battler\'s handhaha{0}ha{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aha{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhh!!"
"........Finding them annoying?
 Irritating? Obnoxious?
 ......Don\'t worry, it\'ll get quiet really soon.
 ......Until you can escape from this room, all noise to disturb your thoughts...
......will disappear for all eternity."
"Th‐...that\'s a relief...
 I\'ll be glad of the quiet...!"
"..................Here\'s......some advice from a survivor of hell.
 ......Enjoy the liveliness while you can.
 .........Even the annoying insults you hear now...
......will be useful as fond memories to preserve your sanity in the depths of eternal silence."
.........Do you hate Bern and Erika?
Then that\'s their parting gift to you.
.........As long as you have hatred, you will be able to avoid giving up.
Giving up has a completely different meaning here, okay...?
.........Once you give up, {i:still} can\'t escape, and realize that hell is eternal,
 ......you\'ll wish you prepared yourself earlier.
"Did you just call yourself a survivor......?
 ......Then,
 .........you also......"
"......You know, ............every once in a while,
 ...that terror comes back to me.
 .........I wonder......whether I really have escaped from that hell.
 .........What if......I actually lost my mind a long time ago...
......and I\'m still in there...
......just having delusions about being here and chatting happily with you all like this...?
 .........That nightmare still terrifies me..."
".........And so, I need to constantly feel...truly feel that this isn\'t a dream...
 ......Hey, ......are you guys......really.........real......?
 ...You aren\'t just an insane delusion I\'m having inside that hell, ......right......? Right? .........Right......?"
There was something in {f:5:Lambdadelta}\'s pleading expression that sent shivers down the spine.
It was probably more terrifying than any threatening words she could have used with even the most vile expression on her face......
It was time for Battler to realize.
......A logic error isn\'t so sympathetic that you can just stick out your tongue,
 ask for forgiveness, and say you\'ll be more careful next time......
Even if you feel that the fight is at a point where you can\'t back down, risking a logic error by leaving things up to chance......is {i:never}......a risk you should take.
It was time for him to pay up and understand the true risk and terror implied by the words "betting one\'s life on a fight",
 which must sound so exciting for a man......
"Battler‐san, hang on in there...!
 I\'ll think deeply upon it as well!
 I\'ll devote everything I have to thinking of a trick to escape this room...!
 I will come to save you...!!"
"B‐......Beato......
 ...Uuu......uuua{0}a{0}a{0}arrg{0}g{0}g{0}g{0}ghhhh......
 I\'ll definitely think of something... Just you waaaaaaatch......"
"Well, regretfully, it\'s time for us to leave.
 We mustn\'t get in the way of his job any longer."
"See you later,
 Battler‐san.
 ......Or, like you\'d say it, <see you again>, right?
 <Have a nice day>...
*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!"
".........Later,
 ......Battler.
 ......Good luck."
"Battler‐san, don\'t give up...!
 You\'ll definitely think of a trick!
 I\'ll think as well, and I\'ll come to save you!!"
"B‐......Beato............?!"
Before he could finish saying Beato\'s name, ......they had all disappeared.
{n}......They hadn\'t disappeared in a golden spray, or turned into butterflies and flown away...
As if there had never been anyone but him in this room to begin with,
 ......Battler blinked once,
 .........and everyone else was gone.
Nothing remained—
not their voices, their presence, their warmth,
 ......nor even the faint perfume Beato had worn.
The frigid air of the room was wrapped only in the lonely sound of the wind and rain......
With that overpowering feeling of isolation......
I finally began to realize.........how horrible a punishment......this would be......
"D‐......damn those bastards...
 ......It can\'t be that hard to get out of a room like this......
 I mean, rooms are made so that people can come in and out of them, right...?
 ......If they can\'t do that, you wouldn\'t call it a room."
This is stupid...
 ......It\'s easy to undo a lock and chain from the inside.
......Dammit...
 ......For some reason, I\'ve always been clumsy,
 ......and undoing chain locks always gives me trouble.
Aha, ......it\'s off.
 Heheh, ......heh......what a stupid puzzle.
{n}Look, ......now the door opens freely, ......see...
......Hey...
...what\'s this cold feeling on my neck......?
What the hell is this.........?
......Why is there suddenly this iron collar around my neck......that\'s attached to a chain?
Dammit, who would do something like that...
......Wh‐when I reset the chain lock, it disappears.
 And when I undo it, it comes back.
The chain is pretty long, so I can make it a little way out into the hallway.
{n}But I can\'t go far from the door...
Then if I close the door,
 .........stand on the outside and stick my hand through the crack...
......and just somehow set that chain......
 .........Uuu......geh......
Why......have I always been so clumsy...
 .........I\'m not really clumsy, ......it\'s just that me and chain locks don\'t go well together...
 Dammit, ......I hate chain locks, ...I hate chains......
 Why......won\'t it work......?
 Why......can\'t I set the chain lock from the outside......?
 Dammit...dammit...dammit...
 ......Nng...
...ggyaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhhh...!!!
"......Battler‐san,
 ......Battler‐san!!
 Hang in there, hang in there...!!"
"...........................
 ......Can\'t......get out...
.........ggh......kk........."
Beato called out to Battler repeatedly, shaking his shoulders hard, ......but by now, Battler\'s eyes were blank.
......The words didn\'t reach him......
{f:5:Bernkastel} and Erika had already left.
The game was officially suspended until Battler could think of a new trick,
 ......but it was doubtful that it would be resumed even after a thousand years...or more...
".........Okay, I\'m heading off too.
 ......So long, you two."
"Th‐there\'s no need to say "so long"...!
 We\'ll—We\'ll think of a trick in no time, and the game will resume!
 We won\'t take up your time...!
 So stay here a little longer...! Please...!!"
"......We\'ve drawn those same words out of many a witch\'s mouth in the past.
 ......And I\'ve heard of hardly any who\'ve actually managed to resume their games.
 ......As far as I know, the only two are me......and Bern."
"Why......why would a person who knows about that hell throw another person into it?!
 Just because you\'re bored?
 Is that all?!"
"...............Yeah, that\'s all.
 ......It\'s to escape from boredom.
 ......Because when we get bored, ......we remember.
 We remember that hell.
 .........And, you know,
 ......by throwing someone else down into that hell,
 ......we realize that, oh, we\'re the ones on the throwing side,
 ......and that means we aren\'t in that hell ourselves.
 .........If we don\'t keep doing that,
 .........then the fear of that hell will overwhelm us..."
"......If you two managed to get out of it, then he can as well!
 I will save him...!! For certain......!!!"
"For {i:certain}......?
 ......You stand before the Witch of Certainty, {f:5:Lambdadelta},
 and swear a certain outcome...?"
"Yes! For certain...!!"
".................................
 ......Very well.
 I was the guardian for the former you anyway.
 ......Though the current you is different,
 ......I\'ll do you one last favor.
 ......I\'ll give you a parting gift."
"And what......is that...?"
"Hope.
 .........The hope that as long as you hold on to your "certainty", your wish will definitely come true."
"........................"
"Listen.
 The old you was the Endless Witch {f:5:Beatrice}.
 ......You used to love detective novels that depicted impossible crimes,
 and you used those to make the claim that a witch existed, to make many people believe in magic...
as one stage on your path to becoming a witch."
"......Detective......novels..."
"Yep.
 The old you was an avid reader.
 ......A lover of detective novels and locked‐room murders......and a super expert on impossible crimes.
 After devouring book after book and reading through countless locked‐room tricks,
 ......you hit upon the ultimate, single, origin trick, and you used it to form the core of your system of magic."
"......Battler told you, right?
 ......He told you that the old you would definitely have thought of a way out of this predicament.
 .........I\'ll acknowledge that.
 I guarantee it by the name of the Witch of Certainty, {f:5:Lambdadelta}.
 ......The old you would definitely have solved this locked room trick......!"
"........................!"
"......That\'s my parting gift to you.
 ............Goodbye.
 You\'ve sworn certainty to the Witch of Certainty.
 So I won\'t say farewell.
 .........‘I\'ll see you again soon’."
"Y‐......yes.
 .........We\'ll see you again...soon......!"
{f:5:Lambdadelta} vanished into thin air......
And left behind in the witch\'s tea room...
 ...were the two who had held the title of Endless Witch.
One had empty eyes.
 The other supported the first by his side.
......Ironically, ......it was the exact opposite...
...of how their relationship had been in the previous game......
"Aah, Zepar!!
 What\'s this ‘important announcement’?!"
"Listen, Furfur!
 Our
 image song is getting released on CD!"
"""Whaaaaaaaaaaat?!"""
""Just kidding~!
 Ahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha.""
"We were just so bored of showing up the same way every time...!"
"We thought we\'d change our style a bit!"
"We\'re entertainers!
 And the stage is alive!"
"You\'ve got to ad lib every now and then...!"
"Y‐......yeah, we could\'ve done without that, you jackasses..."
"......Thanks for helping remove the tension, you two.
 Sorry, but we\'re still talking about what to do in the second trial.
 We\'d like a little more time.
 And if possible, some quiet."
"Sorry, George‐kun.
 Actually, we have a truly important announcement regarding the second trial."
"It is good news for some!
 And perhaps bad news for others?"
"Those for whom it is bad news...
have probably already figured it out!"
""If you don\'t know what we\'re talking about, then it\'s good news for you!!""
"............{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama...?"
".........It\'s nothing."
"........................"
Five people were there.
 Only Battler was missing.
{n}And Beato\'s expression was dark, her head hanging low.
Everyone realized that something must have happened to Battler...
"We\'d like to announce...
that Battler‐kun has retired before the second trial."
Everyone murmured.
 ......Just what had happened......?
"The witch\'s game will wait forever for him,
 but a pair of lovers cannot wait forever."
"Love is like ice cream!
 It\'s sweet and creamy, but if you don\'t eat it quickly, you\'ll lose it.
 Our game isn\'t so gracious that it\'ll wait for him to return."
"......So that\'s what you meant by good news."
"Heh.
 ......Well, I\'m glad that our rivals have gone down in number,
 but if you thought I\'d applaud another person\'s misfortune, you\'re totally wrong..."
"Battler‐kun, the one we thought of as our greatest enemy...
 .........I won\'t ask why.
 If the demons in charge say so, then that\'s how it is."
".........Then...what will happen to {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama...?"
"..................It seems I will lose the right to take this trial."
"After all, this is a trial to test the bonds between lovers!"
"Battler‐kun isn\'t currently capable of doing that.
 So, his pair is disqualified!
 How truly saddening...!"
"However, she is one of the participants in this three‐way trial of love.
 So, I think we should let her watch the trial as an observer!"
"A splendid idea!
 She does have the right to bless the pair that does overcome the trial!"
"......Are you okay with that?"
"Yes......
 I want to watch until the end.
 ......And,
 .........I still believe he will come back quickly, regain his eligibility,
 and continue this trial with me once again."
".........If you ask me,
 she has the right to be an observer."
"No objections here."
"......There\'s no need for us to be cruel."
"That may be, but as bad as it sounds, ......the loss of a powerful rival is our gain.
 ......Sorry to do this to you and Battler‐kun, but I\'d like to settle this trial right away."
"Ah, that\'s George‐kun for you!
 I\'m rooting for you the most on the inside!"
"The coldness with which he furnishes that love...
makes its heat stand out all the more...!"
"At any rate,
 ......we\'ve now gone from three down to two, and the three‐way deadlock has been resolved.
 ......We weren\'t able to fight proactively because we were afraid of a one against two situation."
".........Now that it\'s one against one,
 ......it\'s just a good, clean duel."
"..........................."
"So in the end,
 ......we find that we should have just done this from the beginning..."
The four people stood up as though responding to some invisible summons...and faced each other, glaring...
Only Beato was off to the side,
 ......watching the course of the young lovers\' fight in suspense.
......Each pair of lovers...
has an unbreakably strong bond.
Then, ......isn\'t that enough?
Their love is already the real thing.
 There\'s no need to test it.
But if so, ......then why must they fight...?
The victorious couple will be bound together by the magical miracle, ......and the defeated couple will fall apart.
Why have the demons promised us that we will fall apart without a magical miracle...?
.........Why is a demon\'s game like this necessary?
 ......I don\'t understand.
No, they aren\'t important right now...
I have to think of an escape trick as soon as possible,
 ......so that I can save Battler‐san from that locked room......
"............I heard about Battler.
 It seems things have gotten quite troublesome."
"Onee‐sama......"
"I would like to save you, as you are both my dear sister and a part of my full self.
 ......I am tackling Battler\'s locked room in my own way, .........but it is difficult.
 It feels almost as though an ordinary chain has been made to look like a wire puzzle..."
"I heard from {f:5:Lambdadelta}‐san.
 ......She said that the old {f:5:Beatrice} could definitely solve this trick.
 ......Don\'t you have any idea?"
"That old {f:5:Beatrice} is our completed form after we become one.
 ......Even I am naught but a part of her.
 It stands to reason that I cannot solve it..."
By this,
 ......she meant that we wouldn\'t be able to figure it out no matter how much thought we put into it in our incomplete forms.
She was saying that neither the elder {i:nor} the younger sister...
...could ever be expected to solve this riddle......
Beato shook her head, chasing that thought from her mind.
"I won\'t give up...
 .........I\'ll set right to work on that locked room...!
 Unless I can save Battler‐san as soon as possible, .........his heart will be crushed."
"............Of course, I have no reservations about lending my own wisdom.
 ......However, even I cannot make anything out of this locked room..."
"If we put our heads together, I\'m sure we\'ll find the same answer that we would if we were joined.
 ......Please lend me your wisdom and don\'t give up...!!"
".........I still cannot fathom why you are willing to go so for Battler,
 ......but I shall do as you ask.
 After all, it is a request made by myself.
 I will add my wisdom to yours......"
"Look, Furfur.
 The two Beatos are thinking together."
".........I wonder if those two can really save Battler."
"Oh, they can!
 If they have the miracle of love, that is...!!"
"That\'s right, Zepar!
 They can certainly do it if they have the miracle of love on their side!"
"......Say, Furfur.
 Do you think they\'ll realize that we\'re giving them a hint for solving that locked room......?"
"......................................."
The two Beatos put their heads together,
 ......and, straining their minds with all they had,
 ......they searched for a plan to save Battler with.
It was as though they couldn\'t even see the four people glaring at each other and solemnly discussing the manner of the duel......
"............They\'ll realize.
 If they have love, they certainly will."
They were the demons of love.
{n}Love is the single element.
 The source of all miracles.
......Could the miracle of love...provide an answer for a locked‐room trick......?
"There it is again. "Without love, it cannot be {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen}".
 ......I understand how that catchphrase can describe a certain concept.
 But locked‐room tricks are pure, unfeeling mathematical puzzles, without a fragment of affection within them.
 .........Just what kind of hint could these demons be talking about...?"
"......I already have a certain answer.
 ......What these demons have said supports that even further..."
"Yeah, okay, you\'re incredible.
 You always know the right answer.
 And you\'ll never let me hear any of it.
 ......Going by the rule of observers, until you tell me about it,
 it\'s possible that you\'re just lying and pretending that you know."
"Pft, .........hha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha.
 ......Yes, I believe I do prefer a bad‐mouthed miko.
 You please me, child of man.
 To me, a miko\'s sarcasm and abuse is like a ceremonial dance in my honor......"
"You\'re a real irritating master.
 .........Stupid Onii‐chan,
 ...why did you make a locked room like that......yourself......"
"Think, child of man.
 ......Thinking is not only a job for the characters within the tale.
 ......As a Reader, you too have the right to enjoy thinking.
 ......And I enjoy watching you as you do."
"......I\'m willing to make a bet.
 Your last miko ran out of patience and ran away from you, didn\'t she?"
"You are free to enjoy yourself by scolding me.
 You are also free to consider the problem like the two Beatos.
 ......Unless you think, the tale will not continue."
"Why?
 I\'m a Reader, right?
 Can\'t I just stay quiet and read?"
".........No.
 ......I want you to think.
 Not just the characters—{i:you}, the reader."
".........!
 I see, ......you\'re a pretty unpleasant author, aren\'t you?"
Ange was, of course, still only halfway through the tale.
 ......However, there were only a few pages left in the manuscript she was reading from.
Where was the manuscript for the rest of the tale?
 It should continue much further than this.
There should be many more pages remaining......
Those were inside a different brown envelope, ......which was in Hachijo\'s hand.
With a grin on her face, Hachijo waved the thick brown envelope about.
 ......“If you want to read more, do what I tell you”.
"<Cool>......!
 Looks like she got you, missy!
 Haha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha, ah{0}hah{0}hah{0}hah{0}hah{0}hah{0}ha...!"
Letting you read only so far for free......and then stopping when it finally gets to the good part.
 Amakusa couldn\'t stop laughing at this underhanded approach.
"I want to hear your own opinions.
 ......Your own theories.
 ......If you tell me those now, ......I\'ll hand over the rest of the manuscript."
"Quit mocking me.
 You think I\'ll just do whatever you say after something like this...?"
"Come on now, missy, calm down.
 I want to read on too, so please just chill a bit."
"......About the rest of the manuscript, Hachijo.
 ......It contains the answer to the locked‐room trick......and the truths behind a bunch of mysteries, right?"
"Of course.
 .........However, I haven\'t written it in a way that will be understandable to those who fail to think or consider..."
"......One of these days, you\'re going to get stabbed by an obsessive reader of yours who\'s very upset with you."
"I understand that, which is why I don\'t go out in the open.
 Child of man."
"Anyway, this is what Hachijo\'s trying to say.
 ......First, tell me your answer.
 After that, I\'ll let you check it."
"......Correct, young man.
 .........I am not trying to be mean.
 ...I am asking because I want you to truly understand the tale\'s conclusion."
"Amakusa, ......you\'re really enjoying this, aren\'t you?
 ......Yeah, come to think of it, you always take those TV quiz shows totally seriously.
 ......It looks like you enjoy life much more than I do."
"So, ......what miraculous trick could get Battler out of the locked room?
 ......Please give it some thought yourself.
 I want to give the rest of the story especially to those—
no, {i:only} to those who have thought..."
In the witches\' cathedral,
 ......no, considering everything that\'s gone on in here, maybe it should be called a demon\'s abode...
...Erika, who wanted to savor the memory of her perfect victory,
 ......stood with the whole vast cathedral to herself as the flush slowly left her cheeks.
Then,
 ......on the balcony that she had thought empty, ...a shadow came into view.
It was...{f:5:Lambdadelta}...
"......Oh, it\'s you, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}.
 It\'s not often one finds you alone in a place like this."
".........Oh, you.
 ......Congratulations on your big victory.
 .........Heheh, that\'s funny.
 I think I remember saying the same thing to you right here at the end of last game."
She was probably trying to be sarcastic.
 ......However, Erika was in such a good mood that even those words sounded like a compliment.
"I.....happened to hear what you said a short while back."
"......What?"
"I heard that you have also...
......had the experience of being toyed with as a piece on some Great Witch\'s game board,
 then sealed away in some awful hell..."
Erika had an unpleasant, triumphant look on her face,
 as though she had managed to pry into some embarrassing memory of another\'s past.
However, {f:5:Lambdadelta} didn\'t look in the least bit flustered,
 ......and instead looked down from the balcony in silence.
".........Yep.
 ......I wonder how many years I was shut up in there.
 ......Maybe I should\'ve been like Bern and counted them...
 .........No, it\'s probably best that I didn\'t.
 Counting the years.........is what broke her."
"Are you saying...
......that my master also fell into the hell of a logic error at some point...?"
"She did.
 Though she wasn\'t the one responsible for that logic error."
"......Because she wasn\'t the Game Master...?"
"That\'s right.
 ......At that time, she was still a small piece that wasn\'t even self‐aware yet.
 It was her master, the Game Master, who committed the logic error."
"......My master was also...
...a witch\'s piece?"
"Yep.
 .........That kid\'s master......oh, yes, she was a bad one.
 ......Though she created the game herself, partway through, she lost sight of what her goal was.
 ......She created something like a broken game of backgammon,
 where the start and the goal were connected like a donut."
"What do you mean, she lost her goal......?"
"I\'m talking about a logic error.
 ......She couldn\'t describe how to reach her desired goal,
 couldn\'t draw up the logic to her backgammon game.
 So, the game remained broken, with no goal at all."
"......She should have settled down and thought of an answer herself.
 ......But instead, she despicably left even the thinking entirely to her piece, Bern.
 .........Have you heard of the infinite monkey theorem?"
"......It\'s the theory that if a monkey hits random letters on a typewriter for an infinite amount of time,
 at some point, the string of letters might end up exactly the same as Hamlet by sheer coincidence.
 ......I\'d rather call it an absurdity than a theorem."
".........Wouldn\'t that be a horrible hell?
 .........Bern was forced to type randomly on that typewriter for an eternal period of time, without even knowing the meaning of what she was doing.
 .........The goal eluded even the Game Master herself,
 so she tried to get Bern to create it for her."
......Could Erika even imagine...
...how horrible a hell that had been?
A job that you have to do a hundred times and a job that you have to keep repeating until it succeeds with a 1/100 probability...
......may look very similar probabilistically, ......but the difference in cruelty between them is great.
When you have to do a job a hundred times, you steadily approach the end, get more efficient as you become more used to it,
 and eventually, you can finish.
However, when you have to do a job that succeeds with a 1/100 probability,
 ......the hard work of the individual doesn\'t translate to even a slight gain in efficiency.
Everything is left to luck.
......If luck isn\'t on your side, even the task of flipping a coin until you get heads...
...can last more than a hundred years......
"How many keys are there on a typewriter?
 About a hundred, maybe?
 ......What do you think the odds are of hitting those at random and getting Hamlet...?"
".........I can\'t......even imagine.
 ......They must be......truly astronomical."
"That\'s right.
 ......A virtually infinite amount of time.
 .........For that mind‐bending stretch of time,
 ......that child was made to keep pounding on that typewriter until she typed out a "miracle"."
"And that\'s why......she\'s the Witch of Miracles...?"
"If she wasn\'t a witch—no, if she hadn\'t been able to become a witch,
 ......she would probably still be a black cat strapped to that typewriter for eternity.
 ......That child was blessed by a miracle, ......succeeded in typing out a "miracle",
 ...became a witch, and returned from that hell alive."
"That hell was so long and harsh......that her mind and heart were completely broken.
 That\'s why she became such a mean and heartless witch.
 .........Given the choice, even you wouldn\'t have chosen a master like her, right?"
"Th‐that\'s not true...!
 I am honored to be my master\'s piece.
 My master is strong, an oppressor of {i:others}.
 Trampling over the weak is her natural right."
".........You mean she\'s a human on the bully\'s side of life...?
 Heheh.
 ......Do you know how to create the greatest bully ever?"
"......?
 No."
"It\'s easy.
 For just a short time, bully them horribly, ...then suddenly stop, and give them power instead.
 ......If you do that, then no matter who it is, they will be reborn as a {nobr:grade‐A} bully.
 And what\'s even more incredible is, even if that person was only bullied for about three days, they\'ll reign as a {nobr:grade‐A} bully for a billion times longer than that,
 believing themselves the victim all the while."
"............What does that have to do with my master?"
"......You don\'t understand anything about Bern.
 .........No matter what kind of ruthless, cruel, horrible pukespittle Bern may be,
 ......I want to be the one person who knows what she\'s truly like."
".........And it\'s the same for me.
 ...I think that kid, as a fellow survivor from hell, .........is the only one who can understand what I\'m truly like.
 .........It sounds like you\'re jealous of the relationship we have, but give it up.
 The hell you think you\'ve trudged through is nothing more than a blink compared to the one we crawled out of."
"...................................."
{f:5:Lambdadelta} was probably......mocking Erika back.
And the discouraged expression on Erika\'s face clearly showed that she couldn\'t accept {f:5:Lambdadelta}\'s words.
".........If you\'ll pardon me for saying,
 ......I think it\'s the depth of the hell that\'s important, not the length of time spent there."
"Oh......?
 ......You\'re not afraid to talk back, are you? .........Witch of Truth, {f:5:Erika}."
"I don\'t know what kind of hell you were in, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}.
 ......And I\'m sure the time I spent in hell was nothing more than a flash compared to yours.
 ......However, I don\'t think the depths of my hell were any shallower than yours."
".........In celebration of your victory, I\'ll hear you out without arguing back."
"From my point of view,
 ......both the hell my master fell into, which could only be escaped by a miracle,
 ......and the hell you fell into, which presumably could only be escaped with certain willpower,
 ......were "hells made to be escapable"."
"Really......
 ......That\'s a bold thing to say."
"I am the Witch of Truth.
 ......In the depths of my hell, there was nothing more or less than the truth.
 .........When faced with the harsh reality of truth, no sort of willpower or miracle matters.
 I reached this place by overcoming that truth.
 ......I don\'t believe my power to withstand the truth is in any way inferior to yours...
or my master\'s."
"And what is this "power to withstand the truth"?"
"......Those who don\'t know cannot understand.
 Perhaps your inability to look that in the face...
is the reason you two couldn\'t become Witches of Truth...?"
"........................
 ......Heh......heh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eheh.
 ......I\'ll forgive you for those impudent words.
 Letting them pass with a slight nod is my present to you for your recent victory."
"*giggle*.
 ......Thank you very much, Great Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}{p:0:☆}"
"Oh, that\'s unusual.
 ......It\'s rare to spot you two getting along."
At some point, {f:5:Bernkastel} had appeared on the opposite balcony of the cathedral.
Erika, noticing her, cried "my master" happily and dashed over.
"Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} was telling me old stories about you.
 ......A tale of miracles fitting for my master, the Witch of Miracles...!"
"............I\'ll forgive you just this once."
"Huh?"
"Never speak of my past again."
A grimace rose to her face,
 ......blasting Erika\'s good mood away.
And so, Erika understood.
 ......{f:5:Bernkastel} was also a witch running from boredom.
 Because if it ever caught up with her, ......she would remember.
 ......Those never‐ending days of hell......
This is proof that even my master...
...still hasn\'t gotten over the pain and fear of hell.
It means that she lacks the power to withstand the truth.
.........For the first time,
 ......Erika felt just a little disdain for her master.
"......My apologies.
 ......More importantly, what brings you to a place like this?"
".........I was looking for you. I wanted to give you a reward."
"A reward!
 ......Really?!
 Th‐thank you very much, my master!!"
"Ooh?
 ......Wow, I\'m jealous!
 What are you gonna give her?"
"First, I acknowledge your ascension as a true witch, not just a temporary one.
 .........I\'ll be your guardian.
 Witch of Truth, Furudo {f:5:Erika}."
"Th‐thank you very much!!"
"All you did was remove the temporary bit.
 That sort of reward can\'t be very pleasing.
 She really deserves something better, don\'t you thi~nk?"
"N‐no, that\'s not true, I\'m very pleased."
Of course, on the inside, Erika did want another present.
 ......Taking a cue from {f:5:Lambdadelta}, she waited patiently to see if there would be any other rewards.
"I do have one other."
{f:5:Bernkastel} snapped her fingers.
......As she did, a cloud of gold butterflies gathered,
 ......and summoned Battler sitting in a throne at the center of the cathedral.
Of course, his eyes were blank.
 ......He was still an invalid, his heart trapped in the locked room that he would never be allowed to escape from...
"That man is your reward."
"......My reward......is Battler......?"
"Ooh...
 ......I see.
 ......She\'s saying she\'ll make it so that you inherit all of this game board\'s territory."
"That\'s right.
 ......Look at Battler\'s finger.
 ......He\'s wearing the ring of the One‐winged Eagle, symbol of the territory lord.
 If that becomes yours, you\'ll become the official lord of this territory.
 ......I don\'t mean you\'ll be under my charge.
 ......In name and reality, this territory will be yours."
"So I need to take that ring off Battler\'s finger...?"
"......*giggle*.
 Don\'t be silly.
 ......There\'s only one ceremony where a woman gets a ring from a man\'s finger, right?"
"Erika.
 ......Take Battler as your husband and become the wife of the territory lord."
"M‐......marry......Battler......?!"
"Yes, that\'s right.
 ......If the territory lord is never to wake again, he\'ll need a partner to serve by his side and act as his proxy.
 ......In other words, you will control this territory."
"And we\'ll hold a wedding where you\'ll exchange rings.
 ......Battler\'s territory lord ring will become yours..."
"And in exchange, you will put a ring of servitude on Battler\'s finger.
 ......For eternity you will rule him, debase him,
 ...and use this territory and game board to weave whatever tale your heart desires."
"Furudo {f:5:Erika}, you will be the territory lord.
 ......Any tale you wish will come true.
 ......The territory lord is a god.
 ...Congrats, you\'ll be the god of this small but wonderful world."
"......Ha......ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha...ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha...
 Is that......true, ...my......master......?!!
 Will I......become this world\'s......god......?"
"That is the final reward I will give to you.
 Take Battler\'s ring and create your own world.
 ......When that happens, you won\'t be my piece anymore.
 You\'ll be your own witch, and a splendid one at that."
".........Congratulations, Lady {f:5:Erika}.
 And, one day, you must welcome me when I come to visit, just like Beato once did."
"Y‐yes, my master...!!
 There could be no greater honor...!
 And I\'m starting to like this marriage to Battler thing!
 ......*giggle*, if you think about it, there could be no greater disgrace to this game!"
"After all, that {f:5:Beatrice} was apparently born out of a desire to serve Battler and be liked by him.
 In the world that witch created, ......I will marry, defile, and humiliate Battler!!
 *giggle*giggle*, *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!
 Oh yes, I understand.
 I sooo understand how painful it feels to have the one you love stolen away from you!!
 And now, I\'m finally the one dealing out the pain...!!
 Truly, there could be no greater honor!!"
"I\'m glad you like it.
 I knew it was the one present you\'d like most in the world."
"Thank you so much, thank you so much!!
 My......masterr{-}r{-}r{-}r{-}r{-}r{-}r{-}r{-}rr...!!!"
Erika leapt down from the balcony and walked briskly towards Battler.
Then, she peered down at the reward she had been given...
".........Now isn\'t that a wonderful finale.
 You\'ll hold a wedding ceremony?"
"Of course.
 A magnificent one.
 It\'s the perfect way to end Beato\'s game."
"Of course, you\'ll send Beato an invitation too, right?"
"I only hope she actually comes."
""*giggle*giggle*, ehheh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eheh!!""
"......Alright, things are going to get busy.
 We have to prepare for the ceremony, make programs, send invitations..."
"Don\'t forget the wedding dress and a cake!!
 And you need to get things ready for the reception!"
The two witches disappeared, cackling.
{n}Only the two who were to be wed remained in the cathedral.
".........Could you hear...?
 ......Battler‐san.
 .........Do you realize......what\'s about to happen to you......?"
"...........................
 .........Damn......it......"
Battler\'s consciousness wasn\'t completely gone.
 ......It was very distant......but he was slightly tethered to reality.
......And that......was what made it cruel.
It was as cruel as though the spider called Erika had wrapped Battler up...
...and was eating him while he was still conscious.
In fact, she might have been more like certain kinds of wasp,
 paralyzing her prey and keeping it alive so that she could eat it later.
In short,
 her cruelty was very similar to that of a predator......
"You won\'t be able to get out of that locked room.
 After all, you used all that red truth to show that it was a locked room.
 So stop worrying, and just let yourself be trapped in there forever."
"......While you\'re spending time in there,
 ......I\'ll take my time defiling your body.
 .........I\'ll have our bedroom lined with mirrors.
 ......That way, you can see just how you\'re being humiliated,
 ......with your own eyes.
 ............
*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!"
"And then, let\'s have a bird cage hanging from the ceiling.
 We can stick your beloved witch {f:5:Beatrice} in there.
 What do you think......?
 ......Wonderful, isn\'t it......?
 Eheh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}ehe{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eheh!!
 Aah, ......I can feel it.
 This is how sweet it is to be standing on the other side...
 ...Aha, aha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha......"
As he listened to this mad laugh, ......Battler couldn\'t even bring a distressed expression to his face.
His heart was still trapped in the locked room he had created...
{n}And his body and soul......would soon be trapped within a new locked room of Erika\'s.
A locked room...
......called marriage.
"Hey, did you hear, Furfur...?!"
"I sure did, Zepar...!
 Lord {f:5:Battler} and Lady {f:5:Erika} are having a wedding!"
They said it with so much of their usual frivolity...
that Beato had to ask them to repeat it again.
"Wh‐......what......is happening......?"
"As you know, the lord of this territory has had his heart sealed away and cannot speak."
"So the beautiful Lady {f:5:Erika} is going to become his wife and support him in his work!"
The two demons explained the situation in a very simple,
 yet dramatic way.
......I know what\'s going on.
They\'re planning to take advantage of the fact that Battler\'s heart is sealed away and use marriage to lock up his body as well,
 so that they can steal everything from him...
At this rate, ......Battler will have his position as Game Master...
...and his territory lord\'s ring......stolen away...
"That damn homewrecker, she thinks she can do whatever she wants...!!
 Let\'s steal him back!
 He may be of little importance to me, but matters that affect you are my business also!"
"It\'s no use to just steal his body back!
 After all, the great Lady {f:5:Bernkastel} has already signed the marriage certificate as a witness!"
"With a Great Witch of the Senate serving as a witness, no one can dispel the union except for those who are a part of it...!"
"......Then it\'s as I thought...... Unless I can rescue Battler‐san\'s heart from that locked room,
 ......there\'s no way we can save him......"
"Then find a way to rescue him from that locked room!"
"You\'re going to steal away the bridegroom?!
 Ah!! How wonderful!!"
"......If you can do that, it would make for a tale beautiful enough for the opera.
 However, this locked room sealing Battler is quite difficult..."
"The only way out is the door.
 And if the chain is unset, his escape won\'t be accepted..."
"And on top of that, the chain can\'t be set from the outside!"
"And now there\'s no one left to switch places with him!"
"......No matter how you think about it, we\'re stuck!"
"If we give up, ......we won\'t be able to save him.
 ...The only thing we can do to save him now......is to keep at it and keep thinking."
Though Beato looked as though she was about to burst into tears, ......she clenched her fists tightly.
She was so frustrated with her inability to think up any brilliant plan...that her heart felt as though it would burst...
"......Zepar and Furfur, you two are known as being among the most powerful of demons.
 They say your magic can make the impossible possible.
 ......Could you not use your power and knowledge to work out a plan for crushing this impossible locked room...?!"
"Yes, love can accomplish any impossible thing!"
"If you can\'t accomplish something, it means you lack enough love!"
"..................Hearing that...
...hurts..."
"But we are moved by the strength of will that prevents you from giving up!"
"Because you have that, we\'re sure you can bring about a miracle!"
"......Can\'t you at least give us a hint about that miracle?!
 We have known each other for no short span of time.
 ......Will you not at least give my little sister a hint as a parting gift?"
""A hint?
 We are always giving out hints.""
"Without love—"
"They cannot be {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen}!"
"......If we could {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} them, I would not have asked!
 ......These two are always like this.
 It staves off boredom, but they can become very irritating at times like this."
Zepar and Furfur certainly were demons who possessed a great power.
{n}The power of love that they bestowed had created several miracles in the past, miracles so great that they left a mark on human history.
However, those miracles were never given easily.
They would give trials, tell riddles, ......and sometimes help the truth be realized,
 ......so that those who desired power could create that power themselves.
No matter how pitiful the eyes that looked up at them, the two demons would never lend their power out of pity.
As it is with God, it is with demons:
 ......they help those who help themselves.
"I understand.
 ......I\'ll think about it myself...
 ......I swear......I will free him......"
"Look upon her, demons! When last did you see a girl so pure of heart...?!
 As the demons of love, don\'t your hearts ache even a little?!
 Come, let\'s have a hint...!
 Surely you could give us a hint to a hint, at least?"
Zepar and Furfur looked at each other.
......Of course, there was no pity on their faces.
 However, it could be seen that, though they did find the problem amusing, they were considering what they should do next.
"What\'ll we do, Furfur?!"
"Maybe a hint to a hint would be okay?!"
"Yes, even that would be welcome, so let\'s have it!"
""Oookay!
 Here\'s a present from Zepar and Furfur!
 A hint to a hint of love!!""
"P‐please...!!"
"You cannot {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} the answer—"
"Because you don\'t have enough love!"
"I—I told you, not a hint like that!"
"And if you don\'t have enough love...?!"
"Why not observe couples who have it in abundance?!"
"Yes, and as luck would have it,
 we have two loving couples right here!"
"Why not stay awhile and be a spectator to their fight for love?!"
""You should watch our trial from the position of an outside observer!!""
"Will you listen?!!
 Not a hint like that, I said!"
Beato the Elder yelled at them, asking for a more tangible hint.
However, Zepar and Furfur just giggled...
...and ran about like rats.
......Beato, on the other hand,
 ......took their hint to a hint...
...seriously.
Now that she was out of the running,
 ......the second trial was between George and Shannon...and Jessica and Kanon.
― Tear apart the two who are close.
In other words, defeat one of the members of the opposing team.
They were allowed to use any method they wanted.
 It could be a duel, or it could be rock‐paper‐scissors.
......After alternating many times between speaking as a group and discussing things as couples,
 ......finally, the four of them seemed to have reached a decision.
".........Zepar, Furfur.
 Do you have a second?"
"Oh, they\'ve finally called out to us!!"
"What is it, George?!
 Have you decided the format for the duel?!"
No matter how much the two demons baited them with their facetious tone,
 the couples\' serious expressions did not waver...
"......Yes.
 We\'ve decided to have it...as a single duel."
"It will be a duel between Shannon and me."
"That\'s surprising.
 For a one on one duel, we would have thought—"
"That George and Jessica would\'ve fought."
"......These guys...
really wanted it to be them, and they wouldn\'t listen."
"As a man, I find it frustrating that all I can do is watch.
 ......However, Shannon\'s resolve is firm.
 So I—we—have no choice but to respect their decision and believe in them..."
".........Kanon‐kun..."
"Thank you so much......for believing in me.
 I\'ve always thought that, if the day ever came when we had to fight each other directly,
 ......then we shouldn\'t shy away from it."
"And we\'ve realized that...that day is today.
 ......Of course, we might have been able to avoid this day."
"However,
 ......now this day has come.
 So, we will not run from it."
"......That\'s right.
 ......I\'ll stay right here too."
"Me too.
 .........I believe in Shannon.
 So, I won\'t say anything more.
 ......And, even if Shannon is the one fighting in the duel,
 ...our power is one.
 So, we\'ll be fighting together."
".........Yes, that\'s right.
 ......I\'m just speaking for the pair of us."
"If it is a decision made by those in love—"
"Even demons will not object."
"So, ......how would you like to settle this duel?"
"You don\'t mean...
that you want to have a real "duel", do you?"
At once, both Shannon and Kanon nodded.
"......And the method?"
"That doesn\'t matter, as long as it is a fight to the death."
"If possible, ......we would like it to be peaceful and painless.
 And we would like to avoid wounding each other unnecessarily before one of us dies."
".........Zepar.
 We should be the ones to oversee this noble duel."
"True.
 ......Very well, you two.
 We propose a noble duel, one that will honor your noble spirits!"
When Zepar clapped loudly, a case with an old design appeared in the air and landed between Shannon and Kanon.
Furfur nodded at them, urging them to open it.
Kanon crouched down and opened the case.
......There were a pair of antiques inside.
 They would have looked splendid hanging on the wall at some classy coffee shop.
However, they were not mere decorations now.
"............Th‐these are......"
"I see.
 ......Just perfect for a duel..."
Inside the case......was a pair of old‐fashioned dueling pistols,
 like the kind used many centuries ago.
Yes, this was a dueling pistol case,
 ......which was only permitted to be opened by those who wished for a fight to the death.
"They have one bullet each.
 In accordance with your request, we have imbued the bullets with magic."
"No matter where on your body they hit you,
 these magic bullets will bring certain and painless death."
"......Thank you very much.
 You are...most merciful."
"And what if we both miss?"
"Normally, that would be a draw.
 ......However, such a thing is not allowed in our trial."
"If you both miss, you will come back, and we will give you new bullets.
 This will repeat until one of you is dead."
"......I have no objections."
"Me neither.
 ......I\'m glad.
 This means we can finally—"
""Settle this.""
"Ushiromiya George, I recognize you as the witness for Shannon—nay, Sayo."
"......Understood."
"Ushiromiya Jessica, I recognize you as the witness for Kanon—nay, Yoshiya."
"S‐......sure...!"
""We are responsible for this duel!
 It is our responsibility to see that this duel reaches a decision no matter what!!""
When Zepar and Furfur cried these words out,
 ......the whole area was blanketed in a gold‐colored light, ......and when it cleared,
 ......it had become the rose garden where golden roses bloomed......
"A duel over love, is it......
 How old‐fashioned they are.
 ......I have seen many duels with pistols during my thousand years, ......but I have never seen one like this."
"......Because it\'s being overseen by demons...?"
"No.
 ......A duel over love is usually a fight between two people both in love with the same single person.
 However, here we have a pair of lovers fighting another pair of lovers.
 ......This is quite odd."
"I\'m sure......that\'s because they want the miracle of magic.
 ......It seems we cannot succeed in love without that miracle..."
"........................
 ......Do you know the minimum number of people needed to create a universe?"
"......Huh?
 N‐no, ......I don\'t..."
Shannon and Kanon each took a pistol out of the case,
 returned to their respective witnesses, and checked the weapons over.
Then, after they had both determined that there were no problems,
 ......the two were asked one final time whether they were prepared to duel,
 ......and both of them nodded.
"If there are no problems, the duelists shall stand back to back,
 ......then walk a predetermined number of steps away from each other."
"Then, the duel will begin on our signal.
 ......Zepar, how many steps should they walk?"
"...............Good question.
 ......Well, ......maybe we should choose a number that is closely bound to this duel."
"A number closely bound......?
 What number is that?"
"It\'s a number we know of well.
 ......It is that number which has been repeated over and over again since the time this tale began...!!"
""That number is "19"!""
"...............That\'s an interesting number........."
"......I like it.
 ......It\'s a good number to settle everything with."
19.
It was the number used to refer to the witch each time the illusion of a 19th person had been seen on this supposedly 18‐person island.
It was the length of time it had taken to create this tale.
It was the length of time leading up to this inevitable day.
And it was...
...the age of the true territory lord of this world.
"They\'ll stand across from each other, then walk 19 steps...
...and shoot."
"......That\'s pretty far.
 ......At that distance, the first one to shoot won\'t necessarily be the winner."
"......If one of us shoots first and misses,
 ......that will probably be the end for them."
"And if it hits, this easy game can be won without even getting a scratch..."
""Well then, duelers!
 Stand with your backs together!!""
Shannon and Kanon slowly walked towards each other, facing each other.
Once they turned away,
 ......the next time they would see the other\'s face would be the time that they killed them.
 ......So, this was the last time they would face each other.
"Thanks for everything.
 .........Having a little brother like you made things fun."
"......Thank you for letting me be me.
 ......Thank you for showing me the color in the world of gray."
"Why......were we born, I wonder..."
"It would have been better if we had died at birth."
"......That is our father\'s sin, isn\'t it..."
"Yeah.
 So he can just die. Let them all die."
"Yeah. Everyone will die.
 It\'ll happen very soon.
 ......And right after, everyone will revive, and we\'ll be able to see them again.
 We won\'t be birds in a cage anymore."
"......We will finally leave our cage......and fly off to our separate worlds."
"I should have had this duel with you......long ago."
"......Surely, today is the day."
"Yeah.
 It\'s today."
"October 5th, 1986.
 ......The fated day."
"The day that one of us will die."
"......Or maybe we\'ll both shoot at the same time, and both die."
"Oh, that might happen too.
 .........In fact, that\'s not so unlikely at all."
"Right.
 Even if that happens, our loves will surely be made complete."
".........Do we really......need to duel?"
"We do.
 You said it yourself.
 ......We should have done this much sooner."
"Right.
 ......Because...to me, you are—"
"To me, you are—"
{a:c:
""Just in the way.""}
For the first time, ......the intent to kill flashed through the eyes of both.
Why...?
 For what reason......?
Why must this day come for this pair,
 ......who are connected by a bond different from romantic love, as though they were real siblings...?
It\'s a great mystery.
And, also a great mystery is the question of how this can be the key...
...towards unlocking Battler‐san\'s locked room.
......If I watch over this duel instead of running away,
 ......will I find the key towards solving that locked room...?
I will, right?
 Zepar‐san, Furfur‐san......!
The cathedral was beautifully decorated to be the place of the wedding between the territory lord, Lord {f:5:Battler}, and his wife‐to‐be, Lady {f:5:Erika}...
A crowd of guests wearing goat masks filled the cathedral, waiting for the arrival of the bride and groom...
Fitting for a demon\'s wedding, it was not solemn or quiet,
 ......but cheery and noisy, brimming with activity.
"......I wonder what Beato is doing."
"I hear she has gone to see Zepar and Furfur.
 ......With the power of love, that powerful pair could even force the demon king to retreat.
 ......They are bound to be of some use, or at least I would like to think so..."
"......I know a~ll about those two.
 ......I think you know as well as I that they won\'t hand over their power easily."
"True.
 ......However, ......that is why they are capable of granting a miraculous power."
".........At any rate, if we can just free Battler‐kun\'s heart from that locked room, we should be able to manage something here.
 ......Locked rooms are your favorite, aren\'t they, Gaap?
 Can\'t you think of any tricks...?!"
"This is a nasty one.
 Battler and Erika have locked it up tight with all kinds of red truths.
 ......I can say for certain that a solo escape from the inside is impossible."
"So, after all, the only way is to have someone else trade places with him and set the chain..."
"......If that "someone" does appear, it should be easy to save Battler.
 There are eleven people, right?"
"Those eleven are sealed on the second floor of the guesthouse...
 If we could somehow slip them out of there...!"
"......I see.
 ......Solving the problem of Battler‐sama\'s locked room is equivalent to solving the problem of either locked room on the guesthouse\'s second floor."
"Exactly.
 Limiting your thoughts to just Battler\'s guest room is like being trapped in a mental locked room.
 ......The locked room we need to break open to save Battler isn\'t the guest room.
 It\'s the locked rooms in the guesthouse...!"
".........Most unfortunately,
 we of Eiserne Jungfrau have been placed in charge of those two {f:5:rooms}."
"Tch.
 And you guys specialize in seals and barriers..."
"I must admit, I am impressed, Miss Gaap.
 It is quite an achievement to realize that the locked room you should destroy to save Battler is within the {f:5:guesthouse}.
 ......The ceremony will probably begin soon, but shall we reconstruct the scene as a way to kill time until {f:5:then}?"
"......A‐are you sure?
 Doesn\'t this violate the obligation of confidentiality you have as Lady {f:5:Erika}\'s piece...?"
"That is no {f:5:problem}.
 ......I am sure that if you first confirm the seals around the scene and fall into despair,
 ......we will all be able to celebrate this ceremony more {f:5:sincerely}."
"How confident......
 ......I\'ll take that challenge.
 ...Lia, let\'s have ourselves a little snack before the ceremony."
"With that, dear ladies of Eiserne,
 we humbly ask that you reconstruct the scene for us."
""For your attention: we hear and obey.""
"......This is......the cousins\' room."
"The next room over has the exact same {f:5:layout}.
 Please investigate as thoroughly as you {f:5:like}."
"This room has......Genji, Gohda, Kanon...
plus Krauss, Rudolf, and Jessica, for a total of six people."
"The next room over has Hideyoshi, George, Shannon, Kumasawa, and Nanjo, for a total of five {f:5:people}."
"Come on, everyone, don\'t be stupid.
 It doesn\'t matter who\'s here.
 We need to find out how to escape from this room."
"Y‐you\'re right.
 ......The door and windows are sealed, so we must somehow escape from some other place......"
".........You know what?
 ...I know all about how you heaven people specialize in pressing ahead to hide inconvenient facts.
 ......It\'s not a locked room, is it?
 This room......"
"......For your attention: I beg to inform you of the following.
 The locked rooms in our charge are perfect...!"
"You were in charge of the window seal of Kinzo\'s room last game, right...?
 ......Just how did Battler get Kinzo out of that room again...?"
"..........................."
"......Cornelia was not at {f:5:fault}.
 The blame rests on me as her {f:5:superior}."
"This is exactly the same as Kinzo\'s study.
 It\'s the windows.
 This locked room can be broken by the windows.
 ......It\'s clear as day how you people operate."
"H‐how...?!
 Lady {f:5:Erika} sealed the entire room, right...?
 That means the entire room is sealed, including the windows...!"
"......I see.
 ......It would seem that we have been misinterpreting the definition of these seals.
 A locked room sealed by duct tape...
is not {i:impossible} to break out of.
 It forms no prison."
"That\'s it exactly.
 ......Yes, a seal proves that a room is a locked room.
 But it doesn\'t guarantee that the room will {i:remain} sealed.
 All it does is prove that the room is a locked room {i:as long as the duct tape isn\'t broken}."
"We are not trying to deceive you in any {f:5:way}.
 .........As long as the duct tape is intact, it is guaranteed to be a locked {f:5:room}.
 That is {f:5:all}."
"Th‐then why the windows...?!
 Why is it that we can break the locked room by the windows?!"
"It\'s simple.
 We just tear the duct tape apart and jump out.
 ......I don\'t know what the outside wall of the guesthouse is like,
 but that girl crawled up it and stuck duct tape on the outside without anyone noticing, so it must have at least enough footholds for that."
".........If you break the duct tape, we will immediately know that the seal has been {f:5:broken}.
 And we have already proven that the seals were intact at the time of Battler\'s logic {f:5:error}."
"True.
 It\'s true that, at that time, you proved that the seals weren\'t broken.
 ......That\'s how you tricked us into thinking that it was a locked room.
 ......A seal doesn\'t necessarily imply a locked room."
Gaap was the demon who specialized in putting an end to locked‐room mysteries...
......She drew herself up and looked down on the short Dlanor, as though a challenge such as this was like taking candy from a baby.
Dlanor looked up at her with a bold expression, and sparks flew between them......
"A seal doesn\'t imply a locked room?!
 That can\'t be..."
"Remember, Lia.
 Which seals did Erika and the others show us at that time?
 Which seals did they show were still intact?!"
".........Pu ku ku ku.
 ...I see.
 ......This is the sort of falsification that the Great Court of Heaven likes to practice."
"I cannot let that remark {f:5:pass}.
 ......What is your {f:5:complaint}?"
"Come on, I\'ve been saying it the whole time. It\'s the windows.
 ......It\'s true that you sealed everything with those seals.
 That included the windows, at that time.
 And you proved that at the time they were sealed.
 So far so good.
 But you know what?!"
"After that, any one of the people inside could have done it!
 Umm, who was here again?!
 Genji, Gohda, Kanon, Krauss, Rudolf, Jessica!
 Any one of them could do it!
 All they had to do was tear the duct tape on the window, slip out from there, and save Battler...!"
"But at the time of the logic error, it was proven that the seals were intact...!"
"Incorrect.
 ......At that time, Lady {f:5:Erika} only proved the status of {i:the seals on the doors}."
".........................................."
"C‐......come to think of it...!
 At that time, Lady {f:5:Erika} just showed the doors of the two rooms and claimed that the seals were intact for each...
 She never mentioned the seals on the windows...!!"
"That\'s correct.
 .........It\'s probably true that the seals on the doors and windows were perfect at first.
 ......However, at the time of the logic error, only the status of the seals on the doors was confirmed.
 In other words, since the time Erika left the guesthouse,
 it was not forbidden for them to break through the windows and leave whenever they wished!"
".............................."
"Well?
 I\'ve got you now, haven\'t I?
 This is how you people do things."
"...............heh..............."
"......Supervisor Dlanor.
 ............It\'s nearly time..."
"............It seems the bride and groom have {f:5:arrived}.
 This ends our {f:5:chat}.
 .........We will meet again {f:5:later}."
With an amused grin on her face, Dlanor turned around.
{n}......But that had to have hit her where it hurt.
Gaap had no intention of letting her get away.
 She grabbed Dlanor\'s shoulder.
"......Wait there.
 Confirm whether or not the seals on the windows were preserved at the time of the logic error.
 If you don\'t, it\'s possible for anyone in that room to save Battler!!"
"And who......do you think such a rescue would be possible {f:5:for}?"
"It doesn\'t matter who!
 Then, just by personal preference, I\'ll name Kanon‐kun.
 He seems agile, and hiding his presence is his specialty.
 He\'s the perfect person to follow after Erika and quickly change places with Battler‐kun!"
"Kanon, you {f:5:say}...?
 Hehheh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eheh......
 That is {f:5:impossible}."
"Impossible?
 Come now, we can\'t trust what you say with normal words.
 ......Use the red truth.
 Swear upon that red longsword of yours."
"......Miss Gaap.
 A sacred ceremony is about to begin {f:5:here}.
 You ask me to draw my sword in a sacred place such as {f:5:this}?
 ......I believe that would be inelegant and rude in the {f:5:extreme}.
 Let us do this some other {f:5:time}.
 ......If you would excuse {f:5:me}."
"......{p:2:It is possible for Kanon to save Battler.
 After Erika sealed the room, he left by the window, switched places with Battler‐kun in the guest room, set the chain lock, and hid in the closet}."
"......
{p:1:That is {f:5:impossible}.
 The seals on the windows were also {f:5:intact}.
 Of course, this is at the time of the logic {f:5:error}}."
Gaap\'s blue wedge and rapid reverse roundhouse......crossed with Dlanor\'s red longsword, and both pointed at the other\'s throat......
The once peaceful mood of the wedding broke apart.
......Several goat guests whispered to each other, wondering why those two seemed to be fighting.
"......Okay, ......so you can counter that......
 Why didn\'t you just say so in the first place?"
".........We thought that {f:5:Beatrice} might eventually reach that thought,
 ......then barge in on the wedding with that as the key to Battler\'s {f:5:escape}.
 .........I did not think that you would press us first......and force us to show our {f:5:hand}."
"Y‐......you do fight dirty, don\'t you...
 ......You were trying to lay a trap for Beato, ......making her suspect the windows, ......drawing her out, ......then turning the tables on her......"
"What else should a human who guards the bride be expected to {f:5:do}?
 ......Are you satisfied {f:5:now}?
 A hellish wedding truly is vulgar and {f:5:barbaric}.
 ......Now, excuse {f:5:me}."
"......Hold it right there, you haven\'t fooled me yet......
 {p:2:You were talking about the seals blocking {i:Kanon}, the ones on the windows of the cousins\' room, right?
 Then what about the windows on the next room over?
 All you\'ve done is shown that the rescue would have been impossible for Kanon.
 There\'s still a chance for the humans in the next room over}...!"
"........................How very {f:5:persistent}."
"We apologize for our rudeness!
 We are the Chiester Sisters Imperial Guards, in charge of security at this ceremony!
 I\'m afraid I must ask you both for your stamped invitations!"
"Dlanor A. Knox.
 I am with the bride\'s {f:5:party}.
 Here is my stamped {f:5:invitation}.
 Also, here are my credentials as bodyguard to the {f:5:bride}."
"Confirmed as Chief Knox.
 Welcome to Lord {f:5:Battler}\'s wedding!"
"I\'m Gaap.
 I\'m with the groom\'s party.
 Here\'s my invitation and...
...ah, oh no."
"You didn\'t get it stamped at the reception desk nyeh."
"I came here directly, so I didn\'t go by the reception desk.
 Tehe, haven\'t got a stamp yet."
"Wh‐why do you always have to mess something up at times like this...?!!"
"......Gaap‐sama.
 My apologies, but we\'ll have to ask you to come with us to a different room."
Dlanor watched, shrugged, and turned away...
"Wait there, Dlanor!!
 Respond to my blue truth!!"
"If you want the opinion of the Great Court of Heaven, please fill out an application in accordance with court {f:5:procedures}."
"For your attention:
 know that the ticket window is open from 10:00 to 5:00 on weekdays.
 Lunch break runs from 12:00 to 1:15."
"For your attention:
 be advised that the use of white‐out or strikethroughs is not permitted when filling out forms."
"There\'s a rumor that a certain event I won\'t name refuses applications for the same thing nyeh."
"Th‐that\'s an urban legend.
 .........Probably."
"I will provisionally accept that blue truth {f:5:verbally}.
 ......It will be put on hold until the proper forms are received, and multiple submissions are not {f:5:allowed}."
"I don\'t understand!!
 Can you respond to my blue truth?! Or can\'t you?!"
"......If you fill out the application on Monday, we should be able to have an answer for you by the end of next {f:5:month}.
 Multiple submissions are forbidden, so the blue truth you just spoke will be unusable during this wedding {f:5:ceremony}.
 ......This is in accordance with the official Great Court Regulations, Article {nobr:214‐15}, "Prohibition of Multiple {f:5:Submissions}"!"
"For your attention: I beg to inform you of the following.
 {p:1:Know that it is forbidden for blue truth to be used if based on the argument that the window seals of the next room over were torn at the time of the logic error}."
"For your attention: I beg to inform you of the following.
 {p:1:Be advised that there can be no obligation to provide an answer to said blue truth}...!"
"C‐cowards!!
 Hey, let go of me, rabbit band!!"
The Chiester Sisters led Gaap away...
Just when she had thought that she\'d reached the core......they had underhandedly refused to respond.
However, this was a big clue.
 There was a chance that the window seals on the next room over had been broken...!
In other words, it might be possible for Hideyoshi, George, Kumasawa, Shannon, or Nanjo to save Battler.
And yet, just now, that option had been sealed away...!
The use of any blue truth based on "the window seals on the next room over might have been broken"...
had been prevented...
It was now impossible......to claim that the five who could have saved Battler were the ones who did it...!
"Wh‐what the hell...?!
 That\'s low! Isn\'t that the answer?!
 I also noticed that they hadn\'t proven that the windows\' seals were intact.
 But if that can\'t be used for blue truth, what are they supposed to do?!
 Yeah, I know.
 You\'re gloating again because you alone have discovered the answer...!"
".........My apologies, child of man.
 ......I am stuck on this just like you are."
"Huh......? What are you saying...?"
"I also realized that the windows of the next room over were left available...
 ......However, I never imagined that the use of that argument would be prevented..."
"Doesn\'t this completely violate the rules?!
 I mean, how can a quiz be fair if you can\'t say the right answer?!
 Isn\'t this a logic error for the other side?!"
"........................
 ......We can also view the fact that the tale is continuing as proof that it wasn\'t a logic error..."
"In other words, there\'s some other answer completely unrelated to the windows of the next room over...?"
"......Or, ......it may be possible to explain, without discussing the windows, how one of the five in the next room over could have come to Battler\'s rescue."
"Not discussing the windows means getting out of the room without using the windows.
 That would make this next room over a locked room again...!"
"......Yes.
 ......That is why I am also stuck.
 ......Because of these strange seal proclamations, the two rooms have once again become locked rooms.
 ......Most likely—"
"Most likely what?
 If you\'re so vastly intelligent, what kind of answer have you found?!"
"...............There is no...answer."
"No answer?!
 What do you mean, no answer?!"
"There is no way out except for the windows of the next room over.
 ......And yet, we are not allowed to include those windows in our reasoning.
 ............There probably is no answer...for this locked room."
"Then what happens next?!"
"Since no answer exists, defeat is absolutely certain for whichever player is burdened with the responsibility of explaining."
"But then...they\'re out of moves to play...!
 In other words, that statement of Dlanor\'s was......in a way......the final blow!
 It means it\'s checkmate!!"
"........................
 ......No, one move does exist.
 ......However, that move is one.........that can never be used again.
 ......And it is also...a part of Beato\'s heart."
"You mean...one of the greatest mysteries of this tale...?"
"Precisely.
 .........If he uses that, ......there may be a chance......"
{f:5:Featherine} sighed deeply.
{n}......It was something she hadn\'t done at all before now.
.........I see.
......So it\'s finally time......for the curtain to close on this long, long tale...
Revealing that mystery...
...means finally...
......killing Beato.
.........Battler......is probably the only one qualified to do that.
If he weaves that tale as the Game Master,
 .........no one will be able to stop it now...
Very soon,
 .........the greatest mystery of this tale...
......is likely to be...
......revealed......
A deep sound reverberated through the cathedral.
It was the sound of dozens of heels being stamped in unison, originating from the honor guards—members of the Chiester Sisters Imperial Guard—who were lining the cathedral.
......It brought about total silence even before the demons running the ceremony spoke.
"Let us have silence!!
 Ladies and gentlemen...!!"
"Welcome to the wedding of Lord {f:5:Battler}, territory lord and Golden Sorcerer, and Lady {f:5:Erika}, the Witch of Truth!!"
Zepar and Furfur had appeared in the center of the cathedral.
......It was a great status symbol to have these two demons invited to host the wedding.
Though they had asked for silence, the attendees who packed the cathedral welcomed the two demons with enormous applause.
"......Oh, it\'s Zepar and Furfur.
 Then what about Beato...?"
"She may already have snuck in......"
They searched for Beato in the crowd of several hundred people,
 ......but they couldn\'t find her anywhere.
"I wonder......if Beato found a way to save Battler‐kun..."
"......If she managed to gain Zepar and Furfur\'s power, ......then I\'m sure she has.
 ......There is no miracle that cannot be gained after receiving their power."
"And if she didn\'t......?"
"......Then that goat biting its handkerchief over there is probably her.
 Pu ku ku..."
"And now, let us welcome the bride and groom...!!"
"Please give them a grand welcome to celebrate this new chapter in their lives!!"
""Come out, bride and groom!!
 Walk the path of the shackles called marriage, which will bind you until the grave!!""
The big doors in the back of the cathedral...
...slowly opened......
And then,
 .........the territory lord...
...and his beautiful bride...came into view......
Arm in arm, the pair slowly......began to walk down the "path to the grave" lined with red carpet.
The Chiester honor guards stood at attention along either side of that path,
 raised their adorned bayonets with mechanical precision,
 and made sure that no evil could block the path that the pair walked down.
Chiester Sisters troops that weren\'t part of the honor guard were stationed all over the cathedral, hiding behind pillars and so on, and keeping an eye out for any intruders.
".........00 calling 45 and 410, any irregularities?"
"Ceiling snipers, no irregularities nyeh."
410 and 45 could be seen on top of the massive chandelier hanging from the cathedral\'s ceiling.
Several other sniper pairs could be seen stationed on top of the other chandeliers...
This seemingly festive cathedral...
was actually being heavily guarded in places that the attendees wouldn\'t notice......
"Currently, we are targeting 36 attendees suspected of being Lady {f:5:Beatrice},
 as well as 131 who are located in positions suitable for a surprise attack. Surveillance in progress."
"......Don\'t let your guard down.
 ......Lady {f:5:Beatrice} is certain to stage an attack on the wedding."
"That\'d be so cool, breaking in to steal the bride nyeh."
"410, he\'s not the bride, he\'s the groom!"
"I said what I meant nyeh.
 Nihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi......"
The Chiester sniper teams on the chandeliers...
were using extremely highly capable surveillance agents to track the movements of the several hundred attendees.
If any one of them made any suspicious movements, ......the Chiesters would immediately be given permission to fire.
...The one on that chandelier is Chiester127.
{n}That overworking monster sniper could pulverize a human target from two kilometers away.
...The one on the chandelier across from that is Chiester20.
{n}Her firing rate is 6000 shots per minute.
 However, she\'s using a portable magazine this time, so she\'ll use up her shots in about two seconds.
 That lazy bum can barely do her job for just two seconds nyeh.
Slowly, ......and making a show of it, the two walked down the red‐carpeted path.
Battler\'s eyes were blank.
......If you looked closely, you could tell that Erika was dragging him by the arm she held.
In other words, they weren\'t walking together.
......This was a ceremony for Erika to show off to everyone that this man belonged to her...
Behind the bride and groom walked the Seven Sisters of Purgatory, who held long, ceremonial staffs in the shape of the One‐winged Eagle...
"That moron Battler......what\'s he lazing about for...
 This is why people call him incompetent."
"......I can understand {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama\'s pain...better than anyone else."
"It\'s all because that stupid Battler caused a logic error!
 Stupid, stupid, stupid!"
".........{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama will not fall to sloth and let this wedding go on."
"Of course.
 {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama is greedy.
 She won\'t let someone else take away her favorite toy.
 She\'ll definitely show up..."
"*slobber* I hear the reception\'s gonna have tons of delicious food...!"
"Aaah, I want to wear a wedding dress...noooooooooo~w!!"
{f:5:Bernkastel} and {f:5:Lambdadelta} were in the nobles\' seating on the balcony.
They sipped questionable‐looking carbonated cocktails as they looked down upon the show...
".........What a splendid wedding dress.
 ......This sort of thing\'s not bad."
"This is just the opening performance."
"That\'s pretty cruel.
 What event are you expecting to be the headliner?
 ......Bern, you don\'t really believe Beato will come, do you?
 You know as well as I do that Battler\'s locked room is perfect.
 ......There\'s no way that Beato could win.
 Right......?"
"...............You must have heard too.
 There\'s a chance that the window seal on the next room over has been torn.
 ......It seems that Dlanor has managed to seal that off for now, but she just denied the concept instead of sealing the actual window.
 .........It\'ll fly out the window again.
 This One‐winged Eagle."
"Wanna make a bet?"
"On whether Beato will come?"
".........I bet she comes with certainty."
"......I bet she comes miraculously."
"Ah, this isn\'t going to work.
 ......*giggle*giggle*."
The Witch of Certainty and the Witch of Miracles were both sure that Beato would come.
However, they were very interested in exactly how she would break the locked room and take Battler back...
".........You had a look behind the scenes, so you already know, don\'t you?
 The trick."
"More or less.
 ......But Erika\'s done a hell of a job, so now even I\'m stumped."
"......Liar."
"Oh...?"
"I\'m sure you\'ve found the answer already.
 .........There is one, isn\'t there? A trick that can save Battler."
"...........................
 ......There is.
 ......But it\'s tough."
"And if that move is used, ......part of Beato\'s heart will be exposed.
 ......Isn\'t that right?"
"......Oh, so you do know."
".........Hey, wanna change our bet?"
"To what?"
"To whether Beato or Erika wins."
"Sure, if you\'re willing to bet on Erika."
".........You\'re on."
"Oh? You\'re betting on Erika?
 What makes you think you can win?"
".........If this trick is a part of Beato\'s heart,
 .........then Battler, the Game Master, will hesitate to expose it.
 And so, they cannot win.
 It will probably be a draw.
 I\'m sure they\'ll confuse matters and run away."
".........Battler\'s sworn to lay Beato to rest.
 ......Bern,
 ...you\'re being too naive......"
The bet was made.
Based on the assumption of that certain miracle...that Beato would come.
{f:5:Virgilia}, who was standing in the front row, tried to call out as soon as Battler walked by.
She tried to tell him that the window seal on the next room over hadn\'t been confirmed, hoping that this would give him a hint.
However, she had been marked perfectly.
The instant she tried to lean forward, two Chiester Sisters right behind her grabbed her arms.
It was a powerful force preventing her from going forward.
Unable to move, ......she was forced to stay there and watch as Battler walked past.
"Battler‐kun......"
"......Even now, ......he is fighting that locked room all by himself.
 .........However, he cannot get out of that locked room by his own power alone.
 ......Unless someone comes to save him, he cannot get out."
"Unless that child comes to save him, ......Battler‐kun will be trapped..."
"If there is a key to that locked room,
 ......I am certain...Milady will find it......"
.........Milady.
 ......I am sure you have gone through many trials in your life.
But please, this is one trial that you must overcome...
......I am certain that you can do it.
I do not doubt that in the slightest......
The bride and groom...slowly processed down the path to the grave.........and reached the altar.
Though walking slowly was ceremonious and proper etiquette, it was also tiring.
Erika glanced over at Battler.
{n}......Of course, his eyes were blank.
His heart was still inside that locked room.
Once more, the sound of the Chiester honor guard stamping their heels rang out loudly.
Silence returned to the cathedral.
......Now, the wedding ceremony would finally......begin.
"People live for the sake of love!
 Therefore, today, you have fulfilled the purpose of your lives."
"Oh, how great is the power to live, the power of love...!
 I pray that the brightness of this day blesses these two for all time!"
""Come now, you who love one another!
 Make the oath of love!!""
"In the place of the husband who cannot speak—"
"Let the wife deliver the vows on behalf of both...!"
"......Battler swears to Erika,
 and Erika swears to Battler...
to support each other, both in sickness and in health."
"............ggh..................ghh......"
"......I didn\'t catch that, Battler‐san...
 If you have some objection, please say it a bit more clearly, in a loud voice."
".........Da...mn...it........."
"If you have anything further to say,
 please get yourself out of that logic error locked room first.
 .........Don\'t worry.
 I\'ll support you forever until that day comes.
 ......*giggle*, ......*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!"
""You have heard the couple\'s oath of love.
 Oh, let this oath be eternal...!!""
Thunderous applause celebrated their marriage of servitude......
{n}After the oath, ......they would physically signify the bond.
......It was the exchanging of the rings.
......The territory lord\'s ring with the One‐winged Eagle engraved on it that sat on Battler\'s finger...would become Erika\'s.
By this, she would become the ruler of this game board...
And in exchange, ......Battler\'s finger would be given a diamond ring that Erika had prepared.
......At a glance, it just looked like a ring adorned by a large diamond.
......However, this cursed ring would force Battler into eternal subservience and brand him as another\'s property......
"Yes, let the pair exchange rings...!!"
"......Since the husband\'s fingers cannot move, let his wife support him...!"
Erika respectfully took Battler\'s left hand......then slowly pulled off the territory lord\'s ring that had sat on his ring finger......
That was the ring Beato had entrusted him with.
 ......Erika...stole it away.
"This is the ring that woman left to you, right......?
 Heh...heheh...
 ......How does it feel to have it stolen away by a woman like me......?"
".........to...he........."
"Huh?
 I can\'t hear you.
 Please say it one more time."
"......Go......to hell......"
"Oh, is that all?
 Well, then there\'s no need to worry, Battler‐san."
Erika pressed her lips up against Battler\'s earlobe as if biting it......and told him where they were.
"......We\'re already there.
 *giggle*........."
Then, slowly,
 ......she took Beato\'s ring, which she had stolen from Battler,
 ......and slipped it onto her own left hand...
"And now, the bride...
...may put her ring on the groom."
"......This one\'s pretty incredible.
 .........It\'s the shackle that\'ll hold him in place for all time."
"*giggle*.
 ......Yes, ......it\'s custom made."
Even Battler\'s blank eyes could see the diamond ring Erika held.
{n}It was like Erika herself.
On the outside, it shone beautifully, ......and possessed an absolute hardness that would bend to no one\'s will.
And on the inside, ......to symbolize never letting go of the prey it had latched onto,
 ......it had eight sharp thorns pointing inwards.
If they had been growing out of the outer side, it would have looked like the collar of a hellhound.
......However, who ever heard of putting those on the inside...?
She turned the diamond until it clicked, and the thorns retracted.
......In other words, if she twisted it after putting the ring on his finger, ......the inward‐facing thorns would bite down,
 never releasing until the end of time.
......Then, even his soul would be trapped, ......and his body, mind, and soul would be forced to serve Erika for all eternity.
".........Are...you...kidding me......?
 ..................Who the......"
Who the hell would wear a ring like that?
......He couldn\'t even finish speaking that simple phrase.
And furthermore, those awkward words were the only way he could resist...
She raised Battler\'s left hand......and stroked his ring finger hungrily.
......Erika held the ring of servitude against the tip of his finger...
A ring can hurt if it\'s made to fit too tightly, and it can even become impossible to take off.
However, ......this ring was never intended to be removed for life anyway,
 ......so its inner band had been mercilessly narrowed.
Even without the thorns, forcing a small ring like this on would hurt......
"This ring will seal away your body, heart, and soul......for all eternity.
 ......And you\'ll become an eternal living puppet...
 .........I won\'t even let you die."
"......I\'ll defile and humiliate you endlessly,
 ......and every time I forget the heady taste of victory, ......I\'ll use your body to remind me.
 .........Over......and over again......
 ......If you\'re going to bite off your tongue, now\'s the time...
 ......Once this goes on your finger, ...you won\'t even be able to do that."
".........ffg......ggg.........kk......"
Battler didn\'t even possess the strength to bite his tongue.
......And even if he had possessed it, ......he didn\'t want to give up before finding a way to escape the locked room.
 So he could never bring himself to commit suicide.
However, once this ring was forced upon him,
 ......he would never be able to even think about escaping from the room, much less kill himself......
"S‐...
..st...
...stop...
......it...
..............."
"No.
 ......Here we go,
 ......the finger\'s...
......going in now......"
"Ghih...
...gyaggh...
...it...
...it huurts...
......gggghh...agh..."
It wasn\'t just the pain of having his finger forced through the tight ring.
......The curse of the ring......fiercely tormented Battler\'s body from the inside.
That pain would always torment Battler.
......But, fortunately for him...
...the ring\'s power would also steal away the mind that could understand that pain......
Erika kept screwing on the demonic ring that was far too small...
"It hurts......
......!
 .........!!
 ...It\'s...
impossible...
 ......There\'s no way...
...it\'ll fit........."
"......Don\'t worry.
 ......It will fit... .........No problem..."
With an obscene laugh, ......Erika let a silver thread drip from her mouth......and wet his finger and the ring.
"......Just relax.
 I\'ll stick it in......all at once...
 ...Please don\'t waste your energy resisting.
 ......It\'ll hurt less if you don\'t resist, okay...?
 .........Look, ......now it\'s sliding right on......"
"Nooo...
......oo...
......oo......
............!"
Slowly, slowly, ......Battler\'s finger went deeper and deeper through the ring.
He was pushed through the iron ring of pain and humiliation...which would never be removed again...
"Ooh...
......gah...
.........
...............gyhaah............"
"......Look, ......see...?
 ......It\'s in all the way to the base......"
"...It...hurts, ......it...hurts, ......ghh... ......Take...it......off......"
The demonic ring squeezed his finger so tightly......that it seemed the finger would snap off along with the bone.
......Could Battler\'s hazy expression of anguish......really communicate how unbearable this sickening pain was......?
"......Okay.
 .........Now that it\'s on all the way, ......let\'s add the final touch, okay...?
 Now, ......you will be mine......forever......"
Erika touched the ring\'s diamond knob.
......If she twisted it,
 ......the thorns would bite in...and never let go again...
"N‐......
......no......
 ...Stop......it............"
"Sure.
 ......Just say "spare me, Erika‐sama", and I\'ll stop."
"............R‐......really.........?"
"‘Spare me, Erika‐sama, please.
 I swear to spend the rest of my life as your dog, with a collar around my neck, so at least spare me that ring.’
 ......If you can say that, I won\'t make you wear the ring."
"......S‐...
......s...
.........s....................."
"......Yeeeees...?
 ......I can\'t really hear you......?"
{a:c:
Screw......
...you......}
"......I\'ll never......forgive you......"
"For making you suffer like this...?"
"No.
 ...For...
......defiling...Beato\'s...ring......
I will...
......never...forgive you........."
Though Battler\'s eyes had supposedly been forced into a clouded state, they looked strong for just an instant.
However, it really was only for an instant.
Battler had used up the last of his fleeting resistance......just to say those words.
In his dim consciousness, he had even bitten his own tongue to stay alert,
 .........so that he could complete his words of resistance......
".........Of course.
 It seems you aren\'t the kind of dog that can be tamed.
 But that\'s what I like about you."
Erika smiled.
 ......Then, she turned the diamond.
The instant she did, .........Battler let out a voiceless scream......and threw his head back......
"Ggh.........gah......ahh..................aaaahh......!!!"
His howl had no voice and could be heard by no one.
 ......However, it still rang out throughout the cathedral......A desolate wind blew through the golden rose garden......
Shannon and Kanon had already finished walking 19 steps, and their backs still faced each other.
......At the signal of the demons responsible for this trial, they would both turn.........and settle this.
Each of them held one of the dueling pistols that the demons had prepared.
The bullets......promised certain death no matter where on the body they hit.
This duel would not end...
...until one of them died......
".............................."
"..........................."
George and Jessica......just quietly watched the ones they loved...
They had already entrusted all of their thoughts to them...and their fates.
Just watching over their partners...was now the only way they could show their trust.
"..........................."
"..........................."
Shannon and Kanon......stood quietly, with their backs turned.
They had already put the emotions of the many days they had spent together behind them.
The next time they laid eyes on each other,
 ......nothing would be asked of them except pulling that trigger.
The only one who still had no determination or resolution with regard to this duel...
...was Beato.
The closer that moment came, ......the less she understood.
The love between George and Shannon wasn\'t standing in the way of the love between Jessica and Kanon or vice versa.
......Why, when both sides could find happiness, ......were they forced to kill each other...?
"......I don\'t understand.
 ......I just can\'t.........understand...!"
".........Little sister...
 We are not permitted to do anything but watch..."
"Zepar‐san, Furfur‐san...!
 Why......why this duel?!
 This is no trial of love!
 You really are demons!
 You just want to enjoy watching one of the pairs fall apart...!!"
"Quiet."
"You\'ll get in the way of the lovers."
"You\'re the ones getting in their way!!
 One will fall!
 The one who loves that person will grieve!!
 If only you two weren\'t around, no one would be sad!!"
""That is not true.""
"If we hadn\'t set up this duel—"
"Then both pairs would have fallen apart.
 This duel is necessary."
"I......haven\'t been able to accept that since the beginning...!!
 Do you think love can\'t succeed without a miracle of magic?!
 The only thing needed for love......is two who love each other, isn\'t it?!
 This duel is meaningless!!"
"So stop it, you two!!
 Shannon and Kanon both!!
 Why do you have to fight each other to the death, when you were once as close as true siblings?!
 I just can\'t.........understand!!!"
Everyone should have been able to hear Beato\'s yell.
{n}......However, no one\'s expression changed.
"......That\'s right.
 I\'m impressed that you noticed."
"That is the truth of love."
".........What is...?!!"
"Love needs nothing more than two people who love one another."
"Therefore, when there are not "two people",
 ......we must use a duel to make that number become "two"."
"I could understand if it were a duel between two people fighting over one woman!
 If it were a duel to reduce the awkward shape of a love triangle down to a pair...!!
 But they are two and two!!
 The world formed by each pair is complete, isn\'t it?!!
 There\'s nothing compelling them to fight!!"
"The minimum number of people that can create a world is two."
"Only when two people are together can a world be born and love fulfilled."
"That is why this duel is necessary."
"So that they can reach that number of people."
"A‐......are you saying that furniture is less than {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}, and doesn\'t count as a whole person...?!"
""Correct.
 Furniture is less than {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.
 So furniture and {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} cannot add up to two.""
"That\'s insane!
 If two people love each other, their circumstances don\'t matter!!"
""Oh, yes they do!!""
"Do you really think that the circumstances of two in love don\'t matter?!"
"Is it permissible to fall in love with a man who has a wife?
 Is it permissible to fall in love with a woman who has a husband?"
"Is it permissible to fall in love with your parents?
 Is it permissible to fall in love with your children?
 There are many situations where circumstances forbid romantic love!!"
"Th‐then just what is furniture?!!
 Why mustn\'t furniture fall in love?!!!"
""Because their soul amounts to less than a full person!""
"Shannon, Kanon, and the piece that you are as well!!"
"All of you are furniture!
 Subhuman beings who do not possess a full person\'s soul!!"
"There is only one thing necessary to love a human!
 That is the possession of a full person\'s soul!!
 That\'s why a pair in love can create a world!!"
"For example, do you think a man with a wife has the right to love another woman?"
".........Of course not.
 If he loved two women, neither would get a full person\'s worth of love.
 ......A man such as that would not be qualified to love."
"See?
 There are plenty of people in plenty of circumstances who have no right to love another!!
 As long as both people feel love, nothing else matters?
 That is a comforting lie of naive love!!"
"We cannot forgive humans who falsely pretend that they have the right to love!!
 We cannot permit the love of sub{y:0:-Human}{n:0:human} beings, of those who do not make up the minimum number of people to create a world!!"
""That is the purpose of our trial...!!
 To allow sinful souls to regain the soul of a whole person and become capable of true love!!""
"......Zepar‐sama, Furfur‐sama."
"Our hearts......are ready."
""Please, give the signal to start the duel.""
The pair bidding farewell quietly asked for the signal to be given.
Zepar nodded silently, then walked to a place that could be seen by both of them.
Furfur spoke in a voice quiet enough to avoid distracting the two duelists.
".........Watch."
"Watch the duel to see which of the lovers will fall apart...?!"
"No, this isn\'t a duel to see who falls apart.
 ......This is a duel to make true love succeed."
"......I......don\'t understand......what you two are saying...!"
"No, you must understand.
 This moment.........marks the birth of a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} who is truly capable of loving another person."
"I don\'t......understand.........!!!"
"No matter which of them wins, ......please congratulate them.
 ......This is the moment......when their days as furniture......come to an end."
"The signal is simple.
 ......I will count to three.
 When I reach three, the duel will commence."
"Understood."
"......Same here."
"If both of you miss, the duel will be temporarily suspended.
 You will be given bullets again and will start over from the beginning, with your backs to each other."
".........I guess it\'ll repeat until it\'s all settled..."
"Zepar.
 Have you seen this sort of duel......many times before?"
"Of course.
 I have seen it many times."
"......Usually, how many times do they need to face off before it\'s over?"
"In almost all cases, it is decided in the first round."
"Everyone must be really good shots..."
"That\'s not it.
 ......If one side misses, the other can corner them at their leisure and shoot.
 ......Miss with that first bullet, ......and there\'s almost no chance of winning."
"However, if you take too long, you\'ll lose before you can even pull the trigger."
".........If you\'re going to lose anyway, you\'d at least want to have pulled the trigger first."
"That is a good mindset, you two.
 .........Now, ............here we go."
"One."
"Two."
""Three.""
In the golden rose garden,
 ...when the number three was yelled,
 ......the sound of gunfire rang out once......
Even the people watching couldn\'t tell whether that was a single gun firing...
...or the sound of both going off at the same time......
In the midst of the stench of gunpowder and white smoke,
 .........there, with gun raised and smoke trailing from the barrel...
...was Kanon.
 ...............Shannon...
...was lying on the earth face down......
"......Sh‐
......Shannon...
...san.................."
"......No.
 ......Shannon dropped before the gunshot......"
"Nn.....................gah............"
Jessica\'s distressed expression...was enough to explain what had happened......
......Slowly,
 ......Shannon...
...stood up.
There was no bullet wound anywhere on her body.
.........At the time of the signal, Shannon had thrown herself to the ground......dodging the bullet.
It had been a gamble.
If Kanon had turned around and taken the time to aim carefully before shooting,
 ......then he would have shot her as she lay there.
However, ......if Kanon shot as soon as he turned around, ......she would be able to dodge it.
Kanon had also gambled.
He did not underestimate Shannon\'s skill with a firearm.
He was fully aware that hoping Shannon would be timid enough to let him shoot first...
...could result in him losing before even pulling the trigger.
So, he had decided to shoot right away.
And, he had predicted that when he shot, Shannon would reflexively pull the trigger too.
Since he was already planning to shoot right away, he was sure that his readiness would allow him to shoot with greater accuracy than her.
If Kanon had cautiously turned around,
 and Shannon had shot instantly with the strength of her will, then Kanon wouldn\'t even have been able to pull the trigger.
So, it wasn\'t that Kanon had acted hastily.
.........The two had simply given it their all, left their fates to the heavens,
 ......and reached this result.
"...................................."
".........I didn\'t imagine...
......that my quick‐tempered sister...
...wouldn\'t shoot at all..."
"I\'m surprised too.
 ......I didn\'t think that old, prudent Kanon‐kun......would shoot as soon as he turned."
As Shannon quietly pointed the barrel at him, she slowly walked forward.
{n}She planned on cautiously closing the gap until she reached a distance from which she could hit with even more certain accuracy.
And Kanon.........had already lost any means of fighting back.
He could only try to dodge Shannon\'s bullet......and place his bet on the second round.
.........They both had that same view of the situation,
 .........which meant one could be taken by surprise.
".....................!!"
"This isn\'t......over yet!!!"
Kanon dashed forward like a tornado, bent over so low that he was almost crawling over his shadow...
This duel could only be settled by a bullet,
 ......but he wasn\'t the only one who had a bullet.
If he could steal Shannon\'s gun away from her, he could turn this all around...!
And if Shannon could calmly shoot through Kanon, it would all be over!
The odds that Shannon would miss, or that he could get close enough to her before she fired.
{n}Kanon bet all the chips he had on these.
Shannon could draw Kanon in until the last second, then shoot him from a closer distance.
She could also pull the trigger just before he reached her, and they would start over from the beginning even if she missed.
......Shannon kept her gun pointing at Kanon\'s forehead as she compared these options until the final moment.
She led her shot, calculating the distance he had already moved and the time it would take to pull the trigger.
.........Lady Luck smiled......impartially.
"......Rrrrrraa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}ahhh!!!"
"D‐damn it!!!"
In a flash, Kanon leapt to within striking distance of Shannon as she missed the final moment to pull the trigger.
He swung his hand up and smashed the gun she held upwards.
That strike sent her gun flying into the sky.
At the same time, Kanon\'s gun also flew from his hand and soared into the air.
The two guns danced a rondo through the sky, reached their peak, ......and began to fall.
By that time, neither one of them knew which gun was theirs.
The two guns were exactly the same.
 Everything about them was identical.
{n}There was no way to tell them apart.
However, there was one difference.
.........Only one of them had a bullet inside.
The pair raised their hands to the sky,
 trying to grasp their fate,
 ......their miracle.
It was as though...
...they were trying to grasp the wings of a descending angel of miracles.
The pair looked up at the brilliant sky...
.........and entrusted everything to Lady Luck.
Then, they each grabbed one of the guns out of the air,
 and after dancing a momentary rondo, ............their arms crossed each other.
Even that was like a dance.
And the barrels of each of their guns came to a dead stop against each other\'s forehead.
"...................................."
"...................................."
Even they could not know......which gun held the bullet.
When they both pulled the triggers, ......one would die, and one would remain alive.
The match would end.
George and Jessica had no way of knowing how it would turn out until that moment came.
......However, was it really impossible for the two holding the guns to know...?
The barrel of Kanon\'s gun, which had already been fired, must have been warm.
{n}And the barrel of the other gun, which Shannon hadn\'t fired, should have been ice‐cold.
So, perhaps the pair of them...
...did realize which gun was which.
......And yet, .........both expressions were as solemn as could be,
 ............showing that they would hold total belief and zero doubt in their own fates until the moment the trigger was pulled.
"......................................."
"......................................."
"Don\'t be sad.
 We\'ll meet again soon...in the Golden Land."
"We should have done this much sooner."
"And that way, ......we wouldn\'t have to see each other again."
"It\'s alright.
 Considering what day this is, even this duel is just a farce."
"You\'re right...
 If we\'re just going to revive in the Golden Land anyway, it really is just a farce."
"Then I\'ll see you later."
"Yeah. You too."
"So long."
"Kanon‐kun?!?!"
"Hey, what\'s going on?!
 Hang in there!!"
Suddenly,
 .........Kanon fell to the floor as if he\'d had an attack of anemia.
It happened without any prior warning, so everyone rushed up to him in alarm.
What they saw surprised them.
 There was a single strand of blood across his forehead, making it look as though it had cracked open...
"H‐......huh?
 H‐how......"
"What happened?
 ......Wh‐......what\'s going on......?"
Trying to get a look at the wound, Gohda wiped Kanon\'s forehead with a handkerchief.
.....However, his forehead was perfectly smooth, without any trace of a wound.
And yet, ......almost as though it was seeping through his skin, blood was pouring out......
"Wh‐what are you doing?!
 Stop the bleeding already!!"
"I, I would, but...!!
 Th‐there\'s no wound,
 ......but the blood,
 ......the blood won\'t stop coming...!"
"Hang in there, Kanon‐kun!!
 Kanon‐kun!!
 ......Y‐......Yoshiya‐kuu{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}uun!!!"
"...................................."
Kanon\'s face was pale, ......and though his eyes were open, they had lost the light of the living.
......Just as though...
...he was a puppet whose strings had been cut,
 .........he passed away......
"Yoshiya‐kun, Yoshiya‐kun!!
 Uwaaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhh, uwaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhh!!!"
".........So long, Kanon‐kun.
 .........And......thank you."
Jessica dashed up to Kanon\'s corpse,
 .........held it,
 ......pressed her forehead against his,
 and as her own forehead grew wet with Kanon\'s still warm blood,
 ......she wailed......
"...............Shannon......"
"......George‐san.
 ......I......won.
 ......And now,
 ......I have...
......the right to love you...
.........at last........"
Shannon......leaned against George\'s chest......as though the strings holding her up had been cut.
George held her in silence......
"Yoshiya‐kun, Yoshiya‐kun!!
 Waa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhhh.........!!!
 Uwaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaahhh...aaahh...aahh......"
There was nothing in the golden rose garden except the wind that carried golden flower petals...
...and the sound of Jessica\'s heartbroken wails......
"......Is your trial for us finished now?"
"It is.
 ......Congratulations.
 You two were the ones who remained."
"We will give you our blessing.
 But please, don\'t forget.
 You are now responsible for nurturing your love."
"......Please, take good care of the seed of love that this miracle has created."
"............Of course.
 ......I swear it to her and both of you."
"And now, let Shannon have the miracle of magic."
"Now, your soul will become {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.
 You will become a full person."
""Come together, incomplete souls...!!
 Become one and know love...!!""
When Zepar and Furfur faced the heavens and yelled,
 ......the miracle of love...
...gathered the souls around Shannon.
They came from the losers of the trial.
{n}From Kanon, who had been defeated.
{n}And from Beato, who had dropped out.
Slowly, .........the bodies of the two began to break down into flecks of gold dust...
"......What is........."
"Wh‐what\'s going on here...?!
 No one ever said that the losers would disappear!!"
As she yelled, Beato the Elder supported the body of her fading little sister.
{n}However, the two demons were smiling quietly.
"Kanon disappears because he died.
 Beato was born to love Battler, so without that right, she too will vanish."
"......It is very fair.
 If you had survived, the other two would have vanished instead."
"Hang in there, little sister, hang in there!!
 Weren\'t you going to solve Battler\'s locked room and save him?!
 What are you doing, biting the dust in a place like this?!!
 You call yourself a part of our complete form?!!"
".........Why...
......was I born for the sole purpose...
...of loving Battler‐san......?
 ......Why...
...do I like him...?
 The truth is,
 ......I don\'t know...
...why I fell in love with him."
"Wh‐...what?!
 You want to talk about that now...?!!"
"......After all,
 ......when I was born,
 .........I was told to love Battler‐san and be loved by him...
 That was the purpose of my birth.
 .........So,
 ......I don\'t really know...
...{i:why} I like him......"
"P‐people don\'t need a reason to fall in love!!
 Don\'t disappear!!
 If you disappear, who will save Battler?!
 Little sister, Beato!
 {f:5:Beatricee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}ee}!!"
............Why...
...is it...
...that I like Battler‐san...?
{a:c:
......“Mother”?}
"Well, you know,
 I\'m not really a big fan of the domestic type of girl.
 You know me, I\'m a rough‐around‐the‐edges kind of guy, right?
 ......I just can\'t handle acting politely in front of girls, ladies first and all that stuff.
 ......So, if I had to say what type I liked......"
"......You know, maybe a Jessica‐type girl could be just my thing.
 If I\'m crude, why shouldn\'t she be too?
 ......A rough, relaxed relationship with someone who can cuss and joke around with me, so we\'re not always thinking about how I\'m a guy and she\'s a girl—that could be just perfect!"
"So if I ever get a girlfriend,
 ......I\'d like someone I could joke around with all the time like I do with Jessica...!"
"Huh?
 What would she look like?
 I\'m not too picky about that.
 But if she {i:did} happen to be one of those blue‐eyed blondes with big boobs you see in Western films,
 ihhi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi, that\'d be awesome.
 I\'d love to rub those boobs!
 Waha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha...!"
{a:c:{m:-5:―}―{f:5:Beatrice}.
{n}Listen to me.
{n}I am giving you my love for Ushiromiya Battler.
{n}You are to become the kind of woman Ushiromiya Battler desires.}
{a:c:You will have the golden hair he likes.
{n}You will have the blue eyes he likes.
{n}You will have a personality that matches his.
{n}And then, ......you are to love him in my place,
{n}and if fate allows it, be loved by him.}
{a:c:I.........can no longer love him.
{n}Please, take these desires I couldn\'t bring to fruition,
{n}......these feelings too great for me to bear,
{n}......and see them through yourself.}
{a:c:From this day forward,{n}you are no longer the Rokkenjima ghost that lives only to play pranks.}
{a:c:From this day forward,{n}you will be the master of this island,{n}waiting for the day that he comes to fulfill his promise.}
{a:c:From this day forward, you will do this in my place.
{n}So, from this day forward, you will no longer be me.}
{a:c:Please forgive me for pushing all of my troubles onto you,{n}...while I alone try to find happiness.}
{a:c:From this day forward, you have the right to hate everything.
{n}From this day forward, you are the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}.}
{a:c:And, one day,
{n}you will destroy everything, revive everything,
{n}......and bring blessings to all lovers.}
{a:c:When that day comes,
{n}......I pray that you and I will both have found happiness.}
{a:c:From this day forward, you will no longer be me.
{n}From this day forward, I will no longer be you.
{n}The two of us will split a single soul and share it.
{n}And though, of course, that won\'t amount to a complete soul...
{n}I\'m sure our dreams will be more numerous than most.}
{a:c:Let us be blessed.........
{n}My darling...{f:5:Beatrice}.........}
{a:c:No one else can see your form.
{n}But I can.
{n}And if you\'re loved by a lot of people,
{n}I\'m sure they\'ll all start seeing you too.}
{a:c:We can all {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see}...if we have love......}
".........Yoshiya......kun.................."
"...A‐
......are we...
...dre‐...
...dreaming......?"
"I‐......insane...
 What kind of joke is this...?? Well?!"
"D‐D‐Doctor Nanjo!!
 I\'ll go call Doctor Nanjo...!!"
"............Gohda.
 ......That is enough."
Genji, who had been calm and silent through the whole thing, finally spoke.
And those......were the most reasonable words spoken.
......If he called Nanjo here,
 ............then what...?
Not only was there no arm to take the pulse of,
 .........there wasn\'t even a forehead to feel the heat of.
......Like the last unmelted snow greeting the warm sun of spring,
 ...Kanon\'s form...
......There was no longer...
......even a trace.
His form...
...had sparkled with a spray of gold...
...and vanished completely......
"......Where...?
 Where did he go?!
 Where\'s Yoshiya‐kun?!
 Yoshiya‐kun, Yoshiya‐kuu{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}uun!!!!"
".........So long,
 Milady.
 ......No, ............Jessica."
"......Kanon‐san........."
"No one\'s eyes can see us any longer.
 ......That means that we are no longer in their world.
 ......However, we are right here."
"............You\'re right.
 ......We......are here."
"For us, a body is nothing more than a cage made of flesh.
 .........There\'s no need to be sad."
"......But, .........I do feel sad for her.
 ......Jessica‐san..."
"This is all......my sin.
 ......This is why furniture isn\'t supposed to love."
"..................What will you do now?"
"Though I have lost my form,
 ......though I can no longer talk to her,
 ......and even though if Jessica ever talks to me...
...I can do nothing except nod behind her back,
 .........I will be by her side."
"...........................
 ......I think that\'s wonderful."
"What will you do...?"
"......I want to save Battler‐san...from a locked room......"
"A locked room...?
 Ha......haha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha."
After looking a bit taken aback, Kanon laughed gently.
{n}Beato, who hadn\'t expected to be laughed at, looked a little sour.
"Wh‐why are you laughing...?
 This is very important to me..."
"But it\'s a locked room.
 .........That\'s only a problem for humans who have bodies."
"......Huh?
 ............Ah..."
"We have already been released from our cage of flesh.
 ......How could a locked room hinder us?"
"......A‐are you sure about that...?
 I mean, there\'s a chain lock, and duct tape seals, and red truth...!"
"I see.
 ......So, you weren\'t from the world of pieces, ......but a being from a higher‐level world.
 ......That\'s probably why your limitations are different from ours.
 ......Ah, well."
Kanon stretched.
{n}......It looked as though he was about to head out somewhere.
"......Kanon‐san......"
"Seeing as you\'re a fellow loser,
 .........okay.
 I\'ll go for you.
 I\'ll go to the guest room in the mansion, let Battler‐sama out,
 set the chain behind me, and hide in the closet in his place.
 ......How about that?"
"I, I\'m glad for the sentiment...
 But even if you wanted to leave the cousins\' room, ......Erika‐san\'s seals mean..."
Unlike the next room over, the cousins\' room where Kanon was had been guaranteed to be a complete locked room, even counting the windows.
Not only did he have no way to save Battler, but he couldn\'t even escape himself......
".........In that case, use your magic to give me power."
"My......magic.........?"
"Yeah.
 Use your magic on me."
"W‐wait......
 I don\'t even know how......"
"Aren\'t you {f:5:Beatrice}, the Golden Witch...?"
"I am a witch, but.........ummm...
 I don\'t even know about locked room tricks, much less magic......"
"Good grief......
 Okay, listen up, {f:5:Beatrice}.
 .........I\'ll only tell you this once.
 This is what a witch is."
"What a witch is.........?"
{a:c:
A witch is...}
"Not the one who solves puzzles."
"......Not the one......who solves puzzles......?"
"Yeah, that\'s right.
 If you\'re a witch, why are you clutching at your head because of someone else\'s puzzles?
 ......That\'s not a witch\'s job, right?"
"Th‐......then, ......what is......a witch\'s job......?"
"The Golden Witch I know...
...used insane magic to create puzzles that baffled everyone and sneered at their confusion.
 ......Create a horrible riddle that no one can get, spin everyone around, and bad‐mouth them.
 You aren\'t supposed to clutch your head agonizing over your opponents\' puzzles. That\'s {i:their} job."
"Agonizing......is my opponents\' job......"
"Don\'t worry about how to get Ushiromiya Battler out of the locked room.
 ......A room locked by a chain?
 What a joke.
 ......You need to create a much more spectacular, ultimate locked room...
and make it so that they\'re the ones agonizing.
 .........I\'ll even lend a hand."
"I\'m......not the one who agonizes......"
"That\'s for them to do.
 It\'s about time they recalled the true terror...
...of {f:5:Beatrice} the Endless Witch, the one who can create endless locked‐room tricks of the most horrific kind,
 tricks that can make even the demons of hell prostrate themselves in shock...!"
".........A locked room.........even more horrific than Battler‐san\'s..."
"We\'ve already gotten our hands on one, haven\'t we?"
"A...horrific.........locked...room......"
{a:c:
.........ah...}
In the back of Beato\'s mind,
 ......images she remembered began to flit by, one after another—
the layout of the mansion, the guesthouse, the rose garden......
Trick. Mistake. Mislead.
Taunt.
 Trap.
 Laugh together.
......Do you know about this trick...?
{n}It was in a book I read once......
Beato\'s eyes opened wider and wider......
Countless lights circled around her, swallowing her up.
"And one more thing."
"......Wh‐what...?"
"That\'s no way for the witch of locked rooms to talk."
"Then, you think I should......"
"Go for "warawa"."The marriage ceremony ended without any problems, and the reception was held inside the cathedral...
As the goat demons partied raucously,
 Dlanor could be seen leaning against a pillar, trying to escape from the noise.
Then, Gertrude appeared and whispered some kind of report to her.
".........Is that {f:5:true}?"
"For your attention:
 Assistant Inquisitor Cornelia is currently heading towards the scene.
 ......I suggest that Lady {f:5:Erika} be contacted as well."
"{f:5:Understood}.
 I will tell {f:5:her}.
 ......Gertrude, contact the head of ceremony {f:5:security}.
 ......Prepare for {f:5:battle}."
"As you wish."
"I apologize for interrupting your chat.
 I am in charge of security for this ceremony."
"Huh? For me?!
 Oh, what\'s going on?"
"......I told you that you were going too far.
 Champagne Tower Bowling was always a bad idea.
 Time for a scolding.
 *giggle*giggle*......"
"Hey, Beeeeeeern!!
 Fine, what is it, did I do something wrong?!"
"The reception desk has received an envelope from an unknown sender addressed to "Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}"."
"I always ignore anonymous calls and letters.
 Just throw it away."
"Well, you see, ......this one is a little different..."
"...............What the...
 ......Have you told anyone you received this...?"
"No, only the two Sisters at the reception desk and I know.
 I have already issued a gag order."
The instant she saw the envelope,
 {f:5:Lambdadelta} snatched it away and lowered her voice.
......{f:5:Bernkastel} had walked away and was apparently making fun of Erika.
Erika was drunk, of course, and Bern was getting that way too.
{n}If they were left alone, they\'d probably forget about this.
It was true that the envelope had no sender written on it.
......However, the seal done on it in gold leaf...
fulfilled the same purpose.
......That seal was......
{f:5:Lambdadelta} hid behind a pillar, ripped the envelope open,
 took out the letter inside, and read.
Her eyes instantly started to glint,
 .........and she grinned like a kid who\'d just gotten a naughty idea...
"......What is to be done?
 The sniper team is carrying red warheads.
 If you give your permission, I will give the order to load them."
"...........................
 ......What are you talking about?
 Do you realize how important these guests are?
 If a stray bullet hits one of these attendees,
 all the new Chiester Sisters will be sent straight from the factory to the guillotine for the next ten years."
"Understood, ma\'am. We will intercept with regular warheads.
 Shall we post lookouts around the Seven Sisters of Purgatory?"
"Why would we need those?
 After all, the Seven Stakes are Battler\'s...and now Erika\'s furniture.
 Why would we post lookouts around our allies?
 Just make sure security is nice and tight."
"Just now, we received a recommendation from Senior Assistant Inquisitor Gertrude suggesting that we make preparations for battle.
 Her reasons are unknown."
"From Gertrude?
 .........Heheh.
 Then follow that recommendation.
 A party\'s more fun once you liven things up...!"
"Understood, ma\'am.
 .........00 calling Chiester17, Chiester38, Chiester45: Issuing Code R alert.
 Standby level 2."
"17, copy."
"38, copy."
"45, understood...!"
"Would\'ve been cooler if you\'d just said "copy" nyeh."
"I, I panicked...!"
"Ah, right, 45.
 Come over here a second."
"Wh‐...what is it?
 H‐hey, we\'re on duty...!
 Stop, don\'t play with my ears...!"
"Your ears.
 Better fold them down nyeh."
".........What did you say...?!
 You\'re kidding, right?
 That\'s impossible...!"
"Cornelia is heading there {f:5:now}.
 ......The odds of {f:5:Beatrice} attacking here are extremely {f:5:high}.
 I recommend suspending the reception and {f:5:evacuating}."
"What\'s going on, Erika......?
 Something go wrong with the entertainment...?"
"N‐no, my master...! Please continue to enjoy the reception.
 ......Hey, someone?
 Let\'s get Lady {f:5:Bernkastel} some more dried plum wine...!"
The question had come too fast for Erika to hide her agitation.
When {f:5:Bernkastel} saw this, ......she knew that their final, late guest would soon be arriving.
"Luci‐nee.
 I hear there\'s been some movement in the guesthouse."
"......The guesthouse?
 Who cares about the game board now?"
"Well...
 ......They\'re saying that Kanon‐kun disappeared from the cousins\' room..."
"What?!
 Are you a moron?
 The cousins\' room is a perfect locked room, with the door and all the windows perfectly sealed.
 It\'s impossible for him to escape...!"
"No, I\'ve investigated that claim as well.
 ......There\'s no mistake.
 Kanon has disappeared from the cousins\' room."
"......He\'s probably hiding somewhere in the cousins\' room.
 Or else, he\'s managed to trick everyone since the beginning...and was never in that room to begin with."
"That\'s impossible.
 It\'s been guaranteed that "everyone" is in the cousins\' room except the specific names Lady {f:5:Erika} read aloud back then.
 It\'s impossible for him to trick his way out of there."
"......How did he get past the Jungfrau seal barrier...?
 No, first off, where on earth is Kanon?
 Find him at once...!"
At that moment, the cathedral suddenly went black.
The surprised commotion of the guests filled the cathedral...
".........She\'s here."
"00 calling all Chiesters.
 Code R Alert!
 Chiester17, can you repair the electrical systems?"
"Negative.
 Communications with the management staff have been severed."
"All Chiesters, code red!
 Rock ’n’ roll!!"
"Copy."
"Copy."
"Copy."
"U‐understood. Ah! I mean copy!"
The sniper teams in the chandeliers all released their safeties at once.
{n}The entire security team down in the hall loaded their ammunition.
"......Lady {f:5:Erika}, let us evacuate to the waiting {f:5:room}.
 It is dangerous {f:5:here}."
"What\'s dangerous?!
 I\'m the territory lord of this world!
 Why should I have to run away in fear?!"
"Gertrude, set up a VIP guard {f:5:barrier}.
 Call Cornelia back here at {f:5:once}."
"For your attention: this is underway."
"A barrier?!
 I need to be wrapped in one of your pitiful, pathetic barriers while I\'m wearing a wedding dress?!
 How insulting!!"
This disturbance made even Battler groan, as he sat in the next seat like a doll...
".....................uuugh.................."
Even with his soul sealed, Battler probably realized that something strange was going on...
"She took her time.
 Right, Lambda?"
"Totally.
 She sure kept us waiting."
"What was that just now?
 A love letter from someone...?"
"A fan letter.
 From the Lambda‐chan Fan Club."
{f:5:Lambdadelta} played dumb and munched some popcorn.
Then, the lights finally turned on...
It was clear that during that blackout,
 ......{f:5:Beatrice} had snuck in somewhere nearby, possibly even inside the cathedral itself.
The whispering goat attendees all realized it as well.
Whose scheme was this...and what were they doing?
......Though it may have been imprudent, they were looking forward to this, and an excited chatter filled the cathedral...
"Looks like she came."
"G‐Gaap...!
 They let you come back too...?!"
"Come on, putting me in a jail is meaningless."
"True! Pu ku ku ku."
"......But Riiche.
 .........Battler\'s locked room, the cousins\' room,
 ......and even the final possibility, the next room over, have all been sealed...
 ......How are you planning to save Battler...?!"
"Let us suppose...
that Milady has found some trick X.
 If so,
 she would inevitably have to march in here to thrust that in Lady {f:5:Erika}\'s face..."
"But...against all of these Chiester troops...
 ......I can\'t believe this many of them were hiding here...!
 It\'s impossible... She\'ll be sewn to death...!"
Rabbit ears could be seen poking out all around the hall.
......It was incredible that such a large number of them could remain hidden and unnoticed...
"......If she can just get close enough to challenge Erika, ......she should be able to get herself an even fight."
"I see, that move.
 .........However, does Milady have that item with her?
 ......After all, she hated dealing with them, and disliked it every time I prepared them for her.
 .........Dear me.
 She remains a troublesome one to the end."
Amid the crowd, Ronove took something out and showed it.
......When {f:5:Virgilia} saw the object in his hand, she understood its meaning...
True, with that, ......it should be possible to stop the attacks from the Chiester troops......
"Well, if it doesn\'t work on Erika, we\'re through.
 The problem is getting her right in front of Erika, if only for a second.
 ......The Chiesters will probably prevent that with all they have.
 ......Lia,
 ......I\'ll bet you could give her the time to do that..."
{f:5:Virgilia} gave a small nod.
However, the problem was the two Chiester troops standing at her back.
......Since that time she had tried to jump out in front of the procession, she had been marked constantly...
It was possible, with {f:5:Virgilia}\'s vast magical power, to momentarily take out all of the Chiester troops in the cathedral.
That would only gain a short bit of time, but it would be enough to confront Erika.
......The Chiester troops knew this, so they kept a close eye on {f:5:Virgilia} with tense faces.
At that moment,
 ......the great cathedral door was blasted to bits.
The fragments became bright gold butterflies...
which danced across the room in a beautiful blizzard of gold leaf......
That golden storm...
...slowly faded away...
Then,
 ......at the entrance to that red‐carpeted path to the grave,
 .........stood a calm,
 majestic figure......
"Guards, shoot to {f:5:kill}...!!"
"Negative, conducting identity comparison."
Dlanor ordered the guards to shoot the intruder right away, but Chiester00 didn\'t comply.
Was it because she had been warned about shooting these guests...and was afraid of the consequences if she accidentally shot a drunk guest who had disguised themselves as {f:5:Beatrice} as some sort of prank?
No. 00 was just coolly and calmly carrying out her duties.
"......Oh, what a surprise... You know, I thought you weren\'t going to make it."
"...................................."
The pair faced each other from either end of the long red carpet.
However, in between them...
stood several dozen Chiester honor guards...
"It took you quite some time to come here, most honored guest!!
 You had us all quite worried!
 But I am glad you managed to make it to the reception at least......!!"
"............Heh,
 ......heh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eheh..."
Beato......laughed......
That chuckle...
......made Battler\'s eyes quiver slightly.
"Y‐
......you.................."
"......Did I keep you waiting? Furudo Erikaaa?!
 ......I\'m here to celebraaate...!"
She had an overpowering and evil presence about her, ......strong enough to make anyone shiver.
Was it still necessary for her identity to be confirmed?
{n}Who could possibly mistake this overwhelming presence?
"B‐
......{f:5:Beatriiiiiiii
ce{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}eee}!!!"
"‘See you in hell’ is a favorite parting line of mine, but—"
"Identity confirmed.
 It is the great Lady {f:5:Beatrice}!!"
"It seems we are here already,
 Furudo Erikaaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aaa!!!"
At that moment, the two Chiester troops standing behind {f:5:Virgilia} slumped over and fell to the floor.
......Ronove had touched the bases of their big ears from behind.
It was clear that he had applied some sort of magic.
"Someone find a doctor.
 These girls seem to be ill."
"All Chiesters, open fiiiiiiiiiiire!!"
"Beato, now!!"
Just an instant before the Chiester troops could fire, {f:5:Virgilia} raised her arms to the heavens.
Her magical power, which was more than enough to remind all present what her name had been at the height of her strength,
 became a spirit wave and exploded throughout the cathedral.
The impact made the stained glass windows shatter, and colorful glass shards poured down everywhere.
"S‐spirit particle warfare defenses!! Hurry on recovery!!"
However, all of the Chiester honor guards, who didn\'t have spirit particle defenses, toppled over like dolls.
The ceiling snipers, who were defended, were able to avoid their systems going down completely, but it would take several minutes before they could recover.
.........That span of time...
...would be enough to reach Erika...
However, Erika couldn\'t be defeated in just a few minutes.
{n}There was no way they could carry Battler away in that time...!
What should they use this precious time for?!
Beato dashed down the red carpeted path.
She ran down the path to the grave, which was lined by Chiester troops lying there like corpses.
She had called this place hell.
{n}......In that case, running from hell to the grave was actually going backwards.
Beato\'s figure dashing through the corpse‐ridden path truly symbolized her resurrection...!
"Milady, take this...!"
"Got it!!"
As she dashed, she snatched something white from Ronove\'s outstretched hand.
There was no longer anyone blocking her path to Erika...!!
However, that instant, a golden thread came from in front of her and rapidly sewed through the red carpet towards her like a sewing machine!
"Hoh, we have a meddler...!!"
"Reloading complete, requesting data nyeh!"
"Firing radar targeted.
 Data link to 410!!"
410 was clever.
She had predicted that {f:5:Virgilia} would go for a spirit particle attack...and had folded over her ears and 45\'s beforehand.
So, they were the only ones that weren\'t taken out.
"Firing!!"
Once again, the golden sewing thread chased after Beato, weaving like a sewing machine.
It was as though an undulating golden snake was shooting after her.
"Impudence...!!
 How dare you interfere at a moment so invaluable for my showdown with Erika...!"
Beato jumped sideways away from the red carpet and ran across the top of a long table covered with beautiful food.
The gold snake chased her, sewing through the pure white tablecloth like a sewing machine and scattering dishes left and right...!
The goat attendees ran about wildly, trying to escape.
 The cathedral was wrapped in pandemonium.
"......I can\'t believe some of those rabbits evaded the spirit particle attack...!"
"This is bad.
 With them in that position, ......there\'s nothing we can do...!"
The pair of snipers, attacking from high above on the chandelier, were much further away than Erika was—too far for Beato to reach.
Furthermore, their position couldn\'t have been worse for Beato, with the entire cathedral inside their range of fire!
"......Too bad nyeh, {f:5:Beatrice}‐samaaa.
 The trials of love are harsh nyeh!
 45, new magazine!!"
"This?"
Gaap handed her the magazine.
......45 always handed them over the wrong way around, so 410 was a bit confused to have one handed to her the right way up...
 ......?!?!
"Nyeh?!
 Nyeh nyeh nyeh,
 let go nyeh, nyeh nyeh nyeh!!"
No matter how distant a position they might take, it was no problem for the elusive Gaap.
Gaap twisted their long ears up, then tickled them with her thumbs.
The Chiester\'s greatest weapon was also their greatest weakness.
The two doubled over with laughter.
"......I\'ve handled these two,
 .....but how many seconds do we have?
 The other Chiesters will be reactivating..."
On the other chandeliers, even more powerful Chiesters were slowly starting to move again......
It would be impossible to buy any more time.
"Ah, Gaap!
 Thanks, I\'m in your debt!!"
"Don\'t forget to thank these guys too."
"Beatoooo, good luuuuuck, hang in theeeeere!!"
"You don\'t have much time!!"
"Erikaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"
Beato cut through the crowd of scampering goats like Moses.
Her goal was straight in front of her.
 The place where Erika and Battler were seated...!
Just then, a red barrier was created, blocking her path.
It was the VIP‐guarding barrier that Gertrude had set up.
{n}She stepped forward and laid out a last line of defense to block Beato\'s way.
"For your attention: Know that you will not be allowed any closer."
"You think a wall like that can stop meeeeeeeeeeeeee?!!"
"How long until the Chiesters {f:5:reactivate}?"
"W‐within 30 seconds..."
As the eldest of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory, Lucifer stood in waiting behind the bride and groom.
She wanted to save Beato.
{n}If she could just distract Gertrude for a moment, the wall would disappear...
However, the Seven Sisters were furniture.
 They served the territory lord.
So, they couldn\'t move to help Beato...
Dlanor glanced over at Lucifer.
{n}There was a coercive tint to her eyes.
"..................You are not allowed to move except by the orders of your {f:5:master}."
"............khh............"
"Who\'s our master...?!"
"It\'s Erika now, idiot...!"
"No, our master is Battler‐sama!"
"True. Erika only speaks on his behalf."
"That\'s right, Onee‐sama! Whose furniture are we?!"
"It\'s just too delicious... I\'m gonna have a nibble!!"
The red, absolute barrier flickered for just an instant.
Beelzebub\'s stake had pierced Gertrude\'s shoulder, and her concentration had wavered.
......But it didn\'t break.
Slowly and expressionlessly, Gertrude turned to look at Lucifer.
"......By whose orders?
 Know that Lady {f:5:Erika} has made no such order."
"We do have orders.
 ...Th‐...the orders of our master!!"
"................................."
"How can a master who cannot speak give orders...?"
"E‐even without a word spoken,
 ......understanding a master\'s will is the job of furniture!!"
"Then, ......it cannot be helped."
The seven stakes shot at Gertrude at once.
...Gertrude had chosen to take all of those direct attacks, refusing to abandon the barrier until the last moment.
Though she was resilient enough to do justice to the name of {ruby:Iron Maiden:Eiserne Jungfrau} and took no damage at all,
 the attack was more than enough to make her flinch and lose control of the barrier.
"Good work, my furniture!!!"
Beato shot through the scattered, red fragments of the barrier,
 ......and she was finally right in front of the bride, her rival, Erika......
However, there stood the final shield protecting Erika.
......Death Sentence Dlanor!!
".........You are {f:5:late}.
 ......Time is already up, Lady {f:5:Beatrice}!!"
"Chiester17, data link to all Chiesters.
 Incoming data from Archangel Satellites. Homing format: verdict‐model conceptual guidance."
"Chiester20, reactivation complete."
"Chiester127, reactivation complete."
"Nihhihihihihi... Time\'s up nyeh.
 Nihhyahahaha!!
 Stop that,
 nooo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}oooo!!"
".........Riiche,
 ......good luck..."
".....................Be...
......a...
......to......"
"......Keh, ......D‐Dlanor...!!"
"Back off, Dlanor A. Knox.
 This is not your fight."
"......I have received a red truth denying you from Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}.
 ......I am afraid that this will become your {f:5:grave}...!"
I don\'t know what {f:5:Bernkastel} has allowed her to say.
{n}However, I don\'t need to sit around and let that longsword tell me.
"I\'ll play with you all you want later.
 But for now, back off!"
There\'s no time.
 The Chiesters have already finished reactivating.
{n}I\'m only living on a bit of borrowed time.
"You will be the one to {f:5:retreat}...!!
 You are the pitiable actor who has chosen the wrong time to appear on {f:5:stage}!!"
Dlanor\'s red longsword cut a large arc of absolute denial,
 ......which headed right for the crown of Beato\'s head.
However, in that instant, there was a thunk, and the sword was knocked slightly off course.
Beato didn\'t let this good fortune go to waste.
She slipped past the longsword,
 ......knocked Dlanor aside,
 ......and finally stood right in front of Erika...!
This time, not a single person stood in her way!
"Uuu...guh...
 ......This is......
{f:5:popcorn}???
 Wh‐where did this come {f:5:from}......?"
"For your attention: Urgent request from the bride\'s security detail!!
 Chiester Sisters Imperial Guards, fire at the intruder immediately!!"
The commotion...quieted......
......However,
 ...no one...
fired.
......Why...?
They could have fired if they wanted to.
All of the Chiester troops had her fully in their sights and had removed their safeties.
Of course, all of them had finished reactivating.
......However,
 ......they hesitated to pull the trigger.
"Wh‐why are you not firing?!
 Ceremony guards, immediately—"
"......W‐......{f:5:wait}.
 ......L‐......look at {f:5:that}......"
Dlanor\'s expression grew grim.
......Then, she quietly...put her red longsword away...
After all, ......Erika would have to make a decision.
If she decided to ignore the thing in front of her, they could shoot to kill.
However, if she picked it up, ......doing so would be unforgivable.
So, they couldn\'t pull the trigger until Erika decided...
"......Why won\'t anyone shoot...?"
"Look closely.
 ......See what Beato just threw at Erika?"
{f:5:Lambdadelta} pointed, still chomping down popcorn.
......It was hard to see from the balcony.
Beato had thrown something like a white handkerchief at Erika.
It had fallen to Erika\'s feet.
......What was that white thing...?
"......She really knows, that girl.
 She knows what it means to be the main character."
"How...
.........interesting......"
".............................."
The thing that had hit Erika in the face and fallen to the floor,
 the item Beato had gotten from Ronove,
 ......was a white glove.
Hitting someone with a glove like that could only mean one thing.
That was.........
"Ooh, Zepar! What\'s this?!
 What does it mean?!"
"This is...
...a request for a duel!!
 If she picks up the glove, it means she\'s accepted!"
"But if she doesn\'t, the Chiesters will do the dirty work for her!
 Why, there\'s no need to pick it up at all!"
"She can choose not to.
 ......However, I imagine that we and all the demons present would spread the word far and wide that she dishonorably ran away from a duel...!!"
""She would be known for eternity as a coward who ran away from a duel of love!!!""
{f:5:Beatrice} waited firmly and composedly.
If Erika just kicked it away...
......then, that very instant,
 ...the Chiesters would probably all fire at once, turning her into golden embroidery.
So, Erika did not have to pick it up.
However, ......she could not afford to be afraid of picking it up.
After all, ......she was the true victor, who had defeated Battler\'s locked‐room trick and logic.
If she was the victor, she should have nothing to fear.
So, ......if she was afraid of doing it,
 ......it would prove that she still felt a tinge of doubt about her victory......
"...............If I don\'t pick it up,
 I can kill you without getting these clothes dirty."
"That would probably liven up your reception.
 ......However, you will pick it up."
"Oh?
 .........And why is that...?"
"......I have brought a wonderful wedding gift just perfect for you.
 ......You will want to know what that is.
 ......Therefore, you\'ll pick it up."
"Not interested. Goodbye."
"......You will pick it up.
 ......For the locked room I have brought you...
.....is one to put Battler\'s guest room to shame—
a locked room that is simple, basic,
 ......and absolutely unsolvable.
 ......And you will want to hear about it."
"............An absolutely...
unsolvable...
......locked room............?"
"......I know that you desire to accept my challenge.
 .........I know that because—"
"................................."
"You are—"
{a:c:
A detective.}
Erika threw off her wedding dress as though it was a cape......
Yes.
 Though she was a bride, a piece, and a witch...
Before any of those, first and foremost—
"I am...a detective.
 .........I acknowledge you as my opponent.
 However, ...are you qualified to participate in this game?
 You {i:have} managed to fix the logic error, I assume...?"
"If you pick that glove up,
 I will prove that I have fixed it in my fight against you."
"...................................."
"..........................."
"<Good>!!"
Ohhhhhhhh!!
The cathedral filled with noise.
 ......Erika...had picked up the glove.
A duel! A duel!!
The cathedral was wrapped in a bizarre excitement.
At Erika\'s nod, Dlanor pushed the crowd away, leaving the pair alone.
......People were permitted to witness this duel.
However, no one would be allowed to hinder it in any way...!
"....................................uuughhh......"
"......It\'s alright, Battler‐san.
 ......I\'ve already found a way to save you."
"H‐
.........how...
...did...
....you......?"
"I\'m going to save you now.
 Please endure just a little longer..."
Beato\'s resolute expression returned, and she grinned boldly, looking down on Erika.
Yes, there could be no doubt.
 ...This was the expression worn only by the Golden Witch,
 ......the majestic presence of the master of locked rooms.
A shadow dashed through the stormy rose garden.
{n}It was incredibly light and swift.
The raindrops never touched him, he made no splashes in the countless puddles, his feet left no tracks in the mud.
That rushing figure.........was Kanon...
Then, he ran up the stairs...
...to the entrance of the mansion.
He did not slow down in the slightest to open the door.
......He ran straight at it as though trying to break through......and leapt into it...!
Though the door was shut, even that couldn\'t stop Kanon.
He slipped through the door, fell into the entranceway, and slowly stood up.
His body wasn\'t even wet.
......And, ......as he recalled those nostalgic days spent serving the Ushiromiya family, which would never come again,
 ......he ran once more.
He was heading for Battler\'s guest room.
He ran past the servant room,
 through the entrance hall,
 and past the door to the parlor.
Then, the doors to the kitchen and the dining hall came into sight...
All of it brings back fond memories.
......There was the honor and discipline of serving Kinzo directly.
However, that man wasn\'t strict all the time.
......When the family was out of sight and he didn\'t have to preserve that air of majesty,
 his face could turn unbelievably childish, and he would sometimes ask me to take part in strange pranks.
.........The Master let me shoot lots of guns, didn\'t he...
...That......was pretty fun.
Krauss‐sama was actually surprisingly kind.
He must have gotten the impression that the Master bullied me a lot.
Whenever I was the only one around, he would talk to me in a very familiar way, almost as if he was a classmate of mine.
......I sort of regret that I held back and never did anything but nod in return...
Madam was a really strict person...
......Ever since a rumor spread about her being strict on female servants but soft towards male servants,
 I get the feeling she viewed me as an enemy.
However, she was also a woman to be pitied.
......On many occasions when she was alone, I saw her shoulders sagging from her burdens.
There were a lot of servants, weren\'t there...
{n}......Some lasted a short while, others longer.
Genji‐sama is the one person fit to be called my father.
......I am both grateful and resentful towards him over many things.
......Over time, all those feelings mixed together, cancelled out, and left me with a neutral emotion.
In that case, Kumasawa‐san could probably be called my mother.
......She\'s helped me out so many times.
I always wanted to repay her someday,
 ......and now I\'ve lost that chance for all time.
Shannon...
......is my big sister.
Without her, I wouldn\'t have been able to be me.
Thanks for teaching me that the ocean is blue......
......Gohda?
 .........I hate that guy.
Still, when I complimented his servant stew,
 he would sometimes turn red and tell me there was enough for seconds.
 ......I didn\'t dislike that part of him.
I wonder why such strong memories popped up in the short time it took me to ran past the dining hall...
And then,
 ......my memories of Jessica.
......Ooh.
 ......S‐so you\'re a boy servant...
{n}......How......old are you...?
I think those were the first words she spoke to me.
......Come to think about it, she was probably interested in me ever since then.
We really did......have enough time to build up a love that could have competed with the love between George‐sama and Shannon.
But since I could only see the gray sea, I wasted almost all of that time.
What does she like about me?
{n}What do I like about her?
I get the feeling we were never really able to clarify that for ourselves.
......No, she told me.
There\'s nothing wrong with spending more time together to eventually find that out.
......The reasons for love could have come later on.
......It took me...
far too long...
to realize that.
.........Now, I think I can accept it.
I know why Shannon won the duel.
God must have been watching.
You had so much more courage than I did, and God didn\'t abandon you......
I reached the hallway with the guest rooms.
{n}......There was someone lying on the ground.
It was Battler.
 ......He was lying just outside the guest room, a chain tied to his neck.
......He had probably struggled to do something with the chain lock from the outside until he lost consciousness...
His fingernails on both hands had been torn off, and they were stained with blood.
......I could tell at a glance just how hard he had tried until the final moment when his heart had died.
The collar binding him wouldn\'t disappear unless the chain lock was set.
"......Battler‐sama...
 .........It\'s alright.
 ...I\'m going to save you now......"
".................................ah..."
Battler responded faintly.
He\'d probably never imagined that help would come to this eternal locked room.
......He was so scared that this might be an auditory hallucination brought about by his fleeting delusions...
...that he couldn\'t be easily roused...
Kanon grabbed Battler from behind and dragged him into the room...
The inside of the room......was terrible.
The windows had been brutally shattered, and the wind and rain had made its way into the room.
All kinds of tools and furniture lay broken there.
However, Battler hadn\'t smashed them out of rage.
The curtain had been removed and torn to shreds which had been twisted together.
......He had turned it into a rope,
 probably while experimenting to see if he could use it for some trick.
He had tried using everything in the room, exploring all possible options of escape.
The traces could be seen throughout the room, and even in the bathroom.
......The empty bathtub was stained with just a bit of blood,
 ......and the nippers lay there on the bottom.
To protect this tale,
 ......he had nearly been prepared...
......to accept {f:5:Bernkastel}\'s brutal method of escape...
and cut himself into pieces...
...while washing himself down the drain.
He was even willing to tear apart his own body.
.........To protect the game Beato had entrusted him with,
 ......he had probably questioned himself over and over in this bathtub, wondering if there was any other way out.
......By the clock of the game world, not even a single day had passed.
......However, just how many years had that lasted in the locked room of the logic error?
When faced with an endless span of time, any way of ending it, no matter how cruel, is tempting.
.........However, he had rejected that until the very end.
And...
...even in the last moment when his heart had died,
 ......he had wanted so much to show his iron will to escape from this locked room...
.........that he had chosen to fall here in the corridor,
 ......with the chain still around his neck...
".........Battler‐sama.
 ......It\'s Kanon.
 ......Please, come to your senses..."
He wiped Battler\'s face with a towel wetted in the sink.
In response to that cold sensation, Battler\'s heart slowly started beating again...
"............Ah...
 .........
 .........K‐
............Kanon‐kun,
 ......is that you...?"
"Yes, it\'s me, Kanon.
 ......You did well...
......to endure until today."
"Heh...heheh......
 ......Looks like...
 I slept in...
...just a little too...
...much......"
Battler realized that the feel of the towel on his neck meant that the cursed collar and chain were gone.
"There\'s no longer anything binding you here.
 ......Come on.
 Please, head back quickly."
".........B‐
......but...
...if I unset that chain lock,
 ......that chain will come back..."
"Don\'t worry.
 No longer does any chain exist to bind you, Battler‐sama.
 ......I will remain here."
"What......did you say......?"
By now, Battler knew the terror of this eternal locked room better than anyone else.
So, his happiness at being able to leave was overwhelmed by his shock at the determination of this room\'s new prisoner...
"I will be fine.
 There is no need to worry."
"......B‐
......but......"
"Battler‐sama, isn\'t there still something you have to do...?"
".........I...
...I......"
"Go back, quickly.
 ......There is someone fighting in your place.
 And there is someone awaiting your return.
 .........Will you do it again?
 ......Not come back?"
His stern words and gaze......shot straight through Battler.
"......Are......you sure?"
"Yes.
 ......That will be fine.
 This way, I can repay my debt from back then."
"......Debt?
 Do you owe me something?"
"It isn\'t a debt I have with you, Battler‐sama.
 ......It\'s okay, so go.
 I don\'t like keeping debts.
 .........Go, quickly.
 ...You must not keep her waiting this time.
 ......So, quickly."
Battler couldn\'t argue back anymore.
He silently bowed his head, ......unset the chain, and opened the door.
Kanon had remained in the room, so no chain appeared about Battler\'s neck.
......He could leave this locked room just by running out...
The happy‐sounding voices that he had heard at the far end of the corridor...
...had been replaced with an excited chatter.
There must have been some sort of strange disturbance going on.
As Kanon went out into the corridor to see me off,
 ......the merciless collar and chain had already captured their new prisoner.
He would remain inside this eternal locked room......in Battler\'s place......
".........Kanon‐kun.
 I feel the same."
"About what?"
"I......don\'t like keeping debts.
 ......I\'ll definitely repay you.
 And I\'ll do it soon."
"......I hope I can count on that...
 Go on. Run.
 ......Run to the one you love.
 And please, never get lost again...!!"
Battler would not turn around any longer.
 He ran with everything he had.
He ran out into the corridor, whose warmth he had cursed so many times.
{n}That cursed chain no longer bound him.
He ran to the end of the corridor and beyond,
 ......beyond the light......
Kanon, still connected to the chain,
 .........watched him go, then quietly returned to the guest room.
Now, he only had to worry about his own job.
Stay in this room...
...and fix the error in logic.
".........Now,
 ......I set the chain lock..."
As soon as he set it, the chain disappeared from his neck.
......Now, if he hid in the closet, the one place Erika hadn\'t checked...
.........the broken logic would be fixed...
The closet door opened slowly.
It was well‐oiled, and opened without a sound.
......It was cramped inside, and dark.
This tiny space......is the final place for me.
{n}As long as I remain hidden in here, the logic will be preserved.
".........That\'s an easy job.
 ......Easier than caring for the roses."
Kanon entered the closet......and closed the double doors from the inside.
......As soon as he did,
 ......a small gold butterfly appeared,
 ......melted into the darkness of the closet, and vanished.
It must have been a sign that the logic had been fixed.
The witch\'s game had already stopped, and the clock of the world of the pieces would never tick again.
So, for all eternity,
 ......no one...
would come to save him from this place.
"That\'s okay.
 .........This way, ......I\'ve paid back my debt.
 {f:5:Beatrice}."
The power of the gold butterfly brooch taught me about love.
{n}In the third game, it gave me some quiet time alone with Jessica.
......I get the feeling it did many other small things for me.
{n}At any rate, ......now I\'ve paid back all of my debts.
{n}I owe nothing to anyone, and no one owes anything to me.
.........That music tape Jessica lent me.
 ......I never gave that back, did I...
That\'s okay, isn\'t it, Jessica......?
I liked that one.
Can I keep it as a present...?
......No, but you\'ll make a copy for me...?
Ha......hahahahahaha......
 .....................
 .........
Slowly,
 ......Kanon\'s body began to melt...
...into a cloud of gold butterflies......
And, ......after the inside of the cramped, dark closet glittered like a golden planetarium,
 ......it faded away like the light of fireflies,
 ......and was painted over with a pitch blackness.
...............For all eternity.........
In the cathedral, the goat attendees.........were all jostling around either side of the red carpet.
On the red carpet,
 .........standing across from each other,
 ......were Beato and Erika.
In their hands......were the dueling pistols given to them by Zepar and Furfur.
"Flintlocks, are they?
 How old‐fashioned."
"Pay it no mind.
 Demons are very particular about style."
Its form was similar to an actual old‐fashioned gun, but this was, of course, a demon\'s gun.
This wasn\'t a gun that would propel a lead bullet with an explosion caused by gunpowder.
......Like the pistols used in the duel between Shannon and Kanon, whose bullets had contained a magic that would always kill,
 these pistols also had bullets that were not made of lead...
"......Beato......"
"There\'s no need to worry.
 She\'ll win easily, and you\'ll have to deal with her insults again, Lia."
"When this match is over, we should ask to be paid every now and then.
 ......When the fight is finished with, I would like to take a trip down to the Caribbean sometime."
"Enough talk about "when the fight is over"...
 That\'s an ill omen before a duel."
"Beato! Take this seriously!!
 This is no time to be standing around laughing!"
"Why is Riiche relaxed and Lia tense? You two..."
"All together...!"
"""{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, you can do it!!"""
"......{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama is at a disadvantage in this duel."
"Why...?!"
"......Normally, a witch can put up a fight by piling mystery upon mystery.
 However, since the game has been suspended, she has nothing on her side except the mystery of Battler‐sama\'s guest room."
"If Erika can just strike a blue wedge through that one mystery, it\'ll mean that she\'s solved everything!!"
"We can win.
 ......I believe in {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama...
...and Battler‐sama,
 ......our two masters...!"
"......Did you call {f:5:me}?"
"Thanks."
"......?"
"For once,
 ......it feels as though our chances for winning are fifty‐fifty.
 So I\'d like to thank you beforehand."
"It is simply my {f:5:job}.
 There is no need to thank {f:5:me}."
"...........................
 ......In the last game,
 ......when you protected me after my pathetic defeat,
 ......I was touched."
"That was the first time in my life that anyone had ever protected me.
 ......Even my master has never done so.
 All she gave me was a way to negate the pain of naked truth by laying bare the truths of others...
and causing them just as much pain."
".....................
 ......Please, forgive my {f:5:arrogance}.
 ......I felt that I needed to protect {f:5:you}.
 ......As soon as I realized what fragile truth you live by,
 and how much it has been violently abused by fiction that sounds more plausible,
 ......I wanted to protect {f:5:you}."
"Thank you.
 .........Our time together was short, but you were a wonderful partner."
"And I will remain {f:5:so}."
"......You\'re right.
 Once we\'ve defeated her, let\'s make tons of mysteries on this island together.
 I\'ll have you solve them, and tease you as we play.
 ......How does that sound?"
"......It sounds {f:5:interesting}.
 I am looking forward to your {f:5:challenge}."
"Ah, no, sorry.
 I take that back.
 ......That\'d be one of those loser flags, wouldn\'t it?"
"Pft—"
""*giggle*giggle*giggle*, ahahahahaha.""
""Now, are you ready, duelists?!!""
When the two demons clapped their hands, the duelists instantly returned to their bold, tense smiles.
"The bullets to be loaded into those magic guns are not lead!"
"A shootout between mystery and fantasy should be fought with bullets of red and blue truth!!"
"As long as you possess truth, your bullets are endless!"
"However, being hit by a single one means instant death!"
""Are you both prepared?!""
"Naturally."
"Of course."
""Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}, the great and powerful Witch of Certainty and member of the glorious Senate!!
 Please come forward!!
 Will you swear to oversee this duel?!!""
"Of course.
 I swear it."
The crowd split, and {f:5:Lambdadelta} walked forward with {f:5:Bernkastel} by her side.
She looked between the faces of the two duelists.
Then, ......she took out an envelope with the seal of the One‐winged Eagle...and lifted it high.
"{f:5:Beatrice} has sent me her revisions to the tale inside a sealed envelope.
 I have inspected it and find its contents to be valid.
 I declare the logic error averted!!
 The chain lock is still set!
 And without any contradictions with any red truth made up to this point!"
*chatter*chatter*chatter*...!!
......The many goat attendees knew the details of Battler\'s locked room.
They realized how difficult it was.
And, though fiery debates had swept across the crowd during the reception,
 no one had been able to find an answer.
And now......it was clear that {f:5:Beatrice} had already reached one.
"Therefore, this duel is legitimate.
 It will center around one, single point.
 The locked room of Battler\'s guest room!
 Ushiromiya Battler disappeared from within a locked room sealed by a chain lock!"
"Erika will load her weapon with blue truth regarding this matter.
 {f:5:Beatrice} will load hers with red truth to counter back.
 ......The duel will continue until one side is victorious!!"
"Splendid."
"Perfect."
"OK.
 Well then, Beato.
 Present your new, revised tale and riddle to Erika."
"The cousins\' room was also a locked room.
 Kanon used magic to escape from there without breaking the seals.
 He then arrived at Battler\'s locked room and used magic to allow Battler to escape."
".........Hmph,
 what a foolish tale."
"Good.
 Erika, is there anything you wish to confirm?"
"Repetition requested.
 "The one who rescued Battler was, without a doubt, Kanon.""
"Very well.
 {p:1:The one who rescued Battler was, without a doubt, Kanon}."
"Repetition requested.
 "Battler and Kanon are different people.""
"Very well.
 {p:1:Battler and Kanon are different people}."
"......Hmph.
 That\'s enough."
"Erika, are you done confirming things?"
"That was all I needed.
 I\'ve already decided how to fight."
"OK!
 Let both sides load their bullets...!!"
Erika turned around, pressed her finger against the barrel of the pistol,
 ......made her blue truth into a bullet, and pushed it in.
There was no rule saying that she had to turn away, but she didn\'t want her expression to be read.
......Or, it might have been because she couldn\'t stand the tension of looking at Beato\'s bold smile.
Beato had already finished loading her red truth.
She waited for Erika to finish while calmly puffing on her pipe.
Then, ......she looked at Battler, who sat on the throne of the territory lord, right next to the two witches who sat as witnesses to this duel.
.........Battler\'s consciousness was still hazy.
However, he apparently understood that Beato had come to duel for his sake, so that he could be saved.
It was all he could do to just look at Beato with those sluggish eyes,
 ......but a flood of emotions passed between them.
......There was no need for words.
{n}A look was enough for them now.
Erika closed her eyes tightly, .........her finger still up against the barrel.
At that moment, her stunning powers of concentration made all the distractions of the outside world disappear.
......<Good>.
My concentration is as sharp as ever.
Are you ready, me? Furudo...Erika.
First, let\'s lay out the situation.
Battler disappeared from that locked room.
{n}The chain lock is set.
Did he disappear by magic?
 Of course not!
 There has to be a trick!
Kanon didn\'t save him with magic.
He just came, took Battler\'s place, and set the chain.
......Everyone knows that much!
The problem is what comes next.
 No, it\'s actually what comes before.
Kanon was in the cousins\' room in the guesthouse.
That room was completely sealed with duct tape, and it has been proven that the seal was in effect until the time of the logic error.
In other words, Kanon escaped from a locked room that was absolute, with no excuses or twisted logic possible.
<Good>!
 This is why she called it a simple yet ultimate locked room.
.........How did he escape from the perfect locked room known as the cousins\' room?
Heheh.
 If I fixated on that question, I\'d be no better than your average kid detective.
......That room is a perfect locked room, so {i:there is no way to escape}.
In other words, trying to think of ways that Kanon could have escaped from the cousins\' room is simply a waste of time!
The real question......is how Kanon...
could have been somewhere other than the cousins\' room at the time it was sealed.
The cousins\' room is a completely sealed can.
{n}If he was in there when it was sealed, then it\'s already game over.
That means, ......he was already outside it at the time it was sealed!
I checked everyone\'s location at the time of sealing the rooms.
{n}That check I performed must be suspect.
At that time, I had just been inside the next room over...
and confirmed the presence of five people there with my own eyes.
Hideyoshi,
 George,
 Kumasawa,
 Shannon,
 Nanjo.
......I specifically listed the names of those five people when performing the location check for that room and received confirmation that they were in there.
Then, I checked to see whether "everyone else" was in the cousins\' room...and had that confirmed for me as well.
I said "everyone", so whether he was Kanon or Yoshiya or even Purupurupiko‐Man,
 they all should have been sealed in the cousins\' room.
It seems perfect.
However, though that word "everyone" seems perfect,
 ......something\'s fishy!
The exact definition of that phrase "everyone else"...
is "all people whose names I did not mention directly".
In other words, there are exceptions!
For example,
 ......it\'s been confirmed that Hideyoshi and George were in the next room over.
So, humans with the name Hideyoshi or George...
{i:don\'t need to be inside the cousins\' room}!
It seems that Kanon told Jessica that his real name was Yoshiya,
 ......but that was no red truth.
In other words, .........what if Kanon\'s real name is the same as one of those in the next room over?!
They seem to be about the same age, so let\'s use George.
So, what if there were two Georges in that room?!
That doesn\'t violate the red truth saying that...
Hideyoshi, George, Kumasawa, Shannon, and Nanjo are in the next room over.
Let\'s say that Kanon\'s real name was Tanaka George.
Both Ushiromiya George and Tanaka George could exist in that room at the same time!
In other words, ......there were six humans with five names!
It looked to my eyes as though there were only five people in the next room over, but a sixth person, Kanon, was hiding somewhere.
I don\'t have the detective\'s authority, so it wouldn\'t be that difficult for him to fool my eyes and hide.
I see, the double name trick......
{n}Stupid, so stupid...!!
Alright, I\'ve made my logic!!
Kanon, who was hiding in the next room over, not the cousins\' room, left by the window after the seals were placed—
Bang!!
"Ah, ......owww......"
There was an explosion at the barrel of her gun, staining the tip of her finger red with blood.
{n}The blue truth gunpowder had exploded.
......Ah,
 ......dammit......
......I...
...had Dlanor seal that one...
...a short while ago......
I told her to "ban any blue truth arguing about the windows of the next room over",
 so I can\'t use it......!!!
"......Oh, an accidental discharge?
 Careful now, guns can be dangerous.
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*."
"Sh‐shut up!!
 It\'s just a little mistake...!!"
"............The windows of the next room over.
 You blocked them off with some inane trick, I hear. Gaap told me."
"D‐......did she, now?
 And so what if I did?!"
"Dlanor. Remove that foolish seal.
 *cackle*cackle*, that seal is now your shackle."
Beato has figured out everything I\'ve been thinking.
And she\'s acting so confident, telling me to go ahead and use that argument...!
"......Lady {f:5:Erika}."
"P‐......please remove it.
 ......That fool,
 ...I\'ll make her regret this...!!"
""It seems you are ready, duelists!!
 Please face each other with your pistols.""
""Then fire with the sparks of truth!!""
After facing away and readying herself one last time, Erika spun around.
Beato had been facing her since the beginning.
 She had a confident, challenging smile, as if she\'d been kept waiting.
Then, without any signal, the two slowly raised their guns...
...pointing the red and blue glints that hid within their barrels at each other.
"Come. I could do with a little fun."
"......Begin!!!"
"First is how Kanon escaped from the cousins\' room.
 ......I\'ll use that as my bullet!"
"Hoh, so you\'ll start from there.
 ......Let\'s have it.
 Hold nothing back!"
"Here I go!!"
After holding the gun high and pointing it at Beato once more,
 Erika pulled the trigger with statements of red and blue truth.
"{p:1:The cousins\' room is guaranteed to be a perfect locked room until the end}.
 {p:2:So, if Kanon really had been in that room, it would have been impossible for him to escape!
 In other words, Kanon was not in the cousins\' room at the time it was sealed!!
 Kanon\'s name is an alias.
 His real name is still unknown!
 If his name happened to be the same as anyone in the next room over, that wouldn\'t contradict the check on who was in that room.
 In other words, it\'s possible for him to be in the next room over, not the cousins\' room}!!"
The goat attendees chattered and clapped their hands in realization.
{n}......As if to say, "Of course! I didn\'t think of that!"
Ah, I love watching this.
{n}I love being surrounded by this chatter.
{n}......After all, ......I am a detective!!
"{p:1:It is true that the next room over was sealed,
 but at the time of the logic error, only the doors were checked to see whether the seals were preserved}.
 {p:2:Therefore, there is a chance that the window seals were broken.
 Kanon was in the next room over, and he escaped through that window}...!!
 That is all!!!"
Any other theory would be impossible!!
If this doesn\'t work,
 ......then there\'s no truth left!!
As soon as she said "that is all", both of them fired at the same time.
......After the blast rang out,
 ......it was Erika\'s gun that fell to the floor...
Beato\'s red bullet had knocked Erika\'s gun from her hands.
Was it......arrogance, or confidence?
If she had just aimed that bullet at Erika\'s heart, the whole thing would have been over...
Beato had missed on purpose.
There was a confident smile on her face.
{n}It was as though she was offering to play with Erika a little longer.
......In fact, that was Beato through and through.
{f:5:Beatrice}, the witch who mocks others with unsolvable locked room tricks...!
"{p:1:At the time the next room over was sealed,
 Hideyoshi, George, Kumasawa, Shannon, and Nanjo were in it.
 And the number of people in the next room over was five.
 No one existed there except for those to whom those five names refer!
 Every name has just one person that it belongs to, and no one can go by a name that is not theirs}!!"
"............uu...
...gkk...
...
............!!"
It was a thoroughly merciless red truth...
 It really was...severe......
Now that it had been limited to five people, any leeway for Kanon hiding there had been completely denied.
Since only those to whom those five names referred existed within the room,
 Erika couldn\'t even make a new theory by suggesting that one person held two names, so that the five names referred to only four people,
 and allowing for Kanon to sneak in even though his name wasn\'t on the list.
Furthermore, the part about how "every name has just one person that it belongs to, and no one can go by a name that is not theirs" was a fatal blow that cut down countless theories...!
"......Come to think of it, you only know the half‐sleeping me from the last game, don\'t you...?
 What do you think, Erikaaa?
 ......How do you like the game of the Golden Wiiiiiiiiiitch...???"
"That\'s insane...
 ......A‐......are you saying...
......that Kanon slipped out of the room by magic......?!
 Ghh, ......gkk......
 ......M‐more importantly,
 why did you only knock my gun away...?!!"
"The human side must crush all of the witch\'s riddles, whereas the witch side need only crush the human\'s theories once.
 ......Don\'t you find that unfair?
 So, I decided to have it be even."
"......E‐......eveeeeeeeen......?"
"I\'ve decided that I\'ll make my victory condition be the destruction of all of your theories.
 ......I\'ve won the riddle of Kanon\'s escape, but there\'s one more!
 Let\'s return to the first battleground, where you gave Battler so much trouble!!"
When Beato snapped her fingers, that guest room of Battler\'s was reconstructed.
She meant to fight once more in the room that had threatened Battler with a logic error, determined to settle things once and for all.
"Erika, pick up your gun.
 ......We\'ll have this room be your coffin!"
".........I say the same to you!!
 I\'ll make you regret...
...ever giving me this chance!!"
"Witness.
 I permit Erika to use X."
"......X?
 A basis which doesn\'t need to be explained?
 So, what are you going to let her do?"
"I relieve Erika of her obligation to explain how Kanon escaped from his locked room...
and permit her to involve him in blue truths concerning this "guest room trick" without explanation."
If a theory for explaining how Kanon saved Battler...
did not also explain how Kanon escaped from his own locked room, it would have no basis.
Erika had already lost that basis.
......Beato was giving her a handicap by saying that she didn\'t need to explain that part.
"N‐......naturally!!
 You\'ve already used the red truth to guarantee that Kanon saved Battler!
 It\'s only natural that I be given this privilege...!"
Erika faced away again and concentrated even harder...!
As though twisting the knob on a radio, she turned all noise and idle thoughts down to zero.
Let\'s go, Furudo Erika.
Detective, Furudo Erika!
As long as Kanon reaches this place, rescuing Battler isn\'t hard.
The trick is as follows.
Kanon used some kind of escape trick X to reach the front of the guest room.
While I was busy in the bathroom, ......Battler left the closet.
Battler undid the chain lock.
Battler went outside.
Kanon entered in his place.
Kanon set the chain lock.
Kanon went into the closet. The end!
......This satisfies the two red truths about the chain lock being set and Battler\'s absence.
And, in exchange for this escape trick, Kanon remains inside the guest room.
......There\'s no room for argument on how tightly this room can act as a locked room.
That chain is cursed.
In this demonic locked room, one person must remain as a sacrifice for it to be acceptable.
......However, is such a simple theory really enough......?
The rescuer switched places with him.
And the rescuer is hiding in the closet.
No other sort of theory is possible.
{n}And yet, Beato thinks she can win.
{n}In that case, ......does some other trick exist...?
It\'s impossible!
I swear on the history of the mystery genre that there\'s absolutely, definitely,
 categorically no other way!!
But I\'d never be able to call myself a detective if I gave in here!!
Consider, imagine, don\'t stop thinking...
 That\'s how you drive blue wedges into witches!!
......One thing I can think of......yes.
A wordplay trick!
It can only be some kind of "wordplay"...
...that just barely slips through the net of words spoken in red...!
In that case, I\'ll crush all possibilities!
{n}I\'ll crush them all with repetition requests!!
This final duel......has already begun, even though we haven\'t pulled our triggers yet...!!
"Repetition requested.
 "At the time Battler was rescued, only Kanon entered the guest room.""
"I acknowledge it.
 {p:1:At the time Battler was rescued, only Kanon entered the guest room}.
 I believe that was the whole point..."
"Repetition requested.
 "From the time I entered the room to the time of the logic error, Battler, Kanon, and I were the only ones who entered or exited the room.""
"{p:1:I acknowledge it.
 From the time you entered the room to the time of the logic error, you, Battler, and Kanon were the only ones who went in or out of the guest room}."
"Repetition requested.
 "This refers to three people.""
"{p:1:I acknowledge it.
 It refers to three people: you, Battler, and Kanon}."
"Confirming definition.
 Can I accept "three people" to mean the number of bodies?
 You\'re saying that three bodies went in or out of the room, right?"
I\'ve had enough of things being mixed about with names and numbers of people.
{n}I want this point to be clear...!
"{p:1:Of course.
 Three people—in other words, three bodies—went in or out.
 Only you and Kanon entered, and only Battler left.
 It has already been said in red that every name has just one person that it belongs to, and no one can go by a name that is not theirs.
 Therefore, for each of the names "Erika", "Battler", and "Kanon", only that single person can go by that name}."
"Repetition requested.
 "I am not the rescuer.""
"{p:1:Of course}!
 You are the detective, are you not?
 Worry not, I will respect that!"
"Confirming definition.
 How do you define "rescuer"?"
This is also important.
{n}I want to immediately remove the possibility that I rescued him accidentally.
"{p:1:A "rescuer" means someone who reset the chain lock after Battler undid it.
 It does not matter whether they intended to save Battler or not}."
Since she said "after Battler undid the chain lock", it\'s impossible for this to have occurred before I set foot in the room.
After that point in time, I would not undo the chain "for all eternity".
After all, the game was suspended at that point.
Therefore, it\'s impossible for me to have been the rescuer accidentally.
More, I can boil it down even more......
The chain can only be set from the inside.
{n}It\'s impossible for a person to escape on their own.
Therefore, we know that Battler didn\'t escape by himself.
And I\'m not the rescuer.
{n}Only Kanon can be the rescuer.
Plus, Beato has already said that Kanon is the rescuer in the red truth.
......There\'s nothing to doubt.
There\'s no room for anyone but Kanon to be involved.
......At least, so far!
"Repetition requested.
 "The definition of "going in or out" is "crossing the boundary between the guest room and the area outside it.""
"{p:1:I acknowledge it}."
"Repetition requested.
 "The phrase "guest room" includes all of:
 the bedroom,
 the bathroom,
 and the closet.""
"{p:1:I acknowledge it}.
 I\'ve no intention of wriggling out of this by saying the closet isn\'t part of the guest room."
"Confirming definition.
 The inside of the guest room is divided into three sections: the bedroom, the bathroom, and the closet."
"{p:1:I also recognize it as such.
 Furthermore, you have already confirmed with the red truth that two of those sections, the bedroom and the bathroom,
 had no one hiding in them}."
"Repetition requested.
 "There is someone in the closet.""
"I decline."
"Why\'s that?!
 Because Kanon is hiding there?!"
"Kanon can use magic.
 It\'s true that he hid himself in the closet for a time, but he then immediately vanished with his magic...!
 So, there is no one in the closet!
 I cannot respond!"
"I request for that to be repeated instead!!"
"Fool, the witch side has no obligation to explain how they did things with magic!"
......No, it\'s completely obvious.
{n}There\'s no way she can say that Kanon disappeared with magic using the red truth!
After all, magic doesn\'t exist!!
But......is this......enough?!
......I\'ve gone through every last minor detail.
{n}And yet, there\'s an uncanny lack of dubious points.
I can\'t imagine that there\'s any room for anything to go any differently from the theory I\'ve had since the beginning.
Kanon must be in the closet.
He has to be.
 There\'s no way he isn\'t!
I\'ll say it again!
This locked room can only be escaped from by switching places with a rescuer.
If Kanon tried to escape as well, another rescuer would be needed.
However, no rescuer exists for Kanon!
Battler "escaped", so it\'s impossible for it to be him.
{n}And I won\'t undo the chain "for all eternity"!
The people who have gone in and out of the room have been confirmed both by name and number of people!
......Which means...
...my theory...
...is set in stone.
First, here are the details of the situation that are certain!
{p:1:The game ended while I was inside the guest room,
 so I did not undo the chain lock that I had previously set.}
{p:1:So, it can\'t be that he escaped behind my back after I left the room.}
{p:1:Furthermore, the chain lock was set at the same time I entered the room.
{n}No one could have left the room during the few seconds between the time I entered and the time I set the chain lock.}
{p:1:I sealed the guest room at the time I examined Battler\'s "corpse",
 so until I came again and broke the seals, it was absolutely impossible for anyone to go in or out.}
{p:1:Therefore, it\'s certain that Battler was hiding somewhere inside the guest room at the time that I entered it.}
{p:1:The only chance Battler had to escape was after I broke the seals.}
{p:1:To be even more specific, he had no chance to escape except for the time I was in the bathroom}.
By the above premises, Battler\'s trick to escape with the chain still set is as follows!
{p:2:For the aforementioned reasons, the only one who could have set the chain lock, which can only be set from the inside, and allowed Battler\'s escape...
is Kanon, the only person to enter the room except for me and Battler!}
{p:2:After Kanon entered the room, he set the chain,
 hid in the one place that he could hide inside the guest room, the closet—}
.........Ah?!
Whoa, that was close!!
They almost got me... They almost tricked me!!
I thought that I had cornered him in the closet.
It\'s the opposite!!
{i:They\'re} trying to make {i:me} think he\'s in the closet!
What was the order in which I searched the guest room?!
First, the bedroom.
{n}We confirmed with the red that there was nothing there.
Then, the bathroom.
{n}We confirmed with the red that there was nothing there.
That\'s it right there!!
{i:When we examined the bedroom}, there was nothing there.
However, while I was investigating the bathroom,
 ......Kanon slipped out of the closet,
 and {i:hid again} somewhere in the bedroom!
In other words, the guarantee that no one was in the bedroom...was torn apart after just one minute...!
I\'ve spotted it!!
{n}This is the witch\'s trap, an attempt to lure me into thinking that Kanon\'s in the closet...!
The place he\'s really hiding......is the bedroom...!!
"Heh,
 .........*giggle*...
...*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!
 ......I\'ve found it...
 ......I\'ve finally found it...
 ......Your...
trick...!!"
"...................................."
That was a close one.
If I\'d gone and said there was nowhere to hide except inside the closet,
 she\'d have said, "too bad, the closet is empty!"
Huh? ......N‐no, wait...
It works the same way in reverse......
I see, now I get it...
{n}It\'s an interchangeable logic trick...!
Damn that Beato... So, in resolving the logic error, she\'s discovered this strange trick!!
If I only notice the closet, she\'ll have Kanon hide under the bed.
And if I only notice the bed, she\'ll have Kanon hide in the closet.
Both are correct, and yet choosing either one means losing.
{n}I have to expose both at the same time, or it isn\'t checkmate...!
Incredible......
{n}I\'ve never heard of such an unfair trick......
If this was a magician\'s stage trick, it\'d just be a cheap one.
If it was a mystery, ...it\'d just be cheating......
However, in this witch\'s game, it\'s a legitimate...
...“logic trick”...
In chess, it\'d be called a double check.
No, a discovered attack.
 ......No no, a discovered double checkmate......?
Even though this sort of logic would be a foul trick in the mystery genre,
 ......in this world where witches wage war with mystery,
 ............what a...regal position it is......
The beautiful placement of the black pieces cornering my white king...
...feels almost like art,
 ......a work of such beauty that if I were a god in the age of myth,
 I might wish to display it in the sky as a constellation......
That beauty...
......even brought tears...
to my eyes......
......For the first time,
 ......I feel honored...
...to have been allowed to participate as a human in a game of truth against a witch.
And, ironically,
 ............it taught me, a person who has always believed that there is only one truth, that truth isn\'t necessarily always singular.
If I just broaden my perspective, I can see a completely different truth.
......And though each of those truths are "true", ......both are incorrect if they are all you can see......
............In my life until now, just how many truths have I turned my eyes away from...
......because I was blinded by some trivial truth......?
...............This is...
......the truth...
of the world......
"......Because of our arrogance in thinking that only one truth exists,
 ......whenever we find one truth, we are blinded to all others.
 ............Thank you, {f:5:Beatrice}‐san.
 .........I never thought...
...that a witch...
...would be the one to teach me the true nature of this world."
".............................."
Slowly,
 ......with a soft and gentle motion,
 like a flower opening...
...with the morning dew dripping down its side,
 .........Erika raised her gun...
"I am the victor.
 I\'ve seen through your double check."
"............Then come."
"......
{p:2:‘Battler\'s guest room disappearance trick’ is as follows.
 ......While I searched the room, Battler was hiding in the closet.
 Then, during the disturbance in the bathroom, he unset the chain and escaped from the room.
 At that time, Kanon was waiting for him in the hallway.
 Kanon entered the guest room in his place and set the chain.
 This is the trick to Battler\'s disappearance}."
"{p:2:......And, afterwards,
 .........he hid in the bedroom.
 This happened after I checked to see that there was no one unexpected in the bedroom, so it is valid.
 In this way, Kanon the rescuer concealed himself in the bedroom}."
Erika\'s blue bullet flew in a strange arc,
 became a wedge of the blue truth, and pierced straight down through the bed and the floor beneath.
Beato didn\'t pull her trigger.
......However, she did quietly argue back with the red truth.
"{p:1:Kanon does not exist in the bedroom}."
The goat attendees gasped.
It had appeared as though Erika had been defeated, denied by the red truth.
......To goats who can\'t see more than a single truth, it probably looks as though I\'ve lost...
"Pft, ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...
 Next is the real one.
 ......This is the answer from a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} capable of understanding multiple truths.
 ............It looks like the tale of fantasy will end with the second twilight.
 ......So, why don\'t I carry out the remaining twilights...
...and open the door to the Golden Land.
 .........If you are to disappear,
 then it should be surrounded by your golden roses...!"
The fires of blue truth flashed at Erika\'s feet...
...and she loaded a blue truth bullet once more.
That overflowing blue power was now making her entire gun burn with a blue flame......
She wasn\'t aiming for Beato.
 She was aiming behind Beato.
.........At the closet...!!
"Now that the bedroom has been denied, you\'ve nowhere left to run!!
 Diii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}iiiee, Kanooo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}oonnn!!"
The five wedges of blue truth she released grazed Beato\'s cheeks, hair, and shoulders,
 ......then pin‐cushioned the door to the closet,
 to gouge whatever human was inside to death......!
The five wedges slammed into the door in a vertical line.
 In other words...
On the fourth twilight, gouge the head and kill.
{n}On the fifth twilight, gouge the chest and kill.
{n}On the sixth twilight,
 on the seventh twilight,
 on the eighth twilight...
{n}Gouge and kill and kill and kill...!!
......After being gouged by so many thick and sharp wedges,
 ......the human inside wouldn\'t stand a chance......
".............................."
"......This is the truth I\'ve exposed.
 ......That is all!"
When she proclaimed that she had finished, the five blue wedges piercing the closet disappeared.
However, the many large, splintered holes left behind showed that it had indeed been pierced......
Then, ......as though this had concluded the ceremony that led to the Golden Land,
 ......the space that was the constructed guest room...became countless golden flower petals and drifted away...
Now, the duelists and the crowd of attendees......were surrounded by the golden rose garden of the Golden Land......
However, the closet behind Beato remained.
......It stood there all by itself,
 like a coffin...
......Then,
 as though teased open by a desolate wind,
 the hole‐covered closet door...
......slowly opened......
Inside...
.........was a human figure......
That figure was covered up to the head by what appeared to be a greenish‐gray robe.
......Of course, that also had large holes showing that it had been stabbed into...
Eventually, it became clear that this was not a robe, but a raincoat.
......If he had rushed here from the guesthouse,
 then there would be nothing strange about him wearing this into the guest room...
......Then,
 ......with...
......a rustle,
 ......the raincoat...
...lost its human shape,
 ......crumpled,
 .........became a cloud of gold butterflies,
 ...and disappeared.........
"............N‐
............no...
...way.................."
Inside the coffin of the closet,
 ......nothing remained except an empty darkness.........
"{p:1:Kanon does not exist in the guest room.
 .........Of course, this includes all parts of the closet, the bedroom, and the bathroom}."
"Ah..................
........................ah..............."
"Kanon let Battler escape and hid in the closet...
 .........And then, he used magic to disappear.
 ............This is the witch\'s truth.
 .........That is all."
"Th‐the duel is {f:5:decided}...!! Cease—"
""And the winner is...
......{f:5:Beatrice}!!!""
Oh, ......ooooooooooooooooooooohhhhhh!!
The attendees let out a cheer.
{n}{f:5:Virgilia}\'s group couldn\'t help but scream and shout in joy.
{n}The Seven Sisters jumped about in celebration...!
Then, at the same moment the two demons proclaimed {f:5:Beatrice}\'s victory,
 the head\'s ring worn by Erika, who was slowly crumpling to the ground, and the cursed ring on Battler\'s finger...both burst.
At the same time, Battler coughed violently.
Battler...was starting to regain consciousness...!
"Battleeeerrrrr!!
 Battler‐saaaaaaan!!!"
Beato latched onto the coughing Battler in joy.
{f:5:Virgilia}, Gaap, and Ronove did the same.
All of the Seven Sisters also crowded about him in delight.
"......Heh,
 ......heheh,
 ......that\'s a nasty trick...
 You sure something like this counts......?
 With a trick like this one, those {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s will start complaining again about how this isn\'t mystery......"
"No, it\'s a splendid trick!
 That just can\'t be {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen} by people without love...!
 ......Battler‐san,
 ........Battler‐san,
 ......waa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aahhh...!!!"
"Lady {f:5:Erika}, Lady {f:5:Erika}!!
 Someone, help her, {f:5:quickly}!!"
......The rose of blood in Erika\'s chest wouldn\'t stop opening its petals......
"......Third degree conceptual denial syndrome.
 ......Use of continuous neutralizer impossible...neutralization only possible by an emergency approval for resurrection.
 ......The piece\'s master must provide approval for resurrection..."
"L‐Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}, give your approval for her {f:5:resurrection}!!
 ......Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}...?! Wh‐where did she {f:5:go}...?!"
"Search request to ceremony guards: find Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}...!!"
"Understood, ma\'am.
 All Chiesters, data link. Search formation...!"
"......H‐how despicable...
 To think that a master...
...wouldn\'t watch her piece\'s duel to the end...
 ......Know that it is despicable in the extreme!!!"
After learning that her master was already nowhere to be seen, Erika, who was being held by Dlanor,
 ......didn\'t feel lonely.
On the contrary, ......she was relieved that she wouldn\'t need to be brutally scolded in the last moments of her life...
""Gods and demons,
 tell of her noble passing for generations to come.""
"......Noble...?
 ......Hah,
 .........the villain is supposed to die pathetically so the star of the show can shine...
 .........Ggh, *cackle*,
 .........ha...haha..."
I\'m not anyone\'s piece anymore.
{n}......I can finally...control my own role...!!
"L‐Lady {f:5:Erika}...!!
 Y‐you mustn\'t {f:5:move}...!!"
"......Stand back...
 ......BACK OFF!!"
When Erika yelled with all her soul,
 ......those who surrounded her flinched back and fell on their butts...
"I am...
...the Witch of Truth, Furudo {f:5:Erika}......
 ......A Witch of Truth......is a witch......who can withstand the truth.
 ......Now,
 ......I can finally......accept the real truth about myself........."
The toxin of her own concept being denied raced through her.
......Her vision was already starting to blur.
At the other end of her twisted range of vision...
...were Battler and Beato, hugging each other and looking at her......
Their expressions are firm.
......That\'s okay.
Pity and sympathy would only make me look more pathetic.
{n}......That sort of expression......is a loser\'s greatest salvation...
"Lady {f:5:Erika}...!! The duel is already {f:5:over}...!!"
"It is not over."
"Until death do them part."
""We won\'t let anyone disgrace her final moments.""
The two demons grabbed Dlanor\'s shoulders and held her back...
Dripping blood,
 ......breathing heavily,
 ...and with an awkward gait,
 ......Erika walked towards Beato and Battler despite it all...
As the blood dripped from her, it became golden flower petals, which drifted away.
......So, as she walked,
 ......she looked both divine...
...and beautiful.
The duel wouldn\'t end until one of them died.
So, even though the outcome was clear, ......it wasn\'t over.
Beato and Battler told the people bunched around them to step back, ......and they both walked forward to face the noble loser...
".....................Erika..."
"......Congratulations on your resurrection.
 Seems you have bad luck with women.
 ......You\'ll never get a normal one to like you......"
".........True.
 ......And I\'d never fall in love with a normal woman."
"Beato.
 ......No, I ask this of both of you."
"............You wish for one final clash...?"
"...................................."
"............Erika......"
"......Very well.
 ......We are not so boorish as to refuse your noble request."
"Thank you."
As her consciousness began to waver, ......Erika raised her gun again.
 She pointed it at the two of them.
Beato also......raised her gun to point at Erika.
Then, Battler placed his hand on hers......
"It\'s already resolved...
 What more could there be to argue about...?!"
"......Erika‐sama............"
"Why...
...am I...
...powerless to help you...
...{f:5:now}......?"
"......Watch until the end.
 That\'s your job as her friend, isn\'t it...?"
Both sides silently loaded their bullets of truth without saying a word.
The color packed into each barrel...was red...
Though neither side spoke,
 ......did they both know what trump card the other would use......?
".........With this being the end,
 ......I thought that I should...
...properly introduce myself......"
What\'s she saying? This late into the game......
No one could imagine what red truth Erika had loaded...
"............Beato.
 ......Are you sure?"
"........................
 ......Yes.
 I don\'t mind..."
"......I understand.
 ..........................."
"Let\'s at least pull the final trigger together."
"......I know......"
Battler placed his own hand on top of the finger that Beato had around the trigger.
"......Battler‐san. ......I\'m glad...I met you."
"We will...
be together...
for all eternity."
"Ahhah, so you have to flirt right in front of me!!
 This was starting to piss me off anyway.
 ......A teary farewell scene is definitely not for me."
......If you ask me, a villain\'s gotta wear this face to their very last moments!!
"......That\'s a nice look.
 ......Married life with you would probably have been fun enough to make me vomit."
"Of course.
 I would have locked you in a world of such constant back‐arching pleasure...
that it would have taken Beato‐san completely off your mind."
"Haha.
 It\'s a thousand years too early for you to capture Battler\'s heart, little girl."
"Yes, that one\'s your cutest look by far.
 ......This is really the way for both of us to finish things!!"
".........Come."
"This is the final parting line from the detective, Furudo Erika,
 and my self‐introduction!!"
Erika spun around in a magnificent and graceful rondo,
 scattering blood and golden petals around her as she raised her gun.
"{p:1:Hello and good day!
 Detective Furudo Erika at your service!!
 I may be uninvited, but I hope I\'m not unwelcome}!!"
"{p:1:I am the visitor,
 the 18th human on Rokkenjima}!!!"
"............Sorry, but..."
"{p:1:Even if you join us all—}"
""{p:1:That\'s only 17}.""""Then let the pair exchange their rings!!""
......Beato took Battler\'s hand.........and put a ring with the seal of the One‐winged Eagle on his finger.
".........Are you sure...?"
"You are already the territory lord.
 ......So, this ring belongs to you, Battler‐san."
"......You\'re certain?
 ......This is the world you created...... Your tale."
"Yes.
 .........I created this tale because I wanted to be with you.
 ......That means the purpose of this world has been fulfilled.
 ......So, from now on, ......I want you to write it.
 ......The rest of the tale...about you and me."
"................................."
"......Heh, or am I dragging you out of your comfort zone?!
 *cackle*cackle*, I am merely pushing the tiresome task of territory lord onto you.
 It\'s much easier being the wife, where you only have to brag...!"
"I just need to play around and wait for you to write a new tale.
 And, for each new tale you write, I will play any role you devise for me.
 .........A wicked witch, or an adversary.
 ......A lover, ......or a wife."
"My tales are pretty intense.
 You\'ll be busy from dawn until dusk."
"Hmm...... Sounds perfect..."
Beato\'s hand relinquished the ring of the territory lord......
From Battler, she received a silver ring with a crest that could only be worn by the wife of the territory lord.
Then, they exchanged their rings, ......and their wedding was complete.
Then, the pair turned around, ......faced the packed crowd of guests, and raised their rings high.
A thunderous applause rang out for them......
"In commemoration of the night\'s events, the great territory lord will now recognize the accomplishments of certain people."
"Let those called come forward."
At Battler\'s nod, Beato read the name of the first guest to be recognized.
"......Kanon.
 Come forward."
"K‐Kanon‐kun...?!"
A girl goat pushed her way through the crowd, took off her mask, and yelled.
A cloud of gold butterflies gathered before Battler and Beato...
...and took the form of Kanon, kneeling in front of these two nobles.
Kanon had already died and vanished.
{n}......However, all of the dead revive in the Golden Land.
"Kanon, right here......"
"When my husband was locked up and in danger,
 you rescued him and displayed your self‐sacrifice by choosing to remain in the eternal prison in his place.
 Your devotion is deserving of commendation.
 Therefore, we will allow for your resurrection, as well as your continued service."
"......My lady,
 I am deeply thankful!"
"Kanon‐kun, ......Y‐...Yoshiya‐kun!!
 Yoshiya‐kunnnn!! Waaaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aahhh!!"
Jessica raced forward and landed sobbing in Kanon\'s chest.
{n}Kanon patted her head gently and held her......
"You won\'t be serving as furniture.
 You\'ll be serving as a human.
 ......Do you understand what that means?"
"............I do!"
After looking at Jessica sobbing, ......he looked at Battler again and nodded forcefully.
"Now for the next pair.
 Ushiromiya George and Shannon!
 Come forward!!"
""Yes.""
George and Shannon were the next to be called.
Perhaps they had already readied themselves.
 They walked forward boldly and kneeled.
"Ushiromiya George, right here."
"Shannon, right here......"
"You two withstood Zepar and Furfur\'s trials until the very end.
 Your great achievements and affection, determination and nobility are exemplary and deserving of commendation.
 Therefore, I issue you a marriage certificate signed by his lordship!"
""We are deeply thankful.""
"This certificate overrides objections from one and all!
 Let the families of those recognized bless this union with all their hearts!!"
"You heard her.
 No more squabbling, let\'s all just throw rice at them and celebrate.
 Congrats, you two!"
When the territory lord clapped his hands in celebration, it spread throughout the entire cathedral.
Then, a group of goats in the front line of the crowd took their masks off one by one...
"......N‐now listen here!
 I won\'t stand for you making too much salty miso soup, understand?!
 And George is getting a little overweight, so go easy on the sugar—"
"George! When a man gets married,
 he\'s got to treasure his wife even more than his parents!
 No matter what your mother says, you make sure you protect Shannon‐chan!"
"Yes, of course!!"
"George‐san...!!"
"G‐George needs a solid seven hours of sleep each night!
 I\'ll never forgive you if you let him stay up late!!
 And don\'t forget that washing his back and cleaning his ears are also a wife\'s responsibilities!!"
"I‐is that true...? Wh‐what have I done..."
"...Th‐that varies depending on the family......"
"Rudolf‐san, have you been properly caring for your wife?"
"Y‐you should know...
 Why are you suspicious...?!"
"Find happiness, you two.
 Marriage isn\'t the goal.
 It\'s just the starting line, okay?"
"Uu‐uu‐uu!
 Congratulations, congratulations!!"
"Uryuu!! Congratulaaaaaaatioons!!!"
"We can\'t let them beat us, can we?"
"Heh, heheheheheheh...!!
 Y‐yeah, no way we\'re losing, dammii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}it!!"
All of the Ushiromiya family, all of the servants, and all of the spirits and demons in attendance...
...celebrated the honorees with even greater applause...
Thus, .........the tale woven by the Golden Witch comes to an end.
It seems proper to conclude the tale with the epitaph.
The following is the passage on the Golden Land from the Golden Witch\'s epitaph.
{e:070:The witch shall praise the wise, and bestow four treasures.
One shall be all of the Golden Land\'s gold.
One resurrects all the dead people\'s souls.
One even revives all the love they possessed.
And one for the witch to eternally rest.
Rest in peace, my beloved witch, {f:5:Beatrice}......}
"........................
 ......So, this means Beato now rests fulfilled...?"
"That interpretation is probably appropriate..."
"And?
 Now that the game is over, Onii‐chan will be released, right?
 ......What will happen to him?"
"......Well, I wonder.
 .........The book of this fragment tells no more of the story."
"............So, in the end, we don\'t even find out what happens to Onii‐chan.
 .................."
......It\'s not as though anything will come out of it anyway.
In the end, Onii‐chan and the others never came back.
{n}They reached the Golden Land and enjoyed themselves there.
......So says the tale, ......but in reality,
 .........everyone died......in that horrific accident......
"Still, .........I\'ve learned a lot of very interesting things.
 ......That island really is.........a crazy place of illusions."
"Indeed.
 ......And your reading was truly wonderful..."
"......I feel worn out, like watching a six‐hour movie all at once.
 ......I\'m tired."
"Ushiromiya Ange.
 You really have worked hard.
 .........My boredom was eased by your reading.
 The gratitude I feel towards you is one I have not felt since long before I stopped counting the years..."
"If you\'re grateful, why can\'t I have some kind of "commendation" too?"
"Hmm, what would be good...
 ......Give me some time.
 I will think."
{f:5:Featherine} sat down in her rocking chair and rocked it gently, apparently trying to think of something...
"......Ushiromiya Ange.
 You really have worked hard.
 ......You have done well to keep reading for me until the end.
 ......With this, your responsibilities as my miko are lifted.
 You may return to your original world and be reunited with the fate that you have been given."
"Sheesh.
 ......Feels like this was one hell of a side‐trip."
"Do not pout.
 I am thinking of a reward now......
 ......Yes, why not, every once in a while...
 .........That said, it has been quite some time.
 ......I imagine the ink from the bottle has dried up by now......"
Even after the tale ended, Ange and Hachijo\'s debate over it continued for quite some time.
It was very serious......and fiery.
Ange had acknowledged that this tale was no crazy literary work,
 ......but a new message bottle, which had drifted here once more from the Rokkenjima of twelve years previous to tell her of a single possible truth...
And.........it seemed as though she had found her own interpretation...
of the truth she thought the tale was trying to tell.
......Of course, that was only one truth,
 and it did not mean an end to her journey.
Still, ......this interpretation had its place.
It wasn\'t sufficient to fill the twelve‐year gap in her heart.
......However, for now, ......she was content just to enjoy the feeling the tale had created...
along with the bitter coffee Hachijo had made.
"......Thank you for reading until the end.
 ......And thank you for your thoughts and opinions.
 ......I\'m sure the very first Endless Witch is happy..."
".........Wow, so you can say stuff like that.
 ......If you\'d just talk like that from the beginning, I\'ll bet you\'d have tons more fans."
"......I am merely praising the wonderful reader that you most certainly are.
 ......I just wanted to say that rather than write for a silent readership of unthinking swine,
 I would find it a much more productive use of my limited time on this earth to write a manuscript for you alone......
 *giggle*."
"That\'s the kind of thing you don\'t have to say.
 ......Well, I\'ll take it as a compliment.
 .........Okay."
I get the feeling......that I\'ve spent a really, really long time here.
It feels......as though I\'ve spent a major fraction of my life here.
......It should feel uncomfortable, sitting here on a sofa in someone else\'s house,
 ......but for some strange reason, it feels as familiar as my own home.
However, the clock shows that it\'s been only about two or three hours since I met her.
 ......My sense of time feels very strange...
"......Your friend seems to be taking his time......"
"It must be a long phone call.
 It\'s creepy for a guy to talk that long on the phone."
He said he was going to make a scheduled report to Okonogi‐san, didn\'t he?
Even though he was told that he could use the phone here, he declined, and went to look for a public phone somewhere.
......Something about how he didn\'t want to risk being bugged.
 It was too ridiculous a point to argue, so I just left him to it.
"Is the public phone far?"
"If you go out onto the street, there\'s a store on the corner a short way down."
"Then I\'ll be on my way.
 ......Here, consider this payment for the snacks or whatever."
"......If I let you keep that money,
 will you come again, read my next manuscript, and tell me your opinions...?"
"......You\'re willing to pay rolls of money to get an uncouth girl like me to read your manuscript?"
"On the contrary,
 you were a good reader and a good thinker.
 ......It is in search of a person like you that we weave these tales and set them loose into the world."
".........You praise me too much.
 I just take books a little too seriously."
"As thanks for the considerable time you have given to me,
 .........I will someday write your tale."
"Am I going to appear in another of your Forgeries?
 ......I hope you kill me in a slightly better way this time."
"......Do you...like miracles?"
"You mean story contrivances?
 ......I used to hate them, but recently I\'ve become a big fan.
 I\'ve been spoiled, though, so you\'ll have to one‐up jumping off a skyscraper and ending up unharmed, because I don\'t even count that as a miracle anymore."
".........Then, one day, perhaps, I will write you a tale that you will consider a miracle......"
"I\'m......really sorry for barging in all of a sudden and saying all kinds of mean things."
"......Not at all. It was a worthwhile conversation.
 ...Perhaps I will have my head editor arrange another meeting between the two of us......"
"If the opportunity presents itself.
 <See you again, have a nice day>."
"Yes, it may happen again sometime.
 ......I pray that you find your truth."
"Thank you."
"If you ever do reach your truth,
 .........please try making your truth a tale as well someday..."
".........You want me to become one of you witches?
 I\'m not sure about that.
 I\'m bad at writing.
 A good reader isn\'t necessarily a good writer, you know?"
"Ah, quite true.
 I myself can never read anything written by anyone else."
"......Sheesh.
 Then, I\'m off."
"After this, I will probably never see you again,
 ......but I pray I will be fortunate enough to meet another you somewhere...someday."
"...........................
 Can I ask one last question?"
"Go ahead..."
".........That {f:5:Featherine} witch, who appeared within the tale.
 ......That\'s...you, right?"
"It may be presumptuous to say it, but that was my intention."
"...........................
 ......This might be a strange question, but......umm...
 ...............Are you {f:5:Featherine}?
 Or is {f:5:Featherine} you?"
"......Why,
 ......I haven\'t the foggiest idea what you mean..."
The mysterious woman remained mysterious to the end.
.........And so I made it through a day I had no {i:memory} of, and the following day, I took a boat to Niijima.
I\'ll probably never see her again.
However, that just means that "I" won\'t see her—the other "me"s might, somewhere down the road.
......Just as "I" was able to reach several truths, I pray that they too......can reach their destinations.
So long, {f:5:Featherine}.
......If you ever write a better story, please call me again.
{n}If I\'m free, I might drop by......
"No problem.
 It\'s the cushiest escort job I\'ve ever had.
 ......I\'d almost like to invite you along, sir."
"......I\'ll take a pass on that.
 You know how old I am.
 I\'m done running around all over the place..."
The person on the other end of the line was Okonogi.
......Okonogi was also one who tended to move from place to place, so it hadn\'t been easy to catch him even on the phone.
"Our trip\'s been pretty <cool>, so right now, there\'s no need to run around."
"Sumadera Kasumi\'s searching like a madwoman for her.
 ......According to my source, she\'s fixed herself a ride to Rokkenjima already.
 You\'ll bump into her there."
"So, just as planned."
"...............It\'ll likely be just five or six people at most.
 And they\'ll probably be armed with nothing more than handguns.
 They\'re no match for you.
 Feel free to run wild.
 But make sure you kill them.
 ......Have you received that favorite toy of yours?"
"Of course.
 I\'m surprised you managed to get this into the country."
Behind Amakusa was the rental car that they had borrowed under a false name,
 ......inside of which was now a black golf bag.
"The Sumadera head family has already given the okay, but make sure you get out of Japan as soon as you\'re done.
 Don\'t forget to buy your cup ramen by the box in Narita before your flight out."
"Heheheh, I\'ll take care this time.
 .........It\'s an easy job."
"There\'s also............the other matter...... You understand me, right?"
"Other matter...
 .........Well, now you\'ve lost me."
"......Playing dumb, huh?
 ......Well, whatever.
 At the end of the day, you\'re a man who\'s never betrayed my expectations.
 ......If you\'re clever about it, you won\'t even have to get your hands dirty.
 ......There should be plenty of ways to handle it."
".......................................
 ......Heheh, I\'m not sure what you\'re talking about."
"......I know Ange‐chan\'s an unfortunate kid.
 ......Still, all she had to do was play the part of a secluded, wealthy young lady.
 ......Since Eva‐san\'s death, we\'ve all been in agreement on uniting together going forward.
 ......This little portable shrine of ours is important, ......but she\'s also a liability.
 We\'re talking about world peace here, right?"
"............Well, let\'s see how it goes.
 I hope those Sumadera black‐suits know how to shoot a gun right."
".............................."
"Hmm?
 What is it, sir?"
"......Don\'t tell me that, after a few days on the run,
 you and Ange‐chan have already hooked up...?"
"Ha.
 .........Me and that bratty little girl? ...Please."
"Hey, it\'s not like I care.
 It\'d mean you\'ve finally managed to move on, enough that you can take passes at women, at least.
 ......Half the world is women, you know.
 You\'ll never last if just one or two give you the jitters."
"..............................
 ......Oh, speak of the devil.
 She\'s here.
 ............Guess that\'s all for today.
 I\'ll contact you after I reach our lodgings on Niijima.
 Later."
Ange walked down the street towards me.
Why\'d she have to do that when I told her to wait for me to come back?
......If only she wasn\'t like this, she might have lived a long life.
"......That was a pretty long call.
 I was so tired of waiting that I left."
"Heheh. Sorry about that.
 ......How was it for you, missy?
 Did you learn anything interesting...?"
"It was interesting.
 .........That\'s all I got out of it."
"Hyahha...!
 Sounds <cool>."
After Amakusa opened the passenger\'s side door, Ange got in the car.
{n}Amakusa quickly went around to the driver\'s seat.
".........Then let\'s head to the harbor.
 According to the old man, the Sumadera family has set up a net."
"...............If we do get caught, then that\'s the measure of my luck.
 ......If we don\'t, ......then Rokkenjima is waiting for me.
 ......Let\'s leave it all to luck."
".........Luck, is it?"
"When you can\'t decide what to do,
 or when it doesn\'t matter either way,
 ......it\'s not so bad to entrust your fate to a coin toss."
"Heheh.
 Then I\'ll leave it to luck too.
 ............I\'m no stranger to that sort of thing myself."
"......My bodyguard has just said he\'ll leave everything to luck.
 This sucks."
"Since I had to leave for that phone call, I totally missed the clincher.
 What happened after I left? Let\'s hear it."
"No, I\'m not telling."
"That\'s a shame."
The car dashed through the hilly town...
{n}It would not return to Hachijo\'s house for all eternity.
However, Ange didn\'t get sentimental about it.
For now, ......she just wanted to silently consider the new message bottle...
...that the current Endless Witch, Hachijo Tohya, had given her...
In the rear‐view mirror, the town where a witch lived faded off into the distance.
However, that scene wasn\'t reflected in Ange\'s eyes......"............Lambda, ......where are you......?"
Just having to say that felt like admitting defeat......and I didn\'t like it.
Why is it that she\'s always so obnoxious and clingy when I don\'t need her,
 ......and then won\'t answer when I call her name?
Where.........am I......?
Annoyed by the completely predictable ending, I had left the cathedral.
......I had planned on finding some terrace with a cool night\'s breeze...
where I could kill time until the end of that farcical reception.
"......It\'s true that I tried to find somewhere desolate so that I didn\'t have to look at people,
 .........but this is a bit ridiculous."
I, the great {f:5:Bernkastel}, ......am lost?
A miracle like that certainly couldn\'t happen.
Yes...miracles don\'t exist in this world.
To create a miracle, you need "an amount of time that can never be reached", a period that is no different from infinity.
So, when something that appears to be a miracle happens in a shorter span of time than that,
 .....it is not a miracle...
but due to someone\'s......design.
In other words, ......the reason I\'m walking down this bizarre corridor...
...is because someone\'s design has forced me here......
".........Who did this?
 Who pulled this elaborate prank on me?
 .........You must be quite the shy one,
 ......calling me out to a desolate place like this."
......Then, ......from the other end of the dark corridor, ......I heard a sound.
{a:c:*patter*, *patter*patter*patter*.........}
It sounded as though some small animal, like a dog or a cat, was walking at a quick pace.
No miracle could cause a dog or cat to be in a place like this.
{n}Such a miracle would not be "allowed".
Since it isn\'t a miracle,
 that means I am being guided in that direction.
.........Alright then.
 This might be some new idea to keep me entertained.
If this is some new joke of Lambda\'s, I\'ll cover her whole body with honey using my tongue as a reward.
...And then, I\'ll stick parasol chocolates into her eyes and tell her to never do it again.
In the direction that the noise had come from, ......it was not only dim, but shrouded in complete darkness.
However, ......I could sense something in that darkness.
.........There were two emerald‐green glints, ......probably cat eyes.
 The eyes of a black cat that blended well into the darkness.
"Are you the one who called me here...?
 .........Or......are you just the messenger...? ..............."
When I looked at my feet, ......I saw red cat footprints leading towards those cat eyes.
......It was unsettling, ...as though it had run through a puddle of blood on its way there.
After my eyes adjusted to the darkness, .........even with the lack of light, I was vaguely able to make out the red footprints ahead of me.
......They weren\'t actually glowing or anything,
 ......but they served perfectly well as a signpost leading me onwards.
{a:c:*patter*patter*patter*patter*......}
As though it was telling me to follow,
 ......the cat turned around and dashed off into the darkness.
..................What is it?
 ......Something feels...very strange.
It\'s a feeling I haven\'t felt since I began calling myself the cruelest witch in the world.
......I can\'t quite remember what this feeling is.
Still, ......for one as tired of boredom as me, it\'s surely more fun this way.
I followed the bloody footprints of the cat, which would sometimes stop and look back at me,
 ............and walked on and on through the dark corridor......
It headed forward, .........turned corners,
 .........and descended what appeared to be stairs from time to time.
And then, ......though I couldn\'t really tell because of the darkness, .........it slipped through the crack of a door.
"........................Here......?"
I pushed the door open slowly, ......but it was dark on the inside, just like the corridor.
However, the air and the slight change in the echoes made by the footsteps...
told me that this was a room, not a corridor.
The sounds of the cat\'s footsteps were gone.
......However, the bloody footprints remained.
On the other side of some sort of wooden screen, ......under what looked like a small spotlight...
......that same black cat...
was noisily gobbling down a bowl of pet food.
.........I see.
 So, this is its reward for bringing me here...
"Cat......
 Sorry to bother you during your meal,
 ......but I\'d like you to summon your master.
 .........That is, unless you\'re actually the one who summoned me...?"
Talking to it didn\'t cause it to turn around.
......Well, I guess it is an animal eating its food.
 ......If I kick it away, it\'ll probably run off to its owner.
".........Hmph."
When I did kick the cat,
 ......it sailed away like a stuffed animal,
 hit the wall, and fell to the ground.
Then, it vanished, as though it had melted into the darkness......
......What\'s with this cat?
 ......Is it just an illusion...?
"........................!"
When I looked at its food bowl, ......it was piled up with what appeared to be blood‐drenched raw meat.
......It was as though someone had torn apart living flesh on the spot...
...and piled it into there.
".........Come on, what\'s with the creepy reception?"
{a:c:
{m:-5:―}―That was a mean thing to do, kicking it}.
The instant I heard that voice, the hairs on the back of my neck stood on end.
Then, ......the surrounding area finally brightened.....
However, {f:5:Bernkastel} had already guessed where this was before it grew bright...
".........That was you.
 ......That cat."
"......................................."
"......My dear flesh‐eating cat who has learned to choose its own path,
 ......it has been long since we last met......"
"It\'s a path I\'d never have to have noticed if you hadn\'t told me.
 ......You\'re the monster who taught me the taste of flesh.
 .........So, you\'ve come back to life.
 .........{f:5:Featherine Auaurora}..."
"......It is {f:5:Augustus Aurora}......
 You never learn no matter how often I tell you that...
 ...Very well.
 Even that brings back fond memories......
 I have heard the rumors...
 .........It seems you have taken the name {f:5:Bernkastel}, Witch of Miracles, .........and have been traveling around playing some far from praiseworthy fragment games......"
"I\'m just imitating you.
 Though I could hardly match up to your level.
 ......If the rumors you\'ve heard about me are bad, that applies a hundredfold to you."
{f:5:Bernkastel} sat unreservedly in an antique chair,
 ......as though she was already familiar with the place.
"............What are you afraid of?
 I am merely celebrating my reunion with my longest‐serving miko so far...
 Did you really find my messenger cat so displeasing?"
By all appearances, {f:5:Bernkastel}\'s manner seemed relaxed...
However, {f:5:Featherine} admonished her, telling her not to be afraid.
......And, judging by the expression that rose to Bern\'s face,
 ......{f:5:Featherine} had been right on the mark...
"Did you really have to make such blunt insinuations against me?
 ......A cat leaving behind bloody footprints and stuffing its face with blood‐stained meat..."
"...........................
 ......Have no fear.
 ......Look closely.
 ......Where do you see a cat stuffing its face with blood‐stained meat......?
 I just gave it a plate of biscuits as a reward for going to get you..."
"..........................."
............Despite there being no wind, the bowl at her feet seemed to blow away as though it was made of soot.
...In its place lay a lovely......and perfectly normal......cat dish,
 .........with a pile of small biscuits on top of it...
".....................Tch......"
{f:5:Bernkastel} didn\'t even hide her displeased grimace.
{f:5:Featherine} shrugged and muttered "you haven\'t changed, child of man" as she rocked her rocking chair.
".........I see you\'re as unpleasant as ever.
 ......But nowadays I find you pleasing.
 Imitating you really has been far from boring."
"......Scold me as you please.
 It is the parting gift I gave you when we last met."
"You liked abusive mikos because they kept you entertained, right......?
 Tch, ridiculous.
 ......If talking will only please you, I\'ll shut up.
 .........So, ......what do you want with me...?"
"It seems {f:5:Beatrice}\'s game has ended with Battler\'s victory.
 ......I observed it.
 It was quite entertaining."
".........I\'m sure you enjoyed seeing me fail miserably."
"Nonsense, it was a splendid performance...
 ............I\'m sure Beato is very grateful to you."
"............Hmph.
 ......And?
 If you want me to read the fragments of Beato\'s game aloud for you, I refuse.
 I\'m not your miko anymore."
"I have observed all of Beato\'s games.
 ......I also watched {f:5:Lambdadelta}\'s game and Battler\'s game with great interest.
 ......I believe I have fashioned my own particular answers to all the mysteries.
 .........The culprit.
 The motive.
 The individual tricks.
 ......I am not yet clear about the very last part of the epitaph\'s riddle,
 but I have enough of a theory that if I actually went to Rokkenjima and investigated, I should be able to resolve that part as well."
"...............And...?"
"Of course, since there is no single truth, my theory is probably only one of many possibilities.
 ......However, it is one of those possibilities, so that problem is a trivial one."
"......What are you up to?
 .........Do you want to debate Beato\'s game with me?"
"Wrong.
 .........What I want is to look at the answers, child of man."
Those words of {f:5:Featherine}\'s made {f:5:Bernkastel} straighten up.
......Her old master did not fail to notice that small reaction.
"So far, you have spiced up this tale as an actor.
 In doing that, you have probably come to know many truths.
 ......However, even you are unaware of the truth behind several mysteries that Beato has skillfully kept hidden, correct......?"
"...........................
 .........I see...
 .........You want to use me......to chew apart......and string out the guts of something again."
"After watching a play, the experience of reading the pamphlet and learning what goes on behind the scenes...
...is similar to, as you would say it, enjoying some black tea after a meal.
 ......It is ceremony, but essential nonetheless."
"You play with them and love them while they\'re alive, then eat their flesh when they die.
 ......So, cats are doubly useful to you.
 .........Just die, monster."
"I want...to look at the answers.
 .........I\'m sure you want to know them."
"...................................."
"Think of it as a burial for Beato\'s corpse, where you are in charge of the service.
 ......What do you say about that, child of man?"
".........Now, you\'re starting to speak my language."
When {f:5:Featherine} snapped her fingers,
 a thin spotlight shone on a table cluttered with books.
There.........lay a folded version of the game board for Beato\'s game.
The Witch of Theatergoing spun her finger in a circle, and the game board opened up by itself,
 revealing the rows of black and white pieces that were packed away inside it.
".........It is a complete set, containing the game board and all the pieces.
 ......The records of the previous games are all there as well."
With a rustling sound, the books flipped through all their pages of their own accord, shut themselves,
 and flew to the side of the game board, where they waited.
 Inside them, all of the movements of the pieces during previous games were recorded...
".........I see.
 So you were short a player and a commentator..."
"We are also short on black tea.
 ......And, I suppose, dried plums.
 Of course, I will find some."
"..............................
 ......Okay.
 If you add on some mustard rice cakes, then we have a deal."
"The negotiations are concluded."
"I have one condition."
"Oh, and what is that?"
"I\'m going to be the Reader, right...?
 .........I have no love, so I might interpret all kinds of things in strange ways.
 ......However, the Reader is free to read things in a manner and with an intonation of her choosing."
"I only want to check the answers.
 ......I have no interest in the tale itself.
 .........The particular kind of tale you choose to create is of no interest to me whatsoever.
 ............Ah, yes.
 Now I see what you\'re after."
"..................Will you accept that condition?"
"Very well...
 I want to know the answers. You want an outlet for your grievances.
 The negotiations are concluded."
When {f:5:Featherine} snapped her fingers once more,
 ......a large chair appeared, as though beckoning {f:5:Bernkastel} to sit there.
The chair, its design horribly mismatched with the furnishings of this room, ......was a throne.
Wait, I\'ve seen this before.
 .........This is—
"I acknowledge it. You may sit.
 You are the Game Master."
".........Are you sure?
 ......Are you {i:really} sure...?"
"You may create whatever sort of tale you like to ease your inner hatred.
 I am not interested.
 However, I have one condition as well.
 ......Provide all of the answers I seek.
 No hiding, concealment, or tricks."
"Heh, ......heh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eheh...!
 Leave it to me.
 Tearing apart the chest and ripping out the guts is my specialty.
 .........After all, you trained me."
"I shall make you some black tea.
 ......With my own hands, not magic.
 ......Let the master treat her miko to some tea..."
"Beato once told me that tea is best drunk in the company of a witch."
"It seems we differ in that regard......
 ......Heh, ...heheh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eheh."
......At some point, that dish piled with biscuits...
...had reverted to a mountain of torn‐apart meat and a splatter of red.
 No, not just meat, ...even intestines...
"......Tea is best enjoyed—"
""With your fellow monsters.""
".........In that case, let\'s get the pieces ready.
 If we keep counting, this\'ll be game number seven, right?"
"Correct.
 An auspicious number."
"It won\'t be for Beato."
{f:5:Bernkastel} slowly picked up a black piece.
It was the piece that represented {f:5:Beatrice}.
It was sometimes a king, sometimes a queen, and could even become a knight.
However, that was only if it got promoted.
{n}Until then, it was only a trash piece, like a pawn.
First came piece positioning.
 Even this early, the witch\'s game had already begun.
{f:5:Bernkastel} took Beato\'s piece and slowly raised it high.
"First move, placement.
 {f:5:Beatrice} on d8."
