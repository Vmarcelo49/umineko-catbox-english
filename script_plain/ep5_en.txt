"You idiot!!
 Isn\'t it obvious?!!
 {i:It\'ll be fun to kill her and see the pained look on your face, why else}?!!
 Kuhyahahahahahahaha!!"
"Look, look, don\'t turn your eyes away, look at it.
 Look look, look look!
 It\'s magic, it\'s furniture, no matter how much you try to deny me and magic, look look, look look look look!
 Gyahhahhahahaha!!"
"......Sorry, Battleer.
 It was pretty interesting.
 ...Still, I was just trying to do what Master told me, but it really did work very well!
 I hear, after acting {ruby:tsuntsun:bad‐tempered} and exploring the depths of cruelty, if you act properly incompetent and {ruby:dere:soft}, you can get a massive rise on that goodwill meter thing, riiight?
 Kyahahahahahaah!!"
That lonely tone was the sound of the desolate wind blowing by.
{n}The color of the glittering flower petals on the rose bushes was...that of gold.
The group of gold butterflies which had once danced through this golden rose garden like fluttering rose petals...
could no longer be seen anywhere...
The master of the Golden Land is the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}.
{n}She could be called inhumane and cruel.
 Arrogant and outrageous.
{n} And also, naive and simple.
That laugh of hers, which lost its grace more and more the longer it continued, ......could no longer be heard.
The Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}...
sat like a doll, resting in a deck chair adorned as beautifully as the golden rose garden.
......She wasn\'t relaxing there.
Empty‐eyed,
 never responding to any questions,
 and yet still not permitted to sleep,
 {f:5:Beatrice} was sitting there as if she was a doll......
Her hair was down, and {f:5:Virgilia} was carefully fixing it up with a comb.
If {f:5:Beatrice} had been complaining about this and that regarding her hairstyle,
 then it would have been clear that she was the usual Beato.
......However, she gave no responses, and showed no reactions.
{n}So instead, it only looked like {f:5:Virgilia} was combing the golden hair of a large doll...
Alongside them, there was a table.
On it was a chessboard...along with a mix of black and white pieces in an all‐out battle.
However, something about this setup looked different from normal chess.
{n}...It might have been a game similar to chess but not identical.
And on the other side, ......sitting back in his chair as he contemplated his next move, was a young man.
...No, perhaps he wasn\'t thinking of his next move.
Every once in a while, he would change the positions of the pieces, reconsidering the situation each time he changed it.
Maybe he was reconstructing previous games, trying to discover the thought process behind those moves.
In the past...
Kinzo, the Ushiromiya family head, once likened studying chess games to taking a journey through the thoughts of the old masters.
Ushiromiya Battler...was on a journey.
A journey in search of the Golden Witch\'s thought process...which had led her to create these arrangements and make these moves.
Battler took a black piece which he had only just moved forward...and returned it to its original place, sighing deeply.
Battler\'s pieces were white.
 However, on that chessboard, the side facing Battler was Black\'s territory.
 He was stepping through the game from Beato\'s perspective...
"......The more I do this, the less I understand your moves."
Even Battler...didn\'t expect that Beato would respond to that statement.
No, ......he was still holding onto the hope that there might be a chance of her responding,
 and had only made it sound as though he was talking to himself.
Beato\'s eyes......reflected nothing.
{n}And her mouth told nothing.
"........................"
After begging him to kill her,
 ...the Golden Witch had become a corpse which had given up on living.
She wasn\'t sleeping.
{n}......She was forbidden to step down from this game, and therefore, sleep was not permitted.
So she must have heard.
{n}However, ......his words probably hadn\'t reached her heart.
The Golden Witch would no longer sneer at Battler\'s moves, nor would she praise them or belittle them.
{f:5:Beatrice} was no longer......anything more than a living doll.
Even so, she would glance at him every once in a while. It would be an empty glance, but a glance nonetheless.
Sometimes, she would seem to make some sort of gesture or even move her lips.
However, her movements were never able to communicate anything to Battler......
"What led you to make this move in this situation?
 ......I don\'t get it at all.
 I don\'t understand your moves."
"....................."
"......Beato.
 Battler‐kun is talking to you..."
"....................."
"...Say something.
 Snicker or guffaw if you want.
 ......I don\'t even care if you use that shrill laugh of yours."
......It seemed unbelievable.
 That shrill laugh of Beato\'s...would never be heard again.
However, even if she couldn\'t answer, his voice was surely reaching her.
{n}......Battler was talking to her because he believed this.
{n}So he said the same thing one more time...
"What led you to make this move in this situation?
 I don\'t get it at all.
 I don\'t understand your moves."
"............
 ......So, her thoughts don\'t make any sense to you?"
{f:5:Virgilia} answered in her disciple\'s stead.
Up to this point, she had done her best to avoid speaking for Beato.
{n}After all, there was a chance that Beato would respond in some way, and {f:5:Virgilia} didn\'t want to be the one to take that opportunity away from her.
......Which meant that Battler was being forced to bear with this silence...
...until Beato herself answered.
{f:5:Virgilia} could no longer bear to watch him like this...
And Battler, too, wanted to have a conversation with {f:5:Virgilia},
 with faith that their words would reach Beato\'s heart......
"Yep.
 I don\'t have a clue.
 ......The more I try standing in Beato\'s shoes and moving the pieces like this, the less I understand."
The successful execution of a serial murder following an epitaph.
 He was stepping through the games from the witch side with that as the victory condition,
 ......but he just couldn\'t make it fit with Beato\'s moves.
He could see several incomprehensible moves in the records of their past games that clearly conflicted with that victory condition...
"......I don\'t get it at all.
 This journey through her thinking process is just too rugged."
"Even so, you won\'t give up, will you."
"Yeah.
 .........I promised."
{a:c:
Kill...me.
 ......Let me die......}
"I promised to let her die peacefully.
 ......And I\'m the only one who can do that."
...Beato\'s right ankle was bound with a heavy, cold, steel shackle.
It wasn\'t tied to anything, so it didn\'t restrict her movement.
However, it symbolized restriction.
 It was a visualization of the restriction that prevented her from leaving the game without either victory or loss...
And...the shackle was probably hurting her.
{n}The mercilessly cold steel shackle...
was tormenting her over and over inside her waking dream.
"............Ghh............ah..."
So there was never any relief in her empty expression.
{n}Her eyelids would sometimes tremble like she was having a bad dream, ...and every once in a while, she would let out a pained gasp.
Unless I win,
 ......Beato will never be released from the curse that prevents her from resting in peace...
"...Are you not in a hurry?
 It seems that the fifth game has already started."
"............
 ......I\'m not interested."
Why should I take part in any game without Beato as an opponent...?
{n}If that\'s the only alternative,
 then stepping through past games on a journey in search of Beato\'s thought process is a much better use of my time......
"I\'ll be the next Game Master.
 Any objections?
 You have none, right?"
"......I have tons.
 Beato has abandoned the fight and lost consciousness.
 Isn\'t this loss by default and game over for her...?"
"I\'ll admit a lot\'s happened to Beato, and it feels a teensy bit like she\'s been knocked out right now.
 But that doesn\'t mean she\'s lost the will to fight.
 That\'s why I\'m acting as her assistant.
 Get it?"
Beato was lying down on a deck chair, almost as though she was sleeping.
However, she wasn\'t sleeping,
 ......and she wasn\'t awake either.
She was nothing more than a living doll who had given up on victory, asked Battler to perform her last rites,
 and entrusted everything to him...
Of course, no fifth game would ever be prepared if everyone just sat around.
So, {f:5:Lambdadelta} had succeeded Beato as the Game Master,
 and proclaimed that she would prepare the next game.
"Quit messing around.
 This game is between me and Beato.
 I don\'t know who you two are, but I\'m not gonna just let you carry on without us."
"No one asked your opinion.
 So, Bern?
 Do you accept or not?"
"..................
 ......Sure.
 Go and succeed her position."
"What the hell?! How dare you say that!
 I don\'t know who you two are, but I\'m not gonna let you ignore Beato and me and just carry on by yourselves!"
"Calm down.
 Of course a different player will choose different moves.
 You might have a lot of reason to feel uneasy about the idea,
 but even so, it could give you some big hints, right?"
"Who cares?!!
 And who put you in charge?!!"
".........Beato\'s game has repeated four times, and you still don\'t understand anything, right?
 In that case, I think that changing the player might lead to some huge hints."
"That\'s none of your business!
 This is {i:our} game! Beato prepared it, and she designated me to be her opponent in it.
 I don\'t know what hole you two crept out of, but I don\'t want you screwing things up!"
".........In that case, wake Beato up and make her get the next game ready.
 Can you...?"
"B‐...Beato won\'t be getting up for a while.
 But there\'s no need for a new game.
 Just the four games she\'s already laid out are more than enough!"
"Even if there is to be a fifth game, it just needs to be something that Beato lays out and I challenge.
 You two have absolutely nothing to do with this!"
Battler couldn\'t hide his irritation at these two witches called {f:5:Lambdadelta} and {f:5:Bernkastel},
 who had shown up after the game\'s start and who had started to try and continue it on their own...
It looked like these witches were of an even higher rank than Beato—
so high, in fact, that even Beato\'s master {f:5:Virgilia} couldn\'t come close.
Battler had the feeling that he\'d seen these two several times before.
However, this was the first time he had learned their names and spoken to them directly.
"You can\'t get the next game ready without waking Beato.
 That\'s why I\'m going to prepare it instead!"
"Listen, Battler,
 we aren\'t so patient that we\'re willing to wait however long we have to for Beato to regain consciousness.
 Right, Bern?"
"............I don\'t like boredom.
 It really ticks me off."
"We really don\'t care whether you get bored or not."
"Come on now.
 Leave everything to <perfect> {f:5:Lambdadelta}‐sama, okay?
 I\'ll take over as the Game Master."
"{f:5:Don\'t worry}, I won\'t play with too much "certain perfection".
 I\'ll {i:act all Beato‐like} and prepare plenty of clues, bonus hints, and fakes that make no sense.
 I\'ll make it into one big hint to help you understand Beato\'s world even more, okay?"
Letting my voiceless emotions explode, ...I slammed the table hard.
The two witches barely flinched.
......One grinned.
{n}The other looked indifferent, as though nothing had happened.
The two of them just stared at me silently.
{n}...As though they were reproaching me.
"What\'s this?
 Not satisfied?
 Are you saying you\'ll step down from my fifth game?
 Isn\'t that loss by default?"
".........Battler won\'t step down.
 Of course he\'ll participate in the fifth game."
"Don\'t just decide that yourself!!
 I\'m not gonna play along with you two.
 I don\'t give a shit!"
"Hmmm...
 ......Then it really is loss by default, right...?
 The witch side wins this game,
 the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s submit, and we wrap things up, then...?"
".........If you step down, then you lose by default and the game ends... Are you okay with that?
 .........If you want to make certain that your lonely sister...
will always meet with miserable circumstances in an endless number of worlds, that option is indeed open to you."
When {f:5:Bernkastel} mentioned Ange, .........Battler\'s expression changed instantly.
"H‐......how dare you...
talk about Ange so casually......"
".........It\'s because you have me, the Witch of Miracles {f:5:Bernkastel}, as your ally,
 ...that there exists the possibility of a {i:miracle} in which Ange\'s family might come home to her."
"Well, if you throw that chance away yourself, guaranteeing that Ange\'s endless futures will all end in sorrow, that might be pretty interesting for me too."
I vaguely understood what she was saying.
Until I win in Beato\'s game, I\'ll remain trapped in this bizarre world.
And if I abandon victory, ......then most certainly, my parents and I will never return to Ange.
For Ange\'s sake, ...even though I know that the witches are toying with me,
 I must keep on fighting...
"Nn, ...d‐.........damn......"
".........What\'s wrong?
 You look unsatisfied.
 Did you already forget the anger you felt when your sister was turned into mincemeat......?"
"That spectacle where she was torn to bits, ripped to pieces by countless red‐hot pliers.
 Do you need to look at it directly this time......?"
{f:5:Bernkastel} faced the palm of her right hand upwards.
{n}...As she did, a pale light gathered there, ......and some kind of blue‐glowing crystal appeared there.
......A scene was reflected on its sharp surface,
 ...but it wasn\'t the scene that surrounded them now.
If you looked deep into that crystal, ......that fragment,
 then you would probably learn what was reflected on there.
If you stared at it,
 then you would surely witness that scene where Ange.........finally reached her beloved brother after devoting twelve years of her life to that goal,
 ......only to have her entire body torn to bits while she was still alive.
"D‐......damn...you........."
Without thinking, he grabbed at her collar,
 but as soon as he touched whatever made up her form, it disappeared like foam on the waves.
And then, as naturally as though she had been there from the beginning,
 {f:5:Bernkastel} was leaning against a distant wall.
".........If you step down from the game,
 this will become not just a fragment, but a definite reality.
 I won\'t be the one to weave that future.
 You\'ll do it yourself.
 ......So you decide, alright?
 Figure out what you want to do with your beloved little sister\'s future."
Battler\'s fists shook with anger,
 ......but even if he swung them down, he wouldn\'t be able to hit {f:5:Bernkastel}.
Like a cat or a phantom, this witch wouldn\'t even let someone pet her if she didn\'t wish for it.
Besides, ...she\'s telling the truth.
{n}For Ange\'s sake, I can\'t step down from this fight.
{n}Even if these unpleasant witches hijack the game board.
"Ehheheheheh.
 That\'s just like you, Be~rn.
 Even the way you frighten people into doing what you want is heartless.
 ...That\'s how it is, Battlerr."
"You aren\'t allowed to step down from the game board.
 You and Beato are both nothing more than pieces on the game board who exist to distract us from our boredom.
 ...Even your incomprehensible anger and irritation make for a wonderful treat to sate our boredom."
"Well, this level of anger only makes for a cheap snack."
".........Like those curry‐flavored potato wafers that sell at 30 yen for a pair."
""*giggle*giggle*, ahhahahahahahaha...!!""
"Y‐you damn......witches......"
".........*giggle*.
 Fight for Ange\'s sake, okay?
 And for Beato\'s too, right...?"
In a way that was admonishing, ...or perhaps babying,
 ......{f:5:Bernkastel} smiled, tormenting Battler in a similar way to how something too sweet sometimes gives you a headache.
The host of this tea party, Beato, was absent now,
 ......and the guest witches were already making themselves at home.
"...What\'ll you do, Ushiromiya Battlerr?
 Surrender to faaate...?"
".................."
"Just step down.
 You\'ve had enough of being toyed with as a witch\'s piece, right?
 Eheheheheh, it\'s tough being one of Bern\'s pieces.
 You\'ll be a throwaway just like Ange.
 Geheheheheh!"
"I\'m not giving you the option of stepping down.
 ......Keep fighting for the sake of your sister\'s future.
 I\'m on your side.
 Until you win, I\'ll support you so that you can reach that future...
for all eternity, until I get bored.
 ......*giggle*giggle*."
Battler couldn\'t allow himself to fall for their provocation and cajolery......
These witches knew that he got mad easily, and they were trying to take advantage of that...
...Battler withstood it all, ......and finally relaxed his clenched fists.
".........If you want to start this fifth game of yours, ...then just do it.
 Do whatever you want."
"Oh, I will.
 ......Hey, where are you goi~ng?"
Even though Battler had acknowledged this fifth game, he turned his back on them,
 which surprised {f:5:Lambdadelta} a bit.
"If you\'re going to be Beato\'s substitute,
 ......then I\'m sure that {f:5:Bernkastel} witch over there can be mine if she wants."
".........Not a bad idea.
 Otherwise, this\'ll turn into a loss by default."
"What the heck?!
 Are you gonna just ignore this Episode 5 that I put so much effort into making?!
 Rude, ruuude!"
"......Battler says he\'s going to take a break for a while.
 Until he comes back, I\'ll be the substitute player.
 How\'s that sound...? Battler...?"
".........You do that."
"............"
"......What\'s wrong, Lambda?
 If your opponent is me and not that fool Battler, you won\'t play...?"
"Ehheheheheh!!
 Of course I will{p:0:♪}
 I\'m glad I get to play with you, Be~rn!
 Come on, let\'s play, let\'s play!
 Let\'s play together in {f:5:Lambdadelta}‐sama\'s super <hyper> and <cute> Episode 5~!"
".........This is a world that Beato created, remember.
 You aren\'t going to ruin the atmosphere of the story, are you...?"
"Don\'t worry about that.
 I\'m really good at reading between the lines for that sort of stuff.
 I made sure to use a Beato‐ish atmosphere {i:and} I made it into an even {i:more} interesting story."
"Battler, make sure you come back as soon as your break\'s over, okay?
 It\'d be a shame to miss this.
 I\'ve prepared plenty of bonus hints that\'ll get you closer to Beato\'s secre~t{p:0:♪}"
"...Is what it\'ll look like but I\'ll actually fill it with misdirection and make things more and more confusi~ng.
 Wait, hey, Battlerr! Why aren\'t you listening when a witch is talking?!"
Without answering, Battler disappeared into the darkness.
After shrugging and cackling,
 the witches immediately started playing with the game board they had stolen from Beato......
"Can those witches really understand Beato\'s game?"
"...Since they\'re using the same game board, they cannot do anything that this child cannot do.
 However, they can do things that she wouldn\'t do."
"............
 ...What do you mean, things she wouldn\'t do?"
"The materials of chess exist to play chess with.
 You {i:cannot} use them to play cards.
 However, as for throwing the chess pieces at your opponent, or scribbling on the board..."
"Doing such things is not impossible.
 However, that would be blasphemy against the game of chess,
 so people {i:don\'t do that}."
"....................."
That definitely......wouldn\'t be chess anymore.
{n}It looked like Beato\'s eyes clouded very slightly with sadness.
".........Damn them.
 .........This game is between me and Beato.
 ...I won\'t let anyone else profane it."
At that time, gold butterflies gathered and Ronove appeared, holding a tea set with black tea.
"Would you like some more tea?"
".........If you wouldn\'t mind."
"Certainly.
 ......So,
 how has this journey of yours in search of Milady\'s thoughts been?"
"I\'m as clueless as ever, but I\'m enjoying it."
"On a different topic, ......are you certain about this?
 Relaxing here, I mean."
"......Are you talking about the game those witches are playing all by themselves?"
"Yes.
 Just now, when I went to serve them some tea, the murders of the first twilight had already taken place,
 and it seemed as though the next murder would occur shortly."
When Beato and I were playing,
 the game would be paused whenever someone left their seats.
......However, those witches wouldn\'t pause that game just because I wasn\'t around...
"............Ronove, did you see their game?"
"Just a part of it."
"How was it?"
Ronove lifted the pot high with an elegant gesture as he poured the black tea.
After he was done, he finally spoke,
 expressing his thoughts in very few words.
"It did not have...love."
"......What do you mean, love?"
"My apologies.
 That is how it would be put if a woman were to say it.
 ......As a man,
 ......perhaps one could say it was dishonorable."
I understood what those words meant.
When I met {f:5:Virgilia}\'s eyes, she shook her head slightly and stared at the floor...
".........At a glance, I believe it resembles Milady\'s games greatly.
 However, the foundation is very different."
"Does it go against the rules of Beato\'s game?"
"No, it does not.
 {f:5:Lambdadelta}‐sama understands the rules of Milady\'s game very well indeed.
 ......However..."
".................."
Battler stood up.
There was no need to make Ronove say any more.
"Battler‐kun......"
"......Sorry, Ronove.
 I know you went to all the trouble of pouring this for me, but tea isn\'t what I need."
"You will go after all?"
"Yeah.
 ......We don\'t need any outsiders in our game."
...Those guys weren\'t even here in the beginning.
Because I\'ve been loafing about, crazier and crazier witches have been introduced,
 ......and now they\'ve hijacked this game between me and Beato.
"I\'ve got to take it back.
 ......I\'m supposed to be the one taking care of Beato\'s game board now.
 ...That means I shouldn\'t just sit around here."
"......Thank you.
 I wanted to let this child hear those words."
"I\'m sure she hears them.
 ......Milady is simply unable to answer."
Beato lay there silently, like a living doll with dull eyes...
The game board that she had created herself had been hijacked by incomprehensible people and was being turned into a mess...
Beato had called on me to be her opponent.
{n}Then this game must be something she created for me.
{n}I\'ve......got to take it back.
"......You just wait here.
 I\'m going to take it back."
"....................."
Of course, Beato didn\'t respond in any way.
 ......That\'s right.
{n}If she can\'t respond, ...then I have to protect it in her place.
"I\'ll be right back.
 ......{f:5:Virgilia}, Ronove.
 ...I\'m counting on you two to look after this golden sleeping princess."
"Yes. Leave it to us."
"......See you later, Battler‐kun.
 And please,
 ......try to discover some part of this child in their game without her.
 If you can,
 ......then it will mean that you have fought with her, even in her absence."
".........You\'re right.
 ...Yeah,
 ......this is no goddamn good at all.
 What am I doing?"
Let\'s go.
 ...And let\'s take it back.
"Sorry to keep you waiting, witches!!
 My break is over!!"
When he faced the jet‐black heavens and yelled this,
 the whole world shattered, as though it were made out of thin glass.
Then, ......as though it had been that way since the beginning,
 .........it transformed into that smoking room where Battler had fought Beato so many times, ...and which the two witches had now hijacked.
"What do you think you\'re doing?
 You\'re only coming back now?
 It\'s way too late!
 Not only has the game reached the second day, it\'s already at the finale!"
".........You never showed up, so I just advanced things on my own."
Yeah, like you ever even waited for me in the first place...
"Bern was waaay sharper and more thrilling than you were. Right?!"
"Shut up.
 I\'m the player here.
 You substitute witches can just take a step back now."
".........Well, I don\'t really mind if you join in starting now, but there\'s probably no need for you anymore."
"Seriously.
 After all, we\'re already at the climax!
 After this, Bern will probably corner me and win."
"What the hell.........?!"
".........Why not, though?
 Let\'s let him watch the final moves."
"Yeah.
 Come on over, Ushiromiya Battler.
 It\'s almost completely over, but here\'s the <cute> and <elegant> game I made!"
"Episode 5:
 End of the
 Golden Witch!"
Right now, no humans exist on this island except for those in this parlor.
And with one exception, it has been shown that none of them have committed murder.
And the culprit is among these people.
"......Whoa, whoa.
 ...In that case, ...it\'s conclusive, isn\'t it...?"
"Unless the culprit is a witch who committed murder with magic, that is..."
"............It was you?!
 You killed George, killed my husband?!
 Why?!!
 Whyy{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}yyy?!!"
"I, ...I didn\'t kill anyone...!
 I, I, d‐didn\'t do...!!"
"....................."
In a panic, and with a voice that really couldn\'t be called flowing,
 ......in a manner that was, to put it coldly, unsightly...Aunt Natsuhi denied the suspicion placed upon her...
However, ......there was no longer any way around it...
{i:The girl} stood up, ...brushed back her long hair, pointed at Aunt Natsuhi, and said it one more time.
"......You are the culprit.
 Ushiromiya Natsuhi‐san."{a:c:
"It\'s Natsuhi, please open up...!!"}
Natsuhi yelled as she knocked loudly and repeatedly.
Shortly after, there was a heavy clunking sound, and the sound of the door to Kinzo\'s study unlocking could be heard.
As the door opened, a heavily sweet venomous odor flowed out.
Natsuhi was always ashamed of how she automatically grimaced at that,
 even though she thought it rude to the family head...
Krauss was waiting for her inside the study.
Natsuhi flew into his arms.
"......I‐is Father... ......Is he........."
"Calm yourself.
 ......Doctor Nanjo is examining him now..."
With an uncertain gait, Natsuhi went towards the center of the study, supported by Krauss.
There, a dignified bed fitting for the head of the Ushiromiya family could be seen, along with Nanjo, Genji, and Kumasawa...
"Doctor Nanjo...
 I‐...is Father......"
After sighing deeply, Nanjo left the side of the bed.
On the bed, Kinzo could be seen lying down, sleeping......
".........He died peacefully.
 ...I don\'t think Kinzo‐san had any regrets."
"Ah, ...waa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahh{0}h{0}h{0}h{0}hhh...
 Father... Fathee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}er...!!"
...Sobbing, Natsuhi put her head against the chest of the man who had fallen into a sleep from which he would never awaken.
"M‐......Madam, ...please, stay strong..."
"Father, Father......!!
 This is...just too sudden......
 Aaaaaaaahhhhhhh!!!"
"..............."
Natsuhi couldn\'t stop her tears over the death of Kinzo, whom she had loved like a second father.
Kumasawa rubbed Natsuhi\'s back, consoling her......
Krauss slumped into his late father\'s favorite chair.
By sitting there, he might have been immersing himself in memories of his departed father.
Or perhaps he thought that by sitting there, he might be able to understand just a bit of the madness of Kinzo\'s later years,
 which had eluded him to the end of his father\'s life...
Nanjo turned his back and looked down over the outside world through a crack in the curtains.
It was the same thing he\'d often done when Kinzo sat in that chair contemplating a chess move...
"...If he was to die anyway, it would have been better if he was sick in bed for a year or so before dying.
 I do wish he could have died after a grace period during which the proper arrangements could have been made."
"It\'s the other way around.
 ......We should be glad that he was in high spirits until the very end."
"That will have to be my public stance, yes..."
Nanjo understood that as well.
This was the death of Ushiromiya Kinzo, a man who had risen like a comet and glittered like a supernova in the post‐war world of business.
His funeral would probably be of a fantastic scale.
{n}And it would also be the ceremony marking Krauss\'s inheritance of the headship.
He would have to arrange everything as the host of the event, carry out funeral diplomacy perfectly,
 and make it clear that the Ushiromiya family would still hold enormous influence in the political and financial spheres.
As Nanjo watched Krauss, he was vividly reminded of the time when Kinzo had been suddenly selected as the Ushiromiya family head,
 a time in which Kinzo had been lost and confused.
Nanjo could remember that well, and for that reason, he was able to understand Krauss\'s distress and sympathize with it...
Natsuhi\'s sobs eventually subsided.
Seeing this, and leaving Kumasawa to care for Natsuhi as a fellow woman, Genji returned to Krauss.
And he lowered his head slightly, as though asking what should be done.
"......Genji‐san and I will deal with the formalities.
 Krauss‐san, perhaps you should contact the relatives first."
".................."
Krauss, with his hands still over his eyes, didn\'t respond...
Perhaps even though he had known this day would come, Krauss really couldn\'t hide his shock at how suddenly it had reached them.
"......Leave this to Doctor Nanjo and me.
 Krauss‐sama, I suggest that you first speak with Madam."
Maybe she heard that, or maybe it was a coincidence.
{n}As though responding to Genji\'s words, Natsuhi came over.
Her eyes were red from crying so much,
 but she apparently understood the heavy responsibility that had been imposed on the two of them even better than Krauss did.
"As of now, you are the head of the glorious Ushiromiya family.
 Let us show our relatives and the world that you have splendidly succeeded your father.
 ......As your wife, I am prepared to serve you until the day our coffins are laid down alongside each other."
".................."
Trying to encourage her husband who was overcome with shock, Natsuhi lent him some reassuring words.
When Krauss finally lowered the hands that had been covering his face,
 ...he looked up at the ceiling with a blank expression and let out a deep, deep sigh...
"......Please, stay strong.
 There are a great many people who will intend on helping themselves to everything Father has left behind.
 We must fight to protect Father\'s honor and wealth.
 That is the first responsibility of the Ushiromiya head."
"...I understand.
 I do understand."
"Doctor Nanjo, Genji, please take care of the legal and funeral arrangements.
 Especially you, Genji.
 I ask that you take particular care and see to it that the funeral will be a fitting one for Father."
"......Certainly."
"And Doctor Nanjo.
 Father didn\'t pass away in a hospital, ......so..."
"Yes.
 An autopsy might indeed be required depending on the circumstances......"
"Is there anything you might be able to do about it...?
 Even though he has passed away, Father\'s body is precious.
 Any damage to it would not be acceptable..."
"I understand how you feel.
 ...However, it is important to follow proper procedure where things like this are concerned.
 And, umm, ......I don\'t really know how to say this.
 I fear that several of your relatives might be difficult..."
......There was no way to know what those inheritance vultures might try to find fault with.
They might squawk that there was something suspicious about the cause of death, and use that as a point of contention to start some trouble.
Right now, not only was it important to pay Kinzo\'s remains the respect they were due, but there was also a need to focus on solidifying the position of the new family head, Krauss...
"......I understand.
 In that case, please keep it to an absolute minimum.
 And whatever you do, please make absolutely sure that Father\'s dignity remains unharmed."
"That I can assure you.
 Please don\'t worry.
 ......In any event, leave Kinzo‐san to us and stay by Krauss‐san\'s side.
 ...Things are only going to get tougher for him."
"I understand.
 ......And you too, dear...please stay strong."
".................."
Krauss was still staring lazily at the ceiling with a befuddled expression on his face...
Natsuhi understood the shock and heavy responsibility.
{n}She felt that she understood her husband\'s feelings as well as anyone possibly could.
"......I will contact the relatives.
 Please rest for the time being."
"............"
Krauss didn\'t respond.
...Natsuhi thought that he was being a little bit weak, but that just made it all the more important for her to support him right now.
Seeing her husband like this actually stirred Natsuhi up, and a resolute expression rose to her face.
"Things are going to get busy.
 Let\'s get started with whatever we can do right now.
 .........I\'m sure my husband wants to have some time alone with Father.
 We should step out for the time being."
"......Yes, I think that would be best...
 After all, I expect this will be the only time he\'ll have."
Being in charge of a funeral is tiring work.
 There\'s no time to shed tears.
If Krauss were ever to be given time to cry for his dead father, that time would have to be now.
Everyone agreed with Kumasawa\'s words.
Even then, Krauss continued to lazily gaze up at the ceiling and didn\'t respond in any way.
Natsuhi urged the servants to go.
"I\'ll go talk to Jessica too.
 ......She is the successor to the head now.
 I\'ll have to impress upon her that she needs to be appropriately aware of it."
{a:c:
"Wait."}
As they each started to make their way out of the study, Krauss finally spoke.
They stopped walking.
"Yes?"
"......Wait."
".........Yes??"
Hadn\'t she already stopped walking, just like her husband had asked?
{n}But despite that, he had once again told her to wait.
From those slightly weak words, Natsuhi understood that he had probably stopped her because he wanted her to be by his side.
"The rest of you, downstairs.
 I will stay with my husband.
 Please call us on the phone if anything happens."
"......Certainly."
{e:150:"I said {i:wait}!!"}
When Krauss suddenly raised his voice, everyone jumped and turned around...
Unable to comprehend what she had done to spark her husband\'s wrath, Natsuhi ran up to him.
"What\'s wrong, dear...
 Have I said something rude...?
 If so, please forgive me."
"No, no, that\'s not it, that\'s not it...
 Wait a second, give me some time."
"Yes, I understand.
 It\'s important to have time to sort things out inside your heart.
 ...We were just going to leave quietly to give you the time you need..."
"And I\'m telling you to wait before doing that......
 ......Listen, just no one move.
 Not even an inch...
 ......If you\'re tired, then feel free to sit in whatever chair or sofa you want.
 So just stay quiet and shut up in silence, don\'t do anything, just stay right there!"
......Those unreasonable words felt like a glimpse of how Kinzo used to be.
Natsuhi couldn\'t hide a slight surprise at those words, which made it seem as though Kinzo had possessed her husband.
Natsuhi told the servants to wait for the time being.
She ordered them to sit in a sofa a short distance off, approached her husband, and spoke to him in a small voice...
"......If you order it, I will wait however long you ask. I won\'t move.
 So please, try and calm yourself..."
"...No, ......that\'s not it, that\'s not it..."
Was it really his father\'s blood, or was he actually being possessed?
Krauss\'s disorderly style of speech strongly resembled Kinzo\'s...
As she watched this, Natsuhi felt with even greater certainty that Krauss was indeed Kinzo\'s son,
 and that he was the true successor to the head, more suitable than any other person.
".........Natsuhi.
 Over here."
Krauss stood up and headed towards the window, trying to lengthen the distance between himself and the servants waiting on the sofa by even a small amount.
Natsuhi realized that he must have something secret that he wanted to talk about.
"...Yes, dear?
 ......What is it...?"
"............Dad dying...
would be bad."
"Would be? But he has already passed away.
 We can\'t change reality..."
"That\'s not it.
 ...Now is...a bad time..."
"......What do you mean?"
"I\'ve been putting Dad\'s fortune up as collateral.
 Once the issue of dividing the inheritance comes up, I won\'t be able to hide it...!"
"Wh‐...what...?
 C‐collateral, you say?
 How much...?"
"...You remember how I helped out Kondo‐kun with Melody Land?"
"Didn\'t I tell you to break ties with that person?
 You told me you\'d refused him...!
 Why?!"
"There is such a thing as a man\'s honor!
 I couldn\'t refuse!"
Krauss claimed to hold honor as a virtue.
...However, Natsuhi knew that he most often used this as an excuse after he couldn\'t bring himself to pass up a deal.
"Th‐that wouldn\'t be a problem if we had plenty of money on hand...!
 But didn\'t you borrow quite a lot of money for the plan to turn this island into a resort?!"
"Yeah, I did!
 And there were people here and there who lent me a hand along the way!
 If I\'m going to repay them, I can\'t just sit around on my hands!"
"You need money to repay people!
 You need money to make money!
 You can\'t even get started without money!
 And even the plan for this island would be proceeding smoothly if only there hadn\'t been problems with the planning company!"
"I had the cooperation of government officials.
 I even had the governor\'s personal guarantee that this would become the newest travel destination in the Tokyo Metropolis!
 The groundwork I laid was completely perfect!!
 Random chance and bad timing were against me!
 It was just a bit of bad luck.
 Like a traffic accident!!"
"That was no accident!
 It was fraud!
 You were tricked!!
 They were never drawing up plans for making this island a resort in the first place!!"
"That\'s not true!!
 Hijikata‐kun\'s vision was simply overflowing with foresight!
 The way his eyes always focused on the whole world and the future taught me that things I always believed to be mere dreams were only the tip of the iceberg of what is possible!!
 Expand your dreams! To the whole world, to the future!
 You heard him say that too, didn\'t you?!"
"Yes, I did...! And I think I remember telling you what I thought after we returned home!!
 I said that he was suspicious!
 That he only spoke of dreams and didn\'t have his feet planted on the ground,
 and that you must not have any further relations with him!!"
"Hijikata‐kun is a wonderful, pleasant young man!!
 One could learn a lot from the way he lives!
 I can respect him despite his youth!
 I won\'t have you insulting him!!"
"That\'s what you said about the whole moon tourism thing!!
 You kept saying it was visionary, that it looked to the future, that it had high aspirations, and what was the end result?!
 Eventually, even you yourself admitted that it was utter nonsense!!
 I was sure something was wrong from the moment that strange man showed up claiming to be a high‐ranking NASA official!"
"The only issue was that foreigner who was an international swindler!
 {nobr:Mr. Sonezaki} and I were {i:both} victims of that incident.
 Even now, his vision isn\'t mistaken!
 There will definitely come a time when space tourism will become a popular indulgence for the world\'s richest.
 And the very first enterprise in that area will probably be monopolized by a single, private company.
 That viewpoint is not mistaken!
 There is simply a group of international swindlers who are trying to take advantage of that fact and deceive investors across the world—"
"And I\'m trying to tell you that this Sonezaki man was one of them too!!
 Just how gullible are you? Why do you always just accept these suspicious offers without any doubts?!!"
"Take that back!
 {nobr:Mr. Sonezaki} is a man with a brilliant future ahead of him!
 There\'s nothing suspicious about him!!
 Because the dreams he speaks of anticipate the future, they sound crazy to people who can\'t look that far ahead!
 A woman like you can\'t see into the future!!"
"Yes, a woman like me can\'t see into the future!!
 But I can see the present!
 Right in front of me, I can see a pitiful husband who\'s been taken in by sly, double‐crossing swindlers and still trusts them implicitly even after he\'s been tricked!!"
"Oh, shut up!!
 You don\'t understand anything about money or business or economics!!
 Don\'t try to butt in on the job of the husband!!
 All a wife needs to do is the housework!
 You just keep quiet!!!"
"...............!
 ........."
Without another word, Natsuhi fell silent, just as Krauss wanted.
{n}She was already far beyond anger and sadness.
And the emotion that lay on the other side of those...was an almost indifferent pity.
Krauss had always been frightened of Kinzo since the days of his youth, and had come to subconsciously admire the way his father lived.
...Without realizing it, he had come to believe that he could only be recognized as a man in his own right if he surpassed his father.
However, Kinzo had been a mad genius, the likes of which had never before been seen in the Ushiromiya family\'s long history.
His talent was a gift from heaven,
 ......and it definitely wasn\'t genetic, much less something that could be learned.
Natsuhi instructed the servants not to tell anyone about Kinzo\'s death,
 and dismissed everyone for the time being, to give the two of them a chance to talk alone.
Then, she invited Krauss to her bedroom,
 ......and made him tell her everything about their current financial situation.
They were things that Natsuhi hadn\'t been told about under the assumption that a woman had no business knowing.
Natsuhi had herself made a point of avoiding this area in the past, thinking that it wasn\'t a wife\'s place to intrude on such matters.
However, this might also have meant that she had been remiss in her duty as a wife to protect her family.
The depths of this sin had been made quite clear to Natsuhi...
Krauss was probably tired of trying to defend himself.
{n}Perhaps because he had gotten a headache, he hid his face and sank into silence...
Natsuhi noticed that the water in the electric kettle was boiling and stood up to refill her cup with black tea.
And when she touched the cup of black tea, she noticed for the first time.
The sound of the cup and saucer clinking together told her that her fingers were shaking...
Krauss had built up a large debt to obtain funds for his various projects...and to cover the losses when they failed.
Of course, he had put the mansion and property up as collateral.
However, doing such a thing above board would have resulted in the mortgage being registered.
In other words, there would have been a record that Krauss had put Kinzo\'s wealth up as collateral to obtain a loan without anyone\'s permission.
Krauss couldn\'t afford for Kinzo, Eva, and the others to learn of such a thing.
Therefore, he had been putting those assets up as collateral using the worst possible method.
".........I signed over the deeds and power of attorney..."
"And...what does that mean......?"
What Krauss was saying probably meant that he had, in essence, signed away the rights to their assets.
If those assets had been used as collateral for a loan, then Krauss would have had some options under the law.
He would have had to deal with a bank, which would have absolutely no compassion,
 but they would have been able to work something out within the rules set by society.
......However, signing away the deed and power of attorney was a whole different story.
In short, even the mansion they were living in was at risk.
 If the person holding the deed were to decide to ignore his agreement with Krauss and sell the mansion to a third party right this moment, they would have no recourse whatsoever.
Far from using their house as collateral for a loan, this was basically the same as selling it to borrow money...
"...In other words, ...the moneylenders have the power to make or break the Ushiromiya family as they please.
 If they were to suddenly sell our house on some slight whim,
 ......we\'d have to pack our bags and leave right now, wouldn\'t we...?"
"That is technically true.
 However, all of the people I have arrangements with are very reputable.
 They aren\'t loan sharks.
 These are transactions based on trust between economically literate men."
"I trust them.
 And they, in turn, trust that by lending me money, I will achieve great success in business and give them massive returns on their investment.
 I signed over the power of attorney as a sign of good faith and so that they wouldn\'t have to doubt in the certain success of my enterprises."
"What happens if I hesitate now?
 Wouldn\'t that mean even I have no confidence in my own ventures?!"
".................."
If your ventures had been successful, we wouldn\'t be in debt now, would we...
{n}...Natsuhi only barely stopped herself from saying it.
"......Father is dead.
 What happens next?
 Your debt will be exposed to the light of day, and your siblings will hold you responsible?"
"............That won\'t be all.
 ......It will probably lead to criminal charges..."
"C‐criminal charges......
 Wh‐why is that......?"
".........It\'s better if you don\'t know.
 ......The point is...we can\'t allow anyone to find out about this......"
"..............."
Krauss looked at the floor shamefully, shaking his head over and over......
If it would come to criminal charges, ...then he must have broken some laws.
He had probably been so intent on raising a large sum of money that he hadn\'t paid any heed to appearances.
......Krauss had seriously believed that his many projects would definitely succeed and return huge profits.
So he had figured that even if he broke a few laws, he would be able to pay everything back before too long and pretend that the whole thing had never happened.
......This might have lessened his resistance towards breaking a couple laws.
And now Kinzo\'s death, the worst possible thing, had occurred, and soon he wouldn\'t be able to keep it all hidden......
"......What will happen to us?"
"Th‐there is no need to worry...
 You may not believe, but conditions are most certainly on the rise now.
 The value of the city real estate I invested in is rising rapidly."
"I have a project in progress to consolidate those and construct a massive business tower.
 This is the most reliable of all my investments so far, and it\'s proving to be the most successful."
"......However, it will take a little more time for it to bear fruit.
 It\'s absolutely certain to do so, but it will not happen immediately..."
"......Will the success of that venture be enough to pay back our debts?"
"Of course it will.
 I\'ll be able to write off all of the debt I\'ve accumulated so far...!!
 So believe me.
 I only need a little more time!"
"But Father has already passed away!
 We don\'t have that kind of time anymore!"
"I know, I know that...!!
 That\'s why...I have to obtain money from somewhere and pay off those debts right now!"
"I need money, that\'s what it comes down to...
 Money, a lot of it, right now!!
 Aaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aarr{0}r{0}rgghh{0}h{0}h{0}hh...!!"
Krauss roared and clutched his head, writhing about as if in pain.
As Natsuhi watched, several conflicting emotions swirled about in her chest.
{n}She felt pity for her husband, but at the same time, she felt he was a fool.
......And she also felt a mixture of anger and regret towards her own irresponsibility in letting her husband run wild for so long.
It should have been clear to him well before today that they were in a very critical situation.
And yet he had irresponsibly waited for this moment to come and was now writhing about.
......Her husband was so foolish......and pitiful.
{n}It was easy to feel frustrated with him.
 ......However, she was his wife.
For a wife to ridicule her husband as a fool would run in conflict with her responsibilities.
...If he was a fool, then she would have to support him to compensate...
However, she didn\'t have a clue what she was meant to do about this...
If there was a massive amount of money like that within easy reach,
 there was no way that Krauss wouldn\'t have already laid his hands on it......
It would also be easy to tell him to be a man and give up on everything.
{n}But that would also run in conflict with her responsibilities.
She was Ushiromiya Natsuhi.
......The woman who had become Krauss\'s wife and sworn to support him, the new head of the Ushiromiya family, for as long as she lived.
She had to somehow help her husband in his efforts to raise money.
......She understood it logically.
But she couldn\'t suppress the indescribable feeling of dejection that seemed to rise up from the dark depths of her heart......
"That\'s right, D‐Dad\'s hidden gold...!
 Ten tons of gold is worth 20 billion yen!
 If I had that...
 That\'s right, if I had that, everything could be resolved...!"
"Natsuhi, that\'s it! The witch\'s epitaph!
 Let\'s solve that, let\'s solve it together!
 If we can just find the gold, everything will work itself out!!
 That\'s right, it must be hidden somewhere on this island!!
 If we had that, if we had that!!"
"Y‐you\'re hurting me...
 Dear,
 ......p‐please, stop this......"
Krauss, acting as excited as if he\'d thought up a perfect, brilliant plan, grasped Natsuhi\'s upper arm tightly.
Natsuhi couldn\'t help but be dumbfounded.
It wasn\'t just because she\'d heard something as fake‐sounding as the hidden gold brought up.
Krauss usually disparaged the story of the hidden gold,
 saying that it didn\'t exist and that it was all a fiction his father had created to borrow a lot of money.
Natsuhi was doubly taken aback because of this...
"I know, let\'s have Jessica help us too.
 Maybe some things can only be solved with the sense of a child!
 This is a family crisis.
 All of us have to stick together!!"
"Yes, it\'s just a fanciful little puzzle that Dad created...!!
 We should be able to solve it... There\'s no way we can\'t solve it...!
 It\'s the only way!!"
"Oh, Natsuhi, this is wonderful,
 we still have an option left, and right here next to us!!
 The gold is on this island!!
 If we had it, everything would be resolved!"
"Waha, waha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!
 Natsuhi, call Jessica here right away!
 Let\'s overcome this family crisis as a family!!
 Yes, right now!!
 The gold is on this island, it\'s right beside us!!
 ......Wah!!"
Natsuhi knocked Krauss aside, unable to withstand the pain in the arm he was twisting in his excitement.
Krauss tripped over the edge of the bed and flopped pathetically onto the floor...
"P‐please get ahold of yourself!!
 And please calm down...!!
 Do you really think that this Ushiromiya family crisis......could be solved by saying something as dream‐like as that...?!!"
"N‐.........Natsuhi........."
"Please, cool your head off and think of a realistic plan to gather money...!!
 I\'m going to go cool my head off as well......!"
"...Wait......Natsuhi......"
Maybe falling over had knocked the sense back into him.
{n}Krauss tried to tell Natsuhi to stop, but she just kept walking.
Closing the door forcefully, Natsuhi dashed away......
Natsuhi ran through the corridor.
She didn\'t want anyone to see her like this, but she ran headlong into Genji......
"......My deepest apologies.
 Madam, have you been injured...?"
"I, I\'m alright.
 Leave me alone...!!"
".........Certainly."
"Oh, ......Genji.
 ...What\'s the state of Father\'s study?"
"......It is just as you left it.
 Doctor Nanjo is in the parlor."
"I see...
 ......Do you have the key to the study?"
"Yes.
 Right here."
"Give it to me.
 ...Let me have some time alone with Father.
 If my husband asks where I am, tell him you don\'t know."
"......Certainly."
After grabbing the key to the study that Genji was holding out to her, Natsuhi rushed up the stairs.
She then flew into the study,
 ......and finally, ...she cried out loud.
".........Father......
 Please forgive our foolishness...!!
 My husband and I...
...aren\'t capable of inheriting all that you created...!
 Please......please,
 ............forgive us for our foolishness and our crimes...
 And,
 ...if you can forgive us,
 .........please guide the way for us fools......"
Clinging to Kinzo as he slept in the bed, Natsuhi cried even harder.
She kept imagining Kinzo sitting up suddenly and patting her head.
No, Father isn\'t the type of person to pamper...
{n}More likely, he\'d yell at me to stop being so noisy.
......However, neither of these imaginations would come true.
{n}...Because it was an undeniable fact that Kinzo had entered an eternal sleep.
{n}But even so, Natsuhi begged the sleeping Kinzo to forgive and help them...
It had only been a few hours since his passing.
Perhaps his soul was still here, listening to her.
......Believing this, Natsuhi begged for Kinzo\'s forgiveness and help even more earnestly......
{a:c:
"Noisy woman.
 Don\'t I always say that I value silence?"}
".........Huh—"
That voice made Natsuhi jump up in surprise.
When she faced in the direction that the voice had come from, .........she saw Kinzo sitting at the study desk, folding up his reading glasses...
"Did you get in a fight with Krauss again?
 ......Neglecting his wife...that Krauss only inherited my bad traits."
"F‐.........Father......"
"......What a wretched‐looking face.
 Wash it.
 Aren\'t you the wife of the successor to the Ushiromiya family?
 You mustn\'t let the servants see you wear such a shameful expression."
"Y‐......yes, Father...
 ...My apologies......"
......Natsuhi understood.
This was just an illusion, ...one that Natsuhi had created from her desire to speak with Kinzo and her memories of the man as he once was.
No, that\'s not it...
......She believed that just for now, Kinzo\'s soul had shown itself to her.
She was sure that doubting this would cause it to vanish in an instant...
"It seems that a family crisis has arisen the very instant the headship was passed on..."
"Y‐...yes, Father......
 I wasn\'t able to support my husband...
 ......I am truly...very sorry......"
"Hmph.
 The Ushiromiya family is so very cursed.
 It was in a terrible state when I succeeded the headship too.
 The hardships you two are suffering are trivial in comparison."
Kinzo\'s succession to the family headship came suddenly.
At the time, he was nothing more than a young man from one of the branch families, far separated from the Ushiromiya main family.
The main family might have had honor and tradition, but that was of no relevance at all to Kinzo, and he couldn\'t have cared less.
Then, the principal members of the main family were wiped out in the Great Kanto Earthquake, along with their businesses.
On top of that, there was a complicated antagonism between the members of the family at the time,
 and the elders were all trying to impose their will on the others in that sinking ship.
Because of this, they weren\'t even able to elect a leader to rebuild the Ushiromiya family.
They found common ground by selecting Kinzo, a youth with absolutely no ties to any of the opposing elders, to be the head.
So the elders hadn\'t really entrusted Kinzo with the rebuilding of the Ushiromiya family.
Kinzo had been nothing more than their puppet, with his arms and legs being pulled in opposite directions......
".........Yes.
 ...I know a lot about your days of suffering, Father."
"And then the war started.
 I was already tired of life at that point.
 I hoped to die on the battlefield, but I wasn\'t sent to the front lines.
 ......However, the state of the war grew worse with every day, and the time for the decisive battle on the Japanese mainland seemed to grow ever closer.
 As bad as it might sound, I hoped that day would come quickly..."
It was said that as Kinzo listened to Death\'s approaching footsteps day in and day out,
 ...he started cutting his ties with this world one by one.
And then, on that day when he had freed himself from all his attachments to life, and reached a state of enlightenment......
...he had a mystical experience.
......And he met her.
{n}The Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}......
"I made a contract with the witch and was given gold and the power of madness.
 ......On that day, the old me died, and a new me possessing the insane power of magic was born."
"...I know.
 And after the war,
 you used your ingenious cunning to revive the Ushiromiya family."
The now‐deceased elders who knew Kinzo at the time...
had whispered to each other that Kinzo must have taken a knock to the head on the battlefield and returned with a different personality...
That was how much Kinzo stood out after the war.
Whether the story about Kinzo meeting a witch was true or not,
 there could be no doubt that the extraordinary experience of war had prepared him for death...and let him reach a state of enlightenment.
Natsuhi must surely have felt that if Kinzo had decided to describe that resulting mystical experience as a meeting with a witch, that wasn\'t something she could flatly dispute...
"......That\'s right.
 ...You returned from the war,
 conquered the witch {f:5:Beatrice}, and became the head of the Ushiromiya family in the truest sense..."
"Correct.
 Before I met {f:5:Beatrice}, I was nothing more than a puppet and only the head in name.
 ......I only became the head after conquering the Golden Witch."
"......Father......
 Will this...Golden Witch...aid my husband Krauss now that he\'s the new head...?"
"Oh, she will.
 Assuming that he has truly succeeded the headship."
"Wh‐what do you mean by "truly succeeded"......?"
"I mean it depends on whether he bears the responsibility and pride of the Ushiromiya family head in the truest sense.
 ...Natsuhi, you should understand this.
 The headship is not inherited by blood.
 It is inherited through spirit and conviction.
 ......Even though Krauss is my eldest son, he cannot be called the true head if he does not possess these things!"
"And even someone other than Krauss would make a splendid new head so long as that spirit dwelled in their heart.
 The Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice} will lend her power to that true head.
 .........Isn\'t that right, {f:5:Beatrice}?!!"
When Kinzo called the witch\'s name, ......gold butterflies seethed out of every corner of the room.
This fantastical scene had an otherworldly beauty to it.
It was like standing in the midst of a blizzard of golden flower petals being blown about a rose garden of gold.
As Natsuhi stared at this scene in shock, the gold butterflies gathered and formed a human shape...
Then, ......the witch of the portrait appeared...
"Indeed.
 I am the Ushiromiya family alchemist, the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}.
 ......I am free to run rampant!
 I do not listen to anyone\'s orders."
"And there\'s only one person in the world who can control her.
 Me.
 ......That is why I am qualified to be the Ushiromiya family head."
"Hmph.
 So that pride of yours is what qualifies you to be the head?"
"Pride implies self‐confidence and bravery.
 And, it is the embodiment of the insatiable desire to gain the power to match.
 ...That is why I control you."
".........It is quite pleasant to watch men who speak of pride as they turn that desire into reality.
 The "quiet man of action" is nothing more than an excuse used by the extremely lucky.
 ...A true monarch also speaks of what he doesn\'t have.
 And he makes sure to turn that arrogance, that pride, into reality.
 ......If one is to control me, they must possess that monarch\'s pride."
"Do you understand, Natsuhi?
 A true monarch fears no hardship.
 They declare that they will overcome anything without fail.
 Even if they haven\'t yet figured out how.
 This gives hope to the weak people.
 They gather, revere the monarch, and swear to assist him.
 That is where power is gained and his word is carried out.
 Engrave that into your heart."
"Y‐.........yes, Father......"
Natsuhi understood.
Through this mystical experience, ...Kinzo was teaching her the attitude required to overcome hardship.
 ...Even after his own death.
Feeling a warm sensation rise up in her chest, she let the valuable words Kinzo had given her echo through her mind over and over.
......A true monarch,
 ...in other words,
 the true head of the Ushiromiya family...was not to fear hardship.
They had to believe that they could overcome any hardship...
 If they could not believe themselves capable, then there was no reason why they would be...
.........Natsuhi suddenly felt very ashamed of the way she had come into this room,
 sobbing and asking Kinzo what to do...
"I......was foolish..."
"..............."
"...Of course there\'s no time for crying when an Ushiromiya family crisis is upon us.
 And now that we have inherited the Ushiromiya family from you, Father, we must protect its honor no matter what."
"Hoh.
 ......Even though you can\'t even draw a blueprint on how to repay Krauss\'s debts?"
As {f:5:Beatrice} laughed unpleasantly,
 ......no, that wasn\'t it.
{n}She was testing Natsuhi, to see whether she possessed the mental readiness to be a true monarch.
Natsuhi didn\'t hesitate anymore.
{n}She answered clearly, gazing into {f:5:Beatrice}\'s eyes.
"Yes.
 At this moment, I have not yet discovered the method that we should pursue.
 However, my husband is the new head of the Ushiromiya family, and I am his supporting wife.
 So in my husband\'s place, I will proclaim it."
"Let us hear it."
"Ushiromiya Krauss and Natsuhi will definitely overcome these trials and protect the honor of the Ushiromiya family.
 You have nothing to worry about, Father."
"......You do know the scope of Krauss\'s debt, as well as the disastrous state things are in?"
"Yes.
 Things could hardly be worse—we could even be ordered to leave this mansion tomorrow, and we wouldn\'t be able to refuse.
 Once the distribution of the inheritance comes up, his relatives might even file a criminal complaint against us."
"However, there is no need to worry.
 We will repay all of the debts before then and restore our honor."
As she stood at attention with a resolute attitude,
 Natsuhi proclaimed this clearly with Ushiromiya Kinzo and {f:5:Beatrice} as witnesses.
For a while,
 they remained silent, as though weighing Natsuhi\'s resolve.
Then Kinzo chuckled and turned away...
"......How vexing.
 ...Why couldn\'t this person have been my son..."
"The very fact that a woman with such a disposition married your son is another sign of your great luck."
"............
 {f:5:Beatrice}.
 This is my final order."
"Now that you are no longer the head, I am not obligated to obey your orders."
"Hoh.
 In that case, obey the orders of the new Ushiromiya family head."
"You are no longer the head, and Krauss is not yet the head.
 Whom are you suggesting that I serve?"
"I will leave that to you.
 It is up to you to decide who is qualified to succeed the Ushiromiya family head, and who is fitting to bear the mark of the One‐winged Eagle.
 ......You will be witness."
"I refuse.
 I won\'t listen to the orders of a man who isn\'t the head."
"No, this is different.
 This is a will.
 The last order that the head left behind for you."
"......*cackle*.
 Then it seems I will have to obey.
 What a good friend I am."
"I think not."
"Hoh?"
"You\'re only doing this because it caught your interest."
"I can\'t hide anything from you, can I?"
"Natsuhi."
"Yes, Father..."
"Go and overcome your hardship."
"...Y‐.........yes."
To Natsuhi, that might have been nothing more than a simple response,
 but to Kinzo and {f:5:Beatrice}, it seemed to carry much greater significance.
{f:5:Beatrice} nodded deeply,
 and with a motion as elegant as her dress, she bowed deeply before Natsuhi...
"The Ushiromiya family alchemist, the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}, right here.
 I will give you my aid so that the Ushiromiya family can overcome crisis once again..."
"......Thank you.
 I will need your power.
 We will most certainly overcome these trials."
"I will not hold back on my support for your cause, but there is something I must warn you about beforehand.
 I understand that your troubles now could be solved if I were to bestow a vast quantity of gold again, like I did when I saved Kinzo from his crisis.
 However, that is something I cannot do."
".........I see."
"Sorry, Natsuhi.
 The contract for {f:5:Beatrice}\'s gold stated that it cannot be inherited.
 It was agreed that it could only be passed on to another if that person solves the witch\'s epitaph."
"The gold is sealed away by the epitaph.
 As long as that is not solved, I cannot give you the magic of gold."
".........I understand.
 Then I shall search for another method by which we can save ourselves from this crisis.
 ......My husband said that his plan would take time, but he also said that it would definitely be sufficient to repay our debts.
 If we can buy enough time for that to happen, we will be able to overcome this trial."
"Good, Natsuhi.
 Continue."
"But Kinzo is already dead.
 The doctor and servants are preparing his funeral,
 and you will be contacting the family members about it.
 The window of opportunity for you to raise money will be closed by your own hand.
 *cackle*cackle*, how charming is a guillotine where you lower the blade yourself..."
"..................Ah—"
Natsuhi gasped and looked up at the ceiling.
There wasn\'t actually anything there.
{n}......But even so, Natsuhi had found something.
"So, ......the magical power has descended."
"Natsuhi.
 ......Have you made up your mind?
 What magic of miracles do you desire from me?"
......All of those who had witnessed Kinzo\'s corpse were once again gathered in the study.
Krauss was still very unsettled and clutching at his head.
Genji was as expressionless as ever.
Nanjo and Kumasawa wore bewildered expressions on their faces.
But in stark contrast to all of them, Natsuhi\'s expression was resolute.
"Dear, let me ask you one more time.
 Your plan for raising money is absolutely certain?"
"......Y‐......yes.
 Give it a year, ...no, just half a year, and it will certainly bear fruit!
 But it\'s just impossible to hope for anything right this second......"
"Then we will wait."
"B‐but you said it yourself.
 ......Dad is already dead......"
"Father hasn\'t passed away.
 As you can see, he is as healthy as ever."
When Natsuhi said this, everyone looked up instantly, startled.
{n}...Because they immediately understood what those words meant...
However, Krauss alone didn\'t get it right away and had to ask.
"What......
do you mean by that......?
 Dad is right there,
 and he\'s......"
"I will say it again.
 Father is still in good health.
 He is busy with his research, so he\'ll be even less able to leave his study than usual.
 Because of this, we must handle all external affairs ourselves,
 so that Father can devote himself to his research without being burdened by meaningless tasks."
"In short, nothing will change from the way things have been up until now.
 .........Do you understand, Genji?"
"...............Yes.
 ...The furniture of the One‐winged Eagle will continue to serve the Master."
"Kumasawa.
 And you, Doctor Nanjo.
 Do you understand what I\'m saying?"
"......Oh, ...uh, ......ummm..."
"I‐......is this really what you want to do, Natsuhi‐san......?"
"It may be true that Father passed away today.
 But if everyone here right now believes, we can use magic to revive Father."
"I‐it\'s impossible, Madam...
 That\'s just too much...!"
"The time of death will be determined during the autopsy.
 We can\'t stop it from looking suspicious...!"
"Father will not pass away, so there will be no reason for there to be an autopsy."
Of course, she wasn\'t planning to make Kinzo live forever.
The fake life given to Kinzo would only last until Krauss could repay his debts.
After that, Kinzo\'s soul would finally be able to sleep in peace.
Nanjo repeated himself that the time of death would be discovered during the autopsy, but Natsuhi said again that this wouldn\'t be a problem.
"Father will not pass away by being reported dead."
"A‐.........ah, I see.
 ......He\'ll be reported missing...!!"
After clapping his hands together, Krauss stood up, shaking his fists.
"Yes.
 Once we\'ve managed to pay back the debt and finish the preparations to lay Father to rest, we will then announce that Father has disappeared."
Rokkenjima\'s vast, uncultivated forest was the perfect place to stage a disappearance.
One day, Kinzo would go out to the forest for a walk and never return.
 ......They would search for him without success and then be forced to report his disappearance...
"If he disappears, we can file a report of his death even without a corpse.
 In other words, we can conceal the time of death!
 What do you think, Doctor Nanjo?!
 There won\'t be any problems this way!"
"Y‐......yes, I can see the logic, but......"
"...Are you sure about this, Madam...?
 Y‐yes, if all of us can keep quiet, then perhaps we could keep it a secret that the Master has passed away...!
 But there are so many ways that one of us could slip up and allow someone to find out...!!"
"Kumasawa.
 Keep your voice down.
 ......Have you forgotten that Father is sleeping right over there?
 Are you trying to wake him?"
It isn\'t a corpse.
 ...Kinzo...is sleeping.
As Natsuhi said that,
 ......Kinzo lay quietly on the bed, as though there was nothing at all odd about her words.
"Come, try to remember.
 What form did you have?
 What sort of life did you enjoy?!"
Once again, a storm of gold butterflies started to swirl, covering Kinzo\'s cold body...
Then, after the butterflies exploded into fine gold powder and disappeared,
 .........just like those fairy tales that have been told over and over since long ago, ......Kinzo slowly opened his eyes and sat up...
".........F‐......Father......!!"
"......Natsuhi.
 Let me first make one thing clear.
 I did not coax you into doing this because I have an attachment to life."
"You liar.
 Don\'t tell me you didn\'t anticipate this at least a little.
 How does it feel, Kinzo?
 How is your body?"
"It isn\'t bad, but it feels somewhat like being in a dream.
 I feel light."
"A being not permitted to remain in this world still remains here.
 You\'ll have to accept a little discomfort."
"...Is your body truly alright?!
 Are you really...alright...?!"
"Mm.
 Actually, this feels quite pleasant.
 ......If this is what the world after death feels like, playing the part of a ghost might not be so bad."
"How is this, Natsuhi?
 Kinzo has revived.
 That means a funeral is unnecessary.
 Your hardship has been resolved!"
"......B‐{f:5:Beatrice}..."
As Natsuhi tried to find words of gratitude,
 {f:5:Beatrice} waggled her index finger and spoke.
"There is no need for thanks.
 A ruler should be proud.
 I do not pay heed to requests, but I do follow orders."
"I\'ll say it even so.
 ......Thank you.
 This way, ......you\'ve bought some time for my husband...
 ......We will handle the rest."
"Be warned, Natsuhi.
 Kinzo may have revived, but that is not an eternal thing.
 It will only continue as long as my magic does."
"......Be warned that the anti‐magic toxin might destroy the magic.
 You must understand the laws of magic correctly and work hard to maintain it.
 I can show you a miracle, but it is your role to grasp it and hold it together."
"Of course.
 We won\'t neglect the miracle you have given us."
"Very good.
 ...I see... It seems masters do need to be changed every once in a while, just like floor mats.
 *cackle*cackle*!
 I like it.
 I shall serve you."
"Ushiromiya Natsuhi!
 I am the Ushiromiya family alchemist, the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}...!!
 Call my name whenever you wish. I shall then appear and grant you a miracle."
"Thank you.
 I am Ushiromiya Natsuhi.
 I will employ you to protect the honor of the Ushiromiya family...!!"The rose garden was truly splendid this year.
{n}The roses were blooming like crazy, as though they were competing with each other.
In that rose garden, Kinzo, Kanon, and Natsuhi could be seen...
"Once again, the flowers have grown wonderfully this year.
 It must be the result of your care."
".........Thank you very much.
 The weather just happened to be good this year."
"Thanks to your care, the garden is even more beautiful than usual.
 Good work."
"Thank you very much..."
"If today weren\'t so special...
we might have been able to admire the roses while enjoying some black tea."
Kinzo shrugged.
 Today was the family conference.
......When it came to the other siblings\' businesses, they hadn\'t heard anything good.
On the contrary, those siblings probably planned to turn the conversation to the topic of Kinzo\'s remaining life,
 and hold a quiet feud over the inheritance.
"......Those people are quite unpleasant.
 By the way, what about Krauss?
 Is that debt repayment plan of his proceeding well?"
"It really does seem to be a realistic plan.
 .........However, the scale of the plan appears to be quite large, and it doesn\'t seem to be bearing fruit as well as he expected."
"If possible, I had hoped that something could be done before today\'s family conference."
"......Yes.
 My apologies."
"Are you sure that\'s alright, Kinzo?
 Casually walking around in a place like that."
How had she gotten up there?
{n}......Well, it\'s pretty pointless to wonder about that sort of thing when you\'re dealing with a witch.
{f:5:Beatrice} was casually sitting on the roof of the arbor,
 almost as though she had been basking in the sun.
"Those relatives are like a massive lump of the anti‐magic toxin, and they\'ll be intruding on us.
 If you bump into them, your soul will evaporate in a instant."
"Hmph.
 I am already dead.
 Even evaporating would be no detriment."
"......We can\'t have that happen.
 Please, for the sake of the Ushiromiya family, lend us your strength just a little longer."
"Natsuhi.
 It seems that the boat with the relatives on it has left the harbor.
 It might be a good idea to end your walk soon."
"......Is that so?
 Thank you.
 ...Please return to the study, Father."
"Just great...
 A shame that I must go back when the weather is so perfect."
"Don\'t grumble, Kinzo.
 Right now, you are nothing more than a ghost that I gave life to.
 It\'ll be troublesome for both me and Natsuhi if you\'re scattered away by the toxin.
 Just be a good boy, shut yourself away in the study, and put a blanket over yourself or something.
 *cackle*cackle*!"
"Hmph.
 ......Just being given the chance to enjoy the roses even after death makes me extremely fortunate.
 I understand.
 I shall return to the study."
"But I would like some black tea.
 Kanon, tell Genji to bring me some.
 Some Marco Polo would be nice today."
"......Certainly."
"Then let\'s go our separate ways.
 Natsuhi.
 ......I want you to conduct the family conference splendidly without me."
"Of course, Father.
 He can\'t say it in front of them, but my husband is already the Ushiromiya family head.
 And, I will do all I can to see that I don\'t embarrass him as his wife."
"......Compared to Krauss, who\'s had a stomachache since this morning, you are so very composed, Natsuhi.
 ......My son is quite hopeless."
"My husband is talented in his own way.
 Supporting him where he\'s weak is my duty as his wife."
"Mm.
 Give it your best.
 I will make sure to stay shut away so that I don\'t get in the way of this farce."
"Kanon.
 Go with Father to the study.
 And then have Genji serve some black tea."
"I\'m not so senile that I need your help to stand up.
 Here I go......"
Refusing Kanon\'s attempt to lend him a hand, Kinzo rose from the flower bed he had been sitting on.
The retired head left everything in Natsuhi\'s hands and returned to the study at a gentle pace......
"......You\'re looking well.
 You possess a sense of dignity similar to Kinzo\'s deceased wife."
"On the off‐chance that the anti‐magic toxin does get to Father,
 ......will the magic dissolve in an instant?"
"Yes.
 In the blink of an eye.
 ......I can simply erase my form if necessary,
 but if someone already dead such as Kinzo loses his form, he will be blown away by the winds of the sun and disappear like dust in a matter of seconds.
 You must take care."
"Yes.
 I understand."
".........You might have talent as a witch.
 The anti‐magic toxin has been building up in your system over the years,
 and yet you are still able to understand magic.
 ......If you and I had met during your youth, you might have become a powerful witch by now."
"I am Ushiromiya Krauss\'s wife, the head\'s wife.
 I would become even a witch or a demon to protect his honor.
 ......I am deeply grateful for the power of your magic.
 I wouldn\'t have been able to protect the honor of the Ushiromiya family without you."
"Let\'s discuss that at another time.
 I\'d like to enjoy it with just the two of us women drinking tea."
"A friend of mine who went to Sri Lanka sent me some black tea with a wonderful rose fragrance."
"Hoh, you mean Dimbula.
 That isn\'t bad.
 Then you should also have patis on the side.
 ......You must serve me some as a reward if I manage to trick everyone for the whole upcoming family conference.
 Promise me now."
"Understood.
 I promise.
 Then, I\'ll see you later."
"Mm. Later it is."
The witch made her body crumble into the rustling winds, became gold flower petals, and scattered into thin air.
Natsuhi watched her go, then turned on her heels and headed for the mansion.
After that, there was no one left in the rose garden......
"Alright then.
 It\'s <break time>.
 Any complaints about how things have gone so far?"
".........None at all.
 If you gotta pee, why don\'t you just go and do it...?"
"What a rude thing to say.
 {p:1:Kinzo is already dead}, remember?
 But he\'s walking around and talking, isn\'t he?
 Doesn\'t that mean this is magic?!"
"Well, I doubt this move would work on you after all this time, Bern.
 ......But what about you, Battler?
 Isn\'t this weird?
 Don\'t you have to accept the existence of the magic that revived Kinzo?
 Hahhi{0}hhyah{0}ha{0}haaaah!"
"......If you\'re trying to imitate Beato,
 stop it right now, \'cause it\'s pissing me off."
"*giggle*!
 Figured it out?!
 Then come on, how are you gonna answer, Battler?
 Kinzo was just out for a stro~ll."
"Why don\'t you do what you usually do and start holding your head, crying "{i:this doesn\'t make any sense!!}"...?
 C\'mon, use that old "{i:it\'s no goddamn good at all}" catch phrase and let me hear your classic crazy counterargument."
"There\'s no way that a human who\'s supposed to be dead could be walking around, right?
 Is this all because of some unknown virus called the Rokkenjima Syndrome which causes mass delusions?
 Or do the scales of a mysterious form of butterfly that only lives on Rokkenjima happen to be hallucinogenic?!
 Or is it all because a mysterious secret organization called "Yamainu" made an as‐of‐yet undiscovered drug called Purupurupikopuyo which causes mass delusions?!!"
"Let me hear tons of this wonderful crap,
 kyaaa{0}ha{0}ha{0}haa{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"
".........Just shut up.
 This isn\'t even a problem."
{p:1:Grandfather is dead at this point in time}.
 There\'s no way he exists.
"The only reason everything\'s behaving as though he actually exists...
is because that\'s the lie that Aunt Natsuhi\'s creating in an attempt to hide Grandfather\'s death and trick her way through the family conference."
"Oh?
 It\'s Natsuhi\'s lie?
 You can revive the dead by lying?
 Wouldn\'t that make it Natsuhi\'s magic?"
"This world is like a Braun tube before you\'ve looked in it.
 ......It\'s the world of the cat box before you open it."
"As long as Aunt Natsuhi says that she took a walk with Grandfather, and as long as no one can confirm that that\'s a lie,
 it\'s possible to display "Aunt Natsuhi taking a walk in the rose garden with Grandfather" as Natsuhi\'s reality.
 That means it\'s possible for Grandfather to appear."
Clap, clap, clap...
That extremely unflattering applause was coming from {f:5:Bernkastel}.
"......Bravo.
 ............You\'re much calmer without Beato around."
"Quiet.
 You shut up too."
"Wait a second, Battler.
 According to your theory, sure, it might really be possible for Kinzo to appear if Natsuhi\'s the only person there.
 If Natsuhi claims to have observed Kinzo in a world with no one except Natsuhi in it, then no one can deny it, right?"
"But Kanon was in the same place, and he was also looking at Kinzo, right?
 How would you explain that?"
"...That\'s no problem at all.
 Kanon‐kun is a servant who works for the Ushiromiya family.
 ......Aunt Natsuhi probably ordered him to keep to her story so that she can hide Grandfather\'s death.
 ......This means that just like Aunt Natsuhi, Kanon can see Grandfather even though Grandfather isn\'t supposed to exist."
"............Too bad, Lambda.
 Battler isn\'t going to fall for that kind of child\'s play anymore."
"Seems so.
 ......Well, this is nothing more than an opening before the game.
 Like an apéritif before a meal."
".........An appetizer at a bar.
 Green tea at a sushi restaurant."
"Shut up.
 So we aren\'t gonna get anywhere unless I say it again in blue text?"
"Looks like it.
 Would you mind?"
"............
 ......
{p:2:The reason Grandfather is strolling around like nothing happened even though he\'s already dead...
is that people who want to make it seem as though he\'s alive created an illusion of him.
 Everyone with the same intention can share in that illusion.
 Then, they talk as though Grandfather actually exists and was with them until a second ago.
 That\'s why he\'s strolling around like it\'s perfectly natural}."
"
{p:2:Because of this, the illusion of Grandfather is unable to appear in front of people who aren\'t in on this with Aunt Natsuhi}.
 {p:2:That\'s why they needed to set it up so that he would shut himself away in his study and not come out}."
In the games before now, Grandfather was always shut away in his study.
We never met him directly.
However, there were some people who spoke in a way that made it seem like he was locked up in his study in a bad mood,
 and who claimed to have met him only a short while ago.
 We blindly accepted that and believed that Grandfather was in the study.
{a:c:
{i:That\'s why it was possible for an illusion of Grandfather to exist in the study}.}
That\'s right, in the games before now,
 the only people who met Grandfather were Uncle Krauss,
 Aunt Natsuhi, and the servants.
{p:2:Because they all stuck to the same story,
 an illusion of Grandfather was able to exist on this island, making it seem like he was alive}.
"......You were even kind enough to show me a scene at the beginning of this game...
of Aunt Natsuhi convincing Doctor Nanjo and the rest to cover up Grandfather\'s death.
 ......I\'m not gonna fall for this kind of cheap trick now."
".........Not bad.
 But I was hoping for the unknown drug Purupurupikopuyo."
"There\'s no way he\'d say something so ridiculous, right......?
 After all, supposing that such a thing exists would be just as bad as surrendering to the fantasy genre.
 ......Whether it\'s a virus or a drug or an illness, anything that hasn\'t been discovered yet is in violation of Knox\'s fourth commandment."
"......What do you mean, fourth commandment?"
"Knox\'s 4th:
 It is forbidden for unknown drugs or obscure scientific devices to be used.
 .........It\'s a rule that these cannot be used for murder."
"What?
 I don\'t know what world you\'ve been living in, but unknown drug X and unknown scientific device X are the best kinds of weapons to use when fighting against a witch..."
".........Yes, those.
 They all violate the rules of proper mystery stories.
 Supposing an unknown virus,
 an unknown drug,
 ...an unknown sickness, or an unknown X was used puts it totally in the fantasy genre.
 My condolences.
 If that was your theory, then it\'s game over for you.
 *giggle*giggle*."
".........H‐hey...
 What are you talking about......?"
"You think you\'ve been fighting in direct opposition to Beato.
 But that\'s not actually true.
 You haven\'t been in direct opposition.
 You\'ve been fighting from a diagonal angle."
"All this playing detective you\'ve done hasn\'t been fantasy vs. mystery.
 It\'s only been fantasy vs anti‐fantasy."
"......I don\'t have a clue what you\'re talking about.
 ...But there\'s one thing I do get.
 ......It sounds like you\'re saying there\'s something wrong with the way I\'ve been fighting."
".........We are fighting to kill the fantasy known as the witch illusion.
 That means interpreting this tale...
as a {i:proper mystery}.
 In other words, from the very start, we have to forget about any and all elements that would violate the taboos of the mystery genre."
"F‐...forget about them.........?"
"For example, several locked‐room murders have occurred in the games before now, right?"
"......Y‐...yeah."
At every single crime scene, to make sure there are no hidden doors,
 you\'ve been enthusiastically checking with Beato, haven\'t you?
Weaving a flashy bunch of red truths together all over the place,
 almost as though that itself was the battle.
I call that a waste of time.
After all, it\'s clearly specified by Knox\'s third commandment.
"It is forbidden for hidden passages to exist."
In the mystery genre, hidden passages {i:mustn\'t exist}.
So when trying to interpret everything as a proper mystery,
 having a debate over whether there are hidden doors or not is a defeat from the beginning, don\'t you see...?
After all, {i:there aren\'t any}.
As soon as you suspect that they might exist, then it\'s already game over for you.
In other words, the way you assume that you can\'t use reason just because it hasn\'t been proven that hidden doors don\'t exist at the crime scene...
makes you simply naive and a failure at mysteries.
 You\'ve already lost once you start thinking that.
You were trying to interpret everything within the bounds of the mystery genre, right...?
Then you\'ve got to follow its conventions.
 ...*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*, hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hyah{0}hah{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha...!!
"*cough*.
 .........That\'s how it is.
 Hidden doors must not exist at any of the crime scenes.
 That means anything you do to try and check whether they exist or not is a waste of time."
"...I think I know what you\'re talking about.
 I\'ve heard about it somewhere.
 Is this like the ten basic rules for mystery novels or something?"
"Yeah, that\'s right.
 They\'re the ten witch‐piercing wedges brandished by Knox, the peerless archbishop of witch hunting.
 Those are the true weapons with which to fight and defeat the fantasy known as the witch illusion head‐on."
"......Just like you, Bern.
 Bringing in such annoying weapons.
 They\'re the fantasy side\'s worst enemies."
"..................
 So you deny the existence of hidden doors right from the start, without even investigating the crime scene...
 {i:That\'s} what sounds like fantasy to me..."
"Lambda, who\'s in charge of the witch side, is fantasy.
 I\'m the one who\'s fighting her, mystery.
 What are you?
 The most you can do is repeatedly dodge and deny fantasy, which makes you merely "anti‐fantasy".
 You\'re opposed to absolutely everything, but you can make no counter‐proposals.
 You\'re like a politician from some government.
 *giggle*giggle*."
"Shut up.
 I didn\'t come here to speak gibberish with you two.
 Just get on with the story...!!"
"......Quiet down.
 That sleeping princess behind you is suffering, you know?"
When he turned around, he saw Beato\'s living corpse resting in a chair...
However, sweat glistened all over her body and it felt like she was breathing a little harder than normal.
......She looked as though she was suffering from a high fever.
"Beato......
 What\'s wrong... Are you okay...?"
"What do you mean, {i:okay}?
 You sure do say some strange things.
 ......You\'re fighting to {i:kill} that girl."
"..............."
"We\'ve rewound this fifth game for your benefit,
 but where we\'re at right now, Bern\'s cornered me pretty good and she\'s about to break through the witch illusion.
 ...That girl\'s existence has been almost completely denied.
 It\'s only natural that she\'s suffering."
".........Even just now,
 you smashed a witch illusion by saying there was no way Kinzo existed.
 ......This is the proof that your attack reached Beato.
 This agony of hers."
"....................."
......I tried to at least wipe away the sweat on Beato\'s forehead with a handkerchief.
It\'s true I promised Beato that I\'d let her die.
{n}But that was supposed to be......peacefully.
{n}I wasn\'t planning to make her suffer first.
......My goal isn\'t to make the sleeping Beato suffer like this before killing her......
As if the complicated feelings inside me were plain as day to them,
 the two witches grinned together...
"Dammit, Aneki, Dad overheard because you kept yelling about the inheritance!"
"It isn\'t my fault, how was I supposed to know?!
 He just happened to be in the corridor and heard! It was an unlucky coincidence!"
"Could you two give it a rest......?
 Just call it our bad luck this time and give it up.
 If you leave a man alone, his mood\'ll pop right back to normal."
"Hopefully Father\'s feelings weren\'t hurt so much that he writes up some strange will."
The relatives sighed deeply and fell into silence...
"Hey! Maria! No jumping around!
 What if Ange‐chan trips over?!"
".........Sorry to keep you waiting.
 The boat is ready."
"Alright, let\'s go.
 Won\'t get anywhere by complainin\' now."
"We eagerly await your return to this island."
Natsuhi was sitting on a bench in the rose garden, looking completely worn out.
However, when she noticed that Kanon and Kumasawa were coming back, she immediately sat up straight, regaining the dignity of the head\'s wife.
"......Did the boat leave?"
"Yes.
 It departed just a minute ago."
"I see.
 Good job seeing them off.
 ......What is my husband doing?"
"He returned to his room a short while ago.
 He is resting."
Since the previous day, Krauss had been almost overwhelmed by anxiety over the thought that Kinzo\'s death might be discovered.
When the family conference ended, his weariness must have suddenly gotten ahold of him.
......However, the way he had refused to let even a sliver of his true intentions slip out...
and the manner in which he had managed to act as though everything was normal showed that Krauss\'s nerve was nothing to sneeze at.
".........How was it?
 Did they seem to notice anything suspicious about Father...?"
"Nope.
 Eva‐sama in particular was raising quite the racket about the Master overhearing her talking about the inheritance. Right?
 Wasn\'t her panicking just priceless?"
"Yes.
 She was quite shaken up."
"Kumasawa, you really are quite an actress.
 All that panic in the corridor made it seem like Father really was there."
".........Kumasawa‐san is quite talented at that sort of thing."
"Oooh, come now, I don\'t deserve such praise.
 Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho."
"*giggle*.
 I will have to make it very clear to Genji not to believe you easily when you call in sick."
"Now that\'s just too harsh, Madam.
 Oh‐hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho..."
"You really did a good job.
 As promised, both of you, as well as Genji and Shannon,
 will be reimbursed for the time off you\'ve sacrificed over the past month, and will receive five days of additional pay.
 This bonus is a secret.
 Speak with Genji when you collect your pay to ensure that the other servants don\'t find out."
"Don\'t you worry, we understand.
 Don\'t we?"
".........Kumasawa‐san.
 Your voice is too loud."
"Ooh, how very careless of me... Hoh‐hoh‐ho."
"Yes, we should be careful.
 Let\'s leave it at that for the time being.
 All of you, please return to your regular duties.
 Oh, that\'s right, I had Gohda prepare some special tea.
 Tell him to serve it."
Natsuhi let them know that she wanted to be left alone for a while,
 so that she could drink some black tea in the rose garden.
That black tea, carried all the way to the bench,
 ...was the Sri Lankan tea Dimbula that she had promised Beato, along with patis...
And sitting on either side of it, the wife of the head and her witch could be seen, both of them staring at it curiously.
"......So this is patis...
 I just assumed it would be some kind of baked sweet..."
Natsuhi hadn\'t thought for a moment that it would have a curry‐like spicy flavor, and had started coughing after putting it in her mouth.
To describe it in Japanese terms, it was like {ruby:fried dumplings:age‐gyoza} stuffed with mashed, curry‐flavored potatoes.
As a savory snack, it would probably be pretty popular with the kids.
However, it was something of a shock to Natsuhi, who expected that a treat to go with tea would be something sweet.
"Didn\'t you know?
 You cannot have Dimbula without this.
 Were it another black tea, it would be cookies.
 Oh, but chocolate is good too.
 With Japanese tea, sweet bean jelly is the tradition, although salted konbu also works.
 With Chinese tea, you have {ruby:Chinese dumplings:xiaolongbao}.
 Though I like moon cakes as well."
"......I\'m surprised.
 You know a lot about culture, don\'t you?"
"Well, I haven\'t been living a thousand years for nothing.
 I have sampled all the finest teas from around the world.
 Perhaps you could call me a tea traveler."
"That does seem like it would be a wonderful way to "travel the world".
 Before today, I never knew that one could enjoy tea like this.
 I will treasure this experience."
"I cannot leave Rokkenjima.
 This is the only way I can travel.
 What about you?
 I\'m sure you\'ve traveled the world in luxury as the wife of a rich man should."
"............Before Jessica was born, my husband took me to many countries.
 Before marrying, I never once traveled overseas, so each time was a fresh and new experience."
"......Hmph.
 Sounds like you were also born into a very restrictive household."
"..................
 ...It was strict, but they gave me a wonderful upbringing.
 It would be rude to my father and mother to call that restrictive."
"That tells me eloquently that it was. *cackle*."
Krauss might have pitied Natsuhi.
Or, he might have wanted to take her away from the restrictive Ushiromiya family for a little bit and let her rest.
......Or, he might simply have wanted to take his wife around countries he knew well and show off everything he knew.
"Unlike Father, my husband likes countries in Asia.
 Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea, Thailand.
 I think we also went to Malaysia."
"*cackle*cackle*.
 That Krauss...was he trying to rebel against Kinzo\'s Western obsession?
 But Asia is good too.
 The Japanese are strongly influenced by the West.
 When they think of foreign countries, only Western ones come to mind.
 But the East exists as well."
"I myself knew a few things about the West, but I knew very little about the Orient...
 I seem to recall my husband making fun of me now and then during our travels."
As Natsuhi grumbled that they had all been very tiring trips, Beato secretly peeked into her heart.
"Now, listen.
 This is called an areca nut.
 It\'s a popular luxury food item around here."
It looked like a small, round, gourd‐like nut that had been split open, with a slice of cucumber wedged in it.
At a glance, it looked as though it would probably taste like pickles.
"I, I see.
 So I just bite it here...?"
As she tried to bite the one her husband was holding, he suddenly moved it away.
...It felt kind of embarrassing, like she was a fish who took the bait.
"Whoa, wait up.
 You have to eat it a certain way.
 Yes, you are supposed to bite it.
 Bite it.
 Chew it.
 But don\'t eat it."
"Huh?
 Even though you bite and chew it, you can\'t eat it?"
"Yes.
 Bite and chew.
 Don\'t eat.
 And don\'t drink the juice.
 It\'ll make your stomach hurt."
"I, I don\'t understand...
 Why would you eat something like that??"
"Think of it as something like gum.
 Chew it and enjoy the flavor.
 Spit the juice and the scraps you\'ve chewed off into a paper cup like this."
"......D‐dear,
 the inside of your mouth is bright red...!
 Wipe it off, wipe it off.
 ......Eeek!"
The handkerchief she had wiped Krauss\'s mouth with, a favorite of hers, also had bright red marks on it now.
Something that\'s poisonous if eaten or drunk, and it makes the inside of your mouth so bright red,
 and on top of that, having to spit something out after you\'ve put it in your mouth...how indecent!
 ......Thinking this, Natsuhi firmly refused what Krauss was offering her.
"No. No! No, thank you. Thank you, but no...!"
"This is a cross‐cultural experience.
 What\'s the point of traveling if we don\'t do things that can only be done here?"
Krauss kept chewing, ignoring the fact that even his lips were being colored bright red.
"Father likes these too.
 He must have ordered some long ago, because he used to chew away at them on the mansion\'s terrace.
 Although he seems to have stopped ever since you came here."
"Come on! Father, the person you respect even more than me, chewed these all the time.
 Come on, come on, don\'t hold back, try it."
"No, no! Stop it! Stop i~t! De~~ar!"
......When he was traveling the world, Krauss had the innocence of a child.
He wouldn\'t even conceal his jealousy of the respect Natsuhi normally gave Kinzo.
Just being able to see that side of her husband made traveling all the way to another country worthwhile...
Krauss kept on urging her to bite it,
 but Natsuhi, undaunted, ran from place to place and finally yelled at him that he was being too pushy.
Krauss was miffed for most of the bus ride.
What a child, to let something like this get him down,
 Natsuhi thought, astounded.
Then, a native tour guide on the bus took out one of those areca nuts and started explaining about it.
He talked about how it had been a beloved luxury item in these parts since ancient times, similar to tobacco.
About how its popularity was declining because young people were starting to take a dislike to it, just like Natsuhi.
......And about how it was treated as a good luck charm in this area,
 and was known as a symbol for couples.
She looked at her husband\'s face.
 ......He turned away abruptly, but it looked like his cheeks had gotten a little red...
"And then...
you leaned on your husband and held his hand, I\'ll bet?!
 What the heck, you and your husband share a pretty pure love, don\'t you?!
 Did you get all fired u~p?
 You know, like, that night{p:0:♪}
 Kiiihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi!!"
Red‐faced and avoiding Beato\'s eye, Natsuhi tried to hide her embarrassment by stuffing the patis whole into her mouth,
 chewing with her cheeks puffed out like a blowfish.
Beato said that there was nothing better than this to go with tea,
 and nodded several times, a broad smile on her face...
"Of course, that was when we were newlyweds.
 Right now, I cannot even leave Rokkenjima.
 I\'m a bird in a cage."
"Well, it\'s the same for me.
 I have died more than once, and still I can\'t escape Rokkenjima.
 I\'m a bird in a cage just as you are."
"I don\'t know much about you, and I won\'t pry.
 ......However, I can imagine that the circumstances you\'re under are not ones I can make light of."
"I have no desire to act like the chief prisoner here.
 Let\'s be friendly as fellow birds in this cage.
 I\'ve taken a liking to you."
"Really?
 Thank you."
"The instructions and orders you gave the servants for this family conference were superb.
 You thought of everything from where Kinzo would be and when to what he did and what he left behind,
 and you put it all together splendidly without any contradictions.
 That detailed written plan of yours had the same beauty as a high‐level magic circle."
To make it look like Kinzo actually existed and was living life his own way,
 she had written his schedule for the day down to the finest detail and made the servants follow it to the letter.
Who did he meet, when and where did he meet them, and what did he leave with them?
{n}What was he doing, when and where was he doing it, and what did he change?
As a result, even though the relatives hadn\'t seen Kinzo even once,
 they never suspected in the slightest that he hadn\'t been there.
Eva and the rest truly believed that their conversation about the inheritance had been overheard by Kinzo as he happened to walk through the hall, and that it had sent him into a rage.
Everything had gone just as Natsuhi\'s plan had predicted, down to the finest detail.
{n}And the coordination between the two of them and the servants had also been spectacularly intricate......
"We couldn\'t afford to have this secret found out under any circumstances.
 That\'s why I made such a thorough plan."
"Your willpower and attention to detail summoned success with certainty.
 ......As a witch, it seems that you\'re in Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}\'s camp.
 At your current level, as soon as you become self‐aware of that as magic, you will be worthy of calling yourself a witch apprentice."
"If you call something like that magic, then that would make Kumasawa the witch of feigned illnesses.
 She only calls us to say she\'s taking the day off because of her bad back on the busy days.
 Like every year\'s family conference."
"Oh no, Kumasawa is completely different.
 She\'s a witch of a much, much higher level.
 If you knew what she really was, it\'d shock you!
 *cackle*cackle*!"
Watching these two have their pleasant chat...
was another pair with steam rising from their black tea.
However, this second pair was in a world that the first couldn\'t see, where golden roses bloomed.
"......Ronove was kind enough to make us some of that Dimbula tea too."
".................................nn..."
It felt as though Beato muttered something.
{n}For the first time, it felt as though she had been able to communicate something.
Surely, she had taken an interest in the black tea and felt like drinking it...
Thinking this, Battler took Beato\'s cup and her hand, and made her grip the cup...
"...............nn, ..............."
Beato\'s eyes trembled sadly, and her fingers shook.
Almost as though she couldn\'t even move her fingers as she wanted to...
...and was mourning the fact that she could no longer even enjoy the tea she had once loved without assistance...
 That was how she looked...
So Battler rested his hand on Beato\'s, softly took hold of the tea cup, and lifted it to her lips......
......Then, ...though it was only a single mouthful, ...Beato sipped.
The days in which they had been in a killing‐fest with red swords and blue wedges...
already seemed like the distant past.
Now, not only was Beato unable to do that, ......it was even difficult for her to make her body do as she pleased.
Even just drinking a mouthful of black tea like this was hard......
"......How is it?
 That rose aroma makes for a great black tea.
 Do you like it...?"
".............................."
Of course,
 .........Beato didn\'t respond.
"......What happened to you...?
 ......This is...another strategy, right?
 You\'re pretending to be in a slump so you can shock me later."
"..........................."
"......If that\'s what you\'re after, the same trick won\'t work again, so give it a rest.
 ......If you keep acting like that, even I\'ll start to feel out of whack."
"..........................."
"Hey.
 ...Isn\'t it about time for you to start laughing loudly, saying "Caught you, dumbass!" or something?
 Any kind of joke stops being funny if you use it too much.
 Especially if it\'s a rehash."
"..........................."
"Laugh.
 Just like you\'re cackling over there as you drink with Aunt Natsuhi."
"..........................."
"..............."
"...............................................................................................................................................................{0}..."
"............Can\'t you at least grin...?"
"Never again.
 This child will never laugh again."
Those sudden words......were exceedingly cruel.
"How can you say that for sure?!
 Quit trying to steal away Beato\'s right to laugh."
"......Oh, should I say it in red, then...?"
I shook my head furiously.
Then, with an expression that didn\'t reveal her thoughts in the slightest, {f:5:Bernkastel} spoke while looking at Beato\'s face.
 ......And I didn\'t understand the word she used in the slightest.
{a:c:
"Congratulations."}
".........For what?"
"Beato is like this as a result of your victory."
".........What are you talking about......?"
"You said something interesting in a previous game.
 You said that this would be eternal torture where you both torment each other.
 That was right.
 It was torture for Beato as well.
 And you {i:won} that torture game.
 ......That\'s why Beato\'s soul was killed, and why she became a doll‐like corpse."
"Are you saying......that I did this to Beato?"
"The battle ends when one of you loses the will to try and win.
 ......As far as the battle between you and Beato goes, the conclusion was already reached last time.
 Well, it probably happened without you noticing, though."
".........In that case, why hasn\'t the game ended when I\'ve already won?
 ...Why is this game still continuing?"
"The shackle attached to that girl\'s ankle.
 ......That\'s a rule Lambda made."
Even if {f:5:Beatrice} tries to yield or gets discouraged or gives up,
 she isn\'t capable of stepping down from the game.
......That\'s the rule.
 Or maybe it\'s a curse.
"Some time ago, when it looked like you were going to give in,
 I gave you my support.
 Though you probably couldn\'t perceive it,
 I assisted you by making sure that you would receive hints and things would go your way.
 That\'s why you\'re able to be here now.
 ............Do you remember? How I helped you?"
{f:5:Bernkastel} stared at me...
......It\'s true I wasn\'t aware of it,
 ......but maybe it was true...
that she had helped me.
"In the same way, Lambda is supporting Beato.
 And this time, it\'s Beato who\'s on the verge of giving in.
 So to make sure that she doesn\'t, this time it\'s Lambda who\'s been giving her support.
 That\'s what the shackle is.
 By refusing to let her resign, she\'s saved Beato within the game."
"......How is this "saving her"?"
"This game was made with only two ways for it to end.
 Either one side accepts defeat and resigns,
 or one side wins the game with a checkmate.
 Beato was about to collide with the first way.
 That\'s why Lambda crushed that chance and managed to just barely avoid her losing.
 That\'s a wonderful bit of support within this game."
In that case, the only way left for this game to end......is for me to win.
At the very least, until I do win,
 this witch called {f:5:Lambdadelta} can probably try to buy time for Beato\'s condition to turn back around.
But that......would just prolong Beato\'s suffering even more...
Neither of us want that.
Both Beato and I fought with all we had trying to win.
It was because we were both giving it everything we could muster that the game repeated several times to begin with.
And that was also why, that one time,
 we confronted each other head‐on with all of our strength.
And Beato.........admitted defeat.
She said she wanted me to end this game...and entrusted everything to me.
So, {f:5:Bernkastel}\'s words were the truth.
She said it was my fault that Beato had become a living corpse.
 ......That was true.
But it was something both of us wanted.
"Our match has already been resolved.
 ......Even so, the game won\'t end.
 That\'s why Beato put her trust in me.
 She told me to win quickly and end this game."
"..............."
Now that the game has been resolved, for it to continue any further would be torture without end to Beato.
 ......Nothing more than a nightmare.
I have to give her a perfect checkmate, end this game in the truest sense,
 ......and give Beato a peaceful sleep...
For that reason, I\'ll keep fighting.
But by continuing the game, Beato\'s eternal torture will continue.
It felt as though I could only let her sleep peacefully by slowly strangling her to death...
".........I\'m starting to feel like the truth doesn\'t matter anymore.
 ...Who gives a crap about the game if Beato is satisfied?
 Beato resigned.
 I\'ll ignore the truth of the witch illusions and return home with my family.
 ......What\'s wrong with that?"
If only {f:5:Lambdadelta} hadn\'t placed the curse of that shackle on her, this battle would be over already.
......That\'s why I find it detestable.
This game, where I have to torment Beato even more to end it,
 ......is detestable.
"......What\'s thiiis?
 Beato has started to look like she\'s in pain every time you get closer to the truth, so you\'re suddenly going easy on her...?
 Then just go as easy on her as you can.
 And why don\'t you just let Beato win while you\'re at it?
 Then your little sister can have a lonely, tragic future forced on her endlessly."
"That\'s not how it is......
 ............"
......That\'s right...
 I have to return for Ange\'s sake as well.
I know this isn\'t the time to start feeling compassion for Beato.
"In that case, make sure you kill her.
 Kill this witch without fail."
"...................................."
Even though Beato was right there,
 {f:5:Bernkastel} spoke without holding back...
"Your goal is to kill this woman.
 ......In the last game, you said it at Beato\'s request.
 You said "I will kill you"."
"......Yeah, that may be true,
 but that doesn\'t give {i:you} a right to comment on it."
"Did you know?
 When you tear one of your fingernails out, it\'s better to do it in one go.
 ......Pulling it out like you do, gently, timidly,
 twisting and slow...hurts much, much more.
 What you\'re doing sounds much more like torture to me."
"....................."
"If you have any compassion, kill her in one blow.
 That\'s how killing works."
"That\'s none of your business.
 I\'m the one to decide how to perform her last rites.
 You and that {f:5:Lambdadelta} witch have nothing to do with this.
 {i:I} will kill her.
 I won\'t let anyone else do it."
".........As long as you don\'t lose that willpower.
 I\'m betting on you.
 Alright?
 Make sure you don\'t forget."
"{p:1:Unless this game is resolved, you will never be released}.
 You won\'t be allowed to abandon this game either."
"......I get it."
"I know what Lambda is after.
 She wants to make you lose your will to fight just like Beato,
 to make you a pair of living dolls, and to keep this world in perpetual equilibrium.
 ......You don\'t want that, do you?
 I wouldn\'t like it either."
"Why should I care about what you want?
 Still, I won\'t throw this game away.
 I won\'t abandon the responsibility of fighting with Beato."
"I\'m glad our goals are the same.
 So, this means you\'ll be able to kill this child without any hesitation, right?"
"................................."
"............That\'s right."
"................................."
I have no way of knowing whether those words eased her pain or hurt her.
...But because of this dull tingling in my chest...
...I believe that she must have been hurt.
I have no way of knowing what the silent Beato feels.
......If I believe she\'s been hurt,
 ...is that any different from her being hurt?
And, if I hadn\'t thought I hurt her,
 would I have been able to get by without hurting anyone?
...........................
"......So,
 about that Beato who\'s drinking tea over there with Natsuhi.
 You can handle that, right...?"
"Yeah......
 ...No problem."
"It\'s the same as it was with Kinzo.
 {f:5:Beatrice} doesn\'t exist.
 This is a false witch illusion that Natsuhi created from her belief that she thought up a brilliant plan to overcome hardship by borrowing the witch\'s power."
"The only reason it looks like the two of them are drinking together...
is because {f:5:Lambdadelta}, who is the Game Master and {i:the one who is telling the story}, is interpreting it that way."
"If you stare without a fragment of love for Natsuhi, you won\'t see illusions like that.
 .........That\'s why, with my eyes, all I can see is Natsuhi all alone, drinking her tea in silence."
Without love, it cannot be {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen}.
 Because love is lacking, it cannot be {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen}.
"That\'s a fantasy that Natsuhi\'s showing us.
 ......{f:5:Beatrice} doesn\'t exist there."
"...........................ugh........."
Beato mumbled softly.
 ......It was a small voice that made it sound like she was in pain.
The thorn of {f:5:Bernkastel}\'s truth had stabbed into her chest.
"......Yeah, that\'s probably true.
 I think your theory is right.
 But don\'t say that in front of Beato."
"It doesn\'t matter where I say it.
 This is Beato\'s world."
"......Also, it\'s not like I\'m protecting Beato,
 but there is a possibility that Aunt Natsuhi really is drinking tea with some unknown person X calling themselves {f:5:Beatrice}.
 This scene takes place a year before everything.
 The number of people on the island on this day has never been shown with the red truth."
"............Sure.
 Even Lambda hasn\'t said anything in red about the number of people on Rokkenjima on this day."
"In that case,
 it\'s possible to claim that Aunt Natsuhi really did drink tea with a woman calling herself {f:5:Beatrice}.
 Just like I can\'t deny your theory, you can\'t deny mine.
 That means you can\'t say for sure whether the Beato there is an illusion or not."
".........Oh, the cat box theory?
 That might have worked on Beato, but it won\'t work on me."
"Why?"
"
{p:1:After all, Natsuhi is drinking tea all by herself right there}."
There was a violent sound of glass breaking,
 ......and the Beato joking about Natsuhi\'s newlywed years and laughing happily...
was erased.
......A lonely wind blew,
 ......and the one person who remained on the bench drinking tea with a tired expression...
...was Aunt Natsuhi, all alone.........
"...............nn, ggh........................"
Beato......groaned.
 I could see clearly that she was in anguish.
Another witch illusion had been smashed, ......calling Beato towards death.
......In short, this is what the battle to let Beato rest in peace is all about...
A second ago, {f:5:Bernkastel} likened our fight to the torture of tearing fingernails out.
If I have to tear them out anyway,
 ......then my last bit of compassion towards Beato should be to minimize that pain.
In other words, ......even if I want to minimize the pain, I still have to cause it.
I have to accept......that look of anguish on her face......
And at the same time,
 ...this made me realize what a merciless thing the red truth was.
......Right now, in this rose garden, there is no one except Aunt Natsuhi.
In other words, there are no observers except for Aunt Natsuhi.
So, if that lone observer were to say that she\'d had some tea with Beato,
 ......no one should be able to refute that.
......If no one can refute it, ...doesn\'t that mean it\'s the truth?
Aunt Natsuhi is enjoying the roses and drinking tea together with Beato.
...How could anyone have the right to mercilessly trample that pleasant moment......?
".........The red truth is a lot like a blade."
"....................."
"In a battle with a witch, it\'s a blade that sometimes tears your theories apart, and sometimes serves as a weapon you can fight back with."
"......I know.
 So what?"
"Don\'t use it without reason."
"....................."
"A blade is a tool if you use it as intended,
 ......but it\'s nothing but a murderer\'s weapon if you use it out of malice."
It was true that Aunt Natsuhi hadn\'t really been drinking tea with a witch.
However, saying that with the red truth probably has nothing to do with our game.
Our game is the tale of October 1986.
The two days of the crime give us more than enough time to injure each other with our red and blue blades glistening.
"This isn\'t about the witch illusions.
 ......It\'s about Aunt Natsuhi\'s privacy.
 How could anyone have the right to expose that?"
".....................
 ......Do you want to acknowledge that a witch actually existed here and drank tea with Natsuhi?
 Weren\'t you trying to deny the existence of witches?"
"......Yes, during the game of the two day period from October 4th to October 5th, 1986.
 But I have no desire to question whether or not witches exist outside that game board."
"In the first place, it\'s impossible to deny the existence of witches because of the Devil\'s Proof.
 And, according to the rules of this game, saying something like that in red is a forbidden move that leads to a stalemate.
 You can\'t deny the existence of witches even with the red truth."
"............True.
 ......I never thought I\'d hear you talk about witches existing.
 ............Not bad, Lambda.
 You\'ve done a good job of getting Battler stuck between his human culprit theory and the thought that it doesn\'t matter whether witches exist or not."
"She really excels at controlling a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}\'s heart.
 ......Looks like I\'d better start helping you out even more."
"I really couldn\'t care less about you two.
 Disappear.
 This game is between Beato and me.
 We\'re gonna keep this game to ourselves."
"...............No way."
"What......?"
"After all,
 I\'m enjoying this game too.
 .........*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*. Ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha......"
{f:5:Bernkastel} disappeared, leaving only that unpleasant laugh behind.
"......................................."
After that, all that remained was Natsuhi, sipping tea all alone,
 ......Beato, her hand still on the tea cup as she stared blankly at the surface of the liquid,
 ......and me.
"......{f:5:Bernkastel} and {f:5:Lambdadelta}...
 ......{f:5:Virgilia} called them your friends, but...
...you really should have chosen your friends more carefully.
 Or wait, maybe they actually make a good match with an ill‐natured person like you..."
".............................."
"........................"
Beato didn\'t answer.
Battler took Beato\'s hand, made her hold the cup again, and brought it to her lips.
......Beato made a quiet sound in her throat and drank just one more mouthful......
Then, Natsuhi\'s lonely teatime ended.
{n}......Her truth, which was only hers and observed by no one else, had been defiled.
In Natsuhi\'s world,
 ......that tea party, which had been peaceful despite her annoyance at Beato for making fun of her too much, must have come to an end, and the two of them probably went their separate ways.
However, in Natsuhi\'s exposed truth, ...she was all alone.
Natsuhi traipsed away.
......On the bench, only a single person\'s cup remained......After dashing to her bedroom, Jessica answered the phone call that had been transferred there.
"Ah, hello?!
 Sorry to keep you waiting!
 Battle~r!
 What d\'ya think you\'re doing, not contacting us for six years?!
 How\'s it goi{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}ing?!
 Oh, really?
 How the hell would I know?!
 Cram it, you jackass! Ahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!
 So you\'ll be coming to this year\'s family conference?
 It\'s been six years!"
Five businessmen in expensive suits were visiting in the parlor,
 giving Krauss and Natsuhi a progress report on their business.
Spread out on the table were the blueprints and designs for a building, as well as documents related to expenditures and the like...
so packed that even a tea cup would have gotten in the way.
Officially, they were here to give Krauss a progress report,
 ......but in actuality, Krauss had called them all the way over to Rokkenjima so that Natsuhi could hear from them directly.
This was because Natsuhi needed to hear someone other than her husband explain what condition their business was in.
......In short, even though another family conference without Kinzo was approaching,
 their business had not yet earned them any money.
After telling the guests to wait for a short while and make themselves at home,
 Krauss took Natsuhi out into the hall and once again summarized the situation...
"......In short, they are saying that the business is proceeding much better than we imagined it would.
 This is where that personal connection between me and the governor is really starting to pay off!
 There is no possible way for this catch to get away from us now.
 To the contrary, it\'s growing so big that in one go, we\'ll be able to regain not just that power of attorney, but everything we\'ve lost up to this point as well!"
Krauss spoke passionately.
......This made things seem all the more suspicious to Natsuhi,
 but this time, at least, she had to admit that everything really did seem to be going well.
Certainly, this business Krauss boasted of had expanded in scope over the last year,
 and was promising an even greater payoff than had been anticipated in the beginning.
Investors were gathering, jumping on the bandwagon of their own accord, and the business was rapidly gathering funds.
It was a perfect example of the saying "money makes money".
This was probably the greatest success of Krauss\'s life so far.
 ......No, it probably {i:would become} his greatest success yet.
That point was where Natsuhi\'s misgivings lay.
True, it was certain, and as Krauss had said, they wouldn\'t lose this catch now.
However, .........the fish on the line had gotten too big.
"We\'ll definitely be able to reel this fish in.
 There\'s no need to rush.
 It\'s such a success that I wish I could show it to Dad to be praised, if he were still alive...!"
"Yes, I know.
 However, I believe you made me a promise last year.
 You said you were sure you could manage something within a year...!"
A pained look rose to Krauss\'s face.
 They certainly had hooked a fat fish that guaranteed a great success.
However, it would require an appropriate amount of time to reel it in......
Natsuhi pressed Krauss, asking if there was any way for them to make money before this year\'s family conference,
 but Krauss kept saying that he needed just one more year...
Krauss planned to use this unprecedented success...
as a springboard to future endeavors.
Because of this, he didn\'t want to do anything that would raise suspicions by making it seem like they were rushing to get money...
Certainly, fortune tends to turn against people who take it for granted even in the slightest.
{n}There\'s a saying about hasty anglers......
On many occasions before now, Krauss had gotten cold feet and sold businesses that would surely have brought in a profit had he just waited,
 and had, in effect, given away his winning picks.
Natsuhi also knew this.
{n}She knew that guts were the thing her husband lacked most.
That was why she was unable to refuse when Krauss said he wanted to prudently wait just one more year......
"......Hahahahahahahaha.
 So wonderful that things are going well.
 And that means it looks like I\'ll have to sit around here as a ghost for a little longer."
"You don\'t look too disappointed.
 Your life is fated to be chewed to bits by demons as soon as you leave this world."
"......My apologies, Father.
 ...For another year, ...you might not be granted peace."
"It is fine. Do not worry, Natsuhi.
 I am no longer the Ushiromiya family head.
 The ghost of the study should obediently follow the current head\'s commands.
 ......I\'ve taken a look at Krauss\'s charts, and they aren\'t bad at all."
"Even from your perspective, Father?"
"......Hmmm. They\'re pretty good even from my perspective.
 Everyone is confident in his victory and concentrating a significant quantity of magical power.
 As a result, that victory is growing ever deeper, gathering more and more people and magical power, and beginning to create gold.
 A perfect embodiment of the classic method of alchemy."
"Hoh.
 If you\'ve earned even the Golden Witch\'s approval, that is very reassuring.
 Be pleased, Natsuhi.
 This business of Krauss\'s will save the Ushiromiya family from its crisis without fail."
"Th‐...thank you very much.
 ......And, if you would once again......"
"Hmmm.
 We\'ll have to overcome one more family conference, won\'t we..."
"Yes.
 I think things went well last year, but I imagine some of the relatives will find it suspicious.
 .........I think this year\'s conference will be a critical period."
"During last year\'s family conference,
 you were correct to predict that the same thing might have to happen again."
"......Even for those who aren\'t witches, preparing for the worst case scenario is one of the basics for getting on in this world.
 ......So, what will you do this year?"
"Just like last year, I will see to it that a high concentration of the servants who know Father\'s secret are there on the day of the conference.
 ......Some of the relatives may already suspect that Father isn\'t around.
 A careless act might actually put us in more danger of exposure."
"Hmmm.
 It is said that too much is as bad as too little.
 ......Then what will you do?"
"Unlike last year, I think we\'ll go with a plan that has you staying inside your study until the end."
"That would be suitable.
 A barricade is simple, and a final trump card."
"No matter how much the mansion is filled with the toxin,
 it will be impossible to deny Kinzo\'s existence as long as the locked‐room barrier remains around this room.
 I shall guarantee that myself.
 ......However, if you choose to make a barricade, it is inevitable that you will be surrounded."
"I know.
 ......Even so, I beg that both of you lend us your power just one more time..."
"I cannot disobey the orders of the new head.
 Furthermore, a ghost cannot disobey the orders of the living.
 If you tell me not to leave this room, then I will obey."
"Thank you very much......"
"I, on the other hand, will not.
 If you want me to lend you my power, I won\'t listen to a mere request."
"Yes.
 You are the family alchemist.
 So, I won\'t ask you to help.
 I order you to help.
 ......We are relying on your magic alone.
 Use that power to create an illusion of Father just one more time."
"Very well.
 I hear and obey.
 I find your dignity quite pleasing."
From the shadows of the study, Battler watched the exchange between these three......
"......I see.
 And then this year\'s family conference comes around.
 ......Grandfather shuts himself in his study because he\'s in a bad mood and doesn\'t appear in front of anyone."
"................................."
Natsuhi spoke boldly, saying that she would find a way to overcome this year\'s crisis and protect the Ushiromiya family honor to the end.
 Kinzo praised her, saying that he was relieved to hear it and trusted her to succeed.
Beato also praised her, saying that Natsuhi\'s dignity was even more fitting for the family head than Krauss\'s.
.........However,
 .........right now,
 the true number of people in this room was......
At the same time I thought that......no, just because I thought that, Beato grabbed her chest and moaned.
"......Don\'t worry.
 We\'re still outside the game board.
 So, I won\'t deny you or Grandfather over there."
"................................."
As Beato tried to hold back the pain deep inside her chest, I put my hand on hers......
I already told {f:5:Bernkastel}.
Denying the witch illusions in just the two day period of the 1986 family conference is enough.
"{p:2:In the last game, you said in red that Grandfather is dead at the start time for all games.
 However, you never mentioned whether Grandfather was alive or dead before the start time for the games.
 ......In short, even if Grandfather exists in this place right now, that doesn\'t create any contradictions}."
My hand that was touching her let off a faint blue light,
 ......which seeped into her chest.
That light...
tenderly wrapped itself around the splinters in Beato\'s chest...
"......
{p:2:And I also can\'t deny the existence of the {f:5:Beatrice} in this place.
 The number of people on this island outside the game board...in other words, before October 4th, 1986, has not been declared in red.
 Therefore, there\'s nothing strange about {f:5:Beatrice} existing here}."
"..............................ah..."
Beato\'s expression softened slightly.
My blue light......slowly started to melt the red splinters that denied the witch illusion...
"........................"
Beato still wore the same sad expression, but she lifted her face...
and looked me right in the eye.
Even though she was silent, her eyes told me that the pain had gone away.
The feelings that showed in her eyes were gratitude for taking the pain away,
 .........and appreciation—or was it surprise?—that I had left even a tiny bit of leeway for witches to exist.
Unable to look directly at those pure eyes of hers, I automatically averted my gaze.
"......Don\'t get the wrong idea.
 I don\'t plan on accepting the existence of witches or surrendering.
 I just want to focus solely on that one time period and fight like a stoic so that I can win in this game against you.
 I have no desire to bully you outside the game board as well."
".............................."
"..............."
Beato hung her head.
 ...I was still facing away from her.
However, we waited wordlessly for a while, my hand still on hers......
.........By now, no one would believe that this woman with sad eyes...
...was the same person as that prideful Beato.
So, ......I asked once more.
Even though I said it aloud, it wasn\'t a question to her.
{n}I was asking myself.
"......Just what in the world...
...were you thinking?"
".............................."
"That\'s right.
 Even though this is {f:5:Lambdadelta}\'s game, ......I have to find you here.
 I have to find what you thought...and what you were trying to do."
Very soon, this game will also reach October 4th, 1986.
{n}......The fifth game will finally begin.
And this time, I\'ll reach the end.
 The end of that journey.
"......I\'m not worried about the obvious stuff, like murders and tricks.
 ...What did you, ...the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}, think, and why did you do what you did?
 What were you hoping for?
 ............That\'s what I\'m gonna find out."
That\'s right.
 I already know the method for reaching the end of that journey.
 And I\'ve been shouting it since the very beginning.
"......This time, I really will flip over the chessboard.
 I\'ll untangle this tale not from my side,
 ......but from yours."
".............................."
"And this time, ......I\'ll understand you.
 And I\'ll pick my way to your heart.
 ......I won\'t let you feel pain.
 Don\'t worry.
 ......I won\'t let those witches make you their toy anymore."
".....................nn..."
Beato looked up at me again......and gave a small nod.
 ......That\'s right.
The position of the Game Master might have been snatched up by {f:5:Lambdadelta}.
However, ......as long as I continue this contest with the intent of fighting against Beato,
 ......our fight will continue no matter who controls the game board.
......Very soon, the curtain will rise on our game......
"During this year\'s family conference, we must conceal the Master\'s secret once again."
"Y‐yes.
 ......I understand."
"............I\'m a little doubtful that the same trick will work twice."
"Madam shares your concerns.
 Because of that, it was decided that this year, he will not leave the study even once."
"In other words, we\'ll make it seem like he\'s shut away in the study the whole time...?"
"......Yes.
 And the only ones allowed to enter the study...
will be the three of us, the servants permitted to wear the One‐winged Eagle."
".........Which means that the three of us will have to perpetuate the lie about the Master..."
"Correct.
 ......The relatives will probably question you about the Master\'s health and mood.
 Make sure you answer without hesitation, and see to it that nothing is seen as suspicious."
"......Y‐yes.
 I understand."
"I\'m sure you\'ll screw up right away, Nee‐san.
 Maybe it\'s better to say you have a cold or something so that you can skip that day."
"Th‐that\'s mean......"
Kanon wasn\'t just saying that to make fun of Shannon.
......He simply wanted to release her from the stresses they would face that day as they took on the critical task of concealing Kinzo\'s death.
"Genji‐sama.
 Is it really necessary for Shannon to work that day?
 We can manage things well enough without her."
"That I cannot do.
 Madam gave strict orders that the three of us be scheduled to work on that day."
"Yes......
 I am prepared to perform my duties successfully."
"Don\'t screw up."
"I won\'t."
Shannon grew sullen, and Kanon shrugged.
{n}Then Genji told them that they weren\'t taking this seriously enough.
"......Shannon. Kanon.
 ......The master we serve has already passed away.
 However, until he has truly passed on, we will continue to serve.
 ......That study is not empty.
 The Master is still there, hard at work on his usual research.
 Make sure you take that to heart."
""Yes, Genji‐sama.""
"Father has already passed away...?!
 That\'s insane...!"
"Settle down...
 It\'s only a possibility.
 It\'s well known that Takeda Shingen said in his will that his death was to be kept secret for three years.
 Know about that?"
"......Is that how it went?
 My Japanese history isn\'t so great."
"At the time, Takeda was in the middle of a war with Oda and Tokugawa.
 If his death had become known at a time like that, it would probably have had a negative effect on the war.
 \'Cause of this, he left a will sayin\' that his death should be kept hidden for three years.
 ......Hideyoshi did the same thing, right?
 He completely suppressed information about the death of his master, Oda Nobunaga, so that the enemy wouldn\'t find out,
 quickly made peace with Mouri, and defeated Akechi in the Battle of Yamazaki."
"Shibata Katsuie, on the other hand... That was where he failed.
 The enemy, Uesugi, learned of Nobuyuki\'s death, so Shibata had to deal with an unexpected counterattack and was slowed down.
 That\'s why, later on, he suffered a great loss against Hideyoshi in the fight for the succession."
Hideyoshi, who had a strong fascination with the commanders of the Sengoku period, would always show off his knowledge whenever he got the chance.
Wincing slightly, Eva made him get back to his point.
"......Long story short, ...the whole time since last year\'s family conference,
 something\'s not been feelin\' right to me about what happened."
"You mean the time when Rudolf and I were talking about the inheritance and Father overheard us from the hall..."
"That\'s just it.
 ......Natsuhi‐san and the servants kept saying Father was here or there and that he seemed to be in a bad mood,
 but not a single one of us relatives saw Father, right?"
"If what you\'re thinking is right......
......what does that mean?!
 Does it mean that Nii‐san is trying to get all of the inheritance for himself?!"
"Of course, hidin\' someone\'s death is a very dangerous thing to do.
 And all things considered, I\'m not sure Krauss‐san would be willin\' to do it just to have the inheritance to himself.
 But it is possible."
"......W‐...well, it\'s true that Nii‐san has always been greedy.
 He always used to take things that were meant for all of the siblings and keep them all for himself..."
"Krauss‐san\'s meant to be the most affluent of you siblings.
 For Krauss‐san to scheme to keep the inheritance all to himself to the point of acceptin\' the risk of hidin\' Father\'s death...
 I don\'t know, it sounds a little unbelievable to me.
 But last year\'s family conference was just so strange, it makes me wonder."
"................................."
Eva and the others were painfully aware of how reckless it would be...
to try to see Kinzo knowing that he was in a bad mood.
So ever since hearing about Kinzo getting into a terrible mood during last year\'s family conference,
 they had never actively tried to contact him.
That was why, until this very day, it hadn\'t occurred to them to find it suspicious that Kinzo never showed himself......
"......It definitely is something we should suspect...
 But I wonder if Nii‐san really would do something as appalling as hiding Father\'s death...
 ......For all his pride, that man has a coward\'s side to him.
 Would he really make such a once‐in‐a‐lifetime bet......?"
"In any event, it\'d probably be a good idea to make sure we get a chance to meet with Father during this year\'s conference."
"......They\'re extremely bad rumors.
 It seems that Aniki\'s businesses are failing even worse than we\'d imagined.
 It looks like he\'s had massive losses and is giving it everything he\'s got just to try and cover up that fact."
"In that case, it would be very difficult to borrow money from Krauss‐san."
"Yeah. I could almost cry."
"............So, would being in financial distress give Krauss‐san some kind of weakness?"
"A weakness?
 .........Well, investors tend to have a keen eye.
 If they were to hear that Aniki is actually low on funds, no one would give him the time of day."
"I guess trust is the most important part of that business.
 .................."
Kyrie smiled thinly.
 Rudolf was taken aback by that smile...
He had figured that his plan, which involved raising money to get him out of his current mess by borrowing from the affluent Krauss,
 would all come to nothing now that they knew Krauss himself was in financial trouble......
"......Krauss‐san\'s credibility might be something {i:he} needs for his future work,
 but {i:we} won\'t have any use for it."
"You\'re suggesting extorting money from Aniki?"
"If I was in your place, I\'d hate the idea.
 Who would want to undermine their own blood sibling like that?
 *giggle*giggle*."
Rudolf felt a shiver go up his spine at Kyrie\'s cold smile...
At times, Kyrie was able to throw away all compassion and think in an extremely ruthless manner.
Whenever he felt that, Rudolf thought about how he never wanted to have her as his enemy......
"I wouldn\'t want to threaten Onii‐san if there were any other way to get money."
"......If there were another way, we wouldn\'t be worrying."
"Don\'t you think worrying about a problem when you have no other options is a waste of time?"
"................................."
Rudolf stopped talking, folded his arms, and lowered his gaze.
Even now, Rudolf had a kind of fear of Krauss due to his violence when they were young.
......And now, Rudolf would be the one to threaten him.
That meant Rudolf would also have to fight against his childhood trauma.
So to give her husband a little push, Kyrie smiled reassuringly,
 ......and perhaps coldly.
"I never want to do business based on trust.
 It takes hard work to build up trust, but only an instant to lose it. There\'s no less profitable investment."
"Y‐...you\'re right.
 ...All the trust in the world isn\'t worth a crisp new banknote."
"Even though Krauss‐san has been taking huge losses,
 he should be able to prepare enough money to buy us some time.
 Of course, this will involve forcing him to exchange all the trust he\'s built up for cash."
".........This is......gonna get rough..."
"We\'ll have to prepare sufficiently.
 We haven\'t been given any time or room for failure.
 Isn\'t that right?"
"Among my Kyoto friends, there are a few people who are very good at investigating that sort of thing.
 I\'d rather not be in the debt of these people, ......but do you want to try meeting them?
 They don\'t give receipts, but I\'m sure they\'ll dig up something that makes them worth the investment."
"Yes.
 Maria is doing well too.
 .........That\'s none of your concern.
 Thank you.
 .........Huh?
 I don\'t know, I\'d have to look at my schedule..."
Rosa was talking to Rudolf over the phone.
Rosa rarely received calls from her older siblings, so she braced herself for something serious.
"Well, truth is...
I want to have a little talk about the next family conference, without Aniki."
".........Between you, me, and Eva nee‐san?
 ......Sounds like a headache."
"I can\'t talk about the details over the phone,
 but you might find that it\'s worth listening to."
"Something good?"
"Of course.
 Aneki is all for it."
"Nee‐san is......?"
"We just want your approval. We aren\'t going to ask you for money or anything like that.
 The most important thing is that the three of us are united.
  Understand what I\'m saying?"
Rosa let out a sigh.
...She did so because, in the past, when Rudolf and Eva got into a fight with Krauss, they often used a tone like this to drag her into it......
"First, tell me.
 I stand to gain something from this too, right?"
"Yep.
 The three of us will each grab 200 million out of this.
 If things go well, we might be able to squeeze out more.
 That should be enough to wipe out your debt, right?"
".....................
 And when will we be grabbing this by?"
"Within this fiscal year, of course.
 I need it.
 Aneki needs it.
 And you need it too, Rosa.
 All three of our problems\'ll be settled."
"So, its chances of success are good enough that Nee‐san\'s agreed to it?"
"Now do you wanna hear?
 I know it\'s a bit sudden, but let\'s meet this Sunday, 19:00, at that coffee shop you like in Ginza.
 That\'s the only time Aneki\'s schedule and mine match.
 Any problems?"
"If it can bring me 200 million, I have no choice but to listen.
 ......Then let\'s meet at 7 p.m. this Sunday at Leopold\'s."
"Say hi to Maria‐chan for me.
 You can bring her too if you want."
"Don\'t talk about money in front of that child!"
She set the receiver down with a clunk, a little violently.
Apparently, either Eva or Rudolf had gotten ahold of one of Krauss\'s weak points.
They were probably thinking of threatening him with that at the next family conference and forcing him to pay money.
Even before hearing the details, she knew full well that it could be nothing good.
But even so, ......this was a once‐in‐a‐lifetime chance to pay back her large debts.
Rosa took a notebook out of her handbag,
 and went to fill in the day she would be meeting with Rudolf and Eva.
 ......Then she frowned and smacked herself hard in the forehead.
Because written there was "DZL with Maria".
Maria was in her room, playing around excitedly with Sakutarou and the others.
It was because her mother was going to take her to the amusement park that had just been built,
 Delsney Land, on Sunday......
Looking at the clock, Rosa saw that it was just past nine o\'clock at night.
{n}Maria was breaking the lights‐out rule.
After covering her face and agonizing for a while,
 ......Rosa stood up and stomped over to Maria\'s room.
The room was almost certainly a mess as well.
{n}......At least tonight, that was convenient.
As she stood outside the door to Maria\'s room, listening to the happy laughter seeping through,
 Rosa\'s face twisted in anguish once again, and she looked at the floor.
Then, when she raised her head again,
 her brow was furrowed, and her face had become an ugly expression of anger...
The weather wasn\'t looking very good.
The weekend forecast had said that there was a high likelihood of a tropical cyclone growing into a large typhoon.
If it was true that premonitions tended to be right...
......then this year\'s family conference would probably take place in absolutely horrible weather.
In fact, Natsuhi wished that a typhoon large enough to stop boat travel to the island would seal Rokkenjima away forever.
If that happened, she would be able to keep Kinzo\'s death hidden as long as she wanted......
"If only......the typhoon would keep them at bay forever."
Natsuhi let out a deep sigh.
 ......Just doing that made her headache throb...
As the day of the family conference approached, the intensity of her headache just kept on increasing.
At that time, the phone rang.
{n}Natsuhi turned the television off and picked up the receiver...
"......Hello?"
"I apologize for calling during your rest.
 It is Genji."
"Is something the matter...?"
"There is a phone call for you from the external line.
 ......However, they will not state their name."
"They aren\'t saying their name...?"
"Yes.
 The person in question said you would know when you spoke with them...
 What would you like me to do?
 It might be a prank."
"What did they sound like?"
"I believe it was a young man.
 Do you have any ideas as to who it might be...?"
"A young......man?"
Natsuhi didn\'t have a clue who that might be.
In the first place, there was no one amongst her acquaintances who would do something as rude as refusing to state their name.
And on top of that...a young...man......?
Natsuhi thought that as a wife, it wasn\'t right for her to have connections with men other than her husband, much less a young man; it might be considered suspicious.
The phone call suddenly seemed like something dirty.
But at the same time, she was more interested than ever in what this person wanted to tell her.
......Could it be that there was some kind of trouble related to Krauss\'s business?
What if there was some particular reason that they needed to talk to Krauss\'s wife instead of Krauss directly......?
"..........................."
No matter what the message, it was her duty as a wife to hear it and relay it to Krauss.
......If it was some strange kind of extortion attempt, she just had to firmly refuse and inform Krauss that she had received a phone call like that.
If the call was something irritating, then she just had to tell Genji to never again send her a call if the caller refused to state their name.
Thinking this, Natsuhi told Genji, who was offering to hang up after all, to connect her to this person,
 and she set the receiver down.
After a short while, the phone rang again......
"............Hello?"
This wasn\'t the internal line.
 It was the external phone line, which Genji had transferred to her.
{n}So it should already have been connected directly to the mysterious man.
However, the person on the other end didn\'t respond to her.
......Not liking this at all, Natsuhi spoke one more time, sounding displeased.
"Hello?
 Who is it?
 Tell me your name...!"
"..........................."
She heard something that sounded like a sigh.
{n}She automatically gulped.
After remaining silent for a little longer, the man finally answered......
".........It\'s been a long time."
That was the first time the man had spoken.
"......Just how long has it been?
 ......How many years, I wonder."
"What are you talking about?
 Who are you...?!"
The voice certainly did sound like that of a young man.
But it was a bit hard to figure out much about a person just by their voice over the phone...
He sounded like a young adult, but he might actually have been of middle‐school age,
 or an adult whose voice still hadn\'t deepened.
In fact, it might have been premature to assume this person was a male at all.
However, one thing was certain......
 Though this person spoke to Natsuhi in such a familiar and casual manner, Natsuhi had absolutely no clue who it was...
"......It\'d be easy for me to tell you my name.
 ......But that would make me very sad."
"I don\'t know what you\'re talking about.
 Who are you?
 And what business do you have with me?!
 If you can\'t tell me that, I\'m not interested!
 I\'m hanging up...!"
"What I want......is for you to remember."
"And what is it that you\'re telling me to remember?
 I don\'t know you, so I have nothing to remember!"
".........Don\'t say that.
 I\'m your child, aren\'t I?"
"What did you say......?!
 What are you talking about?!"
"Don\'t say things that\'ll make me so sad,
 ...Mother."
That unsettling word thrust itself mercilessly into the depths of Natsuhi\'s heart and started churning it about...
In Natsuhi\'s entire life,
 no one had ever said anything so unsettling to her.
In her bewilderment, Natsuhi felt her heart beat so loudly that it felt like it would explode.
"I, ......I, I have no idea why you think you have the right to call me "Mother"!
 I don\'t know what you\'re thinking, but I\'m hanging up...!!"
"......I came back for revenge.
 ......Revenge for your crime of 19 years ago."
Natsuhi\'s mind went blank......
And beyond the sound of the wind howling outside the window, she most certainly heard the roar of the sea from that day......
".........You...
remember, actually, don\'t you......?"
"I, ...I told you I don\'t know what you\'re talking about!!
 N‐...n‐never call here again!"
"I haven\'t forgotten what you did to me 19 years ago...
 ......So I will call you Mother despite what you did,
 no, because of what you did, to curse you.
 .........It\'ll be the family conference very soon, won\'t it?
 ......I am your son, Mother, after all.
 I\'ll come on the day of the conference.
 ...After 19 years.
 ......So that I can have my revenge on you."
Click!!
Breathing so hard her shoulders heaved, Natsuhi slammed the receiver down and hung up...
Then she hit the phone violently, knocking the receiver off.
So that there was no chance of that man calling back...
I can hear the roar of the sea......
The voice I\'m hearing from beyond the howling wind must be...
 ...Aaah...
no matter how I cover my ears, no matter how I cover my ears, ......
......the headache won\'t...............
Completely pale, ...Natsuhi kept shivering as though cold......
"............Lambda, are you there?"
"Yes, I\'m here.
 I\'m anywhere you want me to be, Bern."
"......Then crawl into the cupboard under the kitchen floor.
 Or in a jar of rice‐bran paste, if you want."
"Ooh, you\'re gonna dip me in bean paste and bite me?
 But in that case, I\'d prefer to be dipped in hone~y.
 And in return, I\'ll cook you in sugar water."
"......At least make it sweet soy sauce with sweet sake."
"So what\'s up?
 You wanna play with repetition requests?"
".........That\'s right.
 Is Natsuhi\'s phone conversation here a fact?"
{f:5:Lambdadelta} grinned unpleasantly, as though sizing {f:5:Bernkastel} up.
She was probably trying to tease {f:5:Bernkastel} by taking her time on the repetition request.
".........Declining to repeat?"
"I dunno, lemme see...
 Should I decline or should I respond...
 As the Game Master, that\'s up to me to decide, and I get to make that decision any time I want."
".........Unless I state it in the blue text, you aren\'t obligated to respond."
"Exactly!
 *giggle*giggle*.
 For now the best you can do is be all like "Natsuhi has a secret from 19 years ago?! What could it be?!"
 Make sure you\'re sitting on the edge of your seat, alright?
 *giggle*giggle*."
Of course, this fishy telephone call...
occurs before October 4th, 1986.
This is still before the start time of the game.
{n}So it\'s not necessary to question whether it\'s true or false in the first place.
".........Since you, the Game Master, went out of your way to show me this, I\'m just going to assume you\'re setting up something for later.
 ......It might be a trick, but I\'ll at least keep this move of yours in my memory."
"Ehheheh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eheheh.........
 I place this card face‐down onto the field, hehe~.
 Ouch, wh‐what?!"
"............<Direct Attack>."
After suddenly being conked on the head, {f:5:Lambdadelta} was bewildered.
But perhaps this incomprehensible exchange was funny to her...because she quickly went back to giggling.
"......Are you done preparing the game board now?"
"Yeah, that\'s right.
 Now I\'ll finally move on to the game.
 On to October 4th, 1986...!"
".........I wonder what number October 4th, 1986 this is.
 ......The Endless Witch...
{f:5:Beatrice}.
 ...She really is a frightening child."
"Taking any actions on your side, Bern?"
".........No.
 If you aren\'t going to respond to my repetition request, I\'m done."
"<Turn end>, then?
 <Start, cleanup, draw>!!"
"Come!!
 October 4th, 1986!!!""This rose garden really is a masterpiece.
 It\'s gotten even more awesome than it was six years ago.
 You\'re so lucky to have this as your yard!"
"Are you kidding?
 For me, it just makes it a longer walk to the harbor, which is a real pain."
"Hahaha.
 That\'s a pretty luxurious worry."
"Uu!
 Getting to say hi to the roses every morning before school, so awesome!
 You must get late after saying hi to so many roses...!"
"Shame about Ange though.
 I hear her stomach gets upset easily?"
"Apparently.
 It\'s probably her intestines that are weak.
 She\'s always getting diarrhea."
"Uu.
 You shouldn\'t say something like that about a lady......"
"Ihihihihi, sorry about that.
 Yeah, I forgot, marshmallows are what comes out of a girl\'s butt, ri~ght?
 So, Ange got sick, and the marshmallows turned into syrup."
"Yeah, that\'s just—"
"Too disgusting."
George and Jessica slammed a knee and a fist right into either side of Battler\'s gut.
Whack,
 smackthud.
......The smackthud was probably the sound of his knees hitting the ground and him falling over.
Normally, Battler possessed the good sense you\'d expect of an 18‐year‐old man.
However, it seemed that this reunion had brought him back to the mental age he had been six years ago.
And bit by bit,
 Jessica and George realized that they were also returning to the way they\'d been six years ago...
This "charming" chat...
was being observed by Natsuhi, gazing through an open window in the hall.
".........Madam.
 Krauss‐sama is searching for you."
"I\'ll go in just a bit.
 ......It isn\'t even lunchtime yet, ...and I\'m already tired."
The sparks had been flying between them and Eva\'s group only a few moments earlier.
The others had pounded on Krauss and Natsuhi over and over to get Kinzo out of his study...
Apparently, they hadn\'t been fully tricked at last year\'s family conference after all......
".........There are......no problems with Father, I assume...?"
"Correct.
 ......Leave it to me.
 Shannon and Kanon are also fully aware of today\'s arrangements."
"......Kumasawa is a good liar, so I\'m not worried about her, ...but I am a little concerned about Doctor Nanjo.
 ......I get the feeling he\'s bad at hiding things."
".........Leave that to me.
 I intend to support Doctor Nanjo from nearby as much as possible."
"It\'s very reassuring to have you there.
 .........It really helps a lot.
 ...Without your strength, we wouldn\'t be able to succeed."
"......I am honored by your words."
"Don\'t worry.
 The locked‐room barrier on the study is perfect.
 As long as the barrier remains unbroken, no one will be able to expose Kinzo\'s secret."
".........Yes, I understand.
 Still, you heard that conversation in the parlor just now, didn\'t you?"
"......Mm.
 It seems that some considerable suspicions were aroused last year.
 The terrible toxin has accumulated and is being spread all around."
"......It seems this year\'s conference really will be crucial."
"We might be able to overcome this year somehow, ......but there is such a thing as pushing our luck.
 It\'s probably best to assume that next year won\'t be manageable."
".........With this much of the anti‐magic toxin filling up the place,
 it will probably be difficult to preserve Lord {f:5:Goldsmith}\'s magic for yet another family conference."
"W‐......who are you?"
"Oh,
 no need to be surprised.
 This man serves as my head furniture."
"Greetings, Madam Natsuhi.
 My name is Ronove.
 It is a pleasure to meet you......"
"This man\'s reliable.
 He\'s also helping to guard the locked‐room barrier."
"......Is that so?
 I am Ushiromiya Natsuhi.
 I thank you for your cooperation."
"Of course, Madam.
 ......I will be aiding you from the magic world.
 Please rely on me."
"............In that case, I guess I\'ll introduce myself next.
 <Hi>, Riiche.
 Long time no see......"
"Ah, Gaap!!
 It\'s heartening to see that you\'re here as well!"
"......Well, I only came to have some fun.
 ......If you need an extra hand, let me know.
 Nice to meet you, <Madam>.
 ......This is the first time I\'ve said hello, but I\'m always right by anyone\'s side."
"Pu ku ku.
 Gaap here is quite the prankster...
 Remember that headache medicine you dropped on the floor of your room and lost as you were getting dressed?
 Gaap was the one behind that."
"Whenever you set something small down somewhere but can\'t find it later, it\'s always a good idea to suspect that it\'s one of her pranks.
 ......Long ago, she used to tease me all the time!"
"I‐...is that so?
 ......In any event, this is the Ushiromiya mansion.
 As long as you are here, you will obey us.
 You understand, correct?"
"Of course.
 We understand.
 ......Think of me as a Genji of the magic world, and please give me orders whenever you wish."
".........I\'m pretty sure I know how to be a good guest.
 ...I won\'t let the landlord lose face."
"You can count on Ronove and Gaap.
 However, the magic world and the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} world are two different sides of the same coin."
"I understand.
 ......Of course, I will do all I can in the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} world.
 Let\'s work together and protect Father\'s secret."
"Mm."
"......This happens every time.
 We won\'t get anywhere until the next day."
"Hmm?
 Well, su~re. October 4th is like a preparation turn for me.
 If you don\'t feel like doing anything, why don\'t you just sit around until October 5th?
 I\'ll call you after the first six die.
 *giggle*giggle*......!"
......Of course, that was a very irritating way to say it.
The fight wouldn\'t start until the crime occurred.
However, waiting for the crimes to start would mean turning a blind eye towards the murders of the first twilight.
In other words, it would be the same as being content with the fact that six people would die......
"............Did you know?
 They say that in chess, the player who moves first is twice as likely to win."
"Although that can change as the tactics of the match progress.
 Don\'t they say that the second player has a much better chance at a draw?"
"......Even I know what "the first to strike wins" means.
 .........Then what are you trying to say?"
"Pff, *giggle*giggle*!
 This is why you\'re so incompetent."
"......Seriously.
 ......Are you listening, Battler?
 There is a mystery which can be solved even on October 4th.
 ......Do you know what that is?"
"You don\'t mean......
 ............No, but..."
"Heheheheheheh!
 ......Well, watch and see, Battler the incompetent!"
"*giggle*giggle*..."
I have a general idea what these witches are talking about.
......I\'ve tried solving it several times myself in the past, but I still haven\'t found anything resembling an answer.
On the contrary, I still can\'t even understand {i:why that riddle exists}.
.........That\'s right.
 ...The reason it exists.
{n}Why did Beato...
...prepare a riddle like that in the first place......?
We all discussed it together from time to time in past games.
However, I\'ve been avoiding thinking about it under the assumption that there\'s no point in investigating the riddle unless we can solve it.
......This time, I should change my viewpoint.
I shouldn\'t just focus on the obvious parts...
like the truth of the riddle and how to solve it.
{n}......What\'s more important is why that riddle was set up in the first place and displayed for us to see.
{n}That\'s what I should be thinking about.
And the one proposing that riddle......is {f:5:Beatrice}.
Even if I can\'t solve it, I should be able to try and figure out what Beato was thinking when she showed it to us.
......Alright...this time, I\'m turning the chessboard over...
{n}The witches keep calling me incompetent.
Let them laugh.
 ......My enemy isn\'t them.
{n}......I\'m continuing our match,
 Beato......
"......Oh.
 Seems like it\'s finally started raining."
"Sheesh...
 I wish I could keep the downpour limited to the inside of my heart."
The people in the parlor noticed that raindrops had started to drip down the window.
"So now, we have nowhere to run until the family conference ends."
"......The same thing goes for Nii‐san and his accomplices.
 ......I won\'t let them escape, you can be certain of that...
 The cards we\'re holding aren\'t bad.
 Nii‐san is just bluffing.
 ......I\'ll make certain that he surrenders..."
"Well, the thing about a deal is,
 you don\'t go in tryin\' to {i:beat} the other guy.
 ......You get a pitfall ready, praise him a bit, and convince him to stand on it of his {i:own} accord."
"......Hideyoshi‐san is right.
 You pressed him a little too hard just now, Eva nee‐san."
"Th‐that was perfectly reasonable considering it\'s Nii‐san we\'re dealing with."
"Hm? Has Rosa fallen asleep?"
"She was complainin\' about how early she woke up this morning.
 Well, guess there\'s nothin\' wrong with taking a nap."
"There\'s a chance we might be forced to spend all night on this.
 Getting a nap in now is probably a smart idea."
Out of consideration for Rosa, who had fallen asleep on a sofa, the others quietly left the parlor.
Rosa slept, unaware.
After telling Maria to just stay where she was after that tantrum over not being able to find her rose,
 Rosa slept, unaware that the rain had started to fall......
The rain poured down as though it had been saving up for this moment.
Of course, Maria noticed that the rain had started falling and was soaking her to the bone.
However, that just made her even more stubborn.
Unable to find the poor, slightly unhealthy rose that she herself had marked,
 ......she just couldn\'t stand having that search be interrupted by something like the rain.
So the more the rain fell on Maria, the more stubborn she grew,
 and she wandered around and around the rose beds...
As she did, .........from behind her back, ............came a patter‐patter.
 ...The sound of approaching footsteps.
Then, whoever it was stepped in a very small puddle, making a light splashing sound, and Maria finally heard.
However, even the slight distraction that sound caused made her feel irritated, and Maria ignored it despite having heard it.
{a:c:
"............Hello."}
"......ah."
Maria turned around, bewildered.
......After all, that voice...
was one she didn\'t recognize at all.
On this sealed‐off Rokkenjima, ......that voice belonged to no person she knew...
"Krauss‐sama, Madam.
 ......I was looking for you.
 Something important has come up."
Krauss and Natsuhi had been privately discussing what should be done next in a deserted corridor on the third floor.
Genji had searched everywhere for them.
"What is it?
 It must be something more urgent than a few sheets getting wet by the rain."
"What is it?
 Has there been some sort of blunder?"
"......A short while ago, someone came to the mansion...claiming to have drifted here after an accident at sea."
Krauss and Natsuhi couldn\'t help but go wide‐eyed and look at each other.
This was the first time they had ever heard of someone coming to this island uninvited.
"Someone drifted here......?
 Is that true?
 Poor thing.
 ......Treat this person politely, like a guest.
 What is happening now?"
"Doctor Nanjo is performing an examination.
 ......He hasn\'t finished yet, but from what I could tell by looking, the drifter seemed tired but uninjured."
"That\'s good.
 Natsuhi and I are having an important conversation right now.
 We will come to check on this person when we are finished.
 Please tell this drifter that we want them to feel at home."
"Certainly......"
Genji bowed deeply and started to leave, but Natsuhi called him to a stop.
{n}Genji stopped walking and Natsuhi jogged up to him...
".........Genji.
 ...Is this drifter.........a man?"
"No.
 ......She is a young woman, about the same age as Milady."
"...A woman...?
 .........I see.
 Very well. Back to your work."
The parlor of the mansion was bustling.
 The adults gathered, concerned about the well‐being of this sudden guest...
"Well, if she was able to walk all the way to the rose garden by herself, her life probably isn\'t in danger."
"......It always helps to be prepared.
 It\'s probably all thanks to the life jacket.
 Without that, she might have drowned."
"What kind of girl was she?
 Older or younger than George? Jessica‐chan?"
"She was younger than Jessica onee‐chan.
 She was wearing a life jacket and swimsuit.
 Looked all tired out...!"
"Assuming she washed up somewhere near the harbor, that must\'ve been a bit of luck amid disaster.
 It would\'ve been terrible if she\'d landed on the opposite side of the island..."
"......Still, you have to feel sorry for her.
 With this weather, the boats won\'t be coming.
 I imagine she\'ll also be stuck on this island all day tomorrow."
At that moment, the door clunked open and everyone looked in that direction.
"Would anyone like some tea?"
It was Gohda and Kanon,
 with the latter pushing a serving cart laden with a tea set.
Gohda understood well that doing a little extra at times like this would earn him points.
The relatives, hungry for information, crowded around Gohda...
Gohda ordered Kanon to serve the tea and became the sole object of the relatives\' attention.
"Gohda‐san, how\'s that kid doing?
 Does she seem well...?"
"W‐...well, I don\'t know about that.
 But there is no need to worry...!
 Doctor Nanjo is giving his full attention to taking care of her, and Kumasawa and Shannon are with him.
 Please, do not worry.
 Why not relax with some black tea for now...?
 Come, Kanon‐san.
 Quickly, quickly, serve it, serve it."
"{e:070:...Why do {i:I} have to...}{e:100:"}
Kanon knew that this tea was just Gohda\'s way of earning points,
 so he lined the cups up with a slightly sullen air.
"Uu.
 I\'ll help too."
"......I‐it\'s alright.
 You can just wait there, Maria‐sama."
"Uu!
 I wanna serve tea too!"
"Didn\'t you talk with Doctor Nanjo?
 Did he say anything?"
"Yes. When I met him a short while ago, he said that there weren\'t any serious external wounds...
 And from what I could tell at a glance......"
Just as Gohda had successfully captured the gazes of all present and was about to start talking knowledgeably on the subject, Nanjo returned.
Of course, Nanjo instantly became the center of attention.
 ......Kanon turned his back on Gohda, who seemed downhearted.
"Doctor Nanjo...!
 How is her condition...?!
 Does it look like she\'ll be alright?"
"Not to worry, everyone...
 She is fine.
 She had no injuries at all.
 It seems that she is quite worn out, but there shouldn\'t be anything to worry about, as long as she doesn\'t develop a fever tonight."
"That\'s good to hear.
 ......We\'re lucky enough to have a doctor, but this is no hospital."
Everyone was relieved to hear that the girl was in good health...
When Nanjo gave the more detailed results of his examination, concluding by saying that she was young and should therefore be fine,
 everyone who no longer fell under this description nodded in assent.
"......Uu.
 Boats really are scary.
 Gonna faaall gonna faaall.
 Battler was right..."
"Maria‐chan, let\'s not tell Battler‐kun about this."
"Oh, Madam! Krauss‐sama!"
Gohda, who was feeling sorry for himself and handing out cups, called out in an excessively loud voice.
Apparently, he was that desperate to get everyone\'s attention.
"......How is the guest?"
"Yes sir!
 Her condition is not serious."
"I see. I am glad to hear it.
 Where is she now...?"
"I believe Kumasawa‐san and Shannon‐san were showing her to the bath.
 And they said they would get her some clothes afterwards."
"In that case, they will probably arrive here soon.
 ......Everyone.
 This may be the day of the family conference, but we have a guest brought here by an unfortunate accident.
 She wasn\'t invited, but I want you all to welcome her."
"Who could disagree with that?
 I\'m all for it."
"Same here.
 Didn\'t Mom always tell us to be nice to girls?"
"You take that line way too far."
"......It\'s probably best if we call George and the rest over here too.
 Let\'s all greet her together."
"I\'m not so sure...
 Wouldn\'t that just make her feel more timid...?"
Eva stood up and made a phone call to the guesthouse.
At that moment, they heard the sound of a knock, followed by Genji\'s voice.
"......It is Genji.
 The guest has arrived..."
At those words, everyone fell into silence, and the people who had been sitting stood up straight.
Genji came in first, opening the door slowly,
 .........then moved off to the side, bowing deeply and urging the guest forwards.
The guest had Shannon and Kumasawa following by her side,
 ......and though she looked at the large amount of relatives waiting for her in the parlor, she didn\'t seem overawed in the slightest.
Just this single point...
showed that this girl possessed a dignity appropriate for a guest invited in by the Ushiromiya family...
"......Furudo‐sama, allow me to introduce you.
 This is Ushiromiya Krauss, the representative of the Ushiromiya family head."
"Welcome to Rokkenjima.
 Though you arrived due to an accident, you are a guest of the family.
 We welcome you.
 Please, make yourself at home and relax however you please."
"............Thank you very much.
 ...Allow me to introduce myself.
 ......I am called Furudo Erika ({p:0:古戸ヱリカ})."
"My deepest apologies for disturbing you members of the Ushiromiya family like this.
 ......I am truly grateful for the warm welcome I have received despite my status as an uninvited guest."
......There was a general sigh of acceptance.
The clothes she had been lent were probably Jessica\'s formal wear from long ago,
 ......but the composure of her introduction gave the impression of a dignity by no means inferior to the clothes she wore...
The girl\'s name was Furudo Erika.
She looked slightly younger than Battler and Jessica,
 but her composure and mannerisms were beyond what anyone would have expected from a high‐schooler, almost as though she was a well‐to‐do family\'s daughter...
"Wait a sec.
 ......Who is this person?"
"............With someone incompetent like you as the main character piece, the game wouldn\'t get anywhere.
 That\'s why I\'ve placed myself there as a piece..."
"Well, it\'s just a bit of a bonus.
 Even in a closed circle, it\'d get boring to see the same faces every single time, right?"
"Quit messing around.
 This piece doesn\'t exist on Beato\'s game board.
 Beato and I won\'t acknowledge it...!"
"This is Beato\'s game board, right?
 If Beato refuses, then I\'ll think about it.
 And Beato\'s opinio~n?"
"...................................."
Beato was unable to answer.
{n}......{f:5:Lambdadelta} grinned as though in triumph.
"......Wanna try complaining about the rules and stepping down from the game?
 Isn\'t that the favorite move of you mystery people{p:0:♪}
 If there\'s even a tiny element that goes against your expectations, you have a tantrum and totally stop thinking."
".........Ugh..."
".........Don\'t worry.
 I\'ll make a detective proclamation about this piece."
"Detective proclamation......?"
"{p:1:I proclaim that Furudo Erika is the detective}."
"{p:1:The detective is not the culprit}.
 {p:1:No proof is needed to show this}.
 ......In short, there is absolutely no need to suspect this girl.
 With this guarantee, you can theorize the same way as you always did, even now that she\'s appeared as a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} piece, right...?"
"......That\'s Knox\'s seventh commandment.
 ‘It is forbidden for the detective to be the culprit’.
 There was an exception clause in the original, but for this game
 ‘
{p:1:the detective isn\'t the culprit}’ has been proclaimed in red, so you don\'t need to consider the exception.
 I hate word games, so I\'ll say it in red too.
 {p:1:Furudo Erika is not the culprit}."
"Repetition requested.
 ......‘Furudo Erika had no influence on any of Beato\'s games before now’."
"Sure, I\'ll respond.
 {p:1:Furudo Erika had no influence on any of Beato\'s games before now}.
 She\'s nothing more than an extra character who appears for the first time this round.
 {p:1:She does not exist in the worlds before this one, nor does she influence them}."
"In that case, what happens to the number of people on this island right now?"
"Of course, it\'s plus 1 over the previous number.
 But don\'t worry.
 {p:1:It has only increased by one person: Furudo Erika}.
 {p:1:Besides her, the number of people on this island is exactly the same as it was in the previous games}."
At that time, the loud sound of people running through the corridor could be heard.
It was Battler, George, and Jessica, who had come from the guesthouse after being called here by Eva.
They immediately spotted a guest they didn\'t recognize, and their eyes went wide.
"......Whoa...
 ......Wh‐who are you.........?"
"Uu.
 Guest.
 She came by faaaall faaaalling."
"Huh?
 Fall fall...??"
"...Genji‐san.
 Who is this person...?"
"This is Furudo Erika‐sama, a guest.
 ......Furudo‐sama,
 this is the daughter of the family, Jessica‐sama, along with her cousins George‐sama and Battler‐sama."
"Umm, oh, ......n‐nice to meet you.
 I\'m Ushiromiya Jessica..."
"............Hello.
 My name is Furudo Erika.
 I am very pleased to meet you......"
Though Battler, George, and Jessica didn\'t have a clue what was going on and were utterly bewildered, they each introduced themselves...
"......Isn\'t that convenient.
 This way, the number of people is clear.
 The people in the guesthouse have joined up with the rest, and now, all of the pieces except for Kinzo—all of the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s—have gathered in the parlor."
"Looks like it.
 {p:1:In other words, the number of people in this parlor now is equal to the total number of people on this island}."
"There were supposedly 18 humans on the island, ...but since Grandfather was actually dead, that became 17.
 ......And now that one piece of {f:5:Bernkastel}\'s has been added......"
The number of humans on this island has returned to 18......
"I" glanced around at the humans in the parlor.
The guest, Furudo Erika.
 And behind her, Kumasawa‐san and Shannon‐chan.
 Off to the side was Genji‐san.
Uncle Krauss and Aunt Natsuhi were welcoming the guest.
Gohda‐san immediately started showing off,
 and Kanon‐kun was being unsociable, wearing his usual blank expression.
There was Dad and Kyrie‐san.
 Auntie Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi.
 Auntie Rosa and Maria.
 And Doctor Nanjo.
And on either side of me...
George‐aniki,
 and Jessica...
This is everyone. The true number of people on the island at the moment......
"All of us are Ushiromiyas.
 So please don\'t feel obligated to call us by our family name.
 I\'m George."
"I\'m Battler.
 Nice to meet you!"
"......Thank you very much, George‐san, Battler‐san.
 ......I\'d be pleased if you would call me Erika."
"Nice to meet you, Erika‐san...!"
Erika was welcomed like a guest,
 and it was decided that she could borrow the bedroom next to the cousins\' room on the upper floor of the guesthouse.
In front of all the relatives, she had seemed dignified and a bit stiff.
However, as she talked with George and Jessica, her expression began to soften gradually......
{m:-5:——}And so,
 the "detective", Furudo Erika, was placed on the game board......
"I\'m surprised that Jessica\'s old clothes suit her so well."
"......Kumasawa made the decision on her own to use Milady\'s old clothes.
 Please forgive her."
The clothes Erika was wearing were Jessica\'s old formal attire.
Though the guest possessed a dignity that would put many adults to shame, her body was still physically similar to a middle‐schooler\'s.
 Jessica\'s old clothes fit her perfectly.
"Not to worry.
 They match this guest perfectly.
 If she likes them, I should think it would be all right for her to keep them as a sign of friendship."
"......Certainly.
 Thank you very much."
"Have you contacted the police and her family?"
"Yes.
 They seemed to have been quite distressed."
"............By the way,
 ......our guest really did...have an accident, right?"
"......She said that she fell from a boat as it was returning to port."
"Is there anything to back up that claim?"
"I checked with the Coast Guard.
 It seems that she fell from the rear of a pleasure boat, unnoticed by the others on board.
 We don\'t know the exact location she fell from, but it was probably somewhere near this island..."
".........How foolish, to be out boating with such a bad weather forecast.
 All the same, ......is it really conceivable that she nearly drowned in the nearby waters and drifted to this island?"
"It is not impossible.
 Tales of drifters washing ashore exist on several of the islands around this area."
"..........................."
"......I believe it likely that there was an accident.
 ......This is the middle of a typhoon.
 There is no place on this island where it would be possible to land a boat."
Genji had already figured it out.
Natsuhi almost certainly suspected that this mysterious guest, who had arrived during the already high‐stress family conference,
 might be a pawn in someone\'s plot.
Therefore, Genji had already checked to make sure that the accident was real, that Furudo Erika was her real name,
 and that there was nothing suspicious going on......
"......Very well.
 My husband has ordered you to roll out the red carpet for her.
 Make sure that there are no blunders.
 ......However.........you understand, don\'t you?"
"Yes.
 ......We will not allow her anywhere near the family conference.
 After dinner, I will see that she retires to the guesthouse."
"Make sure that they don\'t start talking about letting her meet Father, or anything like that, either."
"Of course.
 I will keep that in mind."
".........Hoh.
 ...Furudo Erika, was it?
 It\'s rare for guests to come here to Rokkenjima.
 She looks as though she\'ll be entertaining, don\'t you think?"
"She is probably Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}\'s piece.
 ......Though she will follow the rules of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s, the player is a witch.
 We can\'t underestimate her."
"Hmph, there is no problem.
 Even if she were Lady {f:5:Bernkastel} herself, she is a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}, and so she is no match for us.
 ......After all, we have Gaap with us.
 {y:0:Human}{n:0:Human}s certainly cannot win against Gaap!"
"............Thanks.
 Still, it\'s not a good idea to overestimate yourself.
 ......The definition of a witch doesn\'t only imply the ability to use magic."
"True.
 ......A joker and the eye of a typhoon.
 That is what a witch is..."
"Hmph.
 I\'m the one who gets to call herself a witch on this Rokkenjima.
 Only I, the Golden Witch and Endless Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}!
 Let us see how good Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}\'s next piece after Ange is.
 I intend to watch very carefully...!"Erika\'s seat was the lowest one in rank.
 In other words, it was at the inferior end of the table.
Since Kinzo\'s seat at the high end of the table was empty,
 if you turned the whole thing around, it sort of looked like Erika was the host of this dinner...
"Well then, everyone.
 I would like to begin tonight\'s dinner, if I may."
After Gohda\'s announcement, dinner began with the almost customary applause.
It was finally the beginning of the dinner orchestra conducted by Toshiro Gohda.
Sitting at such a majestic dinner table was no everyday thing for these people by any means, except for those in Krauss\'s immediate family.
However, they were all used to it and acted as though this was completely normal.
......Again, if anyone was to be surprised, it should have been Erika.
And yet, she showed no surprise at this dinner,
 and acted with composure, blending in with everyone else.
......There wasn\'t even a sliver of the fear one might expect from someone who had wandered here like a lost puppy.
".........What a mysterious child.
 She doesn\'t seem the least bit flustered over the Ushiromiya family\'s grandest dinner of the year."
"Kids these days have nerves of steel.
 ...Definitely not something I dislike."
"Furudo‐san, are you accustomed to meals like this...?
 I\'m impressed that you look so composed."
"No kiddin\'.
 She\'s a real pro.
 Heck, I still get confused about which fork I\'m supposed to use next.
 Yeah...was it this one, or this one...?
 Waha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!"
Erika had been gracefully eating her hors d\'oeuvres, without showing any confusion over the line of utensils in front of her.
Hideyoshi started joking around with her, gripping a fork in each hand.
Of course, a president of a company in the food service industry like Hideyoshi would obviously know his table manners.
However, thinking that Erika must be nervous over this dinner, he had intentionally spoken with a comic tone of voice.
"............You just have to start on the outside and work your way in.
 ......If that\'s too much trouble, then just ask for some chopsticks.
 ......Any self‐respecting Japanese would use chopsticks."
"Chopsticks are wonderful.
 Just a single pair, and you can handle any kind of food!"
As soon as she began talking about chopsticks, her eyes started glittering.
......The smile she now showed for the first time was far different from the dignity she had shown before and more like something you\'d expect from someone her age.
"*giggle*.
 But you\'d use a spoon for curry and rice at least, wouldn\'t you?"
"Simply pour it into a bowl {c:86EF9C:donburi}‐style.
 Is there anyone who eats gyuudon with a spoon?
 Of course not.
 We Japanese must unwaveringly, unfailingly, unflinchingly use chopsticks!
 So, Gohda‐san.
 If you please, I would like some chopsticks.
 I shall show everyone the proud and proper way for a Japanese person to eat!"
"......Incidentally, what is the next dish?"
"Unfortunately, that would be soup."
As she pretended to shrug, Erika winked at everyone.
"""Wahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!!"""
Of course, no one was laughing at her.
She obviously knew that soup came after hors d\'oeuvres in a full course meal.
Furthermore, Erika had even noticed that she had performed a little too perfectly,
 creating a sense of tension that led Hideyoshi to think that she was nervous herself,
 and that this was why he had tried to break the ice.
That was why she\'d started behaving a little childish and light‐hearted,
 acting out the part of a guest enjoying a harmonious dinner......
Pretty soon, not only Kyrie, but everyone else also caught on.
Even though she was an uninvited guest, she was apparently worthy of participating in an Ushiromiya family dinner.
"Smart kid.
 ......Did she really just come here by coincidence?
 Are we sure she isn\'t an illegitimate child of Nii‐san\'s he secretly invited to today\'s family conference?"
"It seems she\'s not only smart, but knows how to brighten the mood too.
 And her manners are simply wonderful.
 It wouldn\'t be bad at all to have this girl as a daughter."
"Hihihihi.
 That\'s pretty cruel.
 Where does that leave Jessica‐chan?"
"*giggle*.
 That\'s mean, Rudolf nii‐san."
"What\'s wrong, Jessica‐chan?
 Headache?"
"Uuuu...
 I can feel my reputation dropping by the minute......"
"C\'mon, as the daughter of the head family, you can\'t let this stand.
 Try fighting back with the table manners and dignity Aunt Natsuhi\'s always teaching you."
"Wanna see, wanna see!
 Wanna see table manners!
 Uu!"
"Hey, making a fuss is bad manners.
 Come on, Jessica‐chan.
 Show us how it\'s done."
"......S‐sure, no sweat..."
Jessica straightened up so much it looked like someone had poked her in the back with a pole.
......She had good posture, but it somehow lacked elegance.
{n}She looked...well...kind of like a triangle ruler.
She sat at attention with her gaze fixed straight ahead, tried to bring her food to her mouth despite this,
 ......and failed miserably.
Dad, who was sitting next to her, suddenly realized that something was up.
"Hm?
 What is it, Jessica‐chan?
 Your stomach hurt??"
Jessica turned bright red.
 ......Ah, sorry, I can\'t help myself...
We laughed our heads off.
{n}Jessica protested, still bright red.
{n}Aunt Natsuhi scolded us for not behaving ourselves.
In the end, no matter how much we tried to smooth it over, we were who we were.
{n}We couldn\'t act like we were anything else.
Still, that laughter really did help us to relax.
We had been so concerned about the guest getting nervous that we had grown even more nervous ourselves.
The lively chatter spread from where we were sitting at the center of the long table to both ends,
 and ultimately, the dinner went even more smoothly than usual...
With some delicious cheese and coffee, our peaceful meal came to an end.
Gohda won unanimous acclaim and was praised for his skill by all present......
After a short period of harmony following the meal, it was decided that we would return to the guesthouse.
Normally, dinner tended to have a very dark atmosphere about it,
 and the adults would often move right on to the family conference with the same dark atmosphere.
However, perhaps because this year\'s dinner had been oddly peaceful, everyone decided to take a break, the adults included.
After eating, taking a bath, and relaxing while watching TV,
 I wonder if they\'ll gather again in the mansion in the middle of all this rain and resume their high‐tension family conference...
 I\'d rather not think about that.
 Auntie Eva seemed to get very worked up trying to convince the rest to start the family conference right away, but it didn\'t look like many people agreed with her.
 The meeting had probably come to a close for the night.
Since they had guesthouse duty, Gohda‐san and Kumasawa‐san were chosen to guide us to the guesthouse.
It must be tough for Gohda‐san.
Even after making and cleaning up such an extravagant dinner, he also has the midnight shift at the guesthouse.
I heard that Kumasawa‐san, old as she was, would be going to sleep soon.
It seemed that she had been assigned the servants\' quarters in the guesthouse.
"Please allow me to guide all of you to the guesthouse.
 Erika‐sama, your room has also been prepared."
"............Thank you very much."
"Why not rest a bit?
 Are you sure you feel alright?"
"...That\'s right.
 I\'d totally forgotten, but you nearly drowned and floated here, didn\'t you, Erika‐chan?
 It\'s probably best if you take it easy today and get to bed early."
".........I\'m perfectly fine.
 ......On the contrary, I\'m so nervous and excited that I doubt I could get to sleep."
"Uu‐uu!!
 Then let\'s play, let\'s all play together!
 Play cards!"
Maria latched on to her, giggling.
This lack of restraint particular to youth was very much like Maria.
{n}......But for now, we really should be thinking about Erika\'s physical condition.
"Maria, why don\'t you play cards with us.
 Erika onee‐chan says she\'s tired."
"......I like cards.
 Please let me join you after I\'ve had a short rest."
"Uu‐uu‐uu!! Hooray!!"
"..................Who is that?"
As she passed through the lobby of the entrance hall, Erika stopped walking......
{n}When we saw what she was looking at, ......the rest of us also stopped.
"......Oh, that is the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama."
"............The Golden...
......Witch."
"What\'re you doing, brats?
 Get your asses in gear, we\'re off back to the guesthouse."
Dad, Kyrie‐san, Auntie Eva, Uncle Hideyoshi, and Auntie Rosa all came over.
The guesthouse party had all gathered.
However, Erika\'s gaze was captured by the portrait of the witch, and she simply stared at it for a while......
"......Yeah.
 Supposedly, Dad has a stash of hidden gold worth 20 billion yen,
 and the hiding place for that gold is written of on this epitaph."
Perhaps because it was too early for them all to disperse into their individual rooms,
 the relatives who had returned to the guesthouse were all gathered downstairs, continuing their chat.
The topic......was the witch\'s epitaph, which Erika had taken an interest in.
".........It really is a fascinating riddle.
 .........He displayed it in a place where anyone could see it as a challenge to our intellect.
 .........I adore challenges like that."
"Whoa.
 I didn\'t expect you to be so into this, Erika‐chan.
 Do you like solving riddles or something?"
"......Well, they\'re interesting, don\'t you think?
 These kinds of challenges.
 ............I have no doubt that Kinzo‐san intends to use that epitaph to choose his successor."
When she said that, the adults froze,
 ......and slowly turned to face Erika...
"Why.........do you think that...?"
Auntie Eva spoke with a coaxing voice.
......Though there had been whisperings between the relatives every now and then that the person who solved the epitaph\'s riddle might inherit the family headship,
 ......that had been nothing more than wishful thinking, since such a thing had never been specifically stated.
And yet, though she had only read it once......this outsider had already reached that conclusion.
How had she come to it?
{n}No, .........that wasn\'t the problem.
{n}"If you solve the epitaph, you can become the next head".
She wanted to establish this not as wishful thinking......but an outright fact.
So they closed in around Erika, asking why she was so sure.
".........It\'s somewhat common for extremely rich people to relinquish their wealth to the person who solves a riddle.
 ......Furthermore, Kinzo‐san didn\'t publish this epitaph in a newspaper,
 but displayed it within the mansion.
 That means the riddle is intended for the people in this mansion."
"You\'re right...
 .........Since it\'s inside the mansion, there\'s no way for someone who can\'t enter the mansion to solve it.
 ...So, that means Grandfather has been challenging the people in this mansion."
".........<Good>.
 Well thought.
 Just by the simple fact that the epitaph is inside the mansion, it\'s possible to figure out that much."
At first, this Furudo Erika girl had seemed to be the fairly silent type,
 ......but apparently, that wasn\'t the case.
When she grew excited about being challenged to a game of wits, she became much more talkative than I had imagined.
"I, I see......
 Well, it does make sense that an epitaph inside a mansion would be there so the people in that mansion could read it......"
"But......can you really be so sure that the one who solves it will be given the headship too?"
".........If the treasure gained by solving the riddle had been something small,
 I would not even have considered it."
"That\'s right.
 The hidden gold is worth 20 billion.
 ......You could consider it the wealth of the Ushiromiya family itself."
"............Inheriting that would be tantamount to inheriting the Ushiromiya family itself.
 ...In other words, the riddle contained within the epitaph that indicates the hiding place of the gold is nothing less than a way of selecting the practical successor of the Ushiromiya family."
......The idea that the person who solved the epitaph would be chosen as the next head...
was something that had been floating around between a few of the relatives for a while now.
However, since it had never been stated specifically, they had thought of it as nothing more than an optimistic dream.
......And so they had abandoned all consideration of that aspect and left it as a gray area.
Erika had declared in clear terms that this uncertain part was, in fact, true.
If one of the relatives had said it, the others would have thought it to be merely an optimistic dream.
However, when declared by Furudo Erika, a complete outsider,
 those words seemed more credible than they otherwise would have......
Everyone remained silent for a while, slowly considering what those words implied...
".........All it takes is the presence of that epitaph,
 and a deduction like this becomes trivial for Furudo Erika.
 ......Your thoughts, ladies and gentlemen?"
"......S‐sorry to butt in,
 but my father is the successor to the head.
 It doesn\'t matter who finds the gold,
 because just finding it doesn\'t make someone the head, right?"
Jessica thought the treasure‐hunting part of the epitaph was really fun.
However, she couldn\'t help but let her expression grow bitter once they started talking about undermining her father\'s position...
"......As far as I can deduce,
 Kinzo‐san does not seem to wish for Krauss‐san to have a smooth transition to inheriting the headship."
"Wh‐why\'s that?!!"
".........Becoming the head of the Ushiromiya family, with all of the vast wealth it entails, would mean gaining a great deal of influence in a political sense.
 ......Ordinarily, then, the succession should be rigorously conducted so that no element of doubt is permitted to creep into the equation."
"Th‐...that\'s right.
 ......It happens a lot in those stories about Sengoku period military commanders that my husband loves.
 When there are multiple candidates for the successor, it usually results in a family dispute..."
"...That\'s right......
 That\'s why it\'s important to clearly specify a successor, so you can avoid any trouble.
 Sometimes, there\'s even a purge of all the competin\' successors."
Even the Sengoku commander Hideyoshi admired, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, made his son‐in‐law Hidetsugu commit seppuku,
 but it was rumored that he might have done this to make Hideyori, who was his real son and born after Hidetsugu, his true heir.
......In other words, naming a successor was a way to make it known to the world that a given single, unique person would be acknowledged by everyone as the successor,
 and a way to remove any chance of another person becoming an opposing candidate.
".........<Good>.
 That\'s exactly correct.
 The only purpose for an epitaph like that would be to cast doubt on Krauss‐san\'s position as successor to the head.
 In other words, if Kinzo‐san wished for Krauss‐san to become the head without any trouble, he would have no reason to go out of his way to display something so dangerous for all to see."
"Yes.
 .........If you flip over the chessboard, you certainly could say that.
 It would be odd if he handed over the position of the head normally, but wouldn\'t hand over the 20 billion yen in gold except to the person who solved the riddle."
Giving up the title of head, but only giving the 20 billion yen in gold to the person who solved the epitaph...
......You really couldn\'t call that passing on the headship in the truest sense.
".........So there you have it.
 With this logic, I can cast doubt upon whether Kinzo‐san truly acknowledged Krauss‐san as his successor.
 ......All it takes is the presence of that epitaph,
 and a deduction like this becomes trivial for Furudo Erika."
"......Your thoughts, Jessica‐san?"
"Wh‐...what the hell is that?!!
 That\'s not logic!
 That\'s bullshit!! You\'re just making it all up!!"
Jessica let her emotions lay bare and glared at Erika.
...Erika, on the other hand,
 looked exceedingly calm with an expression that said "The truth is the truth".
.........I see.
 It looks like table manners aren\'t the only way this Erika girl is fitting for the Ushiromiya family.
...It seems she really is like the family, ......even in ways that it would\'ve been better if she wasn\'t...
"Okay, okay... T‐take it easy, Jessica...
 ......And Erika, let\'s leave it at that for now."
"Well, umm, we can put all this about the successor to the side for now.
 Any way you slice it, there\'s no doubt that it\'s Father\'s big question for us.
 ......Wahahaha!
 It\'s 20 billion yen!
 Maria‐chan, what would you use it for if you found it?
 Waha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!"
"......Uu.
 The Golden Land isn\'t just gold.
 It\'s a sacred place!"
Uncle Hideyoshi persisted with his fake laughter, attempting to force the mood to improve.
Everyone else tried to go along with him, but Jessica\'s mood didn\'t get any better.
"Ha...hahahaha.
 So, Erika‐chan, would you like to have a go at the epitaph\'s riddle?"
"............Yes.
 My little gray cells are itching to get started.
 So I would like to start solving at once, if I may."
George‐aniki skillfully turned the conversation around.
Just like the time she had made everyone laugh in the dining hall, Erika looked about with gleeful eyes and jumped at the chance.
"*giggle*giggle*.
 I like it.
 .........Well, since Erika‐chan seems so interested,
 let\'s all try and solve it together, just like last year."
"I\'ll make some coffee.
 Raise your hand if you want some.
 Not for you, Maria!
 You won\'t be able to sleep...!"
"Uu‐uu!!
 Wanna drink black coffee!!"
"...................................."
"......Don\'t they get you excited?
 Riddles like this.
 .........I adore them."
Erika said that and smiled...
Even though she must have known that she\'d ticked Jessica off and made the atmosphere sour,
 ......she just smiled nonchalantly...
"......See? There\'s a mystery you can solve even without waiting for the crime on October 5th."
"........................
 ......I did try to solve it a bunch of times.
 But—"
".........But you didn\'t have a clue, so you gave up and stopped thinking.
 ...Right?"
It pissed me off, but I didn\'t have a good counter for that.
After all, ......I don\'t get the epitaph at all.
I don\'t even know what the beloved home of old means, much less the parts about the sweetfish river and the key...
Thinking that a few more hints would show up if I waited,
 ......I kept on waiting, ...and just stopped thinking......
".........Have you figured out an answer on your own?
 .........Because I\'m about to {i:solve it}."
"Wh‐what......?"
"This is where Bern solved the riddle of the epitaph.
 ......I\'d expect no less from the Witch of Miracles.
 "If a riddle is solvable, she can solve it without fail regardless of the difficulty".
 ......How many years did it take to solve this one?"
".........How rude.
 I only fished through a few hundred fragments."
"Heheh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eheh......
 You really are terrifying."
"You better not have cheated by suddenly saying the answer in red or something like that..."
".........Don\'t worry.
 Just like you, I followed the rules as a player.
 ......Well, shall we begin?
 .........It\'s cramped here.
 Why don\'t we talk at sea?"
"OK.
 ...Don\'t get queasy, Battler."
"What do you mean, sea...?
 ...............?!"
Right after I thought the world had turned pitch black,
 ......I was struck by a strange floating sensation.
It must have felt like suddenly having the floor drop from under you, sending you into a bottomless pitfall...
When I looked,
 ......I saw that the two witches and I...
...had been thrown into a pitch black universe.
This space was cloaked in endless darkness in every direction, and it felt like an infinite expanse filled with countless glittering objects.
......Instead of a universe, some people might have likened it to the depths of an ocean where countless glittering fragments drifted.
"Uh, ......wh‐whoa................!"
"............Didn\'t she tell you not to get queasy?"
"If you want the concept of gravity, just create it yourself, okay?
 ......Come on, calm down and look at us.
 ......Come on, don\'t we look like we\'re just fine?
 ......Believe that your feet are on the ground and that you\'re being controlled by gravity.
 ......If you do that, you\'ll find your equilibrium."
Sh‐she\'s right... The two witches {i:were} standing normally, as though their feet were planted on a transparent piece of glass.
I was the only one floating about like someone in a rapidly plummeting elevator.
......When I saw that they were just fine, I started calming down, figuring that there was no need to be scared.
Then, just as {f:5:Lambdadelta} said,
 I gritted my teeth and kept telling myself that there was a place to stand here...and that I had to calm down......
"Whoa, whoa............ Ohh..."
"Very good, very good.
 ......What\'s your name?"
"Ushiromiya Battler.
 ......Who else do I look like?"
"OK.
 No matter what, you mustn\'t lose your will, emotions, or form.
 After all, this is the ocean.
 If you lose your purpose, you\'ll fall into the depths of eternity and become a scrap of ocean seaweed.
 Be careful."
I didn\'t get what {f:5:Lambdadelta} was saying, but I tried to calm down for the time being.
I seemed to be regaining my balance the more I calmed down.
Gradually, that weird floating feeling, like I was falling forever, began to disappear.
......It still felt strange, like struggling to stand upright at the bottom of a deep pool, but it was much better than before.
".........Then let\'s begin.
 .........I\'ll weave a fragment for solving the riddle of the epitaph......"
{f:5:Bernkastel} opened both of her hands.
Then, like a planetarium...
......all of the fragments throughout this empty space began to spin, leaving tails behind them...
The expression "planetarium" might have been even more fitting than I thought...
......Multiple fragments were tied together by gold lines,
 and what looked like constellations zoomed by us rapidly, one after another.
It felt almost as though we were dashing through space at an incredible speed...
Then, with tails of light drifting behind them,
 ......several brightly glowing fragments swirled around {f:5:Bernkastel}.
It looked almost like she had created her own solar system with her as the sun.
That solar system surrounding {f:5:Bernkastel} grew to a radius large enough to swallow us up.
And every once in a while, one of the satellite fragments zoomed right past me.
When those fragments passed right by me,
 ......it felt as though some kind of memory welled up inside me.
I could feel it in my gut.
......These fragments were probably like crystals of memories.
"They aren\'t memories.
 They\'re fragments of worlds.
 ......Well, I guess they might feel like memories to you."
"............Then let\'s begin.
 ...Let\'s start with this fragment."
One of the satellites in this solar system was slowly sucked in towards {f:5:Bernkastel} as its orbit around her decayed.
It drew a spiral as it approached her, and came to rest on the palm of her outstretched hand...
Then, it shone brightly, painting over the world with pure white......
"...The "beloved home of old" definitely won\'t betray our expectations.
 ......The only past that Father held dear was his years as a boy."
".........I remember that.
 ...This is when, in the third game, Auntie Eva was just about to solve the riddle of the epitaph, and was thinking it over with this witch inside her or whatever."
"............That\'s right.
 And, from these thoughts, she made her way to the correct answer.
 In other words, this fragment shows a vital hint for reaching the truth.
 .........In other words, it means that {i:this theory is not mistaken}."
"So, ......you\'re saying we should assume this beloved home of old isn\'t a metaphor or anything like that...
but the place Grandfather actually spent his youth?"
".........That\'s right.
 And at the very least, it isn\'t Odawara."
".........Odawara is definitely where he was born, but I don\'t think this home Father loved was Odawara.
 I believe all of us siblings are thinking of the same place."
"...Yes.
 This probably isn\'t Odawara.
 From what I\'ve heard, he had a very fun time as a youth."
"That\'s right......
 ......Auntie Eva and her siblings said that it wasn\'t Odawara.
 ......And not only that, it looks like everyone had a good idea where Grandfather\'s home was."
"......Right.
 And annoyingly, the actual location isn\'t spoken of in any of the fragments."
"Of course.
 If I told you that, there\'d be too many hints.
 .........If a riddle isn\'t hard, there\'s {i:just no point to it}.
 ......Uh‐oh,
 that\'s a hint too.
 *giggle*......"
"........................
 ......Just where is this home of Grandfather\'s?
 ...We can\'t even start if we don\'t know that..."
"You mean you couldn\'t start, so you stopped thinking?
 ......Since it had to be a place where he could have lived, the number of possibilities is limited.
 .........Well, this is the toughest part."
".........You were the witch who could "certainly solve any riddle that can be solved", weren\'t you?
 ......So you took those limited possibilities,
 ...in other words, everywhere on the earth, and considered every single piece of land that Grandfather might have lived on?"
"............That would work too, but that way, no amount of time would be enough.
 So, I needed to take some more hints into consideration to wring out the answer."
"......Didn\'t you say it yourself?
 You said it didn\'t have to be a river with water flowing down it.
 ......If the word sweetfish is too complicated, why not forget it forever...?"
"Think of a river.
 A river.
 Linking it with a "family tree" wasn\'t a bad idea.
 Try thinking about how to link a river with something else along those lines......"
".........A sweetfish river running through his home of old.
 However, this river isn\'t truly a river.
 ......Eva thought of something else, something that could be linked with a river."
"Sure......
 But if it isn\'t a river, then why the sweetfish...?
 ....................."
".........Think.
 A river that runs through the home of old.
 ......But it isn\'t a river with water running down it.
 Something that can be likened to a river........."
"..........................."
".........Behold the sweetfish river, running through my beloved home of old.
 ......Eva knew where his old home was, so she ignored the sweetfish hint.
 ......However, since we don\'t know where it is, this could be a hint for us."
".........I racked my brains too much over the sweetfish river.
 The sweetfish part didn\'t really matter that much at all, did it?"
"That isn\'t true.
 It was an excellent hint, if you ask me.
 Well, of course, maybe there was no need for it to be sweetfish."
"............What are these "sweetfish"...?
 ......If the river isn\'t a literal river, then of course, "sweetfish" probably doesn\'t mean the kind of fish that swims."
"Yeah.
 And on top of that, Rosa tossed it aside, saying that sweetfish weren\'t that significant."
".........And on the other hand, Eva said that it wasn\'t important for them to be sweetfish, but that it was still an excellent hint.
 .........In other words, the "sweetfish" is a key to make you think of something else.
 If that something is a different word, but a word that sweetfish makes you think of, then Eva\'s line about how it "probably didn\'t have to be sweetfish" makes sense..."
"...................................."
From these thoughts, Auntie Eva formed some theory,
 ......went to the archive, looked through some kind of book, and {i:verified that she was right}.
In short, Auntie Eva formed some theory about the true nature of this sweetfish river running through his home of old.
Then, ......she opened a certain book to determine whether that theory was correct or not.
In other words, this theory was something that could be verified through some kind of book...
Also, after she figured out what the sweetfish river was, she figured out the rest of the riddle very quickly......
".........Good thinking.
 ......The epitaph continues on, saying "as you travel down it, you will see a village".
 At that point in time, Eva hadn\'t yet solved the three lines starting with this one."
"......What is {i:village}?
 What does it mean?!
 Is there a village if you go down this "river"......?!
 ............ah, .........aaaaaaaahhh......!!"
All those pieces that I hadn\'t been able to understand at all were...
...right before my eyes, starting to...
...snap,
 snap into place, all by themselves......
I couldn\'t even remember to close my open mouth.
{n}...My throat grew completely dry...
Is it......really alright for this to be the answer?
{n}R‐really?
 Really...?!
"...So...
if we figure out what the "sweetfish river running through my beloved home of old" is,
 ......that leads us directly to understanding the "as you travel down it, you will see a village" stuff, ......and then we get the key to the Golden Land."
"............Correct.
 And we know that because even Eva didn\'t know what the village meant until she checked the book."
"Dammit...
 ......Just what is this book...?!"
"...But this isn\'t six characters at all.
 ......I\'m absolutely sure that this is the answer, but this doesn\'t reach six characters at all...!"
Did you stop thinking again?
 In that case, think of a way you could read it with six characters.
If you can\'t think of one, then research it.
 ......There has to be an answer.
 You must not doubt that.
If you can\'t believe that, why don\'t you cry yourself to sleep, and then just give up and die forever...?
"............One,
 two,
 three,
 four,
 five,
 six..."
"......Oooh,
 ...s‐
......
six characters...
 ......I,
 ......I found it.
 ...This is...
......the Golden Land\'s...
k‐
 ......key.........!!"
"............Then, Eva found the key to the Golden Land."
"Yeah.
 And this key...
...was some kind of word, number, or string of characters...six characters long!"
".........That\'s it.
 If we know that the key\'s true identity is six characters, the meaning of the first twilight changes drastically."
"O‐...on the first twilight, sacrifice the six chosen by the key...
 ......The six...chosen by the key...
 .........Six characters......!"
In other words, ......it means "on the first twilight, sacrifice the six {i:characters} chosen by the key"...!
"This key points towards a certain specific group of six people.
 ......No, we should say it points to a certain specific group of six things.
 ......If this doesn\'t mean a literal command to offer sacrifices.
 ......For example, it could be an anagram."
"An anagram?
 Do you mean a word game...?"
That\'s right, Kyrie‐san theorized this already way back then...!
"...On the second twilight, it says "those who remain".
 ......Which means that, at the very least, that "something" has a finite number of characters.
 You could read it like it\'s telling you to continue with the remaining characters after the six characters are removed."
"In other words, on the first twilight, we take a list of characters that\'s longer than six,
 "kill" the six that are the key,
 and then do something with the characters that remain...!"
"............That\'s right.
 But, like Kyrie said,
 what should we kill the characters from?
 ......We don\'t know this longer string of characters that we\'re supposed to be killing from."
On the first twilight, kill the six characters that are the key.
{n}.....................On the first twilight.
"......In other words, ...by the time we reach the first twilight, some string of characters already exists?
 But {ruby:the first twilight:{p:0:第一の晩}} only has four characters.
 Are we meant to read it differently?
 If we read it in English like Grandfather would, maybe "the first twilight"? Or...something else like...{NOTE:For non‐english translations, this line should change to "If we read it in English like Grandfather would, what would "the first twilight" become?", and the following line should be in ENGLISH, not your translation\'s language:}
first night...?
 ............"
".........<Good>.
 That idea of yours is quite insightful, Battler‐san.
 ......We can interpret the six sacrifices chosen by the key as a string of six characters.
 I think that\'s a clever way of thinking outside the box.
 After all, key‐shaped objects are not the only types of keys."
"I also thought of the possibility that it\'s an anagram."
"......Come to think of it, you did say something like that before.
 But in that case, what do we remove the six characters from?"
"That\'s right.
 ......Since we\'re removing six characters from it, whatever it is must be at least six characters long.
 How could we read it{NOTE:"it" means "the first twilight":} in a way that gives us more than six characters...?"
"If we follow Father\'s sensibilities...I guess it probably is English after all..."
".........If it looks like we\'re getting stuck, why don\'t we move on to the second twilight and look for hints?"
"......Those who remain shall tear apart the two who are close.
 ......We can probably think of "those who remain" as "the remaining characters after the first six have been removed"."
"In that case, ......what does it mean by two characters that are close...?"
".........I see.
 ......I get it, so that\'s what this is about...!"
For example, let\'s take the following list of nine characters: 123456789.
{n}And then, let\'s say that the six characters offered as sacrifices are 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
{n}We erase the aforementioned six characters from 123456789...and get x2x45xxxx.
"So 2, 4, and 5 are left.
 ......So what?"
"......Oh, ......4 and 5 are close..."
"Yes, I get it!!
 So by "the two who are close", it means..."
{a:c:x2x45xxxx}.
"Yep.
 There\'s a gap between 2 and 4, but 4 and 5 are right next to each other.
 They\'re the two who are close...!"
".........<Good>.
 Well done, Battler‐san.
 I can\'t tell whether to "tear apart" means to eliminate 4 and 5,
 or to put a gap between them, but I think that\'s a good observation."
"Then what do you think about the third twilight, those who remain shall praise my noble name?"
".........Since there\'s a good chance that the epitaph is a word game, there\'s a possibility that this part is also a word game of sorts.
 ......‘The characters that remain shall praise my noble name’."
"Hmmmmm......
 That\'s tough...
 ......What could it mean...?"
".........Have any of you figured it out?
 .........I think I have."
"Huh?
 What is it? Tell me...!"
"......Is this also...an anagram?"
".........<Good> once again.
 ...Battler‐san, you\'re a pretty flexible thinker."
"By anagram, you mean playing with letters, right?
 ......That means......"
"I would guess they mean that you can make some kind of word by changing the order of the remaining letters."
"Yeah.
 ......If so, ..................
 ......I might be getting ahead of myself a bit with this theory,
 ...but I\'m going to assume the original list of characters that the first twilight is taken out of is eleven characters long."
"............Well done again.
 I reached the same conclusion."
"Wh‐why\'s that?
 How can you be sure there are eleven characters?!"
".........‘Killing a single sacrifice’ appears to mean "eliminating a single character".
 If we interpret the "tear apart" of the second twilight to mean adding a gap between two characters, then we would expect there to be eleven characters in total.
 If "tear apart" means to eliminate those two characters, then we would expect thirteen."
"......The reason for this is that from the fourth twilight to the eighth twilight, the word "kill" appears five times.
 And then, on the ninth twilight, it\'s written that none will be left alive."
"If we ignore the part about the witch reviving for now,
 I figured it meant that after eliminating six characters on the first twilight, separating the characters that are close, and then eliminating five more......
there should be exactly none left."
So that makes 6+5=11 characters.
{n}If tearing apart the two who are close on the second twilight means to kill both of them,
 that makes 6+2+5=13 characters.
{n}There\'s a chance that the word symbolizing the first twilight has eleven or thirteen characters......
".........Wonderfully done. Exactly my logic.
 ......It looks like you were gifted with the same little gray cells I was, Battler‐san."
"Hey, quit it.
 Just doing what comes naturally."
"............Hang on, what the hell?
 ......My piece is pretty damn clever, isn\'t he?
 There\'s no room left for me to make theories."
"Oh, sorry about that.
 ......You weren\'t around at this point, so I just controlled your piece for you.
 .........Isn\'t it nice how sharp I made you seem...?"
"*giggle*giggle*giggle*...!
 You look so much smarter when Bern\'s playing as you.
 ......Why not step down as the player and concentrate on being the piece instead?"
I joined in on this game on October 5th, after the first few murders.
So up until that point, the piece called "me" was being controlled by {f:5:Bernkastel}, the player.
Which makes it possible for {f:5:Bernkastel} to present her reasoning through "my" mouth...
......The game I\'m watching now is nothing more than a replay of a part that\'s already ended.
However, that\'s probably good enough for now.
......This {f:5:Bernkastel}‐sama has gone out of her way to solve the epitaph for me.
...So I\'ll watch closely for now.
.........And......I\'ll try to find out what it means.
{n}{f:5:Lambdadelta} let it slip herself just a second ago.
"Of course.
 If I told you that, there\'d be too many hints.
 .........If a riddle isn\'t hard, there\'s {i:just no point to it}.
 ......Uh‐oh, that\'s a hint too. *giggle*......"
......This theory about Grandfather creating the epitaph in order to choose a successor isn\'t bad at all.
Erika and {f:5:Bernkastel}\'s logic is extremely reasonable.
But that\'s only if we assume Grandfather was the one to create it.
He was probably alive at the time the epitaph was displayed,
 but of course, ......he\'s already dead by 1986.
And, in the games up until now, {f:5:Beatrice} threatened us repeatedly with letters,
 saying that the only way to survive was to solve the epitaph, and trying to force us to solve the riddle.
In other words, ......it was {f:5:Beatrice}\'s intention, ...her hope......that we would try solving the riddle of the epitaph.
The epitaph is so confusing that, in most cases,
 the relatives never seriously tried solving it until the threatening letters started to arrive.
That\'s why {f:5:Beatrice} fired the starting pistol which made us take a go at it.
.................................
.........Why is {f:5:Beatrice} carrying out Grandfather\'s last wishes......?
Like the theory proposed in the first game, ......is she really Grandfather\'s confidant,
 following his orders even after his death and trying to select the successor with the riddle of the epitaph in his stead...?
That would mean that {f:5:Beatrice} really is Grandfather\'s trusted underling,
 and exactly the family alchemist she called herself in that letter...
After Grandfather\'s death, {f:5:Beatrice} would have managed the ten tons of gold and taken the title of alchemist.
......Without ever embezzling the gold,
 she entrusted it all to the epitaph\'s riddle, and waited for a human fitting to be the successor to appear and solve it......
And if that human didn\'t appear within a set time limit,
 ......that meant game over?
Certainly, when Auntie Eva solved the riddle in the third game,
 she became the only survivor and, automatically, the final head of the Ushiromiya family, inheriting everything.
Up to this moment, no one has ever survived past October 5th except Auntie Eva, the one who solved the epitaph......
That was the only case where {f:5:Beatrice} let anyone survive......
.................................
Is {f:5:Beatrice}\'s loyalty to Grandfather......the thing that drives her.........?
Did Grandfather give her some terrible order to kill everyone if the epitaph isn\'t solved,
 and she\'s so loyal that she faithfully carries that out......?
........................
......I must not stop thinking.
 ...Don\'t......stop thinking......
Don\'t just think of the riddle itself......think about why it\'s significant.
.................................
Why is {f:5:Beatrice} telling us to solve the epitaph......?
Why did she create {i:such a confusing} epitaph for us......?
......If {f:5:Beatrice} makes us try and solve this epitaph that we have no real chance of solving,
 .........and by some lucky chance, a "miracle" occurs and someone is able to solve it......
......what significance does that have to her.........?
I don\'t know......what this miracle would be worth to Beato.
"Anyway, ......until we figure out the first twilight, we\'ll have to give up on the rest."
We tried looking at it from several different angles, but in the end, we got stuck there and made no further advances.
"Mmph, ...fwaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh......"
Maria let out an extra‐large yawn.
This caused several other people to yawn.
{n}...We had been using our heads so much that everyone had gotten a little sleepy.
Jessica, who had been silent and looking displeased the whole time, quickly stood up.
"......I\'m going upstairs with Maria.
 We\'ll watch TV or something."
"All right...
 I\'ll go up too.
 Hey, why don\'t we all play cards upstairs?"
When George proposed this, Maria completely forgot about that big yawn of hers and started jumping around, insisting that she wanted to play cards.
Judging by the clock, it would soon be ten at night.
It was already about that time you normally take a bath and get ready for sleep.
Even the adults seemed pretty weary from traveling.
We decided to continue this later and went our separate ways...
"Will you play with us too, Erika‐chan?
 Cards?"
".........I appreciate the sentiment.
 I overstepped my bounds a little, forgetting that I\'m a simple guest.
 I\'d like to take it easy and rest for the night.
 .........I\'d almost forgotten that I was just in an accident."
"Seriously.
 You\'re in such high spirits it\'s hard to believe you almost drowned."
"*giggle*.
 That\'s youth for you.
 Still, I enjoyed it.
 I think we\'ve taken a big step in our reasoning thanks to you.
 If I find the gold, I\'ll let you have about a million yen\'s worth."
"Wahahaha!
 Can\'t you at least offer the poor girl a hundred million!
 Uhahaha!"
"There\'s really no need.
 I\'m only interested in solving the riddle.
 ......Well then, if you\'ll excuse me.
 ......Good night."
"Yeah, \'night."
"Oh, you aren\'t going upstairs, Battler‐kun?"
"......I\'m getting a bit interested here.
 I\'ll think things through here just a bit longer.
 If I can just figure out the list of characters that marks the first twilight, I\'ll bet the road before me will open up all at once..."
Everyone went up to the second floor one by one.
Only Auntie Rosa remained behind, cleaning up the coffee cups everyone had been drinking out of.
Kyrie‐san and some others had offered to help,
 but since Auntie Rosa had refused this, she was washing them all alone.
Since I\'d just been treated to such delicious coffee, I decided to help too.
......I wasn\'t just doing it because I felt obligated.
{n}I wanted to keep discussing the epitaph with someone.
".........The first twilight...the first twilight.
 ......Gah.
 Auntie Rosa, have you thought of some list of characters or a word?"
"Nope...
 I don\'t have a clue.
 .........But instead of the first twilight, it\'s the tenth twilight that bugs me."
"The tenth twilight...?
 What about it?"
"Well,
 .........the word "Golden Land" ({ruby:ougonkyou:{p:0:黄金郷}}) appears several times, right?"
"Yes, it does."
"For some reason......on the tenth twilight alone, when the journey ends, it says we reach the "Home of the Gold" ({p:0:黄金の郷}), read "ougon {i:no} kyou"—no, sorry, "ougon no sato".
 The "Home" kanji ({ruby:kyou/sato:{p:0:郷}}) is separated out.
 I can\'t help but wonder why this is the one place where it\'s written like that."
"............You\'re right.
 ...No mistake.
 Everywhere else, it says "Golden Land" ({ruby:ougonkyou:{p:0:黄金郷}})..."
Even though all the rest are written "Golden Land", the tenth twilight is the only one where it\'s different,
 and "Home of the Gold" is written instead...
I wonder if the word "Home" ({ruby:kyou/sato:{p:0:郷}}) has some kind of special meaning.........
...........................
"Still, ......you and that Erika‐chan girl are incredible.
 The way you think really is flexible.
 ...I\'m already an old lady, and my mind just doesn\'t work that fast.
 That theory about the six chosen by the key signifying six characters to be removed was very impressive."
"After hearing that, I can\'t see it as being any other way,
 but before then, I didn\'t think it was like that at all...
 It\'s frustrating how thickheaded I am."
"That\'s not true.
 You have a very flexible mind, Auntie Rosa.
 That "Home" discovery might be really important somewhere down the line."
"Not at all. My mind\'s very stiff.
 ......Until a few moments ago, I was thinking of the first twilight as a place, one‐tenth of the way to the Golden Land."
"......What\'s that?
 Sounds interesting. Mind telling me about it?"
"*giggle*.
 ......After all, in the line before the first twilight, it says "you must journey to the Golden Land", right?
 The next part describes a journey that lasts ten days, so I thought the first twilight would be part of the way through that journey."
"......A journey...
 .........I see.
 .................."
"So, you start the journey, and then on the first twilight you set up camp and sacrifice the six.
 ......So I thought, where is that place?
 How many kilometers from the starting point...?
 Things like that...
 Don\'t tell anyone this, okay?
 I\'m not very clever, so for a long time I read the "Home" kanji ({p:0:郷}) as "kyou" when it\'s probably "sato"."
"......And "kyou" reminds you of Kyoto ({ruby:kyouto:{p:0:京都}}), right? It\'s often shortened to "kyou" ({p:0:京}).
 So I thought the ten‐day trip might be between Father\'s home and Kyoto, and there might be something hidden one‐tenth of the way there..."
"Are you kidding? That\'s a brilliant idea.
 .........The first twilight as the first stop on a ten‐day journey...
 ......The name of that place might be the key......"
"For my ten‐day theory to work, you\'d have to know both the start point and the end point.
 ......I know the start point.
 I know the home Father would call beloved.
 Father really did spend his youth a long way away."
"......But the problem is the goal...the Golden Land.
 What does that really mean?
 ......If we don\'t know that, my theory gets us nowhere.
 I\'ve been stuck at this spot for a long time,
 but after listening to your reasoning today, I\'ve realized what an embarrassing mistake I\'ve been making."
".........No, ...I think that\'s still an interesting idea.
 ........................
 A start and a goal, a ten‐day journey.
 ...And the place reached at the very first twilight......"
"Believe it or not, I think you might solve this one easily, Battler‐kun.
 ......If you do solve it with your auntie\'s hint, share a little with me, okay? Even 5% would be great.
 Promise me{p:0:♪}"
She gave me a wink and a smile which almost made my heart jump a little, even though she was my aunt.
As I helped her wash the coffee cups,
 ......I kept pondering the epitaph\'s riddle silently.........
......After I finished helping Auntie Rosa and went into the corridor on my way to the bathroom,
 I saw Erika unlocking the door to a room on the way there.
"......Your room is on the second floor, right?
 I was sure you\'d gone upstairs and fallen asleep by now."
"............I was just searching for something.
 ......I thought it might be here."
"Searching for something......?"
Erika unlocked the door and opened it.
{n}A dusty smell drifted out...
It was the archive.
The distance between the bookshelves was too small for this to be called a library room.
This was obviously a room made for storing books, not reading them.
"......So you\'re searching for a book?"
"Not necessarily a book, ......but, well, reference material.
 There\'s something I simply have to look up."
"...............You\'re looking for something having to do with the epitaph\'s riddle...?
 Pretty admirable that you haven\'t given up yet.
 I guess 20 billion yen is pretty enticing."
I hadn\'t given up either.
{n}Apparently, we were both bad at giving up......
"You\'re joking.
 ......I\'m only interested in riddle‐solving.
 I\'m only looking for the gold because I want proof that my reasoning was correct.
 Even if I found it, I wouldn\'t pocket it for myself, so don\'t worry."
......She immediately dismissed the idea, saying that she just liked solving riddles and had no interest at all in the gold.
My first impression of her had been that she was a bit of a weird one, and it looked like I hadn\'t been wrong.
Erika started searching for the book she was after, slowly going around the bookshelves...
"I\'m also in the middle of trying to solve the epitaph.
 .........Oh yeah, just a second ago, I heard something interesting from Auntie Rosa which might be a hint about the first twilight."
"............May I ask what it was?"
Erika asked this without stopping her search or even turning to face me.
"In the line before the first twilight, it says something like whoever obtains the key must do so and so, right?"
".........You who laid hand upon the key must journey as follows to the Golden Land."
"Whoa...
 You\'ve already got it memorized?
 Guess I shouldn\'t be surprised..."
"And what about that line?"
"......Right.
 "Must journey to the Golden Land", it says.
 Apparently, this made Aunt Rosa picture setting off on a journey from the beloved home of old to the Golden Land, a journey lasting until the tenth twilight,
 or in other words, ten days."
"Actually, I already noticed that myself.
 The place you reach on the first day of the ten‐day journey.
 ......That\'s where you offer the sacrifices from."
"Y‐...yeah, that\'s exactly what Aunt Rosa thought of.
 I also think it\'s an interesting theory.
 ......The place you reach on the first day of the ten‐day journey.
 That bit of land, or else the place\'s name, might be the key..."
".........I have also been speculating that the name of a place might be the key.
 That\'s why I\'m looking for a reference book.
 I want to turn this from speculation into certainty."
"What is it.........that you\'re looking for?"
Then, Erika\'s hand suddenly stopped, ......and she slowly pulled it out...
Then, as she dusted it off, she finally looked at me and spoke.
"An atlas.""......We\'ve managed to make it through the first day."
Natsuhi could be seen in the study.
When she muttered as though to herself, gold butterflies appeared and formed into the shape of a person...
"We can\'t afford optimism.
 ......I doubt that we will be able to make it through tomorrow by sitting around here."
"......So you do think that saying Father is in a bad mood and refuses to come out won\'t be enough to fool them..."
"Mm...
 It seems they were already quite suspicious last year.
 Because of that, the toxin has expanded and is coiling itself around this study, growing ever tighter..."
"I expect that the suspicion they have harbored since last year is not the only cause."
".........That\'s right.
 The toxin has grown too thick to be explained away by that alone.
 ......I have no doubt that after suspecting Kinzo‐sama\'s death last year, they have come with a strong determination to expose it at this year\'s conference."
"Even last year, ......we didn\'t succeed in fully deceiving them?"
"...Unfortunately, it might be best to assume that in the current situation.
 The typhoon will remain here tomorrow, and the boat will not come for them until the day after.
 In short, we must endure for another thirty‐six hours at the very least..."
".........Your eyes may not be able to see it, Natsuhi, but the locked‐room barrier sealing this room was once very firm.
 In the span of a single night, it has been worn ragged like wilted leaves, and now only awaits a storm."
"No, the storm is already here.
 .........Natsuhi‐sama.
 I propose that we switch from the locked‐room barrier to something else."
"What do you mean by something else...?
 Do you mean to change our plan...?"
"That is correct.
 ......{f:5:Virgilia}‐sama and I will reconstruct a barrier similar to last year\'s."
"In other words, we\'ll take Kinzo out of the study and have him tightrope walk from shadow to shadow where the toxin can\'t reach, just like last year.
 It will be dangerous, but I would like to propose the same thing."
"What did you say...?
 You want to change the plan this far in...?!"
"When you learn that you cannot withstand a siege, you must consider abandoning the castle..."
"......Right now, this room is like a castle surrounded by enemy troops with its walls about to crumble.
 If staying put means certain death, then you still have the ability to ride out for one last stand and an honorable defeat.
 ......After all, surrender doesn\'t seem to be an option in this fight."
"I\'ll protect Father\'s secret until the very end!
 If it\'s discovered, there will be no chance for us to talk our way out of it!
 My husband\'s embezzlement will be exposed to the light of day, and the Ushiromiya family\'s honor will be destroyed!
 We must remain firm and prevent that no matter what...!"
"......Calm down, I understand that.
 ...Krauss\'s alchemy will soon see great results.
 If we can make it through this year, we\'ll be able to manage.
 So don\'t get flustered."
"But we planned this barricade strategy because using the same trick as last year wouldn\'t work...!
 Isn\'t it the height of stupidity to return to a plan you previously abandoned because it was impossible...?!
 Just what kind of story do you suggest we create at this point...?!"
"Ronove and I will prepare that.
 Leave it to us, as creating illusions is what witches do.
 ......All you have to do is give us your permission, Natsuhi‐sama."
".........Master and Ronove are very reliable at times like these...!
 Also, the servants of the One‐winged Eagle are excellent furniture.
 If Master and Ronove reconstruct the magic, they will work to protect it.
 ...It still isn\'t too late by any means.
 Let\'s take Kinzo out of the study and have his illusion walk around...!"
"Did you forget that we chose our current strategy because we considered those kinds of plans at length and couldn\'t find anything that would work?!
 To get flustered in an emergency and carelessly throw away the primary plan is simply foolish!"
"But Natsuhi‐sama...!
 You, right there amidst the toxin, must realize better than anyone else that our barricade cannot endure any longer...!"
".........I propose that we try and think of another plan without changing our objective of holding the fort.
 ......In any event, as long as we can keep this room sealed, no one will be able to deny Father\'s existence.
 After all, you can\'t determine the contents of a cat box that can\'t be opened, no matter how many people you have with you......!"
"...Well, that is true......
 However, {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s are unreasonable.
 It\'s possible for them to eat into an airtight cat box and go inside like black ants swarming a box of cake.
 ............And Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}\'s piece also concerns me."
".........It was fortunate that Erika‐sama stole the show at tonight\'s dinner.
 By doing that, she created an atmosphere where it was possible for tonight\'s family conference to come to a close.
 ......If you had gone straight back to the family conference afterwards like usual, the barrier might have broken tonight."
"But because of that, the toxin has grown even thicker.
 ......After thickening all night, the toxin may be able to corrode the locked‐room barrier easily.
 Whether we continue holding the fort or give up that plan,
 we will not be able to make it through tomorrow unless we prepare a new strategy and a new barrier."
"......Lady {f:5:Bernkastel} may have some plan for breaking the locked‐room barrier.........
 We can\'t take that piece called Erika lightly..."
"............Come to think of it, that man who said something about taking revenge for the events of 19 years ago might also be Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}\'s piece.
 ......This board, which achieved equilibrium with 18 pieces, has had two undesired pieces added to it.
 ...There are too many irregularities this year."
"Lady {f:5:Bernkastel} is a fan of Eastern things.
 ......They say that in shogi, Japanese chess, you are allowed to drop pieces onto the board in the middle of a game, do they not?"
"Yes, that is possible.
 ......In shogi, even dropping a queen from the captured pile right in front of the enemy king is a permissible move that can serve as a trump card."
"......What is......that man who spoke of "19 years ago" doing right now?
 ...Is he already hiding somewhere on this island...?"
".........That girl called Erika was able to appear, claiming to have drifted here.
 ......That man might also have landed somewhere on this island despite the typhoon, ...and he might be hiding somewhere......"
"......And it\'s going to be hard to fully deceive the relatives any longer......
 ...........................
 ......Why?!!
 Why must there be so many irregularities?!!
 How can you explain this miracle of nightmares and coincidences?!!"
Natsuhi slammed the desk hard, held her head, and cringed at the pain from her overwhelming headache...
".........Lady {f:5:Bernkastel} controls miracles.
 ...There\'s no point being surprised at irregularities or miracles when that person is around."
"It may be true that shogi is a game where an enemy piece can suddenly appear right in front of a king.
 However, that is why you build up a perfect formation that doesn\'t allow for that kind of weakness, artistically constructing a castle to protect your king."
"Then holding the fort {i:is} what we should be doing, isn\'t it?!!"
"If we had a fort that we could hold then perhaps, but we cannot hope for such a thing now."
"It is difficult to corner a king without a wall to his back, and even more difficult to corner one with open spaces in all directions.
 ......Think of a mouse.
 You can catch a mouse that\'s shut in a cage.
 However, catching a mouse in a field is like trying to catch a cloud."
"Natsuhi‐sama.
 ......Please allow us to explore this option...
...of Kinzo‐sama leaving his study and wandering around the mansion on a whim, avoiding the gazes of the relatives.
 ......We will think of a story that makes it appear natural before morning."
"............Don\'t you see the danger......?
 ......If we\'re willing to consider such a dangerous option, wouldn\'t it be better to continue acting as though Father is in his room in a bad mood......?"
"Tomorrow, the relatives will again crowd around in front of the study.
 They will crowd right on the other side of that door.
 How many hours do you think you will be able to stand there keeping up the charade of a yelling match with Kinzo‐sama?!
 It\'s impossible...!"
"And it falls to me to resist that impossibility for thirty‐six hours!!
 If you tell me to do it, I will!!
 I am Ushiromiya Natsuhi!
 The wife of the Ushiromiya family head!!
 If you tell me to do that, ......I will act out a shouting match with Father for as many days as it takes...!!
 Uuhhhuu!!"
......Even Natsuhi understood that there was no way she could manage it.
But she could no longer see any chance of victory from a plan which involved making an illusion of Kinzo walk around......
Banging on the desk several times, with tears of intense emotion streaming down her face, Natsuhi alternated between groaning from her headache and placing the blame on one thing or another.
It was enough to make one feel that there was a curse which made anyone who sat in that chair do the same......
".........This is like a game of mating shogi, where you are on the defensive.
 ......In mating shogi, the opponent has no king.
 And you have no way of winning other than avoiding a checkmate for a predetermined number of moves."
"And to think...
......that I must escape for a whole day and a half\'s worth of moves...
 ......That\'s just too many..."
"Do not stop thinking... Do not surrender...!
 I am here to listen to your woes, but do not admit defeat...!
 Your absolute determination to overcome this trial no matter what will produce results with certainty...!
 That is the power of the Witch of Certainty."
"You must not lose that magical power.
 ......Believe that you will overcome this no matter what...!
 I am sure a brilliant plan will come to mind.
 You must not give up and stop thinking...!"
"......You\'re right...
 I understand...
 If I can\'t overcome this hardship, then no one can......"
"That is correct.
 Didn\'t Kinzo entrust you with the job of overcoming all of this?
 ......Kinzo acknowledged that you were worthy of this responsibility...!"
".........Father...
 ...Father... Uuuhu...uhu...!!!"
"Master and Ronove will think of a move.
 Of course, I will think as well!
 However, we cannot do even that without our master\'s permission...your permission!
 So the least you can do is not abandon the will to fight...!
 Do not give in...!!"
"I know that, ...I know!!
 But, ...I\'m......so very tired, ...and the headaches are unbearable...
 ......Why am I here...in this freezing cold study......crying alone?!
 Why...why isn\'t my husband here for me now?!"
Back when dinner ended, Krauss claimed to be dizzy and went to bed early.
Of course, he had done this to get enough rest to ready himself for the long day ahead,
 but to Natsuhi right now, it felt as though he had just gone straight to sleep and pushed all of the burden onto her.
However, complaining about such a thing would mean that she had failed as a wife.
......Wasn\'t it a good wife\'s duty to work hard and think of the family first even when her husband was resting......?
Regretting even her anger at her husband,
 ...and unable to determine whom she should be angry at, Natsuhi continued to sob......
If only......Kinzo could just speak to her kindly at times like this.
Beato searched for him, but Kinzo had been nowhere to be seen in the study for some time now...
Perhaps Natsuhi had noticed this as well...
Though she took pride in fighting alone and supporting from behind, thinking of those as the responsibilities of a good wife,
 ......without anyone to validate what she was doing and say it was needed, .........she was now so frail that she couldn\'t even stop her own tears.
Just as Beato was thinking of words she could use to console Natsuhi, {f:5:Virgilia} tapped her lightly on the shoulder.
......If words of consolation don\'t come from the mouth of the right person, they can sometimes do more harm than good.
Therefore, {f:5:Virgilia} silently urged Beato that saying nothing was the best course of action for now...
"...............Hi, sorry to interrupt.
 ...I know I\'m an outsider, but I wonder if you\'d let me speak."
"Gaap.
 ...Please restrain yourself for the time being."
"No, as long as you\'re here, there\'s no distinction between outsiders or guests and the rest of us.
 ......You may speak."
".........Thank you.
 ......Ronove said it himself a while ago.
 This is mating Shogi with you on the defensive.
 .........How does one lose in mating Shogi?
 It\'s because their king is checkmated, right?"
"That goes without saying.
 And the opponent has no king.
 Therefore, all Natsuhi can do is have her king run away constantly."
".........I see.
 ......So you\'re thinking of that move.
 Has that time already come?"
"What do you mean?
 ......Are you saying we have some sort of move?"
"............It\'s the first thing you suggested to conceal {f:5:Goldsmith}\'s death.
 ......I\'m trying to say that the time has come for us to use it..."
"You mean...having him go missing......?!
 You mean to make that move right now, during the family conference?!
 That\'s too dangerous!"
After successfully resolving all of their problems, they would have to lay Kinzo to rest.
And the way to do that......was to make him disappear.
One day, Kinzo would go out into the forest and never return.
{n}They wouldn\'t be able to find him no matter how much they searched, so he would be declared "missing"......
".........You said it yourself a second ago, Riiche.
 You can\'t catch a mouse that\'s escaped to a field.
 And you can\'t catch a {f:5:Goldsmith} who\'s disappeared into the forest."
"Do you honestly think that we could talk our way out of this using that?!
 Using such a move now, when the suspicion against us is greatest, would be no better than committing suicide!!"
"They will suspect, yes.
 It is a move fully deserving of being called suspicious.
 .........However, even if they set foot in this study, such suspicions will be unprovable.
 ......It will be impossible for them to capture Kinzo‐sama forever after,
 and no matter how much they suspect him to be dead, they will be unable to prove it..."
"Forget about thirty‐six hours, you could protect Kinzo\'s secret forever this way, couldn\'t you......?
 ...Of course, it\'ll mean taking on that much risk as well."
"......If you make this move, you may be able to overcome this particular challenge,
 ......but I cannot even guess at how much prestige you might lose for it."
"Even so,
 ............this move can definitely get you through this.
 Of course, you\'ll be treated with even greater suspicion.
 But it won\'t be fatal."
"Y‐
.......yes,
 ......that may be true, but......"
".........The Ushiromiya family should have collapsed after the Great Kanto Earthquake.
 But the mad genius {f:5:Goldsmith} revived it,
 and he rebuilt it into something so magnificent that you want to protect it.
 ......So this time, it is up to you and your husband, the new head and his wife, to do the same."
"......Hoh...
 .........Is that how you intend to stir her up?"
"I\'m not stirring her up.
 I\'m just asking if she\'s prepared to be the wife of the head......
 ......Are you prepared to protect the Ushiromiya family, even if you end up getting dragged through the dirt to do it......?"
"I, ......I am..."
"Then now is the time.
 .........If you can survive by being dragged through the dirt, then crawl with all your might.
 You\'ll drag yourself through a world of suffering, and you\'ll eventually regain your glory.
 .........I, Gaap, the 33rd in rank, promise you this."
"............Gaap..."
".........The fact that I dropped in at a time like this must be guidance from the gods of happenstance...
 ......I\'ll keep that promise, Ushiromiya Natsuhi.
 I don\'t need anything in return.
 Riiche, the one who serves you, has already paid me plenty in advance."
Gaap seemed quite cavalier, but she was actually possessed by a strong sense of duty.
{n}She was the kind of person who just couldn\'t leave someone in trouble alone.
"Payment in advance?
 Now when did I do that...?
 I can\'t recall..."
"*giggle*giggle*...
 .........Just the various magical items that you couldn\'t remember where you put.
 I made off with quite a few of those."
"Wha?!!
 So it really was your fault that I could never find those...!!
 Give \'em back!!
 Give back my Phantom Silver Crystal and Moon Stick!
 I still haven\'t played around by sticking them together yet!"
"............This is the sort of magic or plan that I can give you.
 I can hide {f:5:Goldsmith} away in a world where no one will be able to find him.
 .........Let me know the instant you need this magic.
 Until then, you may think of another, safer plan."
"True.
 ......Having an option open to you leaves you with a little peace of mind.
 ...Without any peace of mind, you cannot think up a brilliant plan."
"Natsuhi‐sama.
 The night is not short.
 ......Let\'s leave Gaap\'s plan as a final trump card and iron out our plan for the time being.
 Please give us permission.
 ......Furthermore, please give us the trust, magical power, and certain conviction needed to succeed without fail."
"If you believe, I will make that come true.
 If you doubt, I will make that come true.
 ......You must make your own future."
".............................."
Having Kinzo...go missing.
 And doing it right in the middle of this family conference.
{n}That was truly a last resort.
Hiding this final trump card in her heart, ......Natsuhi decided that she would grope around for a different plan until the last second.
After all, this long, long night had only just begun......
......And it was long not only for her.
 {f:5:Bernkastel} and her pieces had just as much time.........
"......Gouge the leg......and kill.
 ......Now it\'s complete..."
"I see, ......so that {i:was} what "gouge" meant after all.
 Once again, my reasoning was correct."
The feel of the last one was clearly different from all the ones before,
 making the two of them almost certain that they had activated some sort of mechanism.
However, as far as a quick glance could tell, there was no dramatic change, such as an entrance of some sort opening.
Apparently, they would need to do just a little more before they could find it...
"You\'re something else.
 .........If this really does lead us to the gold, we\'ll have to split it between us."
"Enjoying the intellectual stimulation is enough for me.
 ............The only thing I like is solving riddles.
 Proof that I was right is all I need for a reward."
She shrugged it off, saying that just seeing the gold would be enough.
Then she crouched down, peering fixedly at the gimmick that made up the key.
......It\'s no exaggeration at all......to say that this girl really loves solving riddles.
Her fondness for treasure hunting is fueled by a romanticism regarding the process of finding hidden things,
 and she has no interest whatsoever in getting the treasure for herself and becoming a billionaire or whatever......
"......I see.
 You really thought such a gimmick would fool me...
 ...The mistake "you all" made was welcoming me onto the island in the first place.
 .........All it takes is the presence of that epitaph,
 and a deduction like this becomes trivial for Furudo Erika.
 ......Your thoughts, ladies and gentlemen?"
As she said this to the mechanism she had exposed, she grinned at it.
That smile had a bit of triumph on it, but it was more fully characterized by the small bit of unpleasant disdain it contained.
After solving the riddle, she was probably reveling in the pleasure of having won against the one who had proposed it, as well as the way she could now scoff at this person......
".........If we find the gold now, the successor to the head won\'t be Krauss‐san, but you."
"Heh.
 ......Well, I wonder."
"......Krauss‐san is a little bit arrogant, isn\'t he?
 A braggart, you might say.
 The thought of him waking up in the morning to find that both the gold and his position as successor to the head have been snatched away from him by his nephew...... It kind of makes you smile, doesn\'t it?"
"..........................."
Erika was still crouched down as she spoke, her back to Battler as she toyed around with the mechanism...
".........Jessica‐san...was her name, right?
 The girl who spoke up against me."
"Nn, ......yeah."
".........She really was acting big about her father being the successor to the head.
 ......When she wakes up tomorrow and learns that you\'ve inherited all the gold,
 and that her father is no longer the successor, I wonder what kind of expression she\'ll have on her face......?"
".........I don\'t intend to keep all 20 billion for myself, you know.
 ......I mean, even ten percent would be great, I wouldn\'t want any more than that.
 We can split the rest fairly amongst the family.
 I\'m even less interested in being the successor to the head.
 I\'d be glad to let Uncle Krauss deal with that."
".........Will it really be so simple, I wonder...?
 *giggle*giggle*giggle*.
 Instead of trying to predict that,
 ......I have a feeling that it will be much more fun to puzzle out what kind of expression Jessica‐san will have on her face tomorrow,
 and what kind of sad excuses she\'ll try to make."
"............You have a real twisted mind."
"Oh?
 ............Couldn\'t you deduce that from the moment I said I liked solving riddles......?
 .........I\'m an intellectual rapist who enjoys exposing things that other people hide.
 ......It was the same for solving the epitaph."
"......You probably wanted to expose the gold Grandfather had done everything he could to hide."
"Yes, that\'s how it was at first,
 ............but my goal changed halfway through."
"Halfway through?
 ......Changed to what?"
"Jessica‐san.
 .........She cast doubt on my deductions and contaminated my sublime and noble moment.
 .........I changed my goal into solving the riddle so that I could get even with this Jessica girl."
".....................Are you...being serious?"
"*giggle*.
 .........*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*.
 ...I can bring any opponent to their knees, no matter who they are.
 That is my one and only pleasure.
 ......Perhaps you still need time to reason?"
".........Ushiromiya Jessica irritated me.
 So I decided to solve the epitaph to put her in her place.
 .........From this, you should be able to deduce how I\'m feeling at this very moment.
 ...Can you work it out?"
......This time, I turned my back on her in earnest.
Did I get so caught up in the fun of this riddle‐solving game...
that I allowed her to lead me into making a terrible mistake...?
That\'s right.
 ......I could have worked out that this would happen.
With the riddle solved, the relatives will probably get into an uproar about who will be the successor to the head.
Dad and Kyrie‐san will probably make a fuss about how I, the discoverer, should be the successor, and the other relatives not thrilled with that prospect will probably oppose them.
Despite how adamant Erika was about it, it isn\'t written anywhere that the one who solves the riddle of the epitaph becomes the successor.
Because of this, it\'ll lead to a fight between those who are willing to accept that and those who aren\'t......
To reason out what will happen next, as Erika suggested...
......It will probably turn into an ugly fight between Uncle Krauss and the rest of the relatives.
When Jessica finds out I\'ve solved the riddle, ......will she admire me...or curse me?
......I don\'t want to think about that now......
......Erika was still mumbling.
{n}...Apparently...she had already started trying to reason it out...
As I began to feel very bad, ......I lazily gazed out into the black night...
"..................!"
Then, .........I looked at a dimly lit outdoor light...
...and saw the silhouette of a person in front of it.
I thought I must be seeing things.
After all, it was unthinkable that someone would have been standing there the whole time, pounded upon by the rain without even an umbrella.
However,
 ......the silhouette didn\'t move an inch,
 .........and maybe...
......no, it couldn\'t be......
............It was...looking at me.
{n}And......it was.........
"...................................."
"...........................G‐"
......Grandfather.....................
In that instant,
 ......I understood.
Grandfather had probably...
......been watching us solve the riddle the whole time.
......And...
...he had seen us...
......as we spectacularly solved the entire riddle of the epitaph......
"..................
 .....................Heh......"
Without a doubt,
 .........Grandfather smiled faintly.
Grandfather, who had never worn any expression that wasn\'t moody or frightening,
 ......looked me in the face......and smiled at me for the first time.
......Almost as though he was saying "Too smart for your own good".
{n}Or else, "I never thought it would be you"...
However, ......this was the result...chosen by Grandfather\'s epitaph.
So I was sure......that he had accepted that result.
......He grinned one final time.
Of course, he didn\'t use words.
His smile seemed to be a silent expression of a single word:
 "superb"......
......I didn\'t know how I should respond.
I couldn\'t do anything but stand there in shock, ignoring Erika as she crouched down, mumbling with her back towards me.
......Then, Grandfather stretched a hand out from the folds of his cloak and pointed at something.
When I looked in that direction,
 ......what I saw there.........
The thing he was pointing at...
...was probably...
......the guidepost to the Golden Land.
......Go.
Grandfather had undoubtedly said that one word.
I......nodded to show that I understood.
Seeing this, Grandfather nodded back, satisfied.
Then, with a spin of his cloak,
......he disappeared, seeming to melt into the darkness......
The expression on his face at the end...
...was a truly and finally satisfied...
...smile.
"Are you listening? Battler‐san?
 To my deductions?"
"............I\'ve found it.
 That\'s the guidepost to the Golden Land."
"......Huh?
 Ah, ......it\'s facing a different direction than it used to.
 ......I see.
 So it means "go that way".
 ......You\'re very observant."
"Grandfather showed me the way."
"Huh? Kinzo‐san...?
 Where?"
"Let\'s go.
 .........It\'s time we got a look.
 ...At this "Golden Land"..."
We started to walk.
{n}The entrance to the Golden Land was right there.........
".........So, my epitaph has finally been solved.
 ......And...it was Battler...
 .........Pfft, ...ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha...!!
 Entertaining beyond compare!"
When I think about it, I was also a head that no one saw coming.
How interesting that the one who will succeed me as head is also a person no one saw coming.
"I now have no regrets remaining in my life!!
 {f:5:Beatrice}, I am coming to join you.
 Along with a present, the miracle chosen by my epitaph...!"
{a:c:
Battler, of all people.
{n}......That......Battler......!!}
"Waha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha...!!
 Waha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!
 At the very, very end of my life, I have witnessed a true miracle!!"
"{f:5:Beatriceeeeeeeee}!
 I\'ve won this bee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}ettt, waaahhha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haa{0}aahhh!!!"
"Ha, hahahahaha...!!
 Yahoo!!
 Haha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haaaahhh!!!"
".........I can\'t see anything convenient about using gold as a store of value except for its non‐corrosive properties.
 I imagine it\'d take a lot of work to liquidate all of this."
At the end of a crude underground tunnel, in a VIP room which was so beautiful that it seemed out of place,
 .........there was a pile of gold so large that there could be no doubting its 20 billion yen worth...
Erika was calm, but Battler couldn\'t suppress his excitement.
As for which of the two was the correct reaction to show after seeing a mountain of gold...
only those who saw the scene with their own eyes could say for sure......
In this day and age, it\'s said that an average salaryman earns about 200 million yen in wages over his life.
......And this is 20 billion yen worth of gold.
With even one one‐hundredth of this gold mountain......a single human could live their entire life without working.
What is labor?
Isn\'t it the very point of a human\'s life, since a person who doesn\'t work cannot eat......?
If so, then 200 million yen is enough to make a single person\'s life complete.
And this is 20 billion yen!
......This would account for the labors of a hundred humans, no, a single human life one hundred times over...!
Of course, if you still wanted to work, you could.
{n}Any money you gained as a result could all be used to play with.
After all, you would already have enough money to live for your entire life, no, for eternity...!!
No, wait, I mustn\'t keep it all to myself. I can split it up among 100 people.
If I could create a world where a full 100 humans wouldn\'t have to work for their whole lives, ......just what kind of world would that be...?
.........Yeah, ......there\'s no doubt at all......
"This.........is the Golden Land......"
"And so,
 Bern‐Battler masterfully discovered the gold.
 The End.
 Heh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eheh!!
 I kept the really critical parts hidden, but nothing wrong with just a little bit of teasing, right?"
"......Sure, do what you want with that.
 I\'m not interested in the micro details about what kind of puzzle it was or what kind of answer it had.
 The important thing is that as a result, ten tons of gold were discovered."
The gold was discovered in the third game as well, by Auntie Eva.
Auntie Rosa had also witnessed it.
However, the two of them hadn\'t spoken of the gold\'s discovery to anyone.
In other words, there was a chance that the gold\'s discovery was a cat‐box truth kept between the two of them.
Which meant that it was possible that the gold didn\'t exist and was just an illusion...!
"However, ......‘I’ have finally found it...
 The cat box...has been opened...!"
"It\'d be a waste of time to do that repetition game, so I\'ll give you a little bonus.
 {p:1:This mountain of gold is the real thing.
 All of the ingots piled up here are real, pure gold!
 There are absolutely no tricks such as replicas or fakes}!!"
"......Alright, got it.
 I\'ll accept that this gold exists.
 ......However, there are still some things I can\'t accept!"
".........Of course.
 After all, you met with him, didn\'t you?
 ...With Kinzo."
"*giggle*giggle*!
 Even though Kinzo\'s supposedly an illusion, you met with him just a second ago, didn\'t you?
 *giggle*giggle*, I guess that really was magic, wasn\'t it?!"
"Ridiculous.
 ......‘I’ didn\'t exchange a single word with Grandfather.
 ...I only {i:felt as though} Grandfather and I had exchanged words.
 Give it a rest. The same move won\'t work again!"
"In that case, your blue truth, if you please!"
"{p:2:I was probably in a state of euphoria after solving the epitaph\'s riddle.
 And that caused me to mistake something for Grandfather}."
"{p:2:For example, maybe that was some kind of sheet or cover that had gotten caught in a dark grove of trees,
 which looked like Grandfather wearing a pitch black cloak!
 As a result, I mistakenly thought that I\'d had some sort of conversation with Grandfather}."
".........Blue truth, valid.
 Well, I did say the exact same thing in blue."
"And? Did it work?
 Was there a counter with the red truth...?!"
"Nope.
 Not for now, at least...
 *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!"
The "me" who had let out a strange yell in front of the gold mountain was finally starting to regain his cool.
......Now that we\'d found it, there was no covering it up.
{n}I faintly thought about keeping this discovery a secret.
......However, Erika wanted to prove that her own reasoning was correct by announcing this fact to everyone.
She really is an intellectual rapist...just as she says.
The puzzle‐solving game is what\'s important to her,
 and she doesn\'t intend to take any responsibility for what happens after the riddle is solved.
......A riddle is sort of like a lock.
 Locks exist to be locked.
{n}And whenever a lock is locked, there is a meaning behind locking it.
Therefore, there should also always be a meaning behind breaking one open and exposing what it protects.
However, ......this girl has made the exposure itself her final goal,
 ...and she doesn\'t plan on taking responsibility for anything that happens later.
......Maybe the true storm to hit Rokkenjima...
...isn\'t the typhoon, but her.
She won\'t keep this discovery secret.
{n}She\'ll definitely announce it to brag about her success.
And then, ......she\'ll call a real storm down upon this island.
I won\'t be able to keep this covered up......
{n}...Then in that case, ......there\'s nothing to do except announce this fact fairly.
I can\'t imagine what will happen after that.
As she grinned, Erika muttered to herself.
......She must have been predicting the uproar the relatives would soon bring about.
To her,
 ......imagining that was much sweeter than 20 billion yen in gold......
"......All it takes is the presence of that epitaph,
 and a deduction like this becomes trivial for Furudo Erika.
 ......Your thoughts, ladies and gentlemen?"Knock‐knock‐knock‐knock!!!
The sudden sound of someone banging fiercely on the door brought Natsuhi to her senses.
She had probably nodded off in the study while planning how they would overcome the next day.
But...what could it be...?
 At a time like this...
More importantly, the knock itself was strange.
If someone had wanted to contact her, they could have just used the internal phone line.
She had told them that she would be here.
Realizing that something strange was going on,
 Natsuhi shook her head one more time, completely throwing off her drowsiness.
"Father, Father...!!
 It\'s Eva.
 I have something urgent and vital to talk to you about!"
It was Eva\'s voice.
......What is this?
I thought I told them to lock the doors and windows of the mansion tightly after everyone left for the guesthouse.
So why is Eva here...?!
Natsuhi ran up to the door, responded with a small knock, and spoke through the door in a quiet voice.
".........What do you want? Keep your voice down."
"Natsuhi nee‐san...?!
 Why are you in Father\'s study at this hour?!"
"......I told you to be quiet!
 Have you forgotten that the head treasures peace and silence above all else...?!"
"Now\'s not the time to be saying that!!
 Stop harping on that and open up quickly!!
 Bring Father out!!"
"The head just went to sleep!
 I don\'t know what business you have, but I will listen to it tomorrow!"
"I don\'t have any business with you!!
 Just open up right now!!"
Sometimes, all one\'s schemes and assumptions can fall apart due to the most direct, simple, and emotional of strategies.
This is bad...
If I open the door, Eva will probably throw herself forwards and rush into the study.
Now, I can\'t even open this door...!
At that moment, the phone suddenly rang.
I‐it\'s alright.
 Both of the keys to the study are here.
No one can open this door...!
Natsuhi inched away from the door and grabbed the receiver...
"H‐...hello!!
 It\'s Natsuhi!"
"It\'s me...
 Things are bad.
 I want you to come down to the parlor, quickly."
It was from Krauss.
 His tone was strained.
......What in the world happened...?!
"It seems that Battler‐kun and the guest called Erika...
......solved the witch\'s epitaph and found the gold."
"Huh? ........................
 ...Is, ...is that true?!"
"Rudolf and the rest have forced their way in.
 They\'re saying that Battler‐kun is going to show us all the way to the location of the hidden gold..."
"Right now, Eva‐san is just outside the door, yelling at me to open it...!
 If I open it now, she might push her way into the study...!!"
"...I, I understand.
 I will be there soon.
 Don\'t worry about Eva.
 Just stay there and don\'t do anything...!
 I\'ll give you a signal once I\'ve gotten Eva away from the door, so leave as soon as you hear that.
 Be ready...!"
Right after that, Krauss came up the staircase, accompanied by Genji.
A heated debate started between him and Eva. "Open up!" "No, calm down."
In the middle of that, there was a small knock as a signal.
......Krauss had skillfully pushed Eva away from the door and distracted her.
During that gap, Natsuhi slipped out of the study and quickly shut the door...
Eva noticed this, and her face twisted in disappointment,
 but the heavy sound of the auto‐lock had already rung out, and the door had been sealed.
"The gold of the epitaph has been found!!
 It\'s only natural that we should inform Father...!!
 Or else what?
 Is there some reason you can\'t tell Father about this?!"
"We have strict orders from Father not to wake him after he goes to bed under any circumstances.
 Following those orders is the duty of the head\'s representative.
 Isn\'t that right, Genji‐san?"
"............Yes.
 The Master\'s sleep must not be disturbed, no matter the circumstances."
"There\'s a time and place for everything, isn\'t there...?!!
 I mean, the epitaph was solved!!
 Father has a right to know straight away!"
"Of course, the two of us will report on everything to the head tomorrow.
 That\'s our duty as the head\'s representatives."
"I don\'t care about that!!
 Just open this door!!
 Let me see Father!!
 Father, Father, can you hear me?
 It\'s Eva!!
 Please open up!!"
"Owowow, let go of me...!!
 Th‐that hurts...!!"
"We will bring this to his attention......!
 Now stop knocking on the door so loudly......!!"
"Ouch, owowowowow...!!
 Let go, let go of me!!"
"Krauss‐sama, Eva‐sama.
 You have been told that the Master is sleeping.
 Please refrain from disturbing him any further...!"
When Genji spoke firmly, the two finally ceased their scuffle.
It seemed that Genji, the one who had spoken for Kinzo since they were very young, still possessed an air of dignity strong enough to handle both Krauss and Eva...
Eva put her argument aside for the time being.
She could worry about that after seeing the gold with her own eyes.
{n}After all, not even she had yet seen it for herself.
Natsuhi and the others had managed to deal with this crisis somehow.
......However, the demons\' move which would sneer upon their efforts was already in motion...
"Battler.........solved the riddle of the epitaph, you say......?!"
"Mm.
 ......Though he had a lot of help from that Erika girl, Battler was the one who reached the answer.
 Erika has proclaimed that she will renounce her rights to the Golden Land.
 ......Therefore, Battler is the one who reached the Golden Land."
".........Fate can be truly interesting.
 To think that Battler‐sama should be the one to reach that place..."
"What will you do, Beato?
 ......You made a promise to stop the ritual if anyone solved the epitaph\'s riddle."
"Mm.
 ...That was the agreement."
".........That is the agreement.
 Yes."
"Apparently, Battler‐sama does not intend to become the master of the Golden Land.
 ......It now seems that no one will become our master."
"That is also fate.
 It has been several decades since we first manifested in the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} world through our bond with Lord {f:5:Goldsmith}.
 ......It was all very fun."
".........Come on, Lia, you sound like an old lady.
 ......So, what\'re we going to do?
 According to Riiche and {f:5:Goldsmith}\'s rules, now that Battler\'s solved the epitaph and decided not to become our master,
 we\'ve been relieved from duty, right?"
"That\'s true.
 ......I have no regrets at all.
 I\'ve been prepared to be kicked down into Cocytus all this time."
"Wait.
 We can\'t let that happen.
 ......You might not have any regrets, but I still serve Natsuhi.
 To let ourselves be relieved from duty just because Battler solved the epitaph would be quite irresponsible.
 ......Witches aren\'t allowed to break contracts, but they also must not fail to show gratitude."
"......True.
 We should serve her until the family conference ends."
"In that case, you won\'t be relieved from duty for a while either, Lord {f:5:Goldsmith}.
 ......Perhaps you should wait until you\'ve overcome this family conference safely, said goodbye to Natsuhi‐sama at the very least,
 ......and if possible, rewarded her for all her efforts."
"...............Hmm.
 ......She has done well supporting my foolish son."
"Aren\'t you a fallen angel with one of its wings plucked off?
 Just leave the other wing as a parting gift and go."
"......Hmm.
 ......That is also fitting.
 Natsuhi might be worthy to bear my wing.
 ...However, .........we are approaching the critical moment.
 ......Your reward is waiting for you.
 Try and overcome this test safely, ......Natsuhi..."
The mountain of gold left everyone speechless.
Regardless of how strongly they had believed in its existence,
 ......no one could look at this much real gold and not be shocked...
"............To think that a place like this existed........."
"I can\'t believe it......
 ......That Dad........."
Everyone was stunned by the gold.
The first one to break the silence and jump around in ecstasy was Hideyoshi.
Letting out an excited laugh, he clung to the wall of gold,
 and he felt the cold, hard touch of it all over his cheek.
"W‐waha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!!
 Th‐this is incredible!
 It\'s the real thing!!"
"......Ha......ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!
 Damn you, old man, stockpiling all this gold in a crazy place like this!!"
"If we have all this...
...there\'s...
nothing to be afraid of anymore...
 Anything life throws at us,
 ......we can overcome......!
 Rosaaa......!!"
"Nee‐san...... Nee‐san......
 We\'ll be able to find happiness with this, right......?"
Eva and Rosa started walking towards each other at the same time and hugged each other as they broke down crying...
Ecstasy and shock...wonder and sighs.
After stepping forward in front of the pile of gold that caused these mixed emotions,
 ......Erika spoke as though she were an announcer in some show.
".........If money is everything in this world, then this gold is the embodiment of happiness.
 ......Congratulations, everyone.
 I pray with all my heart that this discovery enriches your lives."
"I take my hat off to you......
 ......To think that you would solve the epitaph within a single day of coming to this island."
".........If it wasn\'t solvable in a single day, then it wouldn\'t have been solvable no matter how many days I spent on it.
 After all, it doesn\'t take more than an instant for your little gray cells to give you a flash of intuition.
 ......Also, I wouldn\'t have been able to solve this riddle on my own.
 I ask that you praise Battler‐san\'s achievement as well, everyone."
"................................."
"......I renounce any rights to this discovery.
 My reasoning was proven correct, and that alone is enough to satisfy me.
 Therefore, I want to give Battler‐san the full credit for discovering the gold."
"......I may be here, but please continue your discussion as though I am not.
 Battler‐san called all of the adults here, making sure that none of his cousins would notice.
 That can only mean one thing.
 ......He must wish for you all to conduct the true family conference."
"......Erika.
 Quit trying to run the show."
"Oh, how rude of me.
 ............In that case, I\'ll step down as the facilitator of these proceedings.
 So, who will take my place?"
Shrugging, Erika looked around at everyone.
......After a short period of silence, Eva made the first move.
"I assume none of us have forgotten......the deal we made earlier today."
"Yeah.
 We divide it between the four of us, 2.5 billion each.
 And then {i:the successor to the head} gets another 10 billion."
".........W‐wait just a moment!
 Who decided that the one who discovers the gold becomes the successor?!"
"Hold your horses, you\'re not gettin\' away with that, Natsuhi‐san...!!
 That\'s been the basis of all our talkin\' this whole time!
 Sayin\' that now is shameful, don\'t ya think?!"
"...That\'s right.
 ......Weren\'t you the one worrying about how if one of the servants solved the riddle, they might consider themselves the successor to the head...?"
"But nowhere is it explicitly written that that\'s the truth!"
"You miserable coward!!!
 That was the way every single one of us interpreted it!!"
"She\'s right, Aniki!
 Are you really going to do a 180 on that now?!"
"Though it was never written down, I believe it was most definitely common understanding between us.
 I don\'t see how you can say it\'s completely irrelevant."
"You can\'t just interpret the head\'s epitaph however you like!!
 Where is it written that the one who finds the gold becomes the successor?!
 The epitaph was decided upon by the head.
 You have no right to decide these things for yourselves!!"
".........Calm down, Natsuhi."
"How can I possibly calm down?!
 I certainly find it very impressive that Battler‐kun solved the epitaph!
 I do think it would be fair for him to receive some kind of a reward.
 However, saying that reward should be half of everything here is clearly over the line,
 and the argument that the discoverer automatically becomes the successor is one that I absolutely will not permit to go unchallenged...!!"
"Th‐that\'s low, Natsuhi nee‐san...!
 This is completely different from what you were saying earlier today...!"
"I agree!
 It may not have been written down, but the fact that the guy who solves the epitaph becomes the successor has always been our greatest unwritten assumption...!
 It\'s not exactly fair to start complaining about that at the last second, is it?!
 Yeah, not fair at all!!"
"At any rate!!
 This gold belongs to Father!!
 We are not to decide how it will be split up without Father\'s permission!!"
"No way!!
 That\'s real low, Natsuhi‐san!
 We were talkin\' about this on and on earlier!
 Are you sayin\' that whole conversation today was a bunch of bull?!
 That\'s just not right!!"
"Why don\'t we just vote on it?!!
 Battler‐kun, the one who found the gold, is the successor to the head!
 My husband and I have no objections!!
 What about you, Rudolf and Kyrie‐san?
 Rosa?!"
"No objections here. Nice going, Battler!!"
"I have no objections either.
 Battler‐kun is the true successor, chosen by the epitaph.
 If you aren\'t satisfied, then why don\'t we just ask Father directly...?!"
"That\'s right.
 Like you just said, Natsuhi nee‐san, Father is the one who wrote the riddle of the epitaph.
 And he\'s also the proper owner of this gold.
 In that case, we should raise the matter with him, wouldn\'t you say?
 What kind of treatment should Battler‐kun receive as the person who discovered the gold?
 I believe Father is the only one with the right to determine that...!"
"B‐...but......!!"
"......I told you to calm down........."
"Rosa and Kyrie‐san are right.
 Let\'s ask Father!!
 It\'s time for you two to step aside!!"
"Darn right!!
 Bring Father down to us!!
 We won\'t get anywhere with just you two!
 Let\'s get the real family conference started!!
 You think this looks like somethin\' you can put off because he\'s {i:tired}?!
 We don\'t do this properly, an\' we\'ll have a massive problem on our hands...!"
"Hey, ya listenin\' to me?!!
 I\'m sayin\' we\'re through with you two!!
 Get off your asses and bring Father down right noooooow!!!"
"...............Are family conferences always like this?"
"......How the hell\'d I know?"
"They\'re probably always feeling like this on the inside.
 .........Heheheheh.
 Looks like they won\'t be able to get this figured out right now without Kinzo‐san."
"......To think he\'s still being called out to settle his children\'s fights even though he\'s been told he only has a short while to live.
 ......I wonder how he feels right about now.
 ......*giggle*.
 Imagining that...no, deducing that will be a treat."
The parents ignored Battler and Erika and kept yelling at each other, on and on...
Even though Battler had more or less imagined that this sort of thing happened behind the scenes, this was the first time he had seen it.
He had suspected it since six years ago,
 and he\'d been able to get a pretty good idea of what this was like by the darkening expressions on his parents\' faces when this time of year drew near...
However, this argument his relatives were having before his very eyes...
...was much more...
...ugly than he had imagined...
He was very glad that he\'d called the adults out here without letting the cousins catch wind of anything......
Perhaps because everyone was tired out from this seemingly endless argument, they took a short break.
It was decided that this family conference inside the Golden Land should be moved over to the mansion...
This place may have been gorgeous, like a VIP room, but there was no ventilation, and it was a little cold.
It wasn\'t well suited for a long conversation.
They thought of the possibility that someone might carry the gold away while their backs were turned,
 but it wasn\'t as if anyone could manage much with just human hands and a small amount of time when they had ten tons of gold to deal with.
In fact, it even seemed as though having this mountain of gold in the background was robbing them of the ability to make sound decisions.
So they agreed to return to the mansion, in part so that they could regain their composure and continue the conference more ruthlessly......
"......Well then, I will retire for the night.
 ......I imagine I would just get in the way if I remained any longer."
"Yeah, sorry about this.
 Did we bother you too much?"
"Please let us show our gratitude again tomorrow.
 Sorry for letting you see such an embarrassing side of us."
"I know you said you were turning it down,
 but we\'ll still prepare a fitting share, out of gratitude, for you as one of the first to discover the gold.
 Right, Nii‐san?"
"......Mm.
 We know what you\'re capable of.
 I think you can grasp our current circumstances."
20 billion yen in gold wasn\'t something they wanted out in the open.
They didn\'t want an outsider like Erika telling people about it.
Of course, Erika had already "deduced" that much.
She wore an unpleasant smile on her face, as though she understood all too well...
"......It\'s quite unnecessary for you to worry about me.
 I have no intention of telling anyone about this, of course.
 ......And even if I did, no one would believe me without proof."
".........I had the pleasure of witnessing something very interesting tonight.
 It was truly a feast for the eyes, so let me assure you that I\'m more than satisfied."
"Heheh, I see.
 Yes, it\'s not every day you get to see ten tons of gold."
......Getting to see the gold was the feast for the eyes?
 Of course not.
{n}From Erika\'s dark nature, it was easy to guess what she was so happy about seeing.
I thought about telling her to get the hell out of here already, but I wanted out myself...
I tried to head back to the guesthouse along with Erika.
{n}However, Kyrie‐san grabbed my shoulder.
"Not you as well, Battler‐kun.
 You come with us, please."
"Darn right.
 You\'re a real successor to the head now!
 You\'ve gotta go see Father and make it all official...!"
"Father is the only one who gets to decide that!!
 Don\'t make things up on your own!"
"......Battler.
 I know it\'s a pain, but you\'re gonna have to stick around with us for a little while longer.
 Don\'t say a word.
 Just stay quiet and keep your head down.
 Got it?"
"............Just do whatever you want."
It would have been easy to say that I had no interest in being successor to the head.
......But I was sure that would only add more oil to the fire.
Even if I hadn\'t been ordered to keep quiet, I was certain that staying shut up like a clam was the wisest thing to do...
In that case, would it really be so bad if they just let me go back to the guesthouse...?
Dad put his arm firmly around my shoulder, and I told him to quit crowding me.
But it didn\'t make any difference...
".........We solved the epitaph.
 Just like you wanted."
"................................."
"When you were the Game Master, we\'d always get those letters.
 ......‘Try and solve the epitaph.
 If you don\'t, I\'ll kill you all’."
"................................."
.........Why did she want to make us solve the riddle of the epitaph?
By solving it, we found a mountain of gold.
{n}Yippee for us.
And what about Beato?
......Does she gain anything......by having us find the gold?
Or does she lose something...?
"...As far as chessboard thinking tells us, ......people don\'t make moves which cause them to lose something.
 That means you must have something to gain by having us solve the epitaph..."
"No.
 {p:1:This child has nothing to gain from having someone solve the epitaph}."
"............Are you sure that\'s alright?
 Using the red truth like that without her permission."
"......It is what she would want."
{f:5:Virgilia}, who had suddenly appeared there, gave me an immediate answer to my question with the red truth...
"In the past, I sometimes guessed that the reason Beato was trying to make us solve the epitaph...
was that she wanted to make us find the gold\'s hiding place for her so that she could snatch it away.
 .........Is that wrong too?"
"Yes.
 ......In the first place,
 {p:1:the gold of the Golden Land belongs to her from the start}.
 {p:1:She has absolutely no need to make anyone find it for her or to snatch it away herself}."
Of course.
 ......Beato is {f:5:Beatrice} the Golden.
She\'s the master of the Golden Land and the Ushiromiya family alchemist.
{n}...That makes total sense.
However, if that\'s true, that makes me even more confused.
......Even if someone exposes the answer to the epitaph\'s riddle, Beato gains nothing.
No, to the contrary, she might get her own gold stolen away.
"In that case, I\'m understanding this less and less.
 .........I understand the epitaph murders.
 It could be revenge against the Ushiromiya family, or else a ritual to revive her powers as a witch.
 ...She\'s probably got some reason or goal of her own for it."
"................................."
"But what\'s the point of her telling us to solve the epitaph?
 Whether we solve it or not, she gains nothing.
 ......In other words, the whole issue of whether the epitaph is solved or not is immaterial in Beato\'s eyes."
"......You could say that.
 {p:1:Whether the epitaph\'s riddle is solved or not, she has nothing at all to gain from it}."
"It doesn\'t matter whether it\'s solved or not.
 ......Doesn\'t that mean that the epitaph\'s riddle {i:itself} has no value to Beato...?"
"..................
 ......I suppose.
 The epitaph\'s riddle doesn\'t have any meaning for her.
 So even if you take the extreme position that it\'s immaterial and has no value, it may not be possible to argue against your claim..."
"................................."
Beato......
......Why are you making us solve the riddle of the epitaph...?
If we liken the witch you are to a pair of scales, the epitaph murders lie on one plate...
And the riddle of the epitaph lies on the other plate.
Because she\'s saying that she\'ll stop the epitaph murders if the epitaph is solved.
......In other words, the epitaph murders and the epitaph\'s riddle are worth the same to Beato.
Like two sides on a balanced scale.
That means that the epitaph\'s riddle and massacring the entire family...
have equal significance from Beato\'s point of view......
But {f:5:Virgilia} responded with the red text.
{p:1:Regardless of whether the epitaph is solved or not, Beato has nothing to gain}.
If she has nothing to gain, then this epitaph\'s riddle...is meaningless and immaterial to Beato.
In that case, how much are the epitaph murders, which lie on the other side of the scales and are equal to the epitaph\'s riddle in value...
......worth to her...?
......Think, don\'t stop thinking......
The epitaph murders and solving the riddle of the epitaph have equal worth.
As long as the epitaph murders, which are Beato\'s goal each time, have this single way that they can be stopped, a way that she decided on herself, both are worth the same thing to her.
X=Y.
{n}And whether the epitaph\'s riddle is solved or not, Beato gains nothing.
{n}Y=0.
{n}So, in this case, ......what is X......?
"................................."
"......Wait a sec.
 ......That means the epitaph murders are also meaningless and immaterial."
"......Beginning with politely sending us an advance notice,
 she\'s been willing to spend an incredible amount of effort killing us one by one, following the epitaph\'s steps in order, without getting exposed,
 every time she performs that bizarre serial murder.
 So all of that is meaningless to her...?"
I\'ve flipped over the chessboard many times exploring Beato\'s moves.
{n}This was always the first place I stumbled.
The significance of the epitaph murders.
Why did she have to commit serial murders in a way that reproduced the witch\'s epitaph?
If she wanted to kill the whole Ushiromiya family for revenge, it would be much simpler, safer, and more reliable if she just put poison into their dinner,
 or else went around killing people one by one in the middle of the night while they were sleeping.
However, on the first evening, Beato sends us a letter that sounds like an advance notice,
 and then carries out what could be broadly described as a three‐part serial murder,
 killing six people on the first twilight, two on the second, and five on the fourth and later.
We aren\'t fools.
Once the first murders occur, we barricade ourselves in somewhere to stave off any further murders.
Furthermore, we quickly suspect a culprit among us and start analyzing each other\'s alibis.
As the victims increase, the number of suspects decreases automatically,
 and Beato\'s chances of completing the serial murder drop closer and closer to zero...
Everything about the epitaph murders......is full of useless ornament and empty decoration...
...that only seems to make it harder for her to carry out the serial murder.
".........She\'s raising the difficulty of completing her own objective."
"That does follow.
 ......She\'s a strange child, isn\'t she?"
"Did you know?
 In mystery novels, there are sometimes murders that follow the events of a poem or nursery rhyme, just like these epitaph murders.
 ......I think you can split the reasons these "nursery‐rhyme murders" occur into three major groups."
"......And what are those?"
"The first would be when it benefits the culprit to follow the epitaph and thereby confuse the evidence and alibis.
 ......The classic technique of pretending to be dead and mixing yourself in with the victims is an example of this,
 as is committing murders in an order that doesn\'t follow the epitaph so that you can cause the others to mistake the order and give yourself an alibi."
"I see.
 So she could make it look as though she was carrying out the murders in accordance with the epitaph, ......when she was actually guiding everyone\'s thinking in a manner that benefited her.
 That sounds interesting."
".........However, in our games, the dead are truly down for the count thanks to the red.
 ...She might be able to trick everyone in the world of the game board, but she can\'t trick us up here in the same way.
 ......In other words, the most traditional purpose for this kind of murder...isn\'t what we\'re dealing with here."
"In that case, what are the other two reasons for carrying out a nursery‐rhyme murder?"
"One is coincidence.
 ......The culprit carries out a serial murder which just happens to look similar to the epitaph without being intended to,
 and the witnesses mistakenly think it\'s a nursery‐rhyme murder.
 We humans try to find cause and effect in everything we see.
 ......If we think we know what something is, then that\'s how it looks to us."
"......I see.
 That\'s also interesting.
 ...However, I\'m not sure it\'s convincing.
 In this child\'s games, there\'s always an advance notice of the crime given before the murders of the first twilight.
 Also, I believe you find letters and circumstantial evidence one after another that clearly show the culprit is carrying out epitaph murders."
"Yeah, that\'s right.
 .........It isn\'t coincidence.
 From the very beginning, Beato has been intentionally shoving the epitaph murders in our faces as she carries them out.
 We aren\'t just misunderstanding.
 These murders clearly follow the epitaph.
 So this can\'t be the reason either."
"In that case, ......it must be your final reason."
"The last one.........is to show the murders to someone.
 In other words, to make them feel fear.
 ...By following the epitaph, she gives the others clear notice in advance that the murders will continue.
 The survivors are in constant fear of the murders, which they\'re certain will continue."
"...................................."
"In other words,
 ......this child performed these epitaph murders to create a feeling of mortal terror?"
"At least, ...putting it that way, everything makes a surprising amount of sense.
 ......The grotesque mutilation of the bodies and the disturbing displays were all a show to terrify us......"
"To terrify whom......?"
"Huh?
 ......Like I said, us.
 .............................."
After hearing that one line {f:5:Virgilia} spoke so casually, ......my thoughts clouded over once again...
Is it really enough...
to just use the vague word "us"......?
There are a lot of people in the Ushiromiya family.
There\'s the head and the one who holds the rank of his successor...Grandfather and Uncle Krauss.
Our parents, who have some pull in the business world.
......On the other side, you have the young cousins, who usually visit at most once a year,
 and the unfortunate servants, who just happened to be on duty.
......Even if the culprit hated all of us,
 ......they probably didn\'t hate all of us equally.
In other words, they might have made it clear which of those among us they particularly wanted to take revenge against and terrify.
If we liken this to a kid eating dessert......
Isn\'t the strawberry on top of a shortcake the part you should eat last?
No one tells you that you shouldn\'t eat it first, but our mentality leads us into saving it for later.
".........In that case, ...the culprit would want to leave the person they hated most until the end.
 ......Yeah, similar to what was said by my favorite character in this novel I like.
 Something about how if you start by killing the people closest to someone, make them feel that sadness, then kill that person last of all,
 that\'s the worst way to kill someone."
"Oh my, that must have been quite a terrifying novel.
 How frightening......"
"......In that case, you could argue that the people who stay alive until the end are the ones Beato hates the most.
 ......But the order people are killed in gets totally changed every single time.
 ......I mean, we all die in the end,
 but if you go through looking for someone who lives at least until the last twilight every time, there\'s...
.....................
 ..........................."
"...................................."
......There\'s only me.
".........Let me first speak with the red.
 {p:1:Battler‐kun, you are not the culprit}.
 {p:1:You haven\'t killed anyone}.
 {p:1:This can be said of all games}."
"Then that.........just makes it even more likely that it\'s about me.
 ...It means the sole reason she had for bringing about the epitaph murders...was to show them to me."
Beato\'s always making out that she chooses who to kill next by roulette.
But I\'m an exception. The only exception.
 ......Though she does kill me in the end, she always leaves me be until the very last moment.
In all of these supposedly random games, there\'s only this one unchanging constant......
"She wants.........revenge? Against me?
 So is she performing the epitaph murders to make me feel fear...?"
"That\'s wrong.
 ......{p:1:Her goal is not to make someone experience fear}.
 {p:1:And it isn\'t to have revenge on someone either}."
"In that case!
 That means the epitaph murders really don\'t mean anything to her.
 The riddle of the epitaph is meaningless, and the corresponding epitaph murders are also meaningless.
 X=Y=0!
 But even so, she\'s clearly trying to show these meaningless things to me!"
"What could she want from me...which is worth the same to her as something meaningless?!
 ......I don\'t get it!!
 The more I think about it, the less I understand what she\'s thinking!"
"...................................."
{f:5:Beatrice},
 the fickle witch who committed a meaningless, worthless serial murder.
Even the riddle of the epitaph, which she made into a condition to suspend the serial murders,
 is meaningless, immaterial.
And......she\'s thrusting this meaningless, immaterial thing in front of my face.
......What is it......that you want from me...?
{n}......Or else, what is it that you want to give me......?
My idea that Beato must have been taking revenge on me...has already been refuted in red by {f:5:Virgilia}.
Both X and Y...
{n}Both the epitaph murders and the epitaph\'s riddle...mean nothing to Beato.
X=Y=0.
However, since she\'s thrusting that in front of me,
 ...it must...
...have some meaning.
She presents us a pair of scales representing "if you don\'t solve the epitaph, I\'ll carry out the epitaph murders".
Neither the epitaph murders nor the epitaph\'s riddle have any significance by themselves.
However, it becomes meaningful when she puts both halves on the scales and thrusts it out before us.........no, before me.
......In other words, it should be like this:
X=0.
{n}Y=0.
{n}X+Y>0.
A scale with meaningless, weightless things on both sides.
{n}However, it has weight itself...and gives the rest meaning.
"......It\'s almost like......playing.
 Like kids playing rock‐paper‐scissors."
Rock‐paper‐scissors is the most immediate method of randomly determining a winner and a loser.
You usually bet some sort of privilege on the outcome,
 ......but kids often do rock‐paper‐scissors just to play, without betting anything in particular.
Unless you bet something, nothing but a feeling of joy or disappointment will come from a win or a loss.
In other words, the two sides of the scale, winning and losing, are both valueless.
However, the very act of seeing which way it will tip...
is the reason kids play rock‐paper‐scissors.
After all, the kids are enjoying the communication that surrounds the game,
 ......and they aren\'t purely interested in the value of winning or losing.
They aren\'t overly concerned about who wins and who loses......
"That would mean that it doesn\'t matter to Beato......whether the epitaph murders succeed or not.
 ......It almost feels like she\'s just enjoying the process."
"........................"
"......In the past, ...I would have cursed her, deciding that she was a heartless witch who kept murdering people for no reason.
 ......But now, I can\'t imagine that\'s true."
".........Thank you.
 In that case, I\'ll give you one more red.
 ...{p:1:Beato never committed murder for the sake of pleasure}."
She didn\'t do it for pleasure, and she didn\'t do it to make anyone feel fear.
She has nothing to gain from the epitaph murders,
 and she doesn\'t care whether they succeed or fail.
It\'s almost like...a random game kids would play......
"No.
 ......It must have meaning.
 To her."
".........And what is...this meaning...?"
"I don\'t know.
 Even though neither side of the scale has any value, ......the scale itself has some weight to it in her eyes."
......Of course it isn\'t meaningless.
 Some meaning definitely exists.
In the previous game, she urged me to remember my sin of six years ago.
......Was that "meaningless" too?
No.
 There\'s no way that\'s the case.
I clearly remember the serious look in her eyes at that moment.
Unfortunately, I didn\'t have a clue what she was talking about.
{n}......And she was devastated.
That\'s right.
At that time, I\'m sure she even went so far as to say that the crime wouldn\'t have occurred if I hadn\'t come.
"There is a meaning.
 .........A meaning to her.
 And she wants me to provide it."
".........................................."
I laughed softly and poked Beato lightly on the head,
 ......then patted her head.
"......Next time you want to send a love letter, I suggest that you just write "I love you".
 ...If you make it too roundabout and confusing, no one\'s gonna be able to figure it out."
".........*giggle*."
"I still don\'t have a clue what she\'s thinking.
 ......But even so,
 I won\'t stop thinking.
 ...I\'ve only just started flipping over the chessboard.
 ......I definitely won\'t give up......on this journey through your thoughts."......Battler did nothing but gaze lazily out the window.
The fighting between the relatives continued without end......
At first, the relatives had crowded around the study.
However, no matter how much they knocked, the master of the study did not answer even once.
Eva and several others said that they should open the door with the second key, the one Genji held.
However, in a flash of brilliance, Natsuhi said that Kinzo had been in a particularly bad mood and had taken back the key he\'d previously given Genji,
 meaning that he now had both keys himself.
 She claimed that it was therefore impossible for them to open the door.
After she promised to let them meet Kinzo tomorrow morning no matter what, they finally returned to the dining hall.
But, of course, the argument continued on even after they returned there.
Eva\'s group wanted a lot of cash very soon, and they were trying to threaten Krauss somehow and make him pay up.
......Apparently, Battler\'s solving of the epitaph, which threatened Krauss\'s position as the next head,
 had given the others a huge tailwind.
On the other side, Krauss and Natsuhi denied the very basis of their argument,
 claiming that it had never been specified that ownership of the gold would be handed over to the person who solved the epitaph.
They asserted that it hadn\'t been hidden gold, but just Kinzo\'s stockpile,
 and it was still Kinzo\'s property, which meant it was only natural for it to be distributed after Kinzo\'s death with the rest of the inheritance.
After hearing this, Eva\'s group once again started demanding that they be allowed to see Kinzo.
......It had probably been clear as day from the beginning.
{n}This sibling fight could only be settled by Kinzo...
It was obvious that this confrontation was between Eva\'s group, which wanted cash fast,
 and Krauss, who was hiding his lack of funds but still didn\'t need money right away.
As Battler listened vaguely to this exchange,
 ......he marveled at how, despite their usual affluent airs, they were all surprisingly deep in debt...
"Didn\'t you already say that a short while ago?
 That\'s enough, let\'s take a break.
 We\'re all repeating the same things over and over again."
According to the clock, it was almost midnight.
It certainly was a perfect time for a break.
The atmosphere relaxed just a bit...
"I agree.
 It\'d do both sides some good to take a breather.
 ...Listen, why don\'t we take a record down for the rest.
 I\'ve had enough of fighting over what was or wasn\'t said."
"Seriously.
 We really can\'t do without a record of proceedings, not when Nii‐san can so easily deny something he\'s said before the words stop bouncing off the walls."
"With a written record, just writing it would be a pain, and it\'d be open to forgery."
"Right.
 ......Aniki, does this thing work?"
"The tape set?
 ...I see.
 This way, we can keep a record without bothering to write it down, and forgery will be impossible.
 It\'s fair for both sides."
"Make sure you don\'t mess anything up...!
 Those are Father\'s precious music tapes!"
The dignified tape set had a sense of weight to it which matched this majestic dining hall perfectly.
On pleasant Sunday mornings, it would sometimes be used to play famous tapes or records.
However, right now, it was the most neutral and impartial conference record keeper around...
Rudolf fished randomly around the cassette rack, searching for a blank tape.
And every time he found some tape with "sophisticated" music, he would chuckle at how pompous it was.
"Excuse me.
 ......You called?"
"We\'re taking a break.
 Sorry, but could you make us something to drink?
 And maybe some biscuits would be nice too."
"Certainly.
 I will prepare it right away......"
"Also, ......sorry.
 Do you have any cold medicine?
 I\'ve been feeling a bit feverish."
"Then don\'t overstrain yourself.
 Get some sleep."
"If you really feel like it, why not get some sleep, Rosa?
 Though I wouldn\'t step out of such an important conference because of a simple cold."
"Really?
 I would excuse myself without hesitation.
 Natsuhi, why don\'t we take a short rest too?"
"............Yes, dear."
Sensing that he meant to have a strategy meeting, Natsuhi stood up.
......Even if that wasn\'t the case, she was so desperate to get out of the room even for a moment that she\'d have taken any excuse.
Krauss and Natsuhi left the dining hall, ......and the tension in the room truly relaxed.
"............Phew."
"You\'ve been doing great, Battler‐kun.
 ......I imagine you feel just horrible.
 Think of this as part of growing up and just accept it."
"Just how long am I going to have to sit around doing nothing here?"
"......Who knows.
 After all, you\'re like our personal donation box.
 ......Sleepy?"
"About the same as Japanese Lit class."
"I\'m pretty sure Father won\'t show up tonight anyway.
 When Krauss nii‐san and the rest come back, I\'ll propose that we might as well let you go."
"......I\'d appreciate that."
Tap‐tap.
A light knock and the faint sound of china clinking together could be heard.
"Excuse us......"
"We have brought tea."
Shannon and Kanon had come by with a serving cart.
The pleasant smell of black tea relieved their tension all the more.
"......Hey.
 Did you hear?"
"What are you talking about......?"
"............We didn\'t hear anything."
"Stop it, Rudolf.
 There\'s no reason to tell them."
"......We are furniture,
 so we have no interest in the family conference."
"I see.
 That\'s a wise answer."
"......You have the midnight shift?
 That must be tough."
"That is our job.
 ......We would be happy to receive your orders."
"You could be right there.
 It\'d probably be even more tiresome to sit around awake doing nothing.
 When I was still down in the bottom rungs, I once worked as a warehouse keeper.
 Even if you\'re just staying awake, it\'s still pretty tough...!
 Right after the war, you had robbers all over the place.
 Plus you couldn\'t rely on the police back then, so it was a pretty dangerous time...!"
Hideyoshi was particularly proud of how he had started with nothing and built up assets by diverting goods from the American army.
Once the subject came up, Hideyoshi tended to get pretty talkative.
The relatives knew this and were greatly relieved to see that a perfect sacrifice had come up.
"If you got found out, you were in for it big time!
 Those Yanks are scary!
 Their strength\'s in another league \'cause of all that beef they eat.
 Get caught and that\'d be the end of ya! Firin\' squad or <death by hanging>!"
"You know that one? <Death by hanging>!
 Oh yeah, and then, I figured it out.
 It\'s all about the meat! The meat!
 Japanese people\'ve gotta eat more meat!
 And that\'s when I had the revelation—I had to start up a business to capture people\'s stomachs!"
"I, ...I see...
 That m‐must have been quite a difficult task......"
"Stop it, darling.
 No matter how much you tell people born after the war, they\'ll never understand how hard it was back then."
"Oops, looks like my bad habit\'s jumped out again...!
 Sorry, sorry!
 Waha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!"
"You two should have some tea as well.
 I think it might help you if once in a while you used your own mouths to learn more about the tea you\'re brewing."
".........No, we\'ll be fine.
 There\'s no need to be concerned for our sakes..."
"Hang out with us for a bit.
 Being surrounded by only adults makes me feel like I\'m gonna suffocate."
"Hear that? That\'s an order from Battler‐sama, successor to the head!
 Sit over there and have some tea with us.
 And tell us about what\'s been going on recently, your hobbies, TV shows you\'re watching, and whatever it is that\'s popular with young folks these days.
 There\'s a lot we could learn."
"*giggle*.
 That\'s a brilliant idea.
 Come on, sit down, both of you.
 And become our sacrifices now that we\'re starved of things to talk about."
"Wahahahahahaha.
 That\'s right.
 The only way I\'m gettin\' to talk to young folk at this age is goin\' to a cabaret club."
"......How long are you planning on standing around there?
 Rudolf told you to sit.
 Go on, sit down.
 ......I give you permission as well."
After getting Eva\'s permission, Shannon and Kanon looked at each other and finally obeyed, nervously.
For a while, the two were pounded by questions and became the relatives\' playthings......
Tap‐tap.
 Another reserved knock could be heard.
All of the servants tended to knock in a similar manner,
 so no one noticed anything strange.
However, Shannon and Kanon turned around with surprised looks on their faces.
......The servants here today included the two of them, Genji, Kumasawa, and Gohda.
Gohda had the midnight shift at the guesthouse.
{n}Kumasawa had gone to bed in the servants\' quarters in the guesthouse.
And they were in here, ......so Genji was the only person left,
 ...but they knew very well that Genji wouldn\'t knock like that......
"......Who is it?
 It\'s not locked. Just come in."
Rudolf didn\'t recognize the knock either.
And when he asked "Who is it?", everyone came to the same realization that they too had no idea who would knock like that......
After that, the same knock repeated just once more.
......Could it be that someone had their hands full...and was asking that the door be opened for them...?
As a slightly odd feeling began to encompass the room, the sound of the large clock in the hall could be heard.
It was the sign that October 4th had ended and October 5th had begun......
A short while earlier—
Krauss and Natsuhi were well away from the dining hall, in a deserted corridor on the second floor......
".........So, we no longer have any other options."
"Yes...
 ......I do not think the same trick will work again tomorrow.
 ...If we hesitate any longer, there\'s a chance that Eva‐san and the others will claim that we have Father locked up and call the police.
 This is......as far as we can go."
"................................."
"......Battler‐kun finding the gold......was completely unexpected.
 If only that hadn\'t happened, I\'d thought of a plan which might have managed to get us through this somehow......"
"......Hmph.
 Just like every other bet I\'ve made.
 ...Something unexpected always arises, and the "guaranteed" outcome is thrown off course."
".........We\'ll have Father\'s room be empty starting tomorrow morning.
 Let\'s plan it out with Genji and have him say that he saw Father heading out into the forest early in the morning."
"I doubt Eva and the others will swallow that story of his disappearance..."
"I\'m fully aware of that.
 However, we have no other options...!"
"If we do such a thing, ......Eva and the others will doubtless make a fuss about it being suspicious.
 They aren\'t worried about appearances as long as they can squeeze some money out of us.
 ...They might strike a deal with some odd magazine and cause serious damage to the confidence placed in me."
"We can live with {i:damage}...!
 If by any chance Father\'s secret is discovered, it won\'t be a matter of mere damage...!!"
"There\'s nothing wrong with persisting until the last second tomorrow.
 If we\'re able to make it through safely, we won\'t have to lose anything.
 There\'s no need to get impatient and use up our trump card...!"
"You want to wait until after they start accusing us of locking Father up, and {i:then} reply that he\'s gone missing?
 That is far more likely to draw suspicion...!!"
"........................nnnn......"
"......Let\'s just...
put Father to rest now...
 To go any further...
......would be impossible......"
"Calm yourself.
 You\'ve just had too much exposure to the toxin from Eva and the others and have lost your composure.
 ......Only two keys exist which can let anyone into that study!
 And you have both of them right here.
 That means no one can go inside.
 That door is of a very special make.
 No matter what kind of tools they bring out of the storehouse, it won\'t even budge."
"It isn\'t a physical problem like that...!"
"Look, stop panicking, settle down.
 If you like, you can pretend to have gotten a fever and stay in bed.
 In the meantime, I will overcome all of this."
"......I can\'t leave everything to you...!
 I\'ll fight until the end too...!"
When Natsuhi could no longer hold back the tears brought on by her fierce emotions, ......Krauss held her gently.
......Just how long had it been since she\'d last felt warmth from her husband\'s embrace......
"Your headache.........is killing you, isn\'t it?
 Whenever you get those creases between your eyebrows, I can tell."
"............Dear......"
She had come to think that her husband could never understand the way she felt.
But, ......when it came to times like this.........
"......Let\'s wait for the very last moment before using our disappearance trump card.
 It\'s like a last‐resort treasured sword:
 it\'s best when it remains in its sheath.
 The important thing is being ready to pull it out at any time, wouldn\'t you agree...?"
"I......understand that..."
"Why don\'t you leave that trump card with me?
 .........Of course, at the final moment, I will take all of the responsibility.
 ......I won\'t get you and Jessica involved."
"What...do you mean by that...?!"
"If the Ushiromiya family is destroyed, it is enough that I alone am crushed under the rubble.
 .........After the typhoon passes, I will prepare divorce forms.
 I will sign the papers for you to keep and use when you please.
 ......I have some assets hidden away in your name.
 Add on the settlement, and it should be enough for you and Jessica to live in comfort."
"No!!
 Ushiromiya Natsuhi is the name that should be engraved on my tombstone...!
 Please let me be with you until the last moment...!
 Even if it turns out that you are the last head of the Ushiromiya family,
 ......please let Natsuhi...
...be the name of his wife...
...your wife......"
......Krauss\'s existence was based solely upon the power of his assets and his trustworthiness as a financial fixer.
If those were both undermined, nothing would remain.
Using the trump card of Kinzo\'s disappearance would mean losing one of these two essential supports.
......It was like offering your right arm to save your head from being cut off.
It was probably better than losing your head, but you still might die from the blood loss,
 and even on the off‐chance that you did survive, you would have to bear a heavy wound that wouldn\'t heal for the rest of your life......
Krauss was prepared even for death......
Natsuhi understood this,
 ......buried her face in Krauss\'s chest,
 ...and cried...
"............My apologies for interrupting."
Genji\'s sudden voice made Natsuhi jump back and hurriedly wipe the tears from her eyes.
Krauss stood in front of Natsuhi, shielding her.
"Ah, Genji‐san.
 Please don\'t sneak up on us.
 ......Do you have some business?"
".........Yes.
 My apologies, but I have something to report to Madam."
"To......me......?
 Dear......"
"I don\'t mind."
Krauss left Natsuhi\'s side, went to a window a short way off,
 and gazed at the windy and rainy rose garden......
Natsuhi went with Genji to a place a short distance away.
"......What is it?"
".........Well...
 The truth is, another phone call has come for you, Madam."
At that moment, she was surprised by a sudden, eerie sound.
{n}It was the large clock in the hall announcing midnight...
"You don\'t mean............that man......again...?"
".........Yes.
 ......What is to be done?"
"D‐......did he say what business he had with me?"
".........He would not answer.
 He kept insisting that he wanted to speak to you directly."
".............................."
Again, ...a phone call......from the man who claimed to be taking revenge for what had happened 19 years ago.
19 years ago.
......That was just one year before Jessica and Battler were born.
In Natsuhi\'s eyes, the gap between 19 years ago and 18 years ago was immense.
......For a long time, she was unable to fulfill her role of creating a successor for the Ushiromiya family...and was treated very coldly.
But then, she finally gave birth to Jessica...
and became able to call herself the wife to the Ushiromiya successor with her head held high.
......So in her eyes, "Ushiromiya Natsuhi" began 18 years ago.
......So everything before that, including 19 years ago......contained nothing but hateful memories.
The last year of that hateful period.........was whispering of revenge...from the other end of the phone......
.........Once again......she heard the roar of the sea......
....................................
".........What is to be done?"
"Transfer it......to my room.
 ......Don\'t let my husband know."
"......As you wish."
From the very beginning, Genji had understood that she wouldn\'t want Krauss hearing about this phone call.
That was why he had told Natsuhi covertly......
Natsuhi ordered that he transfer the call, told Krauss that she would turn in for the night, and left at a quick pace......
She returned to her room and locked the door.
...There\'s nothing peculiar about that.
{n}......In the Ushiromiya family, hallways are like public roads.
{n}There\'s no special meaning in locking the door when you enter your own room...
...This is what she told herself.
Then, as though it had been waiting for her, the telephone rang.
{n}...Genji must have transferred the call.
She took a deep breath, readied herself, ............and picked up the receiver.
"............Hello........."
".............................."
Again, ......it started with silence.
She realized that the person at the other end was trying to keep her in suspense and make her feel uncomfortable, and she got angry...
"Why are you silent...?!
 I\'m hanging up...!"
"...Hahahahahahaha...
 ......Don\'t hang up, Mother.
 I want to hear your voice a little longer......"
Again......that unpleasant voice......
"Are you trying to mock me...?!
 State your business...!"
"I want to play with you, Mother."
"...Wh‐......what?
 What are you talking about?!
 I have no desire to play with you...!!"
"......You\'re tired from the family conference, right?
 I\'ll bet that chronic headache of yours is giving you a bad time."
"Th‐that\'s none of your business...!"
Just the fact that he knew her headache was troubling her made a shiver run up her spine...
"You get headaches because your head\'s all stiff.
 You won\'t have pleasant dreams if you go straight to bed like that."
"Haven\'t I told you that\'s none of your business?!!
 I\'m hanging up!!"
Natsuhi forcefully yelled that she was hanging up, but in actuality, she couldn\'t...
After all, this person was choosing to call her, and that was much better than the alternative.
......If she hung up violently,
 ...this person might choose to call someone else...
"Let\'s play a bit to help you relax.
 Don\'t worry, I won\'t take up much of your time."
"I, ...I have no intention of playing with you......!"
"......Your name is Natsuhi, Mother.
 It has the kanji for a season in it.
 Pretty nice name.
 .........However, just because your name is Natsuhi, that doesn\'t necessarily mean that you like summer.
 ...Which season is your real favorite, Mother......?"
"You think I\'ll tell you?"
"If you don\'t, ......I\'ll hang up.
 .........Are you sure you want that?"
"...kh.................."
It was clearly a threat.
......It meant that if she forced him to hang up the phone,
 anything might happen......
Humiliated that she was forced to give in to a threat made by a man whose name she didn\'t even know, she gave him the answer he wanted......
".........I‐.........it\'s autumn."
"Why......?"
"B‐because it\'s an easy season to pass the time in...!
 There\'s no other reason in particular.
 Are you satisfied now?!"
"Yeah, I\'m satisfied.
 ......It looks like your favorite season really is the same as mine.
 ......I like the fall too.
 .........Heheh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eheheh..."
"......Liar!
 You just made that up...!"
This man would no doubt have done the same thing no matter which season I said I liked.
......What is he after?!
What\'s so fun about making me uncomfortable like this...?!
"It\'s not nice to call someone a liar.
 ......I didn\'t make it up.
 I was already certain that you liked the fall, Mother.
 .........I can even show you proof."
"Proof.........?"
"Yeah.
 ......Is there a clock in your room, Mother...?"
"...A clock......?
 Y‐......yes, there is, but what\'s your point......?"
In Natsuhi\'s room, there was a beautiful antique clock with an intricate design.
......Krauss had bought it for her as a birthday present long ago.
".........It\'s seven minutes past midnight right now.
 I\'m tired, so please get this farce over with quickly...!"
"Try lifting the clock up."
"Wh‐why?"
".........You just don\'t know when to shut up.
 Stop resisting every single time I say something.
 Just shut up and do what I say."
The tone of the man\'s voice suddenly went low, turning into a threat.
{n}It indicated clear displeasure.
Outwardly, this man had a calm manner of speaking, but on the inside, things were completely different.
If she angered this man even the slightest bit further, he would surely show his true nature right away...
"......Are you really that eager to make me hang up?
 You\'d better start realizing how lucky you are that I\'m talking on the phone with you right now......
 ...I can tell your husband and daughter about what happened 19 years ago any time I want to..."
"I, I don\'t know what you\'re talking about, but please don\'t get my husband and daughter involved...!
 I\'m listening to everything you say...!"
"Then do what you\'re goddamn told......"
Once again, the man threatened me in a low voice, as though warning me never to talk back to him again...
My head was filled with the pain from my headache, the sound of my beating heart, ......and the roar of the sea...
......I couldn\'t disobey him anymore.
.........As the man had ordered, I lifted up the antique clock...
".................................?"
There lay something that resembled a single playing card.
{n}............?
Perhaps it was the warranty for the clock.........?
{n}Thinking this, she took it and turned it over............
"Are you.........wide awake now?"
"Eek, ah,
 ......aaaaaaaahhhhh......
 Wh‐
wh‐wh‐
why...
 ...Why is...
...this...?!?!"
"Well, I\'ll be happy if your headache\'s gone down a bit.
 ......Tell me you\'re happy, Mother."
"How did you...?!
 Why?!
 How?!"
"I want you to tell me you\'re happy, you murderer.
 How dare you act like a normal, neat‐freak mother. You make me want to vomit.
 Do you want some of it to land on your husband and daughter as well?
 You don\'t, do you?
 You want me to keep quiet, don\'t you?
 Yeah, I\'ll keep quiet. See, aren\'t you happy?
 Aren\'t you happy?!"
"Ah, .........aaaah, I\'m happy... I\'m happy...!!
 So please...stop...
 Don\'t burden my husband and daughter...!
 What is it you want?
 Money?
 How much?!"
"I don\'t want money.
 ......My wounds couldn\'t be healed with any amount of money.
 But there is a medicine.
 ......Yes,
 it\'s like a kind of ointment.
 ......Thick, syrupy and dribbling."
"............And that is...
my hatred,
 ......my resentment towards you.
 ...Slathering myself with that...
is the only way to hold back the pain..."
Natsuhi had never had anything so hateful said to her in her entire life.
So she suspected many times that she must be having some sort of bad dream.
However, ......this definitely wasn\'t a dream...
"......Y‐
...you couldn\'t possibly be...
...on this island right now, could you...?"
"I am.
 Didn\'t I promise you?
 I said I\'d be at the family conference."
"That\'s impossible...!
 There\'s no way you could have come during this typhoon...!!"
"That\'s no problem if I came before the typhoon reached here.
 ......And I\'m pretty sure this guest called Erika or whatever arrived even during the typhoon."
Her blood froze......
{n}Furudo Erika had been brought here by coincidence...
{n}If he knew that name, he would have to be very close by......
"Wh‐
......where...
...a‐
......are you.........?"
"......I won\'t appear in front of anyone until you introduce me.
 Don\'t worry.
 .........Oh yeah, it\'s useless to try and search for me.
 Your mansion is huge.
 And you have phones all over the place.
 Besides, I\'m sure you don\'t want to see me either, do you?"
"......Or are you offering to find me and introduce me to everyone...?
 Introduce me to Jessica too.
 ......Tell her I\'m her older brother by one year.
 Heheh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eheheh!!"
"S‐stop it...... Stay away from Jessica......"
"I guess I\'ve scared you a bit too much.
 That\'s all from me...for tonight.
 ......But don\'t forget.
 You cannot disobey me.
 Understand,
 ......Mother?"
"......Y‐.........yes......"
"I\'m going to hang up for the night, ......but I have an order to be followed up until tomorrow morning."
"Wh‐......what is that.........?"
"You may no longer leave that room tonight, and you may not make any phone calls.
 If the phone rings, you aren\'t allowed to pick it up, either.
 And you will turn the lights off right now, get in bed, and sleep.
 Then you will wake up at your ordinary time.
 ............Heheheheheh.
 It sure is nice to live a healthy life.
 I really am such a good son, working so hard for the sake of my Mother\'s body......"
"I, ......I understand.
 I\'ll sleep right now.
 I won\'t leave my room, and I won\'t pick up the phone...!
 So please, don\'t tell my husband and daughter......!"
"As long as you follow my orders, I\'ll keep your secret, Mother.
 ......Don\'t disobey me.
 ......I\'m already very close by.
 I can easily tell whether you\'ve turned your lights off and whether you\'re on the phone.
 ...If I wished to, I could even kiss your sleeping face."
"I\'ll keep it!
 I\'ll keep my promise!!
 So stop it, just stop it!
 Stop iiii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}iittt!!"
......As she screamed, Natsuhi crushed the card she had found under the clock into a little ball.
It had a pattern on it like a tarot card,
 along with one single word:
 "Autumn".........
We go back in time once again.
The large clock in the hall was right in the middle of striking midnight.
Wondering who the person who had now knocked twice was,
 ......the relatives in the dining hall stared at the door.
Rudolf told them to come in.
 ......But there was no answer.
Until the end of that long tone marking the coming of midnight, which had come from the large clock in the hall shortly after the knock,
 they were unable to move in the slightest......
"......Maybe their hands are full and they can\'t open it......"
"Maybe.
 ......But it\'s a little creepy that they won\'t say their name."
"......Should I open it?"
"Do it."
Kanon nodded back, then slowly opened the door......
"Ah, ......what\'s that...?!"
"......It\'s......one of Dad\'s envelopes?"
Right behind the opened door, on the floor of the hallway,
 ......lay the envelope.
"There\'s no one in the hallway.
 Perhaps they placed this here and left..."
The adults flew out into the corridor as well,
 but they could find no trace of anyone who might have knocked on the door......
Barely an hour ago, Shannon and Kanon had come in to serve tea.
At that time, everyone had seen that nothing lay in that spot.
Someone came, knocked, left an envelope with the mark of the One‐winged Eagle on it, and left...
"C‐......could it have been...the Master......?!"
"......It\'s not unthinkable.
 ......Father\'s pretty much the only person in this mansion who would refuse to answer when asked who he was."
"That\'s not possible.
 If that\'s so, then why didn\'t Father come in here openly?"
"......That\'s right.
 Father would probably just come in here all of a sudden without knockin\'...
 The doors and windows of this mansion are locked now, right...?
 In that case, the only people who could\'ve left the letter there are Krauss‐san, Natsuhi‐san, and Genji‐san."
By this point, the mansion had been completely locked up.
Therefore, those in the guesthouse—the cousins, Nanjo, Gohda, Kumasawa, and Erika—could not have come here.
Furthermore, since Krauss, Natsuhi, and Genji were the only three who weren\'t in this room,
 one of those three had to have been the one who set that letter down in the corridor.
In that case, it was very likely that Krauss and the others had placed the letter there to make it seem like a message from Kinzo...
"I see...
 It\'ll have something written on it which is supposedly in Father\'s name, saying that he won\'t accept Battler‐kun as the next head, or something of the sort.
 Ridiculous.
 I can\'t believe you\'d try to pull such a childish trick, Nii‐san...!"
"It\'s not like I have any interest in being the next head..."
"Give up.
 This is just your fate.
 ......Anyway, why don\'t we read what\'s inside?"
Rudolf set the letter on the dining hall table and showed everyone the front and back,
 almost like a magician does before performing his act to show that there are no tricks or hidden mechanisms.
"......This envelope is without a doubt Father\'s?"
"Y‐...yes, there\'s no doubt.
 Father liked to use these envelopes for handwritten letters...
 What do you think, Shannon‐chan?"
"Y‐yes......
 ......To my eyes as well, ......it looks like the type of envelope that the Master uses..."
"That doesn\'t mean Father was the one who wrote it.
 It would be pitifully easy for Nii‐san to snatch one of these from a drawer in Father\'s study...!"
"Even Krauss‐sama cannot easily enter the study...
 It might be hard for him to steal an envelope......"
"Let\'s try opening it.
 We can think about this later.
 ......There\'s something in it.
 I wonder what."
Rudolf opened the envelope a bit roughly.
Then, a folded letter...
...and a glittering object fell out.
......It was a ring.
"Huh?
 ............Wait a second, ...that ring is......!"
Eva noticed it immediately and grabbed it...
"Th‐
......this is...
...Father\'s ring...!
 I‐it\'s the Head\'s Ring!!"
"......Wh‐...what in the...!!
 Seriously?!"
"Are you sure it\'s Father\'s ring...?
 Could it be a replica...?"
"No, this is the real thing!
 I\'ve always dreamed about wearing this ring on my finger someday.
 Even though Father wore this on his finger, I know more about it than anyone else.
 ......This is Father\'s ring, no doubt about it!
 Why is it here?!"
"Then it really {i:was} Father who wrote this letter...?!"
"......Heh, heheheheh.
 The sender isn\'t Dad.
 ...It\'s someone much more interesting."
"Then, ......who is the letter from?"
"It\'s from the Ushiromiya family alchemist!
 .........The Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama......!!"
Rudolf showed everyone the part of the letter where that was written.
{n}It really did say that......
"I‐......it\'s from {f:5:Beatrice}......?!"
"What\'s it say......?"
"I\'ll read it.
 .........<Congratulations>...
 I acknowledge that Battler‐sama has spectacularly solved the riddle of the epitaph and reached the Golden Land.
 .........The gold belongs to him in its entirety.
 Furthermore, he is also the new head of the Ushiromiya family.
 ......As proof, ............I send the Head\'s Ring, which Kinzo‐sama left in my charge...
 ......Battler‐sama, I beg that you put on this ring, become the new master of the gold, and lead the Ushiromiya family into the future.
 ......I pray with utmost sincerity that you flourish as the new head............"
"......Hah, ......hahah!
 What the hell...!
 I see, Dad just won\'t come out of his study, so {f:5:Beatrice}, the witch of the forest, has acknowledged Battler directly...!
 Hahaha, haha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!"
"......Battler‐kun.
 You should hold onto this ring.
 ......This is a special ring to be worn by the family head.
 .........I don\'t know who this {f:5:Beatrice} is,
 but she\'s watched the whole thing and sent you this ring after acknowledging you as the true successor."
"I‐......is that alright...?
 It\'s such an important ring......"
"Yeah, it\'s fine.
 You should wear it proudly on your finger.
 ......Got it? Even if Aniki and Natsuhi‐san tell you to take it off, you better not do it no matter what...!"
With creepy smiles on their faces, all of the relatives urged Battler to put the ring on his finger...
It looked like things would get pretty nasty if he refused, so Battler reluctantly decided to put it on the middle finger of his left hand......
The ring was heavy and stiff......
At that moment, Krauss returned.
......Genji came back as well immediately afterwards.
"My apologies.
 It looks like my wife isn\'t feeling so well, so she\'s gone to bed early.
 ............Did something happen?
 You all seem incredibly flustered."
"..................Battler‐sama, ......that........."
Immediately, Genji keenly spotted the thing that Battler had just put on his finger...
"Your eyesight\'s pretty good, Genji‐san!
 ......Looks like you know whose ring this is."
"What...?
 What are you talking about......?"
From Krauss\'s questioning look, it was very difficult to imagine that he could have been the one who set that letter there......
Furthermore, his expression quickly changed into one of shock.
"Eheheheheh!!
 That\'s right, it\'s the ring of the Ushiromiya family head!!"
The family conference took up this new topic,
 ......and the storm came once again.........
The rain was still pouring down as hard as ever.
......This weather was supposed to continue all day tomorrow as well, which was making me feel a bit depressed.
......Oh wait...given the time, that\'s today, not tomorrow...
{n}But that doesn\'t really matter now.
.........I\'m sleepy...
With half‐asleep eyes, I opened my umbrella.
{n}The large drops of rain pounded against it mercilessly.........
Technically, they had called an end to the family conference at {nobr:1 a.m.},
 but the post‐match scuffles were still dragging on.
I was really jealous of Auntie Rosa, who managed to slip out of there at that time.
She cleverly got away by saying that she\'d check on Maria, who might have been staying up too late.
Thanks to Dad constantly involving me, I missed my chance to escape,
 ...and they made me stick around until now, ......{nobr:3 a.m.}...
What on Earth did they spend all that time deciding...?
Nothing got decided at all.
......They just kept on arguing about who said what, like elementary school kids.
......They must be tired too.
I\'m sure that\'s why they keep dragging on with the same pointless questions.
I no longer felt any shock or anger towards them.
{n}I guess no painkiller works better than drowsiness...
......I left them behind and finally returned to the guesthouse.
When I returned to the guesthouse, the lights were on in the lounge downstairs.
Not only that, I could even hear people chatting inside......
{n}Apparently, some people were still awake even at this time of night.
Despite the late hour, Gohda‐san and Doctor Nanjo were still awake and chatting.
Plates and cups were lined up on the counter,
 and it looked almost like a bar with Gohda‐san as the bartender.
After noticing I\'d come back, it looked as though Doctor Nanjo finally realized how late it was.
As Gohda‐san made to top off his glass, he declined with an exaggerated gesture.
"No, that\'s enough, that\'s enough.
 ......It\'s already too late to be up."
"Look how late it\'s gotten...
 You were such a good person to chat with, I hardly noticed."
"No, no, it was your skill at entertaining that made the difference.
 We\'ll have to do this again sometime."
"Yes, gladly!
 Battler‐sama, welcome back.
 Is the discussion with Krauss‐sama and the others still continuing?"
"......The way things were going, they\'ll probably drag it all the way out until dawn.
 None of my business..."
I spoke carelessly, with a big yawn.
".........You all have more stamina than I expected.
 It\'s quite a surprise."
"Oh, ......so you\'re here too..."
"......Yes, a humble little night gathering had begun to form quite naturally here,
 so I took it upon myself to join.
 .........Don\'t worry, I haven\'t said a word about you‐know‐what."
"..........................."
Erika could be seen on the sofa.
She had taken her shoes off and was lounging around as though she owned the place.
"And you too, Erika‐sama—you are very knowledgeable on a variety of subjects.
 I enjoyed listening to you immensely."
"Your knowledge truly is extensive.
 Very impressive for one so young..."
".........You\'re very welcome.
 It\'s merely the trivial knowledge of Furudo Erika."
Erika posed by picking up the hem of her skirt.
She was lounging on the sofa with her feet up, so it didn\'t look remotely elegant.
"......Where\'s Auntie Rosa?"
"She returned around 1 a.m., but she went straight upstairs to sleep."
That was probably the right choice...
{n}She\'d been going along with that conference for so long.
 I feel like flopping down in bed right away myself.
......I\'ve had it.
{n}I\'m tired enough that I might flop over right here...
".........Well then, let\'s call it a night.
 Don\'t you have to get up early tomorrow morning to make breakfast, Gohda‐san?"
"Preparations for breakfast have already been made.
 As always, I have full confidence that you will enjoy it greatly, so please look forward to it."
In Gohda‐san\'s eyes, the family conference is an open stage on which to display his culinary skills.
{n}He\'s probably so pumped up he won\'t even get sleepy.
As she laughed at how youthful Gohda was, Erika stood up.
{n}This acted as the sign that it was time to disperse.
"I will clean up here.
 Please enjoy your sleep, everyone."
Leaving the clean‐up to Gohda‐san, I went to the bathroom and then climbed the stairs to the second floor.
"Goodnight, everyone.
 These old bones have stayed up a little too late."
".........Good night, Doctor Nanjo.
 Good night, Battler‐san."
"Yeah.
 .........Night..."
Then, in the upstairs hallway, we split up.
Doctor Nanjo went to his own room.
Erika went to her room.
And I returned to the cousins\' room.
I couldn\'t hear any sounds of playing coming from the cousins\' room.
......Could they have already gone to sleep?
{n}No surprise, at this time of night.
{n}If they were still playing, they would have been staying up way too late...
When I opened the door quietly,
 as expected, the room was already pitch black except for a small nightlight.
Everyone was already sleeping in their beds.
I bet they all had a great time horsing around.
......They probably had a ton of fun staying up late and talking about their youth.
......If only I hadn\'t found the gold, I could have had fun spending time with them...
I\'m already...
tired...
...so tired.
Forgetting even to change my clothes or brush my teeth,
 I crawled into bed,
 .........and immediately started to sink into the marshes of sleep.........
Aaah, ......today\'s been so insane......
I wonder if that old bastard is still in that family conference now......
......How does he not get tired............?
Come to think of it......
......what was it that old bastard said when we parted company......?
— Tomorrow, there\'s something important I want to talk about, as a family.
 It\'s about you.
......I\'m sure it\'s more stuff about being the successor.
{n}...I don\'t even want to hear about it......
— If I tell you about this,
 ......I\'m probably gonna get murdered.
I\'ll murder you whenever you want, you old bastard......
And then, ......what was it he said next......?
— It\'s about your birth.
My...
............birth......?
......Probably just something about the noble Ushiromiya lineage......
Not interested......
.........Just let me
......sleep...............The sound of crashing waves.
The sound of the tide surging.
 The noise of the sea breeze.
Whenever my headache torments me, these are the sounds that fill my head......
My inability to bear a successor placed me in a very difficult position within the Ushiromiya family...
I tried every medication that was said to promote fertility, every incense or herb,
 ......but nothing I tried had any effect.
Until I was blessed with Jessica 18 years ago,
 ......I was ashamed to even call myself a wife.
"......The creation of a child depends on the efforts of two people and the whims of heaven.
 It\'s not fair to place all the blame on yourself."
"I still don\'t know what caused my inability to become pregnant.
 I even went to see noted physicians.
 I underwent humiliating examinations.
 ......But I was always just told that they didn\'t understand the reason..."
"Even though quite some time had passed since your marriage, you still couldn\'t bear a child.
 ......I see.
 It\'s only natural that Eva, who secretly aspired to become the next head, would start getting ideas..."
Eva tried to convince Father that I was a failure as a future head\'s wife.
It was a time when Kinzo was also very disappointed in my husband\'s repeated business failures.
On the other hand, Eva\'s husband Hideyoshi\'s business was growing well, completely the opposite of my husband\'s business.
......He was the only person who could bring Father good news.
In that case, perhaps there could be no blame placed on Father if he decided to lend an ear to Eva\'s words...
...or even accept them without question.
It was all my fault, because I couldn\'t bear a child...
"You are sinless.
 Aren\'t babies of this country carried here by storks?
 If anyone is to be judged, it should be the stork."
"...............Thank you.
 However, ...even though he was still in good health then, the head was already well past his prime,
 and it\'s not hard to imagine that he wanted to see his grandchildren\'s faces as soon as possible..."
"Who cares.
 If he wanted a grandchild, he could have just done what he wanted with that appalling amount of money he had.
 ......This is Kinzo, the man who always bragged about how money could create anything.
 If he wanted a grandchild, why couldn\'t he just manage something with that money he was so proud of...?!"
"..................Yes, ......that\'s right.
 ......The head......gave up on me when I couldn\'t bear a child...
...and did just that."
......Thinking it the duty of anyone in possession of large amounts of money, the head gave a lot to charities.
One among these, the facility known as the "Gospel House", had been given an especially large donation, possibly because he had old ties with that place.
"Ah, the Gospel House.
 ......Furniture came from that place quite often."
"As part of their work training and public activity,
 the head employed Gospel House children with exceptional grades as servants.
 ......All of the servants in the mansion with the character "{ruby:in/on/non:{p:0:音}}" in their names—Shannon, Kanon, Lunon, Manon, Lenon, and more besides—
were children from there."
"......There were quite a lot of them, weren\'t there...
 Though most quit after just a few years."
"That\'s probably because a few years of wages from working here would earn them more than enough to live on their own.
 ......Experience as a servant for the Ushiromiya family is a wonderful thing to add to one\'s resumé.
 I\'m sure it was also the head\'s desire for them to gain this for themselves and then spread their wings in society."
"............I see.
 ......So, an adopted child........."
".............................."
"F‐Father......
 What......did you just say......?"
"Accept this infant as my grandchild."
"Ohhh...... There, there.
 There, there..."
Apparently, the baby Kumasawa was trying to soothe didn\'t like the air in the study at all.
...It kept on crying as if it hated it here......
"M‐...my apologies, Father...
 ......I\'m not sure what you want me......"
"Accept this infant as my grandchild.
 You shall raise it to be the one who succeeds Krauss."
"......In other words, ......you want my husband and I to raise this baby...as our own child......?"
"That\'s right.
 It\'s clear by now that you are barren.
 ......Your body must have some sort of defect."
"Ooh... There, there.
 Ooh, there, there......"
As though she couldn\'t hear our discussion in the slightest, Kumasawa kept on persistently trying to cuddle the baby.
This made its crying get even louder......
"............That\'s nonsense.
 If all the responsibility of giving birth rested with the woman, this world would have no need for men."
"I\'ve never forgotten the bitter pain I felt that day......
 ......Of {i:course} I wanted a child......
 ......But no matter how much I prayed, I couldn\'t get pregnant......
 Thinking that something to do with my body might be the cause, I went to see several famous doctors.
 But even so, no matter how hard I tried, ......I couldn\'t become pregnant......"
"After all that, ......for this to be how you were treated...
 ............I understand."
The baby had been picked up by the Gospel House just recently.
Of course, it wasn\'t that I didn\'t feel compassion for the child,
 who was so young and who had already lost its parents\' affection.
However, .........the pain and sadness I felt were far greater.
It would have been another story if I had suffered to bear this child,
 ......but why...
...did I have to cradle this baby,
 who not only shared none of my blood,
 but who was not related to my husband in the slightest either......?
"I don\'t hate Father.
 ......If anything, ......I only hated my own body...!
 I detested it!
 I truly detested my own body for being unable to bear a child......!!
 So I prayed.
 I prayed to both angels and demons!!
 And my wishes were granted by both...!"
"......What did you pray to the angels?"
"I prayed for a miracle in my body...!
 If there was something wrong with my body, I could accept that.
 But I wanted to overcome that defect and somehow be granted the miracle of my husband\'s child...!"
"......That wish came true.
 ......The next year, you gave birth to Jessica."
"And......what did you pray to the demons?"
"I couldn\'t stand it,
 I couldn\'t stand it......
 I cursed this body of mine...!
 And I cursed this baby,
 ......who was the living reminder of my failure...!!"
".........What did you wish for?"
"For the first time in my life, I prayed and wished to demons...!!
 I wished that this baby would simply disappear!!"
......Of course, that wish was also granted...by demons.
On that day, I left the baby with one of the older servants and went to think about the future in the rose garden.
No, that\'s a lie.
 ......I just wanted to clear my mind of everything.
The baby\'s cries were aggravating,
 so I ordered the servant to take the baby to a place where I couldn\'t hear.
......By a place where I couldn\'t hear, I meant somewhere far away.
Yes, I wished.
......I wished for the servant to take the baby far away and never return...!!
"I see......
 ......So, a passing demon heard your wish, Natsuhi‐sama."
"And then, ......what happened next?"
"After that...was a bizarre accident that could only have been granted me by a demon..."
The woodland path from the rose garden to the harbor is certainly well suited for a pleasant walk.
......And from time to time, if the mood took you, it would undoubtedly feel good to veer off the path and take a walk through the trees.
However, .........wouldn\'t that be venturing a little too far for a walk with a baby in your arms...?
"There was a cliff on the other side.
 It was......about ten meters high, I think.
 It was rocky below.
 ...There was even a fence there!
 Are we to suppose that the servant deliberately walked all the way over there holding the baby,
 and then leaned against the fence...?!
 The only conceivable explanation is that she was lured there by the beckoning of a demon!!"
"............So she was lured there.
 ......A demon who heard your wish lured that servant there......"
"So then, ......the servant and the baby..."
"They died...!!
 They fell from the cliff, down to the rocks below...!
 No, they died because I wished it!
 That means this is my—"
"It isn\'t your fault!
 There\'s no need to think about it any further."
"But it happened because I wished it......!!"
"No, that\'s wrong!
 Making wishes is one thing, but it is only at the whims of gods, demons, and witches that they may be granted!
 You bear no sin.
 {y:0:Human}{n:0:Human}s bear no sin.
 You can even claim that I killed them if you so desire.
 No, I did kill them!
 I took pity upon your misery, and I lured the servant with the baby to the cliff and led them down it!"
"It was simply an unfortunate accident.
 If you cannot accept that explanation, then blame it on us.
 That\'s why demons exist."
".........That\'s right.
 We\'re here for your sake.
 .....It\'s not like you killed them.
 We killed them.
 So you are sinless.
 ......So please, don\'t blame yourself, Natsuhi."
"Is that true......?
 Am I truly sinless......?!"
"Yeah, you are.
 Fuhhahahahaha!!
 Young one who claims revenge for 19 years ago.
 If you\'re going to curse someone, curse me.
 However, witches have a patent on curses...!
 Let me take on this fight you\'re trying to pick with Natsuhi!!"
{e:090:I am the Ushiromiya family alchemist, {f:5:Beatrice} the Golden}!
{e:090:If anyone picks a fight with the master I serve, I will fight in my master\'s stead}!
{e:090:Revenge for 19 years ago, you say}?
{e:090:I\'ll make you learn that\'s not even a blink of an eye for a witch who\'s lived a thousand years}!!
{e:090:Gahahahahahaahahahahahahahaha}!!
{e:090:So, you hate Natsuhi for wishing your death 19 years ago}?!
{e:090:Let me make you remember just who it was that lured you off that cliff}...!!
......As the middle‐aged female servant cuddled the sobbing baby, she walked on a small path through the trees...
Natsuhi had told her that the baby was too loud, so she tried to get as far from the rose garden as she could.
......She was completely unaware as to why she\'d gone out of her way to head in this direction.
However, the sobbing baby...
...suddenly stopped crying.
Something was reflected in its eyes, but the servant couldn\'t tell what.
However, thinking that the baby had stopped because it had taken an interest in something,
 ......she headed in the direction of the baby\'s gaze...
The baby had seen......a group of gold butterflies disappearing off into the trees.
And.........on the other side of the trees, ...the servant saw a woman.
.........Who?
 It was someone she didn\'t recognize, someone who couldn\'t possibly have been there.
The baby stopped crying and stared in that direction.
{n}...Then, the servant\'s legs started to automatically carry her that way...
"Come this way, woman.
 .........Bring that cursed baby with you."
"...........................Ah......"
The woman couldn\'t disobey.
......She was completely overwhelmed by Beato\'s gold‐glowing eyes...
She walked lightly, as though through a dream world.
......At some point, the scenery around her had changed,
 ......but she did not notice.
 She could not notice...
Though this should have been Rokkenjima,
 ......at some point, it had become the garden of a mansion she had never seen before.
It was a garden she had never seen before, even grander than the great rose garden of the Ushiromiya family......a garden of gold roses.
There stood an arbor,
 ......and a woman wearing an elegant dress beckoning her.........
...There was a man who looked like a butler, and the tea he poured with a beautiful gesture had a very nice and enticing smell.
It was as though they were telling her to join their tea party......
She couldn\'t disobey.
.........She had to go to the master of this golden rose garden...
......and give this child as an offering......
"Forgive me, woman.
 Curse your bad luck for being entranced by a witch.
 ......And, surrounded by these gold roses, which you would never be able to enjoy in this world, sleep.
 .........Gaap."
".........Yes, understood."
When Gaap snapped her fingers,
 ......a pitch‐black hole opened at the woman\'s feet, and she was swallowed up along with the baby.
The sight that the woman and the baby witnessed in the very next moment probably burned itself into their eyes forever.
The two floated in the air......and looked down at the gold rose garden spread out below them.
Below their feet was not the ground, but an unobstructed view of a golden rose garden which stretched as far as the eye could see.
If one could have this scene imprinted in their mind as their last memory, that would be such a merciful way to die......
Then, the woman and the baby were swallowed up by the golden sea.
The {i:thud} was remarkably plain, and remarkably quiet for the sound of two lives being taken.
......However, it was a perfect fit for the entertainment at a tea party of witches.
Darkness swallowed the woman and the baby, ......and slowly expanded to engulf the entire rose garden...
The sound of the wind grew stronger bit by bit.
...Was that TV static?
 What was that noise...?
......It was the roar of the sea.
The two who had died after falling from a great height into a thicket of golden roses...
...were gradually engulfed by the roar of the sea, engulfed by the scenery of the beach below the cliff...
"I guarantee it.
 You are completely sinless!!
 If someone wants revenge for 19 years ago, they need look no further than me!!
 Wahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"
"...Ee......eeeeeeeeeeeeekkk.........!"
When I spotted the two of them on the rocks below, ......I went pale.
Then, I dashed back to the mansion......and there was a great uproar.
We urgently rushed them to hospital by boat, ......but from that height, it was a miracle that they had even avoided an instant death.
Both the servant...
...and the baby...
......died.
In less than three days from the time Father had entrusted me with the baby, ......I had killed it...!
My husband was on a business trip.
Rosa‐san, who still lived on the island at the time, was away traveling with her friends.
......Father and I were the only ones on Rokkenjima!!
And before anyone except Father and I knew,
 ......a baby had appeared out of nowhere...and then disappeared again!!
That\'s right, it was a dream...a nightmare!!
I was convinced that Father would blame me.
...However, his reaction was somehow strange...!
"Heh, ......heh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eheh, fwaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahha{0}hhahaha!!
 I saw this coming, I {i:knew} this would happen!
 How long must you struggle?
 To what lengths will you go to escape being mine?!!
 Waha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haa{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!
 I have no interest in an empty cage!
 Throw it away!!"
When Father learned of the accident,
 he kept on laughing and laughing, as though nothing could be more amusing, to the point that just listening to him disturbed me.
Perhaps something had come loose in his mind......
That was the day that changed him.
Father shut himself up inside the world of the occult even more than he ever had before......
When my husband came back, he was astonished to see how eccentric Father had now become.
However, ......he had already accepted that this would happen sooner or later.
Of course, my husband had heard about the baby.
However, he told me that it was surely just some whim of Father\'s, and to forget the whole episode.
So I forgot it!
It was an unfortunate accident.
No, there wasn\'t an accident at all!
I forgot everything, even that the baby had existed in the first place...!!
After all, it was a twisted nightmare which lasted not even three days!
{n}That\'s right, it was all a nightmare...!!
I don\'t want to remember any of it!!
The cliff, the broken fence, the roar of the sea,
 and......the wailing of that baby.........!!!
"So, that baby.........is the baby of 19 years ago?"
"Of course not!
 I killed that baby!
 It no longer exists in this world!"
"......However, there is no red truth in the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} world.
 In the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} world, nothing can be trusted."
"............That\'s right.
 Beato, you definitely killed that baby.
 But in the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} world, it might still be considered alive.
 ......Whether {i:it\'s really alive or not}, catch my drift?"
"Are you saying.........that it actually was alive?!
 After falling to the rocks from that height......?!"
"I don\'t know.
 But calm down.
 ......No matter how much that person hates you, the truth is that it was an accident.
 If he does hate you, that hatred is completely unjustified...!"
"But, but...!
 Even if I didn\'t lay a finger on him, ......inside my heart, I...!!"
"Calm down.
 ......No matter who the man from 19 years ago hates or what he yells, there\'s no way the sin he\'s after actually occurred.
 So calm down.
 Why don\'t I welcome the man from 19 years ago as my guest?
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*!"
"And just when the riddle was solved and I thought my job was finished.
 I\'ve got to entertain this final guest of mine!!
 Kuhhya{0}hya{0}hya{0}hya{0}hya!!"
"It\'s getting interesting.
 ......Not only are you protecting Lord {f:5:Goldsmith}\'s secret, but you also have a 19th guest and a man from 19 years ago."
".........That\'s right—to us who claim that Kinzo is alive, Erika is number 19.
 And in addition to that 19th piece, we have a man from 19 years ago?
 How interesting. I\'m getting all excited."
"We have no lack of opponents!!
 And I was just thinking it a shame to have only one guest at my tea party!!
 Come, you fools!!
 Kuhha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haa{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haa{0}hahah!!"
Furudo Erika is Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}\'s piece.
{n}In that case, whose piece is the man from 19 years ago......?
The voice which could be faintly overheard through the receiver...was Natsuhi\'s.
"I, ......I understand.
 I\'ll sleep right now.
 I won\'t leave my room, and I won\'t pick up the phone...!
 So please, don\'t tell my husband and daughter......!"
When heard through a receiver, even these begging screams which would have shaken the heart of anyone who heard them...
......could be listened to with a heart of ice...
"As long as you keep our promise, I\'ll keep your secret, Mother.
 ......Don\'t break our promise.
 .........I\'m already very close by.
 I can easily tell whether you\'ve turned your lights off and whether you\'re on the phone.
 ...If I wished to, I could even kiss your sleeping face."
"I\'ll keep it!
 I\'ll keep my promise!!
 So stop it, just stop it!
 Stop iiii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}iittt!!"
The receiver was set down violently.
......“He” knew very well how bad an aftertaste you could leave for the other side just by the way you hung up the phone...
"Okay, good night, Mother.
 ............And there you go!
 Now Natsuhi won\'t come out of her room tonight."
".........That\'s a clever trick.
 You can change your voice?"
"*giggle*!
 Anyone can change their voice.
 A sweet voice when begging Papa for a favor{p:0:♪}
 A hoarse‐sounding voice when taking the day off school.
 An apologetic voice when turning down a friend that you actually hate!
 {f:5:If you want}{p:0:♪},
 {p:0:I can do~}
 {p:0:{nobr:ａｎｙ} {nobr:ｖｏｉｃｅ☆}}
 at all~!"
".........You should stop being a witch and become a voice actress."
"Heheheheheheheh!
 So, are all the pieces set up for both of us now?
............‘Furudo Erika’.
 What a wonderful piece.
 She suits you so much more than Ange did, Bern."
"............Your praise honors me, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}."
"The pleasure is mine.
 ......Mmm, she really is wonderful.
 Super adorable.
 I\'m dying to break her spirit with my witch illusions and see her face twist in humiliation."
"......Hear that?
 ......Don\'t embarrass me, okay?
 Show me that you\'re a much more useful piece than Ange was."
"Yes, leave it to me.
 Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}, my master.
 ......I\'m nothing like that gloomy, dull, utterly charmless piece."
"*giggle*giggle*giggle*!
 She\'s so right.
 The only useful thing that Ange did was get turned into meat chunks to fire Battler up!"
"We have no interest at all in family love or sibling love!
 The game we want to see is more gruesome and sticky!
 A <grotesque>, <pop>, and <cute> murder case!!"
".........If Natsuhi is the king, then I wonder if Beato is the queen.
 *giggle*.
 The pack of witches and furniture guarding Natsuhi is less like a set of chess pieces and more like—"
"Bowling pins, right?!
 Kyahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!
 Illusions of Natsuhi and Beato,
 Kinzo and the worthless furniture!
 Entertain us a bit, will you?!"
"Especially Beato!
 We\'re bored of you now!
 That "Legend of the Witch" murder game of yours is over!
 And your time is up too!!"
"This game board is Bern\'s and mine now.
 It\'ll suit you to be reduced to one of our pieces and toyed with for all eternity!!"
"*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*.
 Both Natsuhi and Beato are sacks of filthy, rotten truth, just entrails wrapped up in a thin layer of skin.
 ......Tearing that to shreds and dragging the insides out will be one of my—
no, one of {i:our} few pleasures."
"Yes, you can have a lot of fun with it.
 Hey, are you watching?
 {f:5:Beatrice}?
 Look at how much fun can be had playing with your board.
 I\'ll show you.
 A fifth game that\'s actually fun!!"
".........It\'s a bit sad if we\'re the only ones having a pleasant chat.
 Why don\'t you let Beato talk too?"
"Hear that?
 I\'ll give you special permission to talk.
 What do you hope to gain from this latest game?!"
"......................................."
"Ahahahaha!
 Nothing, she says!
 That\'s right, that\'s right!
 You\'re the loser who got crushed by Battler!
 Leave it to me, okay?
 I\'ll put the witch side on top in a snap!
 But I\'m gonna be sacrificing you as a piece in the process!!"
"What a dreadful loss of face for {f:5:Beatrice}, keeper of the gold, to have her epitaph so easily solved before the first twilight.
 ......*giggle*giggle*!!"
"......Isn\'t it great that you\'ve been left as a piece as part of Natsuhi\'s fantasy?
 ......Well, except that we\'re treating you as a pin now instead of a piece."
"The Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice} is out of the picture now!
 In my game, you and your furniture only have a teeny‐tiny role, a loser\'s role!!
 You can enjoy getting tossed and thrown around and made into toys for me and Bern!!"
".........If that\'s not what you want, just tell us to stop.
 And we\'ll stop."
"......................................."
"She doesn\'t mind!
 *giggle*giggle*!!
 Pin confirmed!!"
"Ahhahaha...ahhahahahahaha!"
""Kyahhha{0}hah{0}hah{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hah{0}hha{0}ha{0}hah{0}gwa{0}hyah{0}haha{0}aah!!!""
There\'s no need for a Golden Witch anymore.
All that\'s needed is a sacrificial doll so that we two witches can enjoy some time playing.
Die, die, disappear.
Confess to your filthy past and your crimes,
 pour out your sob story of regret and repentance as you throw yourself off a cliff and die!!
There will be no more appearances for the Golden Witch......!!
Ahhah{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haah{0}hah{0}haa{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haa{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha...!!
"......................................."
"...............Beato..."
This will be......a most horrible game.
On the surface, it does look very similar to the usual tales.
However, ......there is no respect given to the true main characters of this tale.
This is supposed to be the tale to which the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice} invited Ushiromiya Battler.
However, the host has been lost, and there is no longer a guest.
{n}......With both inviter and invitee now gone, only the worst kind of tale remains.
{a:c:Welcome to the fifth game:
{n}End of the Golden Witch.
{n}Welcome to a party with neither host nor guests,{nobr: hijacked by wicked witches......}}
".........Ready, Battler?
 The second day is about to start.
 Heheheheh! I hate Beato\'s kind of slow, plodding storytelling!"
"Do your worst.
 ......No matter how much you mess things up, I\'m still gonna reach the truth of this game."
"*giggle*.
 .........As you must.
 For the sake of your little sister, if nothing else."
".............................."
"Don\'t worry.
 ......Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} may be a far more terrifying opponent than that fool {f:5:Beatrice},
 but I\'ll be giving you plenty of support, so there won\'t be any problems.
 ......Let\'s work together, and this time we\'ll expose the witch illusions for what they really are."
".........I don\'t give a damn about you.
 I won\'t accept anything or anyone that wasn\'t a part of Beato\'s games, and I don\'t need your help."
"Is now really the time to act tough?
 .........Oh well, let\'s both give it our all, okay?
 Together, let\'s tear the witch illusions to shreds.
 *giggle*giggle*!"
Erika brazenly put her hand out for me to shake.
...Instead of just passively ignoring this,
 I gave her an active and clear answer by knocking her hand aside.
".........*giggle*.
 Looks like he hates shaking hands.
 Just like Ange."
"Don\'t worry.
 I\'m a far more useful piece than Ange.
 ......I\'m nothing at all like shredded meat that couldn\'t accomplish anything besides restoring Battler‐san\'s fighting spirit."
"..........................."
"*giggle*...!
 Isn\'t it great that you\'ve been blessed with such helpful‐looking allies?!
 In the past, it was {f:5:Virgilia} and Ronove.
 Then Ange came as well."
"And now you have Bern and Erika!
 There are so many pieces supporting you!
 And despite all of that, you still can\'t get even a glimpse of the truth! How does it feel to be that incompetent?! How does it feel?!"
".........It doesn\'t matter.
 This battle is between me and Beato.
 Everyone else besides us...doesn\'t matter."
"Oh, is that true?
 Are you finally standing on your own?!
 You\'ve always had someone helping you or showing you mercy, so I wonder just how far you\'ll get on your own!
 I\'m gonna enjoy watching this!"
"......I\'m taking it back.
 .........This is our game.
 ......You two aren\'t invited!!"
"*giggle*.
 Yes, that\'s true.
 .........This is your game.
 Then show us you\'re capable of reclaiming it.
 ......You couldn\'t even win Beato\'s games when she went easy on you at every turn.
 Show us how far you can take Lambda\'s completely ruthless game without anyone\'s help!"
"Now awaken, Ushiromiya Battler!! Welcome to the morning of October 5th!!"......Was it someone\'s alarm clock?
 A repetitive electronic beeping noise filled the room......
Battler, who had gone to bed late and hadn\'t had anywhere near enough sleep yet,
 covered his head in his blanket and waited for someone to turn off the alarm.
......But no matter how much time passed, the beeping didn\'t stop.
.........I see.
The point of an alarm clock isn\'t just to be loud enough to wake you,
 but to be annoying enough to keep you from wanting to fall back asleep.
Heyyyy... Guuyys... The alarm\'s going off.
 Make it stop please......
Why do we always sound so annoyed when first waking up?
......Well, it does makes sense.
 After all, we\'re still sleepy and in a bad mood.
However, there was absolutely no sign that my annoyed voice had caused anyone to turn over in their sleep,
 much less crawl out of bed to stop the alarm.
Letting out a deep sigh, I flung the covers off me and got up.
With the shutters down on the windows, there was almost no light getting in, and the room was as dim as it had been earlier.
Though even if the shutters hadn\'t been down,
 there\'s no way that this dull weather would have let in enough sun to make this a pleasant morning.
My cousins were still wrapped up in their beds, sound asleep and taking no notice whatsoever of that beeping.
Normally, once any one person gets up, the others tend to automatically follow...
......Annoyed that the Law of Consecutive Summer Camp Awakenings that I\'d come up with had just been broken, I drowsily searched for the source of the sound.
I could hear it coming from a wristwatch set on a table.
Judging by the style of the watch, it was probably George‐aniki\'s.
Taking a random guess, I pushed a small button on the side of it, and the sound stopped.
Apparently, it had been set for seven in the morning.
{n}........Is it already seven?
Sorry, but I really don\'t feel like I slept at all......
Playing cards had been left on the table as though they had stopped mid‐game.
......The game looked like sevens.
"................................."
Dammit, ......I\'ve got a piercing headache.
What the hell was all that last night?
......That mountain of gold and the subsequent argument between our parents...it all feels like a bad dream...
"............So stupid..."
Breakfast normally starts at eight.
{n}......Now isn\'t a bad time to start getting up and getting dressed.
The adults probably won\'t argue in front of us cousins.
......In that case, I think I\'ll stay with my cousins all day long.
I\'m sure they\'ll be able to keep me away from all that annoying talk about the gold and being the successor and all......
In fact, I should have done that in the first place...
I slept with my clothes on last night, too, so I\'m drenched in sweat... Gross.
......I guess I\'ll take a shower.
I\'m sure the others want to too.
At this age, it\'s embarrassing to wake them by shaking their shoulders.
{n}If I turn the TV on, everyone will probably wake up.
{n}Well, let\'s at least turn the lights on for now.
......In this dim light, with the quiet sound of the continuing wind and rain, it really doesn\'t feel like morning\'s come yet.
I flipped the light switch.
 And then, that dimly lit morning ended.
".........George...... .........Geeeoo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}orge!!!"
"This is just too much......
 How...could anyone get away with something like this...?!!"
As they clung to Aniki\'s corpse, knowing that he would never wake up again,
 ......Auntie Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi cried.
"......Please, let him go now.
 Do you think George‐kun would like the two of you to see him this way...?
 Of course not...!"
".........Aneki.
 I know how you feel, but let\'s have Doctor Nanjo handle this..."
"How could {i:you} understand?!
 George was killed!
 George!!
 Geo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}orge, ugghaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!"
"Doctor Nanjo\'s right.
 We mustn\'t keep looking at George like this...
 ......This is for his sake!
 We\'ve gotta hold back for now...!"
When Auntie Eva tried even harder to cling to that corpse,
 Dad and Uncle Hideyoshi dragged her away and had a heated debate with her beside the wall...
"No, nooooooooooooo!! Geo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}orge!!
 Doctor Nanjo! Help him!!
 If he\'s lost too much blood, do a blood transfusion!!
 George and I are the same blood type!!
 I beg you!
 Doctor Nanjo!!"
".....................Eva‐san.
 ...It pains me to say this,
 ......but what George‐kun needs right now isn\'t your blood..."
Doctor Nanjo shook his head slightly, then nodded across to where I stood.
I softly pulled the blanket up......and covered George‐aniki\'s body.
His throat......had been split wide open.
{n}...The wound was probably.....larger and deeper than his mouth.
{n}Did it look like a clean and neat corpse now that his neck was at least covered...?
Of course not...
......The large amount of blood that had spilled from the wound stained the bed a horrible dark red,
 ......and even covering him with the blanket couldn\'t hide the blood that had poured out.
After all, there were large, dark red stains on the blanket too,
 so that even once he was covered with it, the gruesomeness of the body was still being thrust in our faces......
So I stripped the blankets off of my bed and placed one on top.
......But I only had two blankets.
So if I covered just one more body, ......I wouldn\'t be able to cover any more.
Feeling pity for the ones I couldn\'t cover,
 ......for some reason, in spite of the situation, ...I muttered "don\'t complain about not getting the same as everyone else" inside my head......
"......Kyrie.
 Pull their blankets over them.
 ...They\'ll catch cold."
"..................Sure."
Kyrie‐san and I covered the other bodies with their blankets in the same way as George‐aniki\'s...
......So that they wouldn\'t have to suffer the indignity...of having their terrible wounds exposed like this anymore......
In one bed......rested Jessica.
......Jessica was exactly the same as George‐aniki.
Though she appeared to be resting quietly in the bed...
......her throat had been sliced deep and the wound lay open in a brutal way......
And Maria was the same.
......Not only Maria.
There was one more victim.
Lying on the same bed, sleeping alongside her,
 ......was Auntie Rosa.
George‐aniki, Jessica, Maria, ...and Auntie Rosa.
......In this room were four people who had been killed, their throats sliced open.
They\'d probably been like that since last night.
......And I came back to the room completely ignorant, snuggled under the covers, and fell asleep right next to them.........
.........All of them had a horizontal cut across their throats.
I had been...forced to see all the way......into the depths of those gashes in everyone\'s throat...
Those cuts might even have reached as far as halfway into their necks.
......If you tried to open one up, you\'d probably be able to see that the gash reached all the way to the bone.
The only wounds were the single gash on each neck.
......So if you just covered their necks with your hand,
 ......you might be able to persuade yourself that they were merely sleeping.
But even so,
 ......this frighteningly deep wound...
......was incredibly...
...gruesome......
There\'s no such thing as "clean" or "dirty" ways of killing.
{n}...All methods of killing are equally brutal.
But even so,
 .........this was incredibly...
...brutal...............
And...there was one more thing which adorned these brutal murders to make them even more unsettling.
Drawn very large on the wall...
......was something like an eerie magic circle.
It was drawn in a bright red paint which looked like blood,
 making it look as though some disturbing ritual had taken place in this room,
 with the four of them offered as human sacrifices...
However, none of us were paying it any attention.
......No one has a heart so cold that they could witness the deaths of those close to them...
...and still worry about some graffiti on the wall...
".........Good morning, everyone.
 .........Oh, ......what a wonderful magic circle."
The girl who bragged that she drew more pleasure from the process of exposing the truth than from the truth itself,
 ......and who went so far as to call herself an intellectual rapist, ......appeared in the hall.
When she saw the extraordinarily creepy magic circle in this gruesome room,
 I heard what was unmistakably a sigh of admiration escape her lips...
"You...............don\'t come in here......"
"............I overheard the details from the corridor.
 Is it four people who have passed away?
 ......Allow me to express my sincere condolences."
On Erika\'s face...
...no, that\'s not it.
 It was in her eyes.
......In Erika\'s eyes, I could see...
...a shameless smile...
...that was hard to describe.
She found this...entertaining.
{n}......She found the outbreak of a crime...
...entertaining...
It was like the smile of a kid waiting in the wings at a school play,
 moments before she was due to come on stage...
"......Sorry, Erika‐chan.
 We\'re busy at the moment.
 ......Could you wait in your room?"
"............I\'m afraid not.
 It\'s the detective\'s right to investigate the scene."
"We said we don\'t want you here...!
 You\'re not one of the family, so have the respect to back off!!"
".........It is a disappointing, third‐rate mystery in which the suspect blocking access to the murder scene turns out to be the culprit.
 ......At least, in my humble opinion...?"
"Who gives a damn about what you want?!!
 Get out!!
 No one needs you here!!"
"Erika‐chan...!
 I\'m real sorry about this, but could you return to your room?!
 We\'re busy here!"
"Geoo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}orge,
 Geoo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}orge,
 wa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}ahhh!!"
"......Move out of the way, please.
 I can\'t investigate the crime scene."
"If there\'s a need for that, we\'ll do it ourselves or leave it to the police!
 Like hell you have the right to defile their bodies even further!!"
"{p:1:Detective\'s authority.
 ......The detective has the right to investigate all crime scenes.
 Move out of the way, Ushiromiya Battler.
 This is my legitimate right within the game, as granted to the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} side}."
Those words, which seemed to be utterly ridiculous at first,
 ......were words of power that had come from a world much higher than theirs.
Battler was thrown back by an unseen power and landed on his butt.
Struck silent by Erika\'s quiet intensity and the bizarre, suffocating atmosphere, ......nobody was able to prevent her from entering the room...
".........Rest assured,
 my goal is not to profane the dignity of the deceased.
 And I have no desire to peer into the ghastly gashes in their throats.
 ......What I wish to ascertain is something completely different."
"Namely, who committed these murders.
 .........Doctor Nanjo and the rest of you,
 ......and particularly Battler‐san, the first to discover the bodies:
 .........I have a number of questions for you, so I hope you will oblige me."
"A‐......are you listening?! What gives you the right...?!"
"{p:1:Because I am the detective}."
Battler couldn\'t argue against this incomprehensible nonsense.
{n}......No, ...he wasn\'t permitted to argue.
{n}It was a restriction...placed on pieces.
Erika summoned Doctor Nanjo and got him to tell her in detail about his preliminary findings.
......Normally, he wouldn\'t have spoken of that to an outsider so casually.
...However, for some reason, the atmosphere about the place had begun to make it feel as though nothing should be hidden from Erika...
".........Okay, let\'s enjoy this first twilight of Lambda\'s.
 Four corpses?
 That\'s two corpses short.
 ......Well, she doesn\'t necessarily have to see to it that six people are killed, but that\'s how we\'ve been playing.
 That girl isn\'t completely clueless, so she must have killed two more people somewhere."
There\'s a magic circle on the wall representing the first twilight, similar to the ones in Beato\'s games.
*giggle*, that girl talks big, but I wonder just how closely she can imitate Beato.
*giggle*giggle*, ahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha...!
Your Hebrew sure is crappy, Lambda.
 You\'ve got this part slightly wrong.
"......What the heck...
 What\'s going on?
 Why\'s there a magic circle?"
"I\'ll bet someone wanted to try imitating {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.
 Aha, what a crappy magic circle...!"
"This isn\'t some funny imitation!
 Some {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} deliberately drew this to make it look like {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama\'s own work...!
 Anyway, let\'s report to {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama about this!"
"Even though we\'re already up to our eyeballs just protecting {f:5:Goldsmith}\'s secret... ...What a pain."
"These murders have no beauty to them at all.
 ......It isn\'t a locked room or anything, and there\'s nothing impossible about it.
 Sloppy murders like this aren\'t worthy of {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama at all."
"...Furudo Erika...
 ......An unexpected woman for an unexpected crime.
 ......And there\'s that unexpected man from 19 years ago.
 .........And if you add on the fact that Battler\'s already solved the epitaph, this game is completely different than normal.
 ...What the heck\'s going on...?!
 Let\'s go!!"
""Yes, Onee‐sama!!""
In the kitchen, Gohda was preparing a wonderful breakfast at a brisk pace.
The main dish would be herb omelet.
Even simple foods could become an invigorating feast under Gohda\'s skillful hands.
He was planning to complete all the other preparations for the meal here beforehand, and then cook their individual omelets fresh before their eyes in the dining hall, serving them up one by one.
"Hmm hmm hmm hmm{p:0:♪} Pan pan pan pa~n{p:0:♪}"
Gohda hummed as he continued his preparations in high spirits.
When Shannon, who was helping out, saw Gohda like this, her mood also brightened.
She arranged the salad in a neat little pattern and showed it to Gohda.
"How is this?
 I think the tomatoes look a bit cuter this way."
"Hmm~~, very ni~ce!
 You\'re really getting the hang of this, Shannon‐san!
 Hmm hmm hmm hm~m{p:0:♪}"
""Hmm hmm hmm hm~m{p:0:♪}""
The two happy people gave each other a high five.
Shannon didn\'t like Gohda when he was sneaky, but she had no problems at all with him when he was cooking happily.
She sometimes even thought it would have been nice if his contract hadn\'t included any jobs besides cooking.
If that had been the case, he wouldn\'t have had to get in a bad mood doing unnecessary jobs.
"The dining hall is ready.
 You can carry it in whenever you want."
"We\'re almost good to go, so please get the serving cart ready.
 Hmm hmm hmmmmm!"
Without thinking, even Kumasawa caught Gohda\'s high spirits.
The kitchen had a very nice smell and atmosphere about it, truly refreshing for so early in the morning.
Then, Kanon came back in the usual bad mood he always had from the moment he woke up.
Kanon and Genji were in charge of getting many things ready for the morning, such as opening the curtains.
......However, Kanon had been alone today, so it had taken much longer than usual.
"I\'m done.
 ......Where\'s Genji‐sama?"
"He still isn\'t here.
 .........That\'s unusual for him, isn\'t it?
 I\'ve never known him to sleep in."
"Hoh‐hoh‐ho.
 I guess even Genji‐san sleeps in sometimes."
"That\'s rather careless of him, considering that this is the middle of the family conference.
 Kanon‐san.
 Could you wake him up for us?"
"............Yes."
"I wonder what Genji‐san\'s face looks like when he\'s half asleep.
 Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho. Let me go with you."
Even though Gohda had asked her to get the serving cart ready,
 Kumasawa followed nimbly after Kanon, skillfully skipping work.
As Kanon muttered about how Gohda was the one who slept in all the time,
 he headed for the servants\' sleeping quarters.
"So you didn\'t wake him up this morning, Kanon‐san?"
"......Last night, I fell asleep while still in the servant room, so I didn\'t return to the servants\' quarters."
Last night, Kanon had dozed off while in the middle of his late night shift,
 falling asleep in the servant room.
Shannon had been kind enough to put a blanket on him,
 but that had just made it so warm that he fell into an even deeper sleep...
So he hadn\'t returned to his bed in the servants\' quarters last night.
Because of that, he hadn\'t met Genji even once this morning.
He knocked on the door.
"......Genji‐sama.
 It\'s Kanon.
 Good morning."
"............Oh my.
 I wonder if he\'s still sleeping."
"......Excuse me."
When Kanon was about to open the door,
 ......he noticed something strange on the upper part of it.
......What is that? ......Duct tape??
A small strip of duct tape was stuck along the frame of the door,
 almost as though it was sealing the door shut.
Furthermore, there were small slits made with scissors along the center of the duct tape,
 so that if you opened the door even a slight amount, it would be torn in two.
Also, written sloppily across the duct tape with a fine pen was what appeared to be someone\'s...signature?
......It was written in a very elaborate and decorative manner,
 and if it was a signature, Kanon had no idea whose name was written.
"I wonder if it\'s some sort of prank......"
"I don\'t know, but there\'s no point in worrying about it right now.
 ......Genji‐sama,
 excuse me."
He opened the door, ripping the duct tape.
Nothing in particular happened when it was ripped, so the strange piece of duct tape was quickly forgotten.
......The room was dimly lit.
{n}The bunk bed\'s lower bunk still had a lump under the blanket.
Apparently, Genji was still sleeping......
"Good morning, Genji‐sama."
"This isn\'t like you. Hoh‐hoh‐ho.
 It\'s mo~rni~ng."
"...............Ah,
 G‐Genji‐sama......!"
"Eek, ......wh‐what is this, what is this...?!"
There was a large, dark red stain on the blanket.
......Though this was one of the servants\' blankets, even those were always kept clean.
{n}There was no way they would have a stain like this.
Kanon hesitantly peeled back Genji\'s blanket,
 .........saw what was left of him,
 ......and was shocked into silence.
"Wh‐what the heck?
 His throat\'s been cut right across!"
".........It\'s a sharp cut.
 ...You couldn\'t cut through flesh like that without a blade of considerable length."
"Wh‐what\'s going on?
 Battler solved the riddle of the epitaph, right?
 Why are murders happening?!"
"I don\'t know.
 ......In any event, this isn\'t good.
 We should report about this to {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama and Natsuhi‐sama."
"Belphe, hurry and report to Luci‐nee...!!"
"Understood...!"
After dashing out, Kumasawa called Gohda and Shannon over.
......Then, this new pair let out screams identical to the first two.
"Hey, Gohdaaa!
 Don\'t stop making breakfast!"
"Is now really the time to be saying that?!!
 ......There\'s no chance they\'ll be having a quiet and peaceful breakfast on the second day.
 ......I have a bad feeling about this.
 Genji might not be the only one.
 ......Let\'s check the entire mansion. Something else might have happened...!"
"Yes, Onee‐sama!!"
Natsuhi sprang awake at the sudden sound of the phone.
To Natsuhi, the fact that she\'d woken up was surprising in itself.
......She had thought she was going to spend the whole night unable to sleep out of fear that the mysterious man might come in at any moment,
 but at some point she must have fallen asleep...
Of course, she still didn\'t feel rested at all.
As she groaned from the dull pain in her head, which hadn\'t gone away once since last night,
 she managed to get out of bed...
"Good morning, Natsuhi‐sama."
".........Good morning.
 ......It\'s a horrible morning......"
"Don\'t worry.
 No one attempted to enter this room."
"......I see.
 ...Thanks for keeping watch all night..."
Even so, that didn\'t mean she had been able to sleep peacefully.
.........The continued ringing of the phone made her headache throb even more strongly...
"I believe it would be wise to answer the phone.
 ......Also, I have some bad news to report from my sisters."
"......Let\'s leave the bad news for later.
 ......I\'ll answer the phone first."
Natsuhi shook her head to wake herself and picked up the receiver.
......Then, she regretted not listening to Lucifer\'s bad news first.
...Because she wanted the first thing she heard about on this horrible morning to be something better than this...
".........Morning, Mother.
 ......Sleep well?"
That voice told her that this horrible morning......this nightmare......was still not over...
"I, ......I kept my promise.
 I\'ve been holed up in this room the whole time.
 Of course, I haven\'t been on the phone either...!"
"But you did pick up this phone call, didn\'t you......?"
"W‐......well, ......ah—"
"Ahahahahahahahaha.
 ......Just kidding.
 This is just a wake‐up call I\'m giving my beloved mother.
 Morning, Mother.
 ......*snicker*snicker*...!"
".........How far do you intend to mock me......?"
Natsuhi gripped the receiver so hard it creaked...
"I wanted you to leave your seat so that I could set up for the party.
 ......Thanks to you behaving yourself, everything\'s ready now.
 Of course, you\'re the main guest, Mother."
"......Wh‐what are you planning to do......?"
"That\'s for you to look forward to.
 ...Don\'t worry, I won\'t keep you waiting.
 It\'s already begun.
 ......Oh, that\'s right, wait a sec.
 There\'s someone I want you to hear."
"......Huh?"
There was the sound of the receiver being jolted around.
......The phone was apparently being passed to someone else, but there was a clunking, clattering noise,
 as though it was taking a lot of effort to hand the receiver over...
Who in the world was he giving the phone to?
......From what Natsuhi knew of this man, ...no matter who he was giving the phone to, ...it couldn\'t be good news for her...
"......Gwah!
 Untie me...!
 You coward...!!"
"Huh?!
 D‐......dear?!
 Is that you?!"
"Gghgghghgh, mwoooohh...!!
 Untie me, untie meee!!"
It was, without a doubt, the voice of her husband.
However, he didn\'t respond to Natsuhi\'s voice.
{n}......Perhaps he was bound somewhere in the darkness.
Krauss, not realizing that Natsuhi was on the other end of the phone, repeatedly demanded that he be untied...
"......Your husband is here.
 His eyes and ears are covered, so he can\'t talk,
 but I think you can tell that he\'s in perfect health."
"Wh‐what are you after...?!!
 Let my husband go!"
"I\'ll let him go tomorrow.
 If you\'ll keep two promises, that is."
"What are they...?!"
"One is that you keep it a secret that I\'m taking care of your husband.
 ......Sooner or later, the others in the mansion will probably raise a fuss that they\'re unable to find Krauss.
 But you know nothing, so you will say nothing.
 ......Understand?"
"I, I understand...!
 What\'s your other condition?!"
"......It\'s just a little game.
 At one in the afternoon,
 you will go into the foremost guest room on the first floor of the mansion and hide in the closet."
"A guest room......?
 Why should I go into a closet......?!"
"It\'s just a little game of hide‐and‐seek.
 If you can hide there for an hour without anyone finding you, you win.
 ......If someone does find you, you lose."
"And if I lose,
 ......what happens......?!"
"Nothing in particular.
 ......Isn\'t that what playing is all about?
 If you play along with this hide‐and‐seek, I\'ll release your husband tomorrow."
"Y‐
......you are going to...
keep that promise, I hope..."
"Of course.
 Make sure you do too, Mother.
 ......If you break our promise, I\'ll know right away."
Just then, there was a sudden, loud knock on the door to Natsuhi\'s room.
{n}Her heart leapt automatically.
"......Madam, are you there?
 Good morning...!"
"It\'s Gohda and Kanon!
 Madam, please wake up...!"
The voices coming through the door were Kanon\'s and Gohda\'s.
{n}...The knock had been wild, and the voices a little shrill.
......It seemed that something strange had happened...and that they were agitated.
".........What is it?
 Did something happen?"
"I‐it\'s nothing.
 It looks like the servants have arrived.
 I\'m hanging up."
"Sure.
 I\'ve said everything I wanted to.
 .........So, don\'t break our promise."
"......I understand.
 A‐and you don\'t break our promise either...!"
"You\'ve got it wrong.
 That\'s for you to decide.
 .........Don\'t make me break my promise.
 Mother."
"...............kh......"
"I\'ll be watching you all day today, Mother.
 *giggle*giggle*, ahahahaha, oh‐hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho!"
Clack!
{f:5:Lambdadelta} slammed the receiver down on the antique phone.
Then the phone exploded into bits and changed into a spray of gold, which became a group of gold butterflies and disappeared.
"*giggle*, dance for me, Natsuhi!
 Dance in fear of your sin 19 years ago!!
 My turn\'s going pretty well.
 Okay, your turn now, Bern!!"
".........I\'m sure this is a waste of time, but confirm for me whether communication with the outside world is possible through calling the police."
"The external line\'s unusabl~e!
 The internal line seems like it can be used, though!
 Boats can\'t be used either \'cause of the typhoon!
 I guess that completes the closed circle, huh!
 Congrats, you\'re now a full detective, Bern!"
Police intervention sometimes robs the detective of some of her authority.
However, with the construction of the closed circle, the existence of police had been denied forever.
From now on, the authority of the detective piece would be completely guaranteed.
"Yes, yes, thank you for your generosity.
 Then I guess it\'s time to get this game started."
Erika, you\'re the main character.
 Now, begin...!
"......E‐even Genji‐san?!
 F‐five people have been killed?!"
"Y‐yes.
 ......It was so......horrible......!"
"It was exactly the same as the four in the guesthouse...
 ......His throat......was sliced open...with a terribly sharp blade..."
"......I...I can\'t believe that even though I had the midnight shift, ......I didn\'t notice anyone suspicious......"
"Don\'t blame yourself.
 ......If you\'d bumped into the killer, you might be the one dead right now."
"On top of that, the phones aren\'t even connectin\'...!
 I doubt any boats\'ll come in this weather.
 We\'re really up the creek now...!"
"......And that means it\'s very likely that the killer is still nearby."
"Hiyi...hiiiiieeieiiieee...!
 Then what?
 Does that mean we\'re trapped here with a murderer until the typhoon passes and the boat comes...?!"
"...I‐it\'ll be alright.
 If we all stay together like this, even the killer won\'t be able to lay a finger on us...!"
"E‐......even Jessica...
 ......I can\'t believe it........."
"W‐we won\'t let ourselves be killed like the others...!!
 I will have vengeance for George!!
 I\'ll never let them get away with this, never!
 No matter who did it or what their reason was, I swear I\'ll get revenge on whoever killed George!!
 I\'ll kill them, I\'ll murder them!!
 Waa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhhhh...!!"
".........Alright, has everyone gotten the weeping out of their system? Let\'s have some order, please.
 ......Has anyone seen Krauss‐san yet?"
"......We\'ve been calling him for a while, but he isn\'t answering..."
"Could the receiver be off the hook......?"
"No, we could hear it ringing.
 He would certainly have heard it......"
"..............."
"Wh‐what does it mean......?
 You don\'t think......Uncle Krauss too......?!"
"............I thought this would happen.
 .........I hate to say it at a time like this, ......but there were four in the guesthouse plus Genji to make five.
 ......I figured there would be one more."
"Why?!
 How could you know that?!
 Are you the killer?!
 Did you kill George?!"
"S‐stop it, Eva‐san...!
 Now is not the time...!"
Eva got agitated and grabbed at Kyrie.
Nanjo stepped in between them, and it grew into a bit of a scuffle......
Watching this, Erika smiled condescendingly and shrugged.
"But of course.
 Anyone could have predicted six victims from the moment they witnessed the crime scene in the guesthouse.
 In fact, I\'ve been wondering who the other two would be ever since I saw there were only four corpses."
"How could you know such a thing?!!
 You killed them?!
 You killed Geo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}orge!!"
"Qu‐quit it, Eva!
 .........Erika‐chan, Kyrie‐san...!
 How can you know that?!
 Can\'t you think before you talk...?!"
".........It\'s a simple connection to make.
 The graffiti drawn at the scene of the crime in the guesthouse was a magic circle.
 I just thought of things that are connected to both magic and murders."
"I see... ......The epitaph..."
"......I see...
 .........It\'s.........the first twilight."
"Huh? ...Huh?
 What\'s going on...?!"
"W‐well, I don\'t have a clue either...!!"
".........Is that how it is...?
 ......That damn witch......"
"So is this really.........{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama\'s doing......?"
"Why do you all keep talking as if you know something?!!
 I don\'t have a clue!!
 Someone, explain!!"
"Eva, please...! Calm down a bit...!!"
".............................."
"......That\'s all there is to it.
 From the moment I saw the magic circle at that crime scene,
 I had a hypothesis that this was a murder following the epitaph\'s first twilight, and that there would be six victims."
"......All it takes is the presence of that magic circle,
 and a deduction like this becomes trivial for Furudo Erika.
 ......Your thoughts, ladies and gentlemen?"
".........Then, ...you\'re saying Uncle Krauss was...killed as well...?"
"We can\'t be sure of that.
 ......Krauss‐san isn\'t the only one not present here.
 There\'s one more."
"..................ah—"
For just an instant, Natsuhi\'s brow furrowed......
{n}As she feared, ......she wouldn\'t be able to avoid the topic of the study...
"You don\'t mean......Dad?!
 Hey, someone must have contacted the study, right?!"
"O‐of course I placed a call and even knocked on the door...
 But, umm, there was no response..."
"Th‐......the head is completely immersed in his own research...
 H‐he sometimes leaves the receiver off the hook so that calls will not disturb him, and even ignores knocking at the door...!"
"...B‐but the line wasn\'t busy when I......"
"I‐in any case...!
 Our first priority must be to ensure that my husband is alive and well!!
 Let\'s go to his bedroom at once!!"
Natsuhi stood up in a flurry and dashed out into the corridor.
Rudolf and the others immediately chased after her, telling her to wait.
"............Come on now, everyone, you\'d better follow her.
 In both third‐rate mystery and splatter films, the people who act alone tend to die first.
 ......So of course that must also hold for this game.
 ......Beato truly is third‐rate.
 *giggle*giggle*giggle*...!"
Oh, but in third‐rate disaster and action movies, it\'s the ones who act alone who survive, isn\'t it?
Weird.
 *giggle*giggle*!
"......Even though the epitaph has already been solved...
 ...Who\'s behind this farce......?"
"It might be the work of this man from 19 years ago, who is thought to be Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}\'s piece.
 ......Ah yes, that can\'t be true."
"......Beato already stated in red in previous games...
that with Kinzo\'s disappearance, no more than 17 people exist and no 18th person exists.
 And now that Erika has been added, it\'s been stated that no 19th person exists.
 There\'s no room for this man from 19 years ago to appear on the island."
"Then the identity of the man from 19 years ago is either one of the existing {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s,
 ......or else..."
"*cackle*cackle*!
 Even if a 19th person isn\'t permitted by the red, slipping in a 19th person there...
is no trouble for me, no trouble for witches...!
 Now it\'s getting interesting. Why don\'t we watch how things unfold for a little longer?"
"Still, that Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} and Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}...
 They\'ve finally started doing whatever they like with my game board...!"
".........Didn\'t you know that would happen when you invited them?"
"Hmph.
 ......As a witch, I have the same dislike for boredom as they do.
 Even the unexpected brings the kind of joy a witch expects.
 So be it, bring it on...!"
"It\'s great that you\'re so eager, ......but things have taken a nasty turn.
 You know that, right?"
"............I concur.
 I would hesitate to call this a good time to wait and see what happens next."
"I know that.
 At this rate, Kinzo\'s existence will become a problem once again.
 ......And the barrier around the study won\'t last long."
"That\'s not all.
 Things are going to get even worse.
 ............Imagine this.
 Move one,
 move two,
 move three.
 ......Cornered,
 ......Natsuhi."
Gaap whispered something into Beato\'s ear.
Beato\'s mouth......slowly widened into a crooked smile.
"......That Erika has brought everyone together is actually convenient for us.
 All darkness outside the range of observers belongs to us demons.
 ......This may be the only time to make that move."
"Natsuhi is the king.
 She can\'t move far, but we cannot allow her to be taken!
......Let\'s make the first move.
 If we slip up here, Natsuhi will be cornered...!
 Gaap, can I count on you?!"
"Of course!
 ......I\'ll blow a hole through locked‐room tricks, alibis, and mysteries alike.
 .........Leave it to me. I\'ll deal with it."
A pitch‐black hole opened up in the floor and swallowed up Gaap along with the chair she sat in.
Then, a hole opened in the ceiling and spat just the chair back out, dropping it back into its original spot...
"......Things are becoming troublesome."
"Heh, ......heheheheheheheh.
 ......I see.
 So, against Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}, even I am nothing more than a mere piece.
 They say that in the opening, you should worry more about development than the capture of pieces."
".........*cackle*cackle*!
 I\'m just no match for that lady!
 I won\'t let her do that. Natsuhi is the final master I will serve!
 Know that this is a piece you\'ll never be allowed to take as long as she has a contract with me!!"
"Krauss\'s room was empty.
 The bed was also empty.
 But massive bloodstains similar to the crime scenes where the other five were murdered remained there."
"But there was no corpse."
"Nope."
"Then he isn\'t dead."
"Maybe not. Eheheheheheheheh...!!"
"......What\'s going on?!
 Where is Nii‐san?!"
"Judging by this blood‐stained bed......
I don\'t like to think about it, but we should probably assume that he was killed and had his neck cut open, just like the people in the guesthouse..."
".........Probably...
 Judging by the amount of blood lost, ...it\'s hard to imagine that he\'s alright..."
"B‐but......
 Where did Krauss‐sama go......?"
Large amounts of blood stained the bed, but there were no similar marks on the floor of the room.
Whether Krauss had run to safety somewhere after being seriously wounded, or whether he\'d been killed and carried somewhere,
 ......they had no clue where this "somewhere" was.
"........................"
......Natsuhi knew.
Though Krauss had been sounding far from his best over the phone, he at least hadn\'t sounded like he was on the brink of death.
In other words, these blood stains had to be a ruse.
{n}That might not even be blood...
.........Just what is that man thinking?
{n}...What is all this for...?!
"What the heck.........
 ......On the first twilight, ...sacrifice the six, is that what this is......?"
".........Was Krauss nii‐san not in the habit of locking his door?
 We just came in without unlocking it."
"......He did have a habit of locking up."
"O‐on Madam\'s orders,
 all private spaces in this house are kept locked."
"How many keys can unlock Uncle Krauss\'s room?"
"In addition to the one key Krauss‐sama held, there are the master keys..."
"Oh, don\'t bother with the lock and key nonsense, it\'s completely pointless.
 ......Have you forgotten that Genji‐san has already turned up dead?
 His master key is missing.
 Which means that all of the locks in this mansion are now meaningless."
".........How dull.
 In short, there are no locked‐room murders inside this mansion and there never will be.
 ......Good grief.
 What a bore of a mystery this is becoming."
Erika laughed off this murder in disappointment, as though it was something she was watching on TV.
......I can\'t understand her.
...Why is "her world" so different from ours?
It\'s almost like she\'s a being from another dimension...
"......W‐...was Jessica also...
...like this, ......in a bed?"
"....................."
"......Yes, that\'s right.
 ......Just like George, her throat......was cut......"
"......Jessica...
 ......Let me see Jessica...
 I haven\'t even seen her face yet...!
 .........Jessica, ...Jessicaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aaa!!"
"W‐wait up, Natsuhi‐san......!!"
"The culprit might still be hiding nearby!
 It would be dangerous to let her be alone..."
Natsuhi flew out of the room and dashed towards the guesthouse this time.
...It was only natural.
 After all, she still hadn\'t even seen Jessica\'s last face.
Everyone probably thought that was the reason.
 .........Of course, that was at least half of what was on Natsuhi\'s mind.
The other half...
...was her desire to shift their attention away from the study.
Strange crimes had occurred, the gold had been discovered, and some relatives had even recommended Battler to be the next head.
Even in these twisted circumstances,
 ............she had to protect Kinzo\'s secret.
.........Aahh... ...My head... ...If it should split from this pain...
{n}......Let it burst this very moment, burst open like a balsam flower.
Then I won\'t have to suffer any longer.........
"So, everyone.
 For Natsuhi‐san\'s sake, let\'s return to the guesthouse for the time being.
 ......Not that seeing her daughter\'s face is going to advance the story in any way."
".........Do you even have a heart?"
"A heart?
 What\'s that?"
Seeing her daughter\'s dead face wouldn\'t bring Jessica back to life, nor would it heal Natsuhi\'s anguish.
On the contrary, she would probably wail, wasting a considerable amount of time before being able to think properly again.
......That probably sums up Erika\'s screwed up argument...
........................
Seeing her dead face won\'t advance the story......?
"Oh, but that\'s where you\'re wrong!
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*.
 Beato\'s pieces have brought about an interesting change. *giggle*giggle*!"
"Wh‐...what in the..............."
Natsuhi flew into the cousins\' room on the upper floor of the guesthouse,
 ......and was struck dumb by the blood‐stained beds and the eerie magic circle which looked like it might have been drawn with the victims\' blood...
"......Where is Jessica......?
 Where is Jessica...?! Jessicaaa!!"
"In that...
...bed........."
"Bed?
 Where?!"
"Huh?
 ......George...?
 Wh‐......where is he......?!"
"Wait a second,
 ......what the hell...
...is going on here......?"
".........This room was locked tight when we left.
 We can now be certain that the culprit has a master key.
 Once again, my reasoning was correct."
"Who cares about that...?!
 Where did they go...?
 Wh‐where did all their bodies go...?!"
"............Heheh.
 Nice trick."
"See, look, look, it\'s magi~c!
 That Gaap who\'s with Beato hid the corpses somewhere with magic...!"
"......All of us moved together.
 You\'re trying to say that this gives everyone an alibi?"
"Your reasoning goes like this, right?
 The four of them weren\'t actually dead, they were just playing dead.
 Then, when no one else was around, they hid somewhere.
 Am I right?"
"You don\'t intend to declare any of their deaths in red now, do you?"
"Of course I won\'t.
 Unlike that dolt Beato, I don\'t give red out for free!"
"In that case, I\'ll gladly use the blue truth.
 I can think of any number of ways to work around something of this level."
"*giggle*.
 Sure, go ahe~ad!
 Blue truth time!"
"Here\'s the first one I can think of.
 {p:2:The victims aren\'t actually dead.
 They pretended to be dead, then secretly hid themselves somewhere.
 After all, you haven\'t declared anyone\'s death with the red truth}."
"Ahhaha!
 Even if I showed you their gaping wounds, you\'ve still gotta try that one if it wasn\'t in red, right?! That\'s like the basics of the basics!
 But don\'t get your hopes up.
 I\'m not giving you a freebie red truth!
 \'Cause all I need to do is refute one teensy little part of that theory at the end of the game, at midnight on October 5th!"
"Ah, the witch side has such a big advantage!
 If that stupid Battler was my opponent, he\'d be done after that blue truth, but you aren\'t like that, right, Bern?!"
"Of course.
 Anyone could have thought of that ridiculous move.
 I have more.
 Second one.
 {p:2:Krauss carried the bodies off and hid them.
 You\'re making it look like you\'ve kidnapped Krauss and locked him up somewhere, but he might actually be free.
 Krauss has no alibi.
 Krauss hid their corpses}."
"Right, of course you\'d say that.
 It\'s not like I declared with the red truth that Krauss was being confined. *giggle*giggle*!
 They do say you\'ve got to trick your friends before you can trick your enemies!
 So you\'re saying he lied to Natsuhi, making it seem like he\'d been captured!
 Eheh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eheh!!
 Any others?!"
"Third one.
 {p:2:The corpses were different people in the first place.
 They were substitute corpses made to look like the victims.
 George and the others were hiding from the beginning, and later cleared away the substitute corpses.
 The corpses were dead from the very beginning, so they don\'t count towards the number of people on the island}."
"Ahhah{0}hah{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!
 What is that, that\'s hilarious!!
 So all those people gathered around and looked at their dead faces, and not a single one of them realized that they were fakes?"
"Since you haven\'t used the red truth, there\'s a possibility that everyone misidentified all of the bodies.
 Of course, if you feel like responding to a repetition request for "no one would misidentify a person", I\'ll withdraw that claim immediately..."
"How about no~{p:0:♪} You can\'t bait me like that!
 The red truth is only useful if I make you wait for it, you know?"
"I\'ll pick a single blue truth from all the ones you give me throughout this game and I\'ll smash it with the red!
 Then the rest of the blue truths will be swallowed up by darkness before you can even find out whether they were right or wrong!"
"That darkness is the world of witches!
 You won\'t be given any truth at all!
 Ehheh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eheh!!"
.........Heheh.
...This girl acts like she\'s stupid, but she\'s not bad at all.
She\'ll never rise to provocation.
Looks like she understands the thing called "the darkness of witches" even better than the true Game Master, Beato.
And apparently, Gaap has a good understanding of it as well.
......That move of hiding the corpses.
It worked out pretty well for both Lambda and Beato.
In any event, I\'ve thought up a full three theories about the disappearing corpses.
Three blue wedges for a single riddle.
That doesn\'t mean she can just refute one of those three.
Unless she pulls out all three wedges, this riddle has been defeated.
That\'s the ironclad rule of witch hunting.
A single wedge isn\'t nearly enough.
Only vampires die from a single stake.
Compared to witches, vampires are weak.
......True witches won\'t die unless you stab them all over with stakes, you know.
Think about assassins—they do the same, don\'t they?
Assassins only kill their targets with a single perfect shot in Japanese manga.
Real assassins will empty out an entire clip of bullets.
............That\'s what you\'d do too, isn\'t it?
 So would I, of course.
But my blue truths were nothing special, so knowing her, she\'ll probably slice all of them in two with a single swipe of the red.
A confirmation of their deaths and Krauss\'s innocence.
 By simply firing off those couple of reds, she can remove all three of my wedges.
Well, that\'s okay.
When the red truth does come out, I just need to follow along with it and stab her full of blue wedges again.
.........*giggle*giggle*.
 This is how a witch\'s game is played.
*giggle*, ah, it\'s so much fun...!
Especially since Battler\'s sluggish fighting has been driving me mad for so long...!!
Yes, I understand, Lambda.
This was merely the very start of the beginning of the first twilight.
It was just a skirmish, right......?
*giggle*...... ...Wouldn\'t have it any other way...
.........Because when I crush you ragged, make you cry out in frustration as you crawl and scratch at the floor...
...grab that cute hair of yours and drag you along the ground as I roll around laughing......this way will make it all the more enjoyable!!
The servants\' quarters in the mansion had once again gone silent......
{n}There lay Genji\'s body, which had been covered completely with a blanket......
In the ceiling of this cramped room, a pitch‐black hole appeared,
 ......captivating legs sprouted out,
 ...and Gaap floated downwards.
".........Sorry, Genji.
 You probably want to enjoy your eternal sleep there, but that\'s not going to work.
 Disappear from this place so that even after death, you can continue to serve Natsuhi, the final head of the Ushiromiya family."
Gaap stripped off the blanket as she said this to Genji, who was sleeping peacefully...
Then she stared at the deep wound in his neck...
".........That\'s a nice cut.
 ......It must have been made with a single slice.
 .........Has someone capable of {i:this} manifested now......?
 This isn\'t so great.
 ...I can\'t think of anyone who isn\'t bad news."
It goes without saying, but witches are capable of summoning beings with a strength proportional to their own rank.
The great Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} called that being here as a trump card 19th person.
......Even optimistically speaking, this is on par with Ronove and me...
A pitch‐black hole opened in the bed, and Genji disappeared as though the bed had swallowed him up.
Just like the four in the guesthouse, Genji\'s corpse was hidden in some unknown place...
It was a place that no one could find, located neither within this world nor the next......
No longer would anyone be able to find their bodies.
{n}No longer would anyone be able to confirm their deaths.
Genji\'s body was carried to that place of endless silence,
 where it would never be disturbed......
"Without a corpse, he will be treated as missing.
 ......To be treated as missing is to be treated as both culprit and victim, truly like the inside of a cat box.
 ......The darkness within cat boxes that will never be opened is the haunt of witches and demons like us...!
 You\'re one move too late, Miss Great Detective. ......Heheheheh..."
Gaap licked her lips and swallowed......
"......I wonder why Gaap‐sama is going around hiding corpses."
"Nooo idea.
 But Gaap‐sama is pretty cool.
 She\'s just so......awesome."
"Stop talking nonsense, what happened to standing guard?!
 The {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s are returning from the guesthouse!!
 Gaap‐sama...!"
"Yes, let\'s disperse.
 .........This should be enough to give Natsuhi a way out..."
Gaap jumped into a pitch‐black hole which had opened near her feet.
Mammon shouted "I\'m going in too!" and jumped in,
 followed by Asmo, who said "Me too, me too!" and hopped in, giggling.
As Satan hesitated over what to do, the hole closed.
"A‐and you call yourselves members of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory... H‐how childish.
 So stupid...!"
Satan went bright red and got angry all by herself, then turned into gold butterflies and disappeared...
".........It seems that Gaap has succeeded in moving the five corpses."
"Well done.
 ......However, the next part will be the tricky one."
"They will probably be somewhat surprised at the disappearance of Genji\'s corpse,
 but their interest will most likely swing back to Kinzo\'s study after that."
"......There are two keys to the study.
 ...It\'s fortunate that Natsuhi is in possession of both.
 If she had left one with Genji, it would probably have fallen into Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}\'s hands by now."
"It seems that Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} has no intention of hiding Kinzo\'s death.
 ......Apparently, she plans to fight while ignoring the moat, towers, and ramparts that you have created."
"Heh, ......heheheh.
 This has become a strange triangular confrontation.
 We are all each other\'s enemies, but we sometimes join forces unintentionally.
 ......It is a three‐way fight, yet the next moment it\'s two against one, and then suddenly one against two.
 ......I know what this is like.
 The Chinese battle royal!
 Don\'t you think it\'s like that "Records of the Three Kingdoms" thing?"
"Oh, the Longzhong Plan.
 That\'s quite a sophisticated analogy to hear coming from you, pu ku ku...!"
"There were three empires in Records of the Three Kingdoms, weren\'t there?
 Wei, Wu, and Shu, right?
 That sounds just like us.
 ......So, which empire won out in the end?"
"......The power that gained control in the end was the Jin dynasty.
 The three empires you mentioned were all destroyed."
"Hoh.
 ............I didn\'t know that.
 I thought one of the three empires won.
 Did the Wei not have an overwhelming advantage...?"
"They had the position of emperor stolen from them, and their empire was subjugated and destroyed."
......The Sima clan, a noble family that Cao Cao invited in as advisors,
 eventually gained central control in a power struggle and took over the country.
".........So, they were invited in as advisors,
 ......and they seized control.
 .........*cackle*, ......very interesting.
 ......That Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}......!
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"
"Excuse me!
 ......The {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s have confirmed the disappearance of Genji\'s corpse in the servants\' quarters.
 ......They have started moving towards Lord {f:5:Goldsmith}\'s study!"
"Riiche.
 ......They\'re coming."
"Hmph, ......let them come.
 The {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s......and the Witches of Certainty and Miracles..."
If this is a three‐way fight,
 then the three sides are the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s, the witches, .........and what are we...?
If the object of our protection...is Kinzo\'s illusion...
"......We must be.........the illusions, then.........
 ......Heheh, ......heh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}ehe{0}heh...""......Father, ...it\'s Natsuhi.
 Good morning..."
"There\'s no way he\'ll wake up if you do it like that!
 Father, it\'s Eva!
 Please wake up!
 It\'s an emergency!!"
Eva pushed Natsuhi aside and knocked repeatedly with all her strength.
"Qu‐quiet down...!!
 Don\'t make such a racket...!"
"Do you really think now is the time to be saying something like that?!?!"
"............So he isn\'t picking up the phone, and he isn\'t responding to knocking either.
 What a quandary."
"...H‐...he might be in a foul mood again...
 Kinzo‐san sometimes detects omens in the slightest of changes,
 and gets into a bad mood for reasons only apparent to him..."
"Ho......hohoho...
 Yes, that\'s true...
 This isn\'t something that\'s started today..."
"Does Grandfather really shut himself away in his study that hard?"
"......Yes.
 ......It\'s not uncommon for him to stay in his study for over a month at a time..."
"......Privately speaking, ......even though I work here,
 I sometimes forget that the Master even lives here..."
"Gohda.
 That is not the sort of statement I expect to hear from a servant!!"
"M‐my apologies, Madam... I am truly sorry......"
"Anyway, ...isn\'t it bad if we can\'t get in touch with him?
 I mean, Father might not even know there\'s crimes goin\' on! Right?!"
"......I, I\'m not sure........."
Keenly noticing that people were starting to doubt Kinzo\'s existence, Kanon mumbled his words...
"...............Who was the last person to see Father...?
 ......And when?"
"I‐...it was me.
 Last night, ......up until moments before all the fuss of Battler‐kun finding the gold,
 I was reporting the day\'s events to him in the study."
".........So around eleven o\'clock last night."
"......No way around it.
 Let\'s open it up."
"Wh‐what did you say...?!
 This is the family head\'s precious study and research room!
 No one is permitted to intrude without his permission, no one!"
"Who here holds the highest rank?
 Me, remember?!
 I am the third in rank of the Ushiromiya family!
 And if someone must be scolded by Father for opening this door, that will be my responsibility as the highest ranked as well.
 As this is an emergency, I am opening this door.
 You have a key, right? Open it."
"I, ......I believe you know this, but the study door cannot be opened with the master keys."
"Umm, ......the Master recently took away Genji‐sama\'s key as well.
 He has both keys on his person now.
 ......So, umm......"
".........So, both of the keys that can open this door are inside the study."
"A locked room!
 .........<Good>.
 Things are finally starting to get a little interesting.
 ......If, inside that room,
 Kinzo‐san is lying on the bed with his throat cut, that would be pretty neat."
"That is incredibly inappropriate, Erika‐san!!
 A‐......anyway, as you know, this door can only be opened by the keys that Father has."
"......That means it\'s impossible for anyone, even a murderer, to so much as touch Father from outside the room!
 So I am certain that the head is perfectly fine...!!"
"That doesn\'t make it okay not to make sure he\'s safe, does it?
 Is it really that important to you not to confirm the safety of the father you respect so much......?"
".........Th‐......that isn\'t what I..."
The atmosphere, which had been so agitated a second ago, suddenly went cold......and an eerie feeling filled the room as everyone stared at Natsuhi.
......They could understand why Natsuhi would protect the study under normal circumstances.
It was understood that she probably didn\'t want to disturb the research of Kinzo, whom she respected,
 and she was therefore trying to keep the unpleasant relatives away.
However, ......this was an emergency.
 People had been murdered.
Natsuhi\'s persistence in keeping things quiet for Kinzo even in a situation like this...
was hard to understand from a rational perspective.
".........The evidence suggests that the crimes occurring on this island are most likely a series of murders following the epitaph.
 ......It\'s probably reasonable to assume that the crimes will continue."
"If we reinterpret the epitaph as outlining this series of murders, that means the crimes will continue further, resulting in a total of thirteen lives being taken.
 .........Do you have any concept of how many victims that would be?"
"......Wait a sec.
 How many people do you think there are on this island?
 ......That\'d be almost everyone..."
"Non, non. You have it all wrong.
 .........To my knowledge, the serial murder resulting in the most deaths in mystery novel history...
was ten people in a well‐known work from England, in which everyone including the culprit died.
 As far as Japanese mysteries go, it\'s probably that famous novel in which an astrologer served as the detective.
 Though there were less than ten deaths in that one."
"......Do you realize?
 If this continues and thirteen people die, it will lead to the most prestigious and gruesomely spectacular accomplishment in the annals of mystery writing:
 the completion of a thirteen‐person serial murder case!
 And if everyone on this island is killed..."
"......Why, that could give it an even greater number of deaths than the world record for serial murder mysteries and Japan\'s record added together,
 making it a historical achievement in the world of serial murder mysteries!
 ......Well? Did you know that, ladies and gentlemen?"
"The culprit of this crime...
...is undertaking an incredible challenge, one that stands to rewrite the record books of mysteries throughout the world and throughout history!
 ......But I\'m sure all of you were well aware of that, weren\'t you......?
 Any mystery lover worth her salt will have read the works of the Queen of Crime.
 And it goes without saying that any Japanese reader has covered the works of the {c:86EF9C:Shin‐Honkaku} genre of mysteries.
 ......Are you sure you\'ve been reading enough, everyone?
 *giggle*giggle*, *cackle*cackle*cackle*........."
"............That\'s no good."
"Oh.........?"
"Looks like you haven\'t read enough yourself."
"Did I say something wrong...?"
Erika, who had been chatting away happily all by herself up until a second ago,
 changed her expression into a displeased glare in an instant...
"About Japanese mysteries.
 ......Prior to Shin‐Honkaku, a writer of the Shin‐Gesaku school wrote a different work that also qualifies."
".....................
 .....................Th‐
.........the number of people was the same in both."
"They tie for the record, but if you pay attention to the fact that the Shin‐Gesaku novel asked its readers to search for the culprit, it\'s a far more fitting example.
 If you know so much about this, shouldn\'t your examples have been based on more than simply the number of victims, like perhaps the approaches of each work?"
"............nn,
 ...............khh."
Erika glared at Battler with an expression that couldn\'t be fully described with the word "shock",
 and her arms shook as she stood there, lost for words......
"Ahahahahahahaha, kyaahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!
 Oh my god, she\'s so laaame, this is priceless!!"
"Well, I mean, who can blame her, right?
 Shin‐Honkaku is so much more famous where mysteries are concerned.
 It\'s easy to overlook that there were murder mysteries among the Shin‐Gesaku novels.
 Aaahhi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hhya{0}ha{0}ha{0}haahh!!"
{f:5:Lambdadelta} kept on hitting the table with both hands, overcome with laughter.
Even {f:5:Bernkastel}, who had been enduring the humiliation,
 suddenly snorted and started pounding the table and laughing in the same way.
"Pfft,
 ..........hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaah!!
 This is just too good!!
 Giihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihiii!!
 .........Not bad, Battler\'s piece.
 Gahihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hya{0}hah{0}haa{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhh!!"
".........I\'m impressed.
 ......Battler‐san, ......you must be quite the reader."
"Of books?
 Nah, I\'m no reader, not at all."
".........You liar.
 ......You\'re clearly...
...quite well‐read."
"I\'d never be so arrogant as to say I {i:read}.
 ......I don\'t even get through a hundred books a year.
 Someone like me should think twice before calling themselves a reader......"
"Y‐......you miserable......piece........."
"A‐......ahem.
 ...A‐anyway, we can\'t let this turn into a massive crime like that...!!"
"That\'s right.
 At any rate, checking Dad\'s safety is our first priority right now.
 But what should we do?
 He\'s ignoring the phone and our knocking. The keys are inside.
 There\'s nothing we can do.
 Are we supposed to knock this thick door down?
 ......That won\'t be easy."
"Father might have been attacked by someone and severely injured, and maybe he\'s waiting for someone to help him.
 ......These are extraordinary circumstances.
 Even Father will understand.
 And if he has any rebuke, I\'d be happy to take responsibility myself."
".........B‐but...
breaking down the door would be...
a‐altogether too rude......"
"What about the windows.........?"
"Th‐......that\'s right.
 The windows.
 ......Is there a ladder somewhere which can reach up to the third‐floor windows?
 We should be able to get inside by smashing the glass...!"
Erika finally gathered herself together and her tone regained its decisive edge.
"The third‐story window...? Th‐that would be dangerous......"
"We won\'t know unless we try.
 Is there a ladder around here that can reach up to the third floor?"
"I don\'t think the ladder in the gardening shed is long enough......"
"......Oh, then what about the ladder in the boiler room?
 I remember using it some time ago when a bird made its nest on top of the rain gutter...!
 Yes, that would do the trick! Without a doubt!"
He must have been extremely happy about thinking of something Kanon hadn\'t.
Looking pleased with himself as though he had won something, he glanced around at everyone.
He was probably hoping that Natsuhi would praise him, but she quickly avoided his gaze...
Of course, Kanon had known about that ladder too.
......However, in order to protect Kinzo\'s secret, he had intentionally pretended to have forgotten......
"But with this weather and the strong winds...
 Isn\'t this just too dangerous......?"
"I agree.
 If one of us gets seriously injured, we won\'t even be able to go to a hospital until tomorrow...!"
"......The wind might not be as strong in the courtyard.
 I think it\'s at least worth it to take a look."
"I must say, getting up to the third floor will be quite a challenge...!
 Back when we had to clean away the bird\'s nest, most of the servants shrank away from the danger.
 And that\'s when I, your humble servant, took it upon myself to accomplish the task.
 Uha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha...!"
"Right, then there\'s no problem!
 We\'ve got a ladder tall enough..."
"And someone who\'s proven he can use it."
"............Ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha,
 .........huh?"
Because the courtyard was surrounded on all four sides, while the rain was fierce, the winds had almost no effect.
Fortunately, the roof jutted out a bit, so even the rain wasn\'t so bad.
"Alright.
 Let\'s try standing the ladder up.
 ......Be careful.
 Don\'t hurt yourself."
"Sure..."
Rudolf and Battler carried the special ladder, which was designed for work on high places.
Two umbrellas followed the pair.
{n}Shannon and Kanon were holding umbrellas and sheltering Rudolf and Battler from the rain.
"We don\'t care about getting wet.
 Go back under the eaves.
 ......Gohda‐san!
 Your knees might be acting up, but you can at least hold a ladder down, right?!"
"Y‐yes, yes, sir...!
 If only I had enough Hyaluronan, going up a ladder would be no problem at all... ...I am truly sorry..."
Gohda rushed up to replace Shannon and Kanon.
{n}Kyrie giggled as she watched him.
"Dad, hammer."
"Cool.
 ......Battler, do you like athletics?"
"Not as much as I love my cool handyman of a dad{p:0:♪}"
"You little brat.
 .........Sheesh, I guess I need to show this son of mine my good side every once in a while.
 Battler, Gohda‐san.
 Hold that ladder down tight.
 And make sure you\'re looking up, okay?
 My hand might slip and you\'ll have this hammer tumbling down on you."
"Don\'t worry.
 I\'ll catch it and smash your head in."
Rudolf put the hammer meant for breaking the window into his pocket.
 Then, after cracking his knuckles, he started climbing the ladder......
"Will Rudolf‐sama......be alright......?"
"He\'ll be fine.
 That guy could be in an action movie.
 Plus, sports are one of his strong points."
"......I wish you\'d tell me how my skating prowess is supposed to help me climb ladders...
 ......{p:0:♪}I am Ina Bauer, always in danger...or whatever."
"{c:86EF9C:He never dies}, so he\'ll be fine.
 ......Anyway, we\'re really lucky that the shutters aren\'t down.
 Isn\'t it standard practice to lower the shutters to Father\'s study at night?"
"I‐it is.
 When we\'re permitted to enter, we open the shutters in the morning and close them at night."
"......However, the Master told us that there was no need for the time being, so I think they were left open."
"I see.
 ...............Father will be pretty mad, won\'t he?
 ...If his son smashes his window and comes in while he\'s sleeping."
"......Well, ...probably......"
"It would be wonderful if we didn\'t have to smash the window, don\'t you think?"
"........................"
Both Shannon and Kanon...knew that Kinzo no longer existed in this world.
Natsuhi had ordered them to interfere as much as possible,
 ......but now that it had come to this, there was nothing that the two of them could do.
......They had tried to interfere by pretending that they didn\'t know about the ladder that could reach up to the third‐floor window...
But because of Gohda\'s showing off, that ladder had been found...
Rudolf carefully climbed the ladder.
......He would reach the third‐floor window very soon.
As he did this,
 ......Shannon and Kanon stared at him, looking uneasy......
What would happen after this?
To the two of them.
 To Madam.
 ......To the Master.
......Very soon, Rudolf would reach the window.
"......So, the barrier around this room is giving way at last."
"Hahah.
 The soldiers are scaling the castle walls.
 Truly, we stand only moments from the fall of the keep.
 .........I am prepared to be erased at any moment."
"We can\'t let that happen.
 You have to remain alive, even if it means crawling through the dirt.
 ......I\'ll think about what comes next.
 Escape from this place for now."
"That is easier said than done.
 ......Eva and the others are still in position in the hallway and Rudolf is approaching the window.
 There\'s no way of retreat through either."
"In that case, perhaps you could hide under the bed."
"......Hmph.
 So I am not even permitted to await the enemy\'s arrival seated on my throne?"
"You might have done that while you were still alive.
 However, you are now a ghost that Natsuhi and I brought to life.
 Ghosts should do what ghosts do best and hide under the bed or in a closet."
"Will something like that really fool them...?
 ...So it comes to this."
".........Don\'t worry.
 I\'ll be with you.
 I\'ll get you out at the last moment."
"It\'ll be dangerous for you.
 Even though you\'re a demon, you won\'t get away unscathed if you\'re burned by the anti‐magic toxin."
"Don\'t worry about that.
 .........Anyway, I need things to get at least that bad before my heart starts pumping."
"How reassuring.
 ......Very well.
 I\'ll hide under the bed."
".........Milady.
 Rudolf will reach the window very soon."
"Gaap.
 I\'ve changed my mind. I will guard this place.
 Hide yourself along with Ronove."
"What did you say...?
 This was not the plan.
 We planned to leave this place to Gaap and have you retreat, Milady."
Even though Ronove should have been used to her fickleness, this surprised him for the first time in a long while.
......Though Beato was the powerful queen, she was also an important piece that should not be exposed to danger.
Though she was strong, running to the front lines without any plan would not be a praiseworthy move.
"What kind of whim is this...?
 ....................."
"It\'s just a whim.
 I\'m not so fond of boredom that I could simply sip tea while leaving everything to you...!
 I\'ve just gotten the urge to jump into the struggle right away...!"
"........................
 ......OK.
 It is your game.
 You do what you want.
 I\'ll keep a close watch over the first twilight corpses I erased to make sure nothing happens to them."
"Sorry for stealing your time to shine."
".........Are you certain about this, Milady?"
"You know that I love attention more than my three meals a day.
 I\'ve done nothing except gobble up Gaap\'s turn on the stage.
 Don\'t pay it any mind...!"
......Ronove and Gaap were both silent.
{n}The two of them had already noticed.
Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}, who used Furudo Erika as a piece, was a terrifying opponent.
......This fight would probably be terrifying as well.
{n}Beato couldn\'t expose Gaap, her friend, to this danger......
Beato bluffed and said that this wasn\'t the case,
 but Ronove and Gaap had already figured it out.
Therefore, after confirming Beato\'s resolve one last time and seeing that she was completely firm in her decision,
 ......they nodded in silence and accepted it.
"OK.
 ......I\'ll leave this up to you. I\'m rooting for you.
 .........Take care."
"Indeed.
 Feel free to stand back and watch my performance...!"
"......Lady {f:5:Bernkastel} will probably start trying to expose Kinzo\'s absence with a locked‐room argument.
 ......Fights in a locked room are normally Gaap\'s area of expertise.
 ......Queens rule the battlefield because they are best at fighting in wide open areas.
 ......This won\'t be an easy fight."
"I\'m fully aware of that.
 I currently serve Natsuhi.
 It would not be right for me to delegate her peril to Gaap and callously watch from safety."
"............Understood.
 ......I wish you luck in your battle."
"Be careful...
 ......If it becomes a complete locked room, we won\'t be able to come in and help you."
"I\'ll laugh at them a bit, and if things get bad, I\'ll just grab Kinzo and run for it.
 It\'ll be easy.
 With the door and the window, the past and the future to choose from, there are plenty of places to run to.
 Of course I won\'t let this become a locked room."
"......Though you won\'t see us, we\'ll be cheering you on from very close by.
 ......Good luck."
"Mm."
Gaap and Ronove became a swarm of gold butterflies and disappeared,
 and Kinzo melted into the darkness beneath the bed.
Then, Beato also became a swarm of gold butterflies and melted away inside the study...
After that, all figures and signs of life had disappeared from the study, and it once more regained a silence as though no one had been there from the beginning...
Then, ......Rudolf\'s outline slipped into view from beyond the window\'s curtain.
"Dad...!!
 If you\'re there, answer!
 Daaad!"
As he yelled, he hit the window.
His foothold was so uncertain that just hitting the window felt life‐threatening.
But of course, this was Rudolf, the show‐off.
Deciding that he couldn\'t show himself up with so many people watching from below, he suppressed the fear from being so high up...
and boldly knocked on the window.
".........Come on, Grandfather... Can\'t he hear...?"
"I, I wonder...
 I hope he doesn\'t drop the hammer..."
"How many seconds have passed?"
"......It\'s been thirty seconds since he knocked on the window."
"So,
 ......he\'s really going to...
sm‐
......smash it?
 Umm, the Master...will be very angry..."
"There\'s one person who\'s been kind enough to brag about how accepting that anger is her duty, so there\'s no need to worry.
 ......Rudolf‐san!
 That\'s enough. Do it...!"
"Sure...!
 .........Dammit Dad, you better not complain after I smash it."
He hit it several times, and eventually, a fist‐sized hole opened up in the glass.
Because of his unstable footing, this took a lot of effort...
Using the end of the hammer skillfully, he brushed aside the now fractured bits of glass and opened the hole further,
 stuck his hand through it, and unlocked the window.
Then, after a hard struggle, he somehow managed to open the window, and his body slipped through into the study.
After that, he flopped onto the floor, using his entire body to enjoy the relief of having a ground under him.
".........Dad! It\'s Rudolf.
 Answer me!"
It wouldn\'t be an exaggeration to say that Kinzo\'s study was a small villa he had created inside the mansion.
A study.
 A book archive.
 A place to sleep.
 And a bathroom and washroom.
{n}It was divided into multiple rooms.
......Indeed, with all this at your fingertips, it wouldn\'t be hard to spend your days in this study without ever leaving at all.
The bed was empty.
{n}There were marks on it which made it seem as though someone had slipped out, but there was no one in sight.
"......They do this a lot in ninja movies.
 "The bed\'s still warm! They can\'t have gotten far!" Just like that."
Rudolf tried placing his hand on the bed, but he couldn\'t feel any heat at all.
Not only was there no heat......it felt completely ice cold.
And the bed wasn\'t the only thing that was ice cold.
......The air inside the room......and even the presence about it, if that\'s the right word for it,
 ...even that felt ice cold.
To Rudolf, it felt as though Kinzo had slipped out of this room a long time ago...
"......It\'s very clean.
 There are signs it\'s been lived in.
 ........................"
Wrinkles in the bed.
 The slight angle of the chair.
Here and there, there were many marks that would doubtlessly have been cleaned or fixed up if someone had come in to make the beds.
"As far as I can tell off the top of my head, Dad must have slipped out of bed several hours ago at the latest..."
That placed it in the same general time period as the brutal series of murders.
......It didn\'t seem possible to say that Kinzo\'s absence was completely unrelated to the crime.
Having reached a dead end for now, Rudolf leaned out of the window,
 and told Kyrie and the others in the courtyard to come back up since he was going to unlock the door.
Then, he pushed the button on the study desk and released the door\'s auto‐lock.
There was a heavy clunking sound, and Natsuhi and the rest dashed in immediately...
"F‐......Father...... Good morning..."
"Sorry, but it isn\'t Dad.
 ......I\'m the one who opened it."
".........Was Kinzo‐san there?"
"Nope.
 ......There are signs he slipped out of bed, but no way to tell when that was."
"And Natsuhi nee‐san was the last person to meet him, right...?
 At around eleven o\'clock last night.
 I wonder if that means he slipped out of the study sometime after that and went somewhere else..."
"W‐......well......
 B‐but Father is a fickle man...
 Many times, he has bolted awake in the middle of the night saying that he had a revelation in a dream,
 and walked around the mansion.
 Isn\'t that right, Doctor Nanjo...?"
"Nn, ......y‐yes, that sort of thing has happened before...
 ...As you say, ......he is, erm, a fickle fellow.
 R‐right, Kumasawa‐san...?"
"...Hoh, ...hohoho.
 That\'s true...
 He might have had some sort of strange dream and slipped out of bed...
 That happens a lot, yes......"
"Then where\'d he slip off to...?!
 Isn\'t there a good chance...Father\'s been caught up in this crime?!"
"............You see?
 We should have checked to make sure Father was safe from the beginning, shouldn\'t we?"
"...nn....................."
"We can\'t be sure he isn\'t in this room.
 Maybe the culprit tied him up and locked him in the closet or something like that."
".........Just what I was thinking.
 Let\'s conduct a search."
"Th‐......the head treasures this study...
 It will not do to have you pawing all over it...!"
"Oh, that\'s right.
 I have an announcement for our guilty party."
When Natsuhi heard this said from right in front of her, her heart froze.
......But Erika had only just happened to be standing right in front of Natsuhi when she said it.
 She had directed her words to the room at large.
......She hadn\'t been speaking to Natsuhi in particular.........
Natsuhi turned her back on Erika, trying to make it so that her faltering expression wasn\'t noticed...
"......My memory is photographic in every detail.
 If any attempt is made to hide evidence or alter the scene, I will know at once.
 ......Please don\'t commit some stupid blunder here and disappoint me.
 Don\'t you agree that any whodunit in which the culprit is unmasked by way of some silly mistake or slip of the tongue is dreadfully third‐rate?"
"............I, ...I don\'t understand what you\'re talking about, but I\'ll ask you to refrain from imprudent remarks.
 ......Father, are you there...?!
 Please answer me...!"
Natsuhi started walking around and calling out in a loud voice, refusing to let Erika say any more.
There was a knock.
 Kyrie and the others who had gone down to the courtyard had returned.
"No sign of Father, I assume?"
"He might be tied up and shut away somewhere around here.
 We were just about to start searching for him."
"............I\'m amazed he can keep himself locked up in a place like this for so long."
"..........................."
"......Give it up, Nee‐san.
 ......We can\'t change anything now."
"I wonder......what Madam plans to do......"
"......Get paid back for all the lies she\'s told up until now."
".........Shh.
 ...Let\'s leave fate in God\'s hands."
"Y‐.........yes......"
".................."
Many people traipsed around Kinzo\'s vast study, looking here and there.
Inside the closet and in the bathtub.
{n}Even in the refrigerator and under the study desk.
......They looked everywhere, almost as though they were "it" in a game of hide‐and‐seek.
......However, not only were they unable to spot Kinzo, they couldn\'t even find a single suspicious mark...
"I‐it seems clear that Father isn\'t here.
 ......That\'s enough.
 I ask you all not to disturb Father\'s precious study any further."
"Yes, yes...
 There\'s nothing the Master hates more than having things moved around without his permission..."
"Father\'s nowhere to be found.
 .........Maybe he really was caught up in the crime...?"
".........Th‐though we can\'t be sure of that..."
Natsuhi averted her gaze once more.
"......It\'s alright, Natsuhi."
"......We truly do have our backs against the wall...
 On the off‐chance that someone entered the study, I had planned to talk my way out of it by saying that he had probably gone for a walk somewhere.
 ......However..."
"Hmph.
 No one would believe that I was enjoying a casual midnight stroll in a mansion where a murder has occurred and many people have been killed.
 Though I wouldn\'t put it past myself to do such a thing."
"Come now, Kinzo.
 Be a good boy and stay hidden under the bed.
 ......It\'s alright, Natsuhi.
 Remain calm.
 .........You can prove that someone exists, but you can\'t prove that they don\'t exist."
"In other words, the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} world is one in which regardless of whether something exists or not, you can make it "exist".
 ......And the shadows in which you can make it "exist" form the world of us witches and the world of demons and devils."
"......You mean...the Devil\'s Proof."
"Yes.
 .........So don\'t worry.
 The power of demons will most certainly protect you."
".........If it could protect the honor of Father and my husband, ...I would gladly sacrifice this body of mine to demons."
"Your resolve is good.
 ......Don\'t be anxious.
 I won\'t allow them to {i:kill Kinzo}."
At that moment, a dry sound suddenly rang out twice.
Erika had clapped her hands, seeking everyone\'s attention.
Though such an action should have been above a guest\'s place,
 for some reason, it already felt like a natural right of hers.
......After all, she was the "detective".
".........I think that\'s enough.
 Ushiromiya Kinzo‐san is nowhere to be found in this study."
"Yeah, we\'ve searched every possible hiding spot.
 Dad\'s nowhere to be seen."
"And we haven\'t found anything out of place."
"Yes, we didn\'t find anything at all."
Erika said it again.
{n}They hadn\'t been able to discover anything......
"In that case, we mustn\'t continue to loiter in this room.
 Do you understand how angry Father would be if he learned that so many people were looking through his study...?!"
"Eva‐san,
 you said that you were prepared to take responsibility, didn\'t you?
 I hope you\'re prepared to be disowned for life...!"
"Th‐that\'s for Father to decide...!!
 Not you!!"
"Quiet down.
 .........I\'d like to assemble the facts as we know them.
 At eleven o\'clock last night, the last person to meet Kinzo‐san in this room was Natsuhi‐san, correct?
 Can anyone confirm that?"
"......Confirm...?"
"Yes, that\'s right.
 After all, the only one who claims that Natsuhi‐san really did stop by here at eleven o\'clock last night is Natsuhi‐san herself.
 A confirmation from Kinzo‐san that Natsuhi‐san did indeed come here last night would have sufficed,
 but his absence is the very issue under question."
".........Alibis are the foundation of a mystery, correct?"
"Yes, that\'s right.
 Alibis are important.
 Of course, they\'re almost useless when it comes to the actual theory‐making,
 but it\'s common courtesy to be particular about this kind of thing."
"Heh.
 ......You didn\'t ask for alibis regarding last night\'s murders, but you\'ll do it for Grandfather\'s disappearance, huh?
 ...You really are unpredictable."
"Oh, don\'t worry.
 Regarding the murders of the first twilight,
 have no fear that I will fully examine everyone\'s alibi for that as well later."
".........So, can anyone confirm that Natsuhi‐san visited here at eleven o\'clock?
 If no one can, we\'ll be forced to doubt whether Natsuhi‐san really was the last person to spot him."
"......A‐are you saying that I can\'t be trusted?"
"No, no, just the opposite.
 I hope that you aren\'t the culprit.
 After all, that would be {i:dreadfully} dull, don\'t you agree?
 Only the worst third‐rate mysteries have the most suspicious person as the culprit."
"...Natsuhi‐san......is suspicious?
 W‐wait a second.
 What exactly is your argument...?!"
"Yes...!
 Calling Madam suspicious is the height of discourtesy...!!"
"Quiet!!
 Doctor Nanjo, Gohda,
 thank you.
 ......Erika‐san.
 ......I presume you have some basis for the tremendous disrespect you just showed me......?"
"......I do.
 It\'s painfully simple,
 but if you\'ll permit me some TV drama‐quality evidence, I\'ll be happy to oblige."
"............Let\'s hear it."
When Battler glared at her, ......a cold expression rose to Erika\'s face for an instant.
But it was only for an instant.
{n}After smiling peacefully and gazing around at everyone, she started to talk.
She looked just like the main character in a play,
 who had come out onto center stage bathed in a spotlight...
"Think back to this morning.
 Please recall the chaos that followed the murders.
 ......We wanted to inform Kinzo‐san about the crime, but he wouldn\'t come out no matter how many times he was called on the telephone.
 Remember what happened then."
"Anyway, ...isn\'t it bad if we can\'t get in touch with him?
 I mean, Father might not even know there\'s crimes goin\' on! Right?!"
"......I, I\'m not sure........."
Keenly noticing that people were starting to doubt Kinzo\'s existence, Kanon mumbled his words...
"............Who was the last person to see Father...?
 ......And when?"
"I‐...it was me.
 Last night, ............up until moments before all the fuss of Battler‐kun finding the gold, I was reporting the day\'s events to him in the study."
".........So around eleven o\'clock last night.
 ...........................Heheh."
Erika chuckled significantly.
"A‐and what\'s your point?
 Ridiculous."
"I think Kyrie‐san probably did that intentionally.
 ......Am I right?"
"..........................."
"Wh‐
...what do you mean...
...by that......?"
"......I figured someone might fall for it."
"Yes.
 Thank you, Kyrie‐san.
 Actually, I was planning to say the same thing, if you hadn\'t done it first."
"......W‐...was the question of who saw the Master last...
really that important...?"
"Yes.
 If we take the circumstances into account, then in response to the question "Who saw him last?",
 it was very odd for Natsuhi‐san to instantly answer "me"."
"Wh‐......why?!
 Madam told the plain, unvarnished truth...!"
"Quiet!!
 Why do you think that was odd...?"
"Why are you so sure that no one else saw Kinzo‐san after eleven o\'clock?"
"W‐......well, ...that\'s because I watched as he went to bed.
 It\'s only natural to assume that he would then sleep until morning,
 and not entertain any other visitors..."
"Considering the circumstances, whoever saw him last was going to be at risk of being suspected of having some kind of involvement with this case.
 ......A normal person in your position, Natsuhi‐san, wouldn\'t say, "I was the last to see him.
 I met with him at eleven o\'clock."
 Right, Kyrie‐san......?"
".....................
 ......Yes, that\'s right.
 ......A normal person would say,
 "I saw him at eleven o\'clock.
 But I don\'t know if I was the last person to see him."
 ......Something like that."
"<Good>.
 .........Identifying oneself as the final witness is usually quite difficult.
 ......That is, unless you know some reason that makes you certain that there couldn\'t have been any other witnesses after you."
"......In third‐rate mysteries, the final witness is often the culprit.
 They killed the victim themselves, so they knew that no one else could have met the victim later on...is how the argument goes."
"Hohoh, ...hohohoho...
 That\'s nothing more than a minor misuse of words...
 It\'s nothing to make such a fuss of and focus on..."
"Yes, yes, that\'s nothing more than nitpicking...
 Aren\'t you jumping the gun a little, suspecting Natsuhi‐san because of a little slip of the tongue like that......?"
"And you mentioned that Madam must have a reason to be sure that no one else could have seen the Master,
 but, of course, Madam has one...!
 She left the room after seeing the Master go to bed!
 Following common sense, it\'s perfectly natural to assume that he probably wouldn\'t meet anyone else until the next morning...!"
"......No.
 That isn\'t natural whatsoever.
 After all, Natsuhi‐san, Doctor Nanjo, and Kumasawa‐san all made this claim a short while ago.
 Please, try to remember."
"And Natsuhi nee‐san was the last person to meet him, right...?
 At around eleven o\'clock last night.
 I wonder if that means he slipped out of the study sometime after that and went somewhere else..."
"W‐......well......
 B‐but Father is a fickle man...
 Many times, he has bolted awake in the middle of the night saying that he had a revelation in a dream, and walked around the mansion.
 Isn\'t that right, Doctor Nanjo...?"
"Nn, ......y‐yes, that sort of thing has happened before...
 ...As you say, ......he is, erm, a fickle fellow.
 R‐right, Kumasawa‐san...?"
"...Hoh, ...hohoho.
 That\'s true...
 He might have had some sort of strange dream and slipped out of bed...
 That happens a lot, yes......"
".........Yeah.
 ......Grandfather often slips out of bed all of a sudden late at night...
 ......That\'s what you claimed."
"<Good>.
 Battler‐san, you have quite an impressive memory.
 .........In other words, it\'s well known amongst the people at the Ushiromiya head house, Natsuhi‐san included,
 that there\'s a chance Kinzo‐san might wake up in the middle of any given night on a whim and wander around.
 On top of that, they were aware that this happened quite often."
"......Isn\'t that odd?
 ...If you knew that Father often wanders around at night,
 there\'s no way you could be certain that he\'d stay in his bed until morning.
 Right?"
"It really is......like a third‐rate mystery.
 A lot of those have this part in the last five minutes where the culprit asks "When did you figure out it was me?"
 and the detective answers..."
"It is, isn\'t it?
 ......That\'s why I feel let down.
 If it turns out that Natsuhi‐san really is the culprit, this will be worse than a TV mystery.
 ......That\'s why I want to clear away the suspicion surrounding Natsuhi‐san as soon as I can.
 I want to make sure that this mystery isn\'t third‐rate before I do anything else."
".........ugh......gah......"
"......There\'s no need to get anxious, Natsuhi.
 She is merely playing with words, a favorite trick of would‐be detectives.
 ......Is it of any consequence?
 How can she possibly use that one statement to corner you?
 In the court of hell, all of the demon jurors will declare you innocent.
 So calm down and don\'t get flustered..."
".........Sure, when you say it like that, it does make Aunt Natsuhi look suspicious.
 ......But to me, it just sounds like you\'re picking holes in whatever she\'s saying for the sake of it."
"But it is suspicious.
 ......I think this is more than enough reason to suspect that Natsuhi nee‐san might be hiding something..."
"Th‐that accusation is entirely false...!
 And you are not being fair, Eva‐san...!!
 You {i:yourself} can testify that I was in fact here at eleven o\'clock...!"
".........Is this true, Eva‐san?"
"........................
 .........Oh, now that you mention it, perhaps it is.
 ......Heheheh, I\'m sorry.
 At the time, I was losing my head because the gold had just been found,
 so I forgot all about meeting Natsuhi nee‐san until just a second ago."
"So, Eva‐san, you can confirm that Natsuhi‐san was a witness at eleven o\'clock?"
"Unfortunately, yes,
 I can attest to part of Natsuhi nee‐san\'s story.
 ......But only the part that she came out of this room."
".........Wh‐what are you implying?"
"Let me tell you what I\'m implying.
 ......No, I\'ve wanted to say this for a long time now.
 ...I really did feel like saying this in the middle of such a tragic murder case would be improper,
 but the timing now is just too perfect.
 .........You know what I\'m talking about, don\'t you?
 ......Natsuhi nee‐san.........?"
The servants gulped and held their breaths...
{n}It seemed that they hadn\'t been able to hide it......after all.........
In the middle of this heavy silence, ......Eva fingered her trump card, and Natsuhi pretended to be calm.
Both space and time grew as heavy as lead...and swallowed up everything...
"How long has Kinzo‐san been gone......?"
Erika\'s words, spoken almost casually,
 tore that atmosphere to pieces like shattering glass......
"......Simply put, we haven\'t seen him once at the family conferences this year or last."
"That\'s right...
 We\'ve suspected it since last year.
 ...Seeing as how my son and the others have just been killed, this may not be the time or place to pursue this.
 ......But there\'s a chance that this has something to do with the crime, so we will do just that..."
"It\'s possible that you have a motive for hiding Father\'s death.
 ......We can suspect that you\'re embezzling Father\'s assets."
"If Father were to die, an investigation would be conducted for the distribution of the assets and your embezzlement would be exposed.
 That\'s why you\'ve been hiding the fact that Father is already dead!!"
".........I see.
 That\'s more than enough for the whydunit.
 This keeps getting more and more third‐rate.
 Aaah, ......how boring."
"I, ......I don\'t know what you\'re talking about...!!
 You accuse me of hiding the death of the head?!
 Slander of this nature is...absolutely unforgivable!!"
"That\'s right...!!
 In addition to Madam, the other servants take care of the Master on a daily basis, and they see him all the time...!!
 Genji‐san, Shannon‐san, and Kanon‐kun...!
 Even Doctor Nanjo and Kumasawa‐san meet with him often...!"
"......P‐perhaps because he doesn\'t trust me, I haven\'t seen him even once since last year, but..."
"Be quiet, Gohda!!!"
"Eek!!
 M‐my apologies...!"
"All of the witnesses besides Natsuhi‐san are servants she employs.
 ......You paid them to corroborate your story... Ohh, this really is third‐rate. What a waste of time.
 .........I\'m disappointed, Natsuhi‐san.
 I think it\'s time I concluded this now."
"C‐.........concluded what......?!"
"Ushiromiya...Kinzo‐san."
".........What is it, ...uninvited guest?"
"You don\'t exist.
 ......You\'re a ghost whose death was concealed by people who didn\'t want it known due to the inheritance problem."
"......Hmph.
 ......Heheheheheheheh."
"If you\'re a ghost, you should pass on quickly to the next world as ghosts are meant to.
 ......Oh, where are my manners, this is the first time we\'ve met and I\'ve yet to give you a proper greeting."
"......Good day, pleased to meet you.
 And goodbye!!!"
Beato\'s pipe......
stopped mere millimeters from Erika\'s face, so close that you might just barely have been able to wedge a single sheet of paper between them.
"And good day from me.
 ......Ushiromiya family alchemist, {f:5:Beatrice} the Golden.
 I shall be your opponent in this fight from here on out."
"Glad to meet you. I\'m the detective of this game, Furudo Erika.
 It\'s a pleasure to make your acquaintance.
 And soon, to bid you farewell."
"So, you\'re Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}\'s next piece after Ange.
 ......I\'m afraid I didn\'t get to fight with her to my satisfaction in the end.
 It pleases me that we can test wits at last,
 piece of Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}...!"
"............My master is almighty and all‐powerful.
 A fool like you couldn\'t even begin to compare with her.
 I accept your challenge."
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*.
 You really are calm.
 ......Even though a witch has appeared before you and is about to fight with magic and fantasy.
 .........If you were Battler, you\'d be on your knees wailing that this isn\'t a mystery anymore."
"Well, parallel worlds like this are popular even within the mystery genre these days.
 Are you familiar with that detective who reasons from an armchair in a meta‐like space?"
"Mind your anachronisms. That author doesn\'t make his debut until next year."
"You certainly are picky for a witch."
"Hahha!!
 You think yourself a witch\'s equal?
 Don\'t be so conceited, you miserable little {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}!!"
Beato snapped her fingers, and something bounced around the room at terrifying speeds...!!
It was the witch\'s stake.
 The witch\'s wedge which contained the power of the blue truth within it...!
Of course, a mere {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} like Erika couldn\'t follow its terrible speed with her eyes.
Erika understood this, so she didn\'t attempt to look every which way stupidly trying to spot it.
"You slowpoke!!
 Take this!!"
With a terrible sound, Lucifer\'s blue stake buried itself into Erika\'s right collarbone.
It shot all the way through and out of her back.
Spinning as she rebounded off the walls, Lucifer landed in front of Beato,
 and disappeared, laughing shrilly.
Erika wasn\'t blown back.
{n}However, a blue wedge was stuck deeply into her.
".........So this is that so‐called blue truth.
 Well then, let me hear your opinion."
"{p:2:You can\'t eliminate the possibility that Natsuhi met with Kinzo at 11 p.m.
 In the six‐plus hours between then and the time you all barged into the study, Kinzo had every opportunity to escape!
 Because of this, you can\'t state decisively that Kinzo doesn\'t exist}."
Beato announced that with an expression worthy of her title as witch.
{n}Erika, on the other hand, was silent.
......Was she too shocked to speak?
There was no anguish in her expression.
{n}She was just quietly listening to Beato\'s blue truth.
No, ......judging by her disdainful expression,
 it would probably be more appropriate to say that Beato\'s words went in one ear and out the other.
".........<Good>.
 Begin with the orthodox.
 .........By the way, this thing really is stuck good.
 It won\'t come out."
She tried pulling from the front and the back of the blue wedge that pierced her, but it didn\'t budge an inch.
However, her indifferent, relaxed expression didn\'t budge an inch either.
"You can\'t take it out!
 ......The blue truth can only be broken by the red truth.
 ......And as you are a guest who came to this island a day ago at most, there exists no truth that you could possibly know!
 There is no red available to the likes of you...!
 In other words, this is checkmate!!"
"......I see.
 This is one of those spaces.
 ......In that case, I\'ll need a piece suitable for fighting a witch.
 ......I am the detective.
 Let it be my role to deal with the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} culprit.
 You are a witch.
 ...There is a piece better suited to the role of dealing with witches and demons."
"Allow me to introduce you.
 .........Miss Dlanor.
 It looks like it\'s your turn."
"D‐.........Dlanor...!!!"
"Ahhahahahahahaha!!
 I knew it, I was certain you\'d bring that piece in sooner or later...!!
 The ten witch‐hunting wedges, the archbishop of witch hunting, Dlanor!!"
"There\'s no more fitting piece for a battle against devils and demons.
 I have my double, Erika, and the greatest natural enemy of witches, Dlanor."
"I\'ve now taken control of the seventh rank with my two rooks.
 ......And now you\'ll entertain me, {f:5:Lambdadelta}. And you too, {f:5:Beatrice}.
 As I watch you struggle and scramble to no avail.
 ......*giggle*, ahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haa{0}ha{0}haa{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!"
The air shone brightly, and the piece Erika had guided there showed its form...
It was a form that resembled a cleric, perfect for confronting an evil witch......
"Pleased to meet {f:5:you}.
 Dlanor {nobr:A. Knox} is my {f:5:name}."
Even though the atmosphere in this space could be cut with a knife,
 she introduced herself in a neat and frank manner.
......Her out‐of‐place appearance, completely different from those of the demons and witches,
 felt blatantly odd and had a kind of severity to it.
"......This is the first time I\'ve met you, but I\'ve heard all the rumors.
 Therefore, this truly doesn\'t feel like a first meeting."
"The same goes for {f:5:me}, Miss {f:5:Beatrice}.
 Eiserne Jungfrau has a detailed file on you 600 pages {f:5:long}.
 I always look over those, so this doesn\'t feel like a first meeting to me {f:5:either}."
"The secretary of hell could summarize those 600 pages in a mere six letters."
"Allow me to {f:5:ask}."
"‘Danger’."
"That\'s a good {f:5:summary}.
 When I get back, out of respect to you, I will close out your file with an additional two letters for a total of {f:5:eight}."
"<Executed>."
".........So I\'m <cute> now, *cackle*!
 Flattery will get you nowhere, my guest...!"
"Then let us {f:5:continue}.
 Miss {f:5:Beatrice}.
 I, Chief Inquisitor Dlanor, do humbly accept my role as your {f:5:opponent}."
"I\'ve already completed my first move.
 If you can\'t remove the blue wedge from that Furudo Erika over there, then you might as well trudge back up to heaven,
 and get back to your usual boring job of stamping things!"
"......Take care of this wedge or whatever it is, please.
 {f:5:Beatrice}‐san seems to think that this is all it takes to achieve checkmate."
After making a show of tapping the blue wedge that pierced her with her finger,
 Erika shrugged as though taunting {f:5:Beatrice}.
"......B‐{f:5:Beatrice}..."
"It\'s alright. I\'m just going to toy with her a bit.
 ............After all, if things get bad, I can take Kinzo\'s ghost and flee from here whenever I want.
 I can leave this room at any time and go anywhere."
"That is {f:5:useless}."
"......Hoh?"
"Encountering me is equivalent to your {f:5:demise}.
 There will be no {f:5:escape}. No one can evade {f:5:me}."
"As you say, there\'s always the possibility that Father bolted awake and went off somewhere.
 .........But you know what? I can state for certain that such a thing couldn\'t have happened.
 Heheheh, you know why?"
"O‐of course I don\'t...!
 Are you saying that you stood outside this door all night, watching to make sure the head didn\'t take a step outside...?!"
"Yes, someone was watching.
 This little guy right here!!"
"For your attention: I beg to inform you of the following.
 Be advised that entering or exiting through this door is impossible.
 Guards, you are hereby ordered to blockade the study door."
The doors to heaven opened with a strong, unrelenting radiance like the sun\'s,
 and Dlanor\'s subordinates appeared.
Their words were clad in the red truth and cut off the witch\'s method of escape.
"Chiester410, right here!"
"Chiester45, right here!
 It has been some time, Great Lady {f:5:Beatrice}!
 We were dispatched in accordance with Alliance Agreement #1516 and a request from the Great Court of Heaven.
 We apologize for the rudeness that is to follow...!"
"We\'ve formed a precision blockade on the study door nyeh.
 I think it\'s best if you stay away from the door nyeh...
 Kihihi!"
"For your attention: I further inform you of the following.
 {p:1:From last night at 23:00 until the present time, the study door was not opened even once}."
"Wh‐......what is that scrap of paper?"
"It\'s a completely ordinary receipt.
 But even so, this mere scrap of paper proves that you lied."
"Last night, when you came out of the study,
 Eva saw her chance and wedged a receipt into the crack of the door to the study...!
 And that fell down just now when Rudolf‐kun opened the door for us...!!"
"Know what that means?
 In other words, from {nobr:11 p.m.} last night until now,
 it\'s impossible that Father could have opened this door!!"
".........Wh‐what\'d you say......?"
"Rudolf.
 The window was locked, right?"
"......Yeah. That\'s why I smashed the glass."
"The other windows are all locked as well.
 They can\'t be locked from the outside by construction...!"
"For your attention: I beg to inform you of the following!
 Be advised that {p:1:the windows were all locked}!
 Guards, blockade all of the windows."
"In the name of Eiserne Jungfrau, the imperial guard is hereby permitted to make use of forbidden weapons."
"Understood, ma\'am.
 All units, clearance granted for use of forbidden weapon: red warheads.
 Transmit activation code!"
"Unya?
 The password doesn\'t work nyeh."
"410, turn caps lock off and try again...!"
"Chiester Troops, precision blockade for study door and all windows complete.
 The Great Lady {f:5:Beatrice} is hereby warned that if anything is caught passing through these physically, conceptually, or by any other method,
 we will fire without warning...!"
"Data link from four Archangel Satellites.
 Homing format: verdict‐model conceptual guidance...!"
"And on top of that, we\'ve got red warheads nyeh.
 Impossible to shoot down, impossible to avoid, impossible to survive when hit.
 ......It\'d smash even Lady {f:5:Beatrice} into little bits nyeh{p:0:♪}"
The Chiester Troops had laid down a pinpoint blockade over the door and all of the windows.
{n}Escape would no longer be permitted through any of these...!
".........My, my.
 ......I should be doing the welcoming, but it seems I am the one being welcomed.
 And a courtesy call with the Chiester Sisters in tow, no less...!"
"For your attention: I beg to inform you that your paths of retreat have been severed!
 Supervisor Dlanor, let us now remove the sin and purify...!!"
"Your work is {f:5:appreciated}.
 .........Miss {f:5:Beatrice}.
 I have had your paths of retreat {f:5:terminated}.
 You cannot leave through the door, nor can you leave through the {f:5:windows}.
 You will find that escape is now {f:5:impossible}."
".........You think you have me trapped with this alone?
 *cackle*cackle*......"
The Inquisitor in Heaven and her subordinates surrounded the witch.
The subordinates used a powerful barrier to cut off Beato\'s methods of escape.
......Demons prefer to fight, and as a result, they sometimes allow their victims to escape.
However, angels prefer to block off passages of escape, and as a result, they eradicate their targets without fail...!
"In other words, from the time you claim you bid him goodnight yesterday...
until the time Rudolf opened the door, this study was a perfect locked room...!"
"In that case, Father\'s gotta be here.
 But we haven\'t seen hide nor hair of him...!!
 Come on, what the hell is goin\' on...?!!"
"Uh, ...gah.................."
"I keep telling you to calm yourself...!
 The thought that I, {f:5:Beatrice}, could be imprisoned merely because the doors and windows are closed is simply laughable."
"...Kinzo, I was planning on playing around, but it seems our guest has no such intentions.
 Let us withdraw before we overstay our welcome."
"Mm.
 I would not hesitate to give up this life of mine, but for Natsuhi\'s sake, I cannot die yet."
Beato waved her pipe and the air was split vertically.
Then, a pitch black gate appeared there and slowly opened.
......It was a warp portal, the same as the pitch‐black holes that Gaap used.
"In my file, it should have said this:
 "She is an elusive phantom,
 appearing and disappearing wherever she desires"...!
 As long as Kinzo has me, it will be impossible to capture him...!"
The pitch‐black gate opened.
{n}That gate led from everywhere and to nowhere.
Both Beato and Kinzo would be sent to a place where no one could catch them,
 a place where no one could set foot, much less chase after them...!
"Th‐...this is the study of the Ushiromiya family head.
 And it is also a room that Father had a direct hand in designing.
 ......Don\'t you agree that there would be nothing strange about him having some mechanism for getting outside without using the door...?"
"...Y‐yes, of course...!
 There would be nothing at all strange about the Master having a hidden door...!"
"A hidden door?!
 Really, and where would we find one of those...?!"
"It\'s a hidden door, so nobody knows.
 ......There are several mechanisms and hidden doors in this mansion that only Father knows of.
 ......No one has seen them first‐hand, but all the people of this mansion know of them in concept. Correct...?"
"Uh, ...ah, ......yes...!"
"......It\'s true that there have been always been rumors about hidden passages only the Master knows of..."
"Th‐that is the sort of trick that Kinzo‐san would love..."
"Hohohoho......
 And they are hidden doors, after all...
 No matter how much people such as ourselves might search, {i:it\'s only natural that we won\'t find them}."
".........I see. It\'s a Devil\'s Proof.
 You\'re saying we can\'t eliminate the possibility that a hidden door exists in this room."
"That\'s nonsense, it\'s all made up...!!
 How dare you stoop to this just because your lie about concealing Father\'s death is about to be revealed...!!"
"Darn right!! Just where in this study is there a hidden door...?!!
 Go on, try provin\' it exists!!"
"{p:2:No proof is required!!
 It\'s a Devil\'s Proof! The existence of a hidden door is impossible to discover or disprove!!
 Therefore, no one can eliminate the possibility that Kinzo escaped from this study through a hidden door}!!"
"{p:1:I will not allow a hidden door to exist in this {f:5:room}}."
Beato\'s blue wedge, which had been fired off as a farewell gift,
 was crushed with a flash of Dlanor\'s longsword, ......and the pitch‐black gate was crushed as well...!
And it wasn\'t just crushed visibly and physically.
From that moment onwards, the warp portal which conceptualized hidden doors had been destroyed forever.
"H‐how can someone like you, who is neither the owner of the study nor the Game Master,
 ......use the red truth......?!
 And what was that?! What do you mean you "will not allow" hidden doors to exist?!"
"It\'s because that\'s what defines a mystery.
 {p:1:Knox\'s 3rd: It is forbidden for hidden passages to exist}.
 You can\'t have any hidden doors in the mystery genre. I\'m terribly sorry."
"In this world, gods other than our God do not exist, and hidden doors do not {f:5:exist}.
 They must not {f:5:exist}. We will not allow them to {f:5:exist}.
 They are a {f:5:blasphemy}."
"......Arrogance enough to shock a witch...
 Hah, how delightfully preposterous...!"
"Ahahahahaha{0}haa{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha...!!
 Here it comes, the ten wedges to pierce witches...!!
 Just like usual, it\'s the kind of irrational argument that I just love to hear...!"
"What a fool.
 The Devil\'s Proof might have been vague enough to let you escape from everything until now,
 but now that you\'re up against Dlanor, that move won\'t work anymore, {f:5:Beatrice}!"
"......As I thought, you\'re no different from any ordinary {f:5:witch}.
 I am {f:5:disappointed}."
"......Beato.
 ...It seems, after all, that this is not an opponent who will allow us an easy escape."
"Please do entertain me, {f:5:Beatrice}‐san.
 ......You should at least serve some tea for your guests.
 It doesn\'t even matter if it\'s third‐rate!"
"How did Kinzo‐san escape from this locked‐room study?
 Educate me with your blue truth...!!"
"......Very well.
 Make sure you don\'t regret it!!"
"{p:2:It\'s possible that, after slipping out the door, Kinzo noticed the trick with the receipt and correctly returned it to its original place}."
"{p:1:That possibility has already been eliminated in {f:5:red}.
 After 23:00, the door to the study was not opened even {f:5:once}}."
"{p:2:Kinzo might have been a marvelous mage and inventor!
 He might have invented a concoction to turn his body to mist and slipped out through the keyhole}!!"
"{p:1:No such substance {f:5:exists}.
 It must not {f:5:exist}}."
"{p:2:Maybe he invented a teleportation device!
 That possibility is impossible to eliminate because of the Devil\'s Proof}!!"
"{p:1:Such a machine does not {f:5:exist}.
 I will not permit it to {f:5:exist}}."
"{p:2:Oh, so you can examine every chemical substance in the world?
 You can rule out the existence of unknown scientific devices?!
 There\'s no way you can, it\'s a Devil\'s Proof!
 You cannot rule out their existence}!"
"{p:1:I will {f:5:repeat}.
 In the name of God, I will not permit such chemicals or devices to {f:5:exist}.
 From now until the end of time, I will not permit them to {f:5:exist}}."
"Even in the future?!
 Oho, so you think you can even deny the possible futures of the human race?!"
"It\'s Knox\'s fourth commandment.
 It is forbidden for unknown drugs or obscure scientific devices to be used."
"The progression of humanity and the techniques and knowledge that the future might bring are for God to {f:5:decide}.
 And their existence has been declared forever {f:5:denied}.
 Therefore, from now until the end of time, I will not allow for such technology to {f:5:exist}. It is not {f:5:permitted}."
Beato and Dlanor had just gone through a massive exchange of red and blue.
......However, not only had Dlanor not taken any damage, she also showed no signs of fatigue.
Beato might have been a fearsome witch, but blood flowed through her veins and she did breathe.
{n}She felt both pain and fatigue.
But Dlanor......was like a doll made of marble.
She felt no fatigue, no pain, no hesitation.
Even if Beato\'s sharp wedges had aimed right for Dlanor\'s eyes, she wouldn\'t have shut them.
......No, it was doubtful whether she ever even blinked in the first place......
"B‐......{f:5:Beatrice}...... Hang in there......"
"......I\'d heard the rumors, but she really is the worst matchup for me.
 ......To think that dreams, hopes, and even future possibilities are forbidden. The arrogance of the gods is overwhelming.
 ......I\'d expect no less from a witch hunt executioner.
 It seems we\'ll never be able to drink together."
Even the strikes which had defeated Battler over and over had absolutely no effect on Dlanor.
......She had expected that already more or less, but she hadn\'t expected to be repelled so easily...
"Quite a formidable opponent..."
"Oh my, so even the great {f:5:Goldsmith} has gotten old and decrepit.
 Hearing those words come out of your mouth is rarer than seeing two comets in the night sky...!"
"Hmph. I\'m not decrepit, I\'m already dead."
"Hah, that\'s true.
 Sorry, but I won\'t let you be for just a little longer."
Beato experienced something she\'d only rarely felt during her entire life.
......It was probably what we\'d call "hardship".
As Natsuhi tried to comfort her, Beato quietly brushed aside her hand,
 and she regained her posture again, showing off her witch\'s pride and her continued readiness to fight.
"Is that {f:5:all}?
 There was no need for me to be {f:5:present}.
 I am {f:5:disappointed}."
"I\'m not done yet. I was just testing a few moves just now.
 I was only trying to measure your abilities."
"It is foolish in the extreme.
 Know your place, Golden Witch."
".........Lady {f:5:Beatrice}..."
Beato\'s expression became tense once again.
{n}No longer was there any trace of mischief.
......The mood changed.
"The time for playing is over.
 Here I go.
 In that case, I shall acknowledge that Kinzo did not enter or leave the study.
 Why don\'t I accept your locked room?"
".........{f:5:Hm}."
"For your attention: I beg to inform you that {f:5:Beatrice} has changed her pattern of attack."
{f:5:Beatrice}, who had until then thoroughly resisted the idea that a locked room existed, did an about face.
She declared that she would accept that proposition.
Of course, this didn\'t mean that she\'d surrendered.
 This was a new attack of Beato\'s.
{n}Dlanor noticed this and readied herself.
"What\'s going on?
 Why did Lady {f:5:Beatrice} acknowledge the locked room when she\'s trying to destroy it nyeh?"
"......Sh‐she\'s probably going to claim that Kinzo existed outside of this room.
 ......Reactivation of the great Lady {f:5:Beatrice}\'s warp portal confirmed!"
"{p:2:Natsuhi claims to have "talked with Kinzo in the study", but she never said that she spoke with him face to face.
 Therefore, if Kinzo was in a location other than the study, there is no contradiction as long as they held a conversation}!"
".........nn—"
After bouncing at an erratic angle, the witch\'s stake pierced the top of Dlanor\'s foot.
"You sure are slow.
 ......Heheheheh, top of the foot, all mi~ne!"
"{p:2:Natsuhi used the internal phone line in this study to speak with Kinzo, who was in another place!
 There\'s nothing strange about Kinzo, who hates the relatives, predicting that they would enter his study and leaving to go elsewhere.
 He might have gone to the hidden mansion, Kuwadorian}!"
The power of Beato\'s blue truth began to dwell in the Stake of Asmodeus piercing the top of Dlanor\'s foot, changing the stake into a blue wedge.
"Not bad, that makes sense nyeh...!"
"......Blue truth, valid!"
A cyclone of gold butterflies swept up with Beato at its center.
{n}......The magical power of the pitch‐black gate that had been smashed was once again refilled.
......If she could hold Dlanor off here somehow,
 this time, she would be able to warp Kinzo out of the study, all the way to Kuwadorian...!
Dlanor moved clumsily, trying to pull the blue wedge out of her foot,
 but it didn\'t even budge.
Of course, Beato didn\'t miss this chance.
{n}No witch would!
"I have more, so prepare yourself.
 {p:2:There\'s a chance that the Kinzo mentioned by Natsuhi does not refer to the person himself!
 The Kinzo spoken of by Natsuhi might have been another name for this room!
 Kinzo had taken refuge in Kuwadorian and was impossible to contact.
 Perhaps Natsuhi called this room "Father",
 and by contemplating inside of it, she felt as though she had received some sort of revelation from Kinzo}!!"
"We\'ve stopped you from moving. You\'ve already lost!"
Beelzebub\'s blue wedge pierced the base of Dlanor\'s neck!
{n}Of course, even this didn\'t cause her to flinch, but her movements were restricted even further.
"......{f:5:Interesting}.
 Is that {f:5:all}?"
"You don\'t call it a full‐course dinner if you stop at the soups and hors d\'oeuvres!
 I\'ll hit you with the main dish and the dessert at once, so watch your stomach explode and die!!!"
"{p:2:Even if, as you say, this is a locked room and impossible to escape from, you can\'t deny the possibility that he is still hiding in this room.
 I\'m not talking about a hidden door! He might be under the bed or above the ceiling!
 He might be hiding in such a subtle blind spot that even a demon would not recognize it}!"
"{p:2:Or, it might be that Natsuhi, ordered by Kinzo to act as his proxy,
 considered herself both his representative and another Kinzo!
 In other words, it\'s possible that Natsuhi was also Kinzo}!"
"{p:2:I\'ve got plenty more!! At eleven o\'clock last night, Kinzo escaped out the window!
 Natsuhi watched him go, then locked the window!!
 This doesn\'t lead to any problems. In fact, it might be the most beautiful blue truth yet}!"
"How\'s that, Dlanor A. Knox?!
 Hyah{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahh!! There are any number of ways to escape from this locked room!!"
"Know your foolishness in trying to oppose my master!"
"There\'s no need for you to argue back."
"Just suffer defeat here and sleep for all eternity...!"
The Seven Sisters appeared from Beato\'s golden tornado one after another, and they pierced Dlanor with blue wedges.
Four blue wedges were buried into her neck, her chest, her gut, and her thigh.
Including the one buried into the top of her foot, she had been pincushioned by five stakes.
"Aaaah, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama!
 What about my turn?!"
"I\'ll use you if I think of any more. Be quiet for now!!
 *cackle*cackle*, how\'s that, Dlanor the witch hunter?!!
 After skewering so many witches in the past and burning them at the stake, how does it feel to have the tables turned and be skewered by a witch?!!
 Heh{0}hi{0}hha{0}hha{0}a{0}ahhha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!"
They were all ridiculous arguments, but they came fiercely one after another.
Though a total of five wedges pierced Dlanor, her expression didn\'t change in the slightest.
However, her movements had indeed been limited...
"Ooh...
 Witches sure are scary nyeh...
 You can\'t beat twisted logic nyeh."
"They don\'t violate the Knox Decalogue...
 They\'re all valid...!"
"..........................."
"...W‐......well done, {f:5:Beatrice}...!
 Even if there was no one in this study and even if it was a locked room, that alone isn\'t enough to deny Father\'s existence...!"
"Against a normal opponent, I\'d think the matter settled by now.
 ......But this is Dlanor, Chief Inquisitor!
 This ruthless woman even killed her father when he violated the Ten Commandments...!
 Kinzo, now!"
"Mm...!"
Now that Dlanor had been pinned down, this was their last chance to recover their magical power and escape.
Once again, a pitch‐black gate began to rise slowly in front of Beato and Kinzo......
Though the gate had once been opened by simply drawing in the air,
 it wasn\'t so easy in the study now, filled as it was with the power of denial.
"D‐......do you see now, everyone?!
 No matter how much you question the state of this study, the truth of Father\'s good health remains unshakeable...!!"
"......Oh, very bold words.
 I suggest you don\'t forget that you and I...
are both also a part of this battle.
 I cannot fight against witches, but I can fight against you."
Erika grinned at Natsuhi with a smile more demonic than a real demon\'s.
"......Natsuhi‐san.
 Let me ask you again.
 ......Are you sure that last night, you spoke with Ushiromiya Kinzo‐san in this room?"
"Y‐yes.
 I have said repeatedly that I reported the day\'s events to him and bid him good night...!"
"This may be a strange thing to ask, but since it\'s needed to prove your innocence,
 please answer me straightforwardly.
 ......Is this Kinzo‐san you speak of the same Ushiromiya Kinzo‐san we are all thinking of?
 It isn\'t a different person or thing with the same name, is it?"
"I, I\'m not really sure what you mean...!"
"......It\'s like this.
 You didn\'t, for instance, start calling this room itself "Father" after Father\'s death, right?
 That\'s what she\'s asking."
"You said you gave a report of the day\'s events to Father before bed, right?
 That doesn\'t mean you were here alone, delivering your report directly to the wall of the study and addressing it as "Father", does it...?"
"H‐how rude!!
 Nothing of the sort happened...!
 Father is Father!!
 He is in good health!
 And I most certainly gave him a report and said good night to him in this room last night...!!
 I\'m not trying to trick you or talk my way out of anything!"
"I see.
 In that case, can you repeat what I tell you to?
 If you aren\'t tricking or deceiving us in any way, you should be able to repeat my words."
"F‐fine.
 I\'ll repeat whatever you want...!"
"Repetition requested.
 "Ushiromiya Natsuhi, at eleven o\'clock last night,
 spoke with Ushiromiya Kinzo in this room, where he was also present"."
"I, I, "Ushiromiya Natsuhi, at eleven o\'clock last night,
 spoke with Ushiromiya Kinzo in this room, where he was also present"!!"
"<Good>!
 Then I\'ll ask one last thing.
 ......Seriously now, Natsuhi‐san,
 you didn\'t do anything such as throwing Kinzo‐san out of the window after your conversation and locking the window behind him, I presume?
 Because everything still makes sense if you did."
"Wh‐why would I send Father out through the window?!!
 This is intolerable! This mockery is intolerable!!"
"For your attention: I beg to inform you of the following.
 {p:1:The "Kinzo" Natsuhi mentions refers to nothing other than Ushiromiya Kinzo}."
"For your attention: I beg to inform you of the following!
 {p:1:Natsuhi claims that she was face‐to‐face with Kinzo in the study at 11 p.m.}!"
"Ah, .........aaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhhh...!!"
Natsuhi let out a cry, but it was too late...
{n}She had completely risen to their provocation...!
The blue wedge to the foot representing a telephone discussion.
The blue wedge to the neck representing the study itself being called Kinzo.
The blue wedge to the gut representing Natsuhi herself being called Kinzo.
The blue wedge to the thigh representing Natsuhi letting Kinzo escape out of the window and locking it afterwards.
The four of them shattered with the sound of thin glass...!
Because Natsuhi, {i:the one who knew the truth,} had denied them,
 those denials had gained the power of the red truth...!
Despite Kinzo\'s absence from this locked room, Beato had introduced five ways that Kinzo could still exist.
Natsuhi had carelessly destroyed the premises behind four of those herself...!!
Only one wedge remained.
In other words, this was the last blue truth which could bury the contradiction of Kinzo existing in the study at eleven o\'clock but not existing there later after it had become a locked room.
There was only the theory that pierced Dlanor\'s chest: "Kinzo is hiding somewhere in this room".
With this theory, even if Kinzo wasn\'t present in this locked room of a study, he could "exist" here...!
If this wedge of Satan\'s were to be crushed, their chances of escaping this room would become hopelessly dim......!
"Gghhh, .........ack...!!
 B‐{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama...!
 Quickly, escape while you still can...!!
 Ggh, gyah......"
Dlanor slowly grasped the final wedge, which still pierced her chest.
......Her vice‐like grip seemed to be causing Satan intense pain as though all the bones in her body were being broken.
"All that remains......is this one {f:5:wedge}.
 It was about Kinzo hiding somewhere in this room, {f:5:correct}?"
"I am the detective, and I have searched everywhere.
 If even I haven\'t found him, just where do you suggest he is hiding? *giggle*giggle*giggle*!!"
With the final wedge still sticking out of her chest, Dlanor slowly approached Beato...
If this wedge was taken out, ......then......!
"Allow me to {f:5:ask}.
 Just where in this study is Kinzo {f:5:hiding}?"
"Heheh, who knows...
 {p:2:Maybe he\'s under the bed}?!"
"{p:1:That possibility was searched and {f:5:voided}}."
"{p:2:Maybe he\'s in the bathtub}!!"
"{p:1:Searched and {f:5:voided}}."
"{p:2:Inside the closet!
 Under the desk!
 Behind the curtains}!!"
"{p:1:Searched and {f:5:voided}.
 {f:5:Voided}.
 {f:5:Voided}}."
"{p:2:Behind the bookshelf,
 behind the closet,
 under the carpet,
 under the floor,
 above the ceiling,
 behind the wallpaper,
 inside the sofa, inside the chair.
 Inside the bed, inside the blankets, inside the walls,
 inside a rock,
 inside a stone,
 inside the room}!!"
"{p:1:Voi{f:5:ded}, voi{f:5:ded}, voi{f:5:ded}.
 Voi‐voi‐voi‐{f:5:dead‐dead‐dead}!
 Voi‐voi‐voi‐voi‐voi‐voi‐voi‐voi‐{f:5:death‐death‐death‐death‐death‐death‐death‐death}!
 <Die the DEATH>!
 <Sentence to DEATH>!
 <Great equalizer is the DEATH>}!!"
No locations would work against Dlanor by this point.
Dlanor took Beato\'s final desperate onslaught head‐on,
 turning everything back with a far stronger power of denial!
Smack them down!
 Beat them down with overwhelming force!!
No longer is there any place in this study for Kinzo to escape to...!!
Beato was blown back like a leaf dancing in the wind,
 knocked around over and over again like an empty can lying on a road.
By now, no matter how many times Beato used the blue truth, it wouldn\'t be able to defeat Dlanor\'s red truth...
"Hahahahaha, ahhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha...!!
 .........You witches are truly pitiful beings.
 ......You just try to talk your way out of things endlessly in an attempt to cover up the truth.
 Let me borrow Dlanor\'s words.
 ......I\'m disappointed, {f:5:Beatrice}‐san.
 ...*giggle*giggle*giggle*!"
"......guh........................ggghh......"
Erika coldly delivered these decisive words to Beato, ......who was crawling on the ground.
"Detective\'s authority.
 The detective has the right to inspect all crime scenes.
 And I have exercised that right.
 Therefore, I can say this."
"Kinzo‐san is not inside this room.
 Furthermore, this room is a perfect locked room.
 From the above two points, I can state this fact:
 This room has been uninhabited all along.
 Natsuhi‐san was lying about having met Kinzo‐san here last night!
 And that is checkmate, {f:5:Beatrice}‐san...!"
"*giggle*giggle*, ......ahahahaha, ahhah{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haa{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!
 What do you think of that?
 All it takes is the presence of this room,
 and a deduction like this becomes trivial for Furudo Erika!
 Your thoughts, ladies and gentlemen?!
 Ahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hah{0}hah{0}hah{0}ha{0}a{0}aahh!!"
At these words, the final wedge shattered,
 and at the same time, the pitch‐black gate which was about to open shattered once again.
This time, the warp portal had been completely destroyed...
No longer would Kinzo be permitted to exist in this room......or escape from it...
Beato struggled to her feet......but that was the best she could do.
{n}She no longer had the energy to fight.
She had taken all of the denying red head‐on from close range.
It was all she could do to withstand the pain, which was so strong it felt like she\'d vomit up all her insides...
Even Beato, who had held a monopoly on the title of strongest and most evil witch all this time,
 ......couldn\'t do a thing against a witch hunter.
No matter how sturdy a sandcastle you build on the beach, it can never win against the rising tide......
".........S‐sorry, Kinzo...
 ......She really is...too tough for me......"
"{f:5:Beatrice}, I thank you.
 ......You\'ve fought so hard for me despite your lingering grudge."
"I guess it\'s true that your life flashes by when you see death coming.
 ......I\'ve remembered how you once looked when you were young.
 .........You were annoyingly like Battler."
"Battler is now carrying on everything, including my soul and the right to lead the family.
 I no longer have any regrets...!"
"............Battler............
 ...My apologies...
 ...Though I swore to fight with you once again,
 ...I must settle my accounts with something like this...
 ......How pitiful..."
"................................."
To Beato, it seemed as though Battler had met her gaze.
{n}......There was no way he could have.
This Battler was the piece Battler.
{n}There was no way he could see Beato in this higher‐level world.
However, his eyes really did meet hers.
{n}Even though they couldn\'t have, .........Beato was sure they did.
As Erika, Eva and the others closed in on Natsuhi, questioning her over and over,
 ......only Battler stood apart from that tumult.
His expression held none of the enthusiasm and excitement that the other humans had.
It just piercingly and coldly surveyed the scene.
And the expression on his face......was a quiet displeasure. Anger.
He wasn\'t feeling compassion for Natsuhi because her lie was about to be exposed.
However, he couldn\'t forgive Erika, who was simply enjoying the "intellectual rape" of cornering Natsuhi,
 or any of the people going along with her.
Then, he whispered softly.
{a:c:
".........No good."}
Beato and the others definitely heard that...
"You don\'t think......Battler might...turn things around from this weakened position......?"
"......I probably could have done it, back in the day.
 ......And Battler can probably do it."
".........Battler..."
"Battler...
 ......If you are indeed the man who will inherit everything from me, ......now is the time to prove it...!
 Don\'t let the legend of the Golden Witch end here......!"
"It\'s true that I met Father here last night!!
 It\'s true!!
 And he spoke to me of the Ushiromiya family\'s glorious history, as well as the burden of bearing it..."
"Your lie has already been exposed, Natsuhi‐san.
 We already know that you were alone in this room last night."
"Would you please give this up now and launch into your confession?
 The culprit\'s refusal to capitulate is proportional to the poor quality of a mystery.
 At least show me that this third‐rate mystery had some redeeming qualities in the end."
".........Yeah, this is no good.
 No goddamn good at all."
Battler, who had been silent off by himself up until then, finally spoke.
At first, it sounded as though he was attacking Natsuhi.
......However, when Erika realized he was glaring directly at her, her expression visibly clouded with displeasure.
"Exactly what......is no good?"
"If the mystery is third‐rate, then so is the detective.
 ......Listen up.
 I\'ll be Grandfather for you."
"......B‐......Battler......?!"
"You\'ll be......Kinzo‐san?
 Are you saying you\'ll become Kinzo‐san to reenact his disappearance from this room?"
"......You can\'t possibly...intend on denying my checkmate...?
 ......That\'s ridiculous!!!"
"......What is this man {f:5:saying}?"
"Hey, new girls.
 .........Is this is your first game here?
 Sorry, but calling checkmate after something like that is no good.
 Yeah, it\'s no goddamn good at all...!!"
"Wh‐what are you talking about, Battler?
 You\'re gonna be Dad......?!"
"Yeah.
 I\'ll reenact it.
 I\'ll become Grandfather and disappear from this room."
"Y‐you can\'t use the windows or the door! How\'re you gonna do it...?!"
"Did you find where the hidden door is?!"
"We don\'t have a clue... Yes, not a clue...!!"
Rustle.
.........That sound wasn\'t just the noise of the onlookers fidgeting.
{n}...It was a provocative chill that ran up Erika\'s spine.
".........I like it.
 Yes, you are after all the Ushiromiya family head, the one who bears the Head\'s Ring.
 That should more than qualify you to stand in for Kinzo‐san.
 .........So let\'s hear your deduction!!"
Erika\'s expression was no longer a challenging smile.
{n}......It was malicious.
 Extremely displeased.
She couldn\'t conceal her anger at having her most pleasurable moment ruined.
"......H‐......how will he...get us out of here......?"
"Heh, ......heheheheh...
 ......I\'ve got it.
 I see, so that move is still available."
"So you finally figured it out, you damn geezer.
 Hidden doors and hiding under the bed...... All that stuff is so pathetic I was almost weeping for you.
 This is {i:the} Ushiromiya Kinzo we\'re talking about here.
 ......There\'s got to be a more thrilling and exciting answer."
"Exactly.
 How pitiful that I couldn\'t even match my own ingenuity.
 And how pitiful that with all these relatives of mine present, the only one to understand me is the grandson who\'s returned after six years of absence.
 .........Battler, you are my acting proxy.
 Do not disgrace my legacy!"
"Sure thing, Gramps!!
 I\'ll teach these guests what the majesty of the Ushiromiya family head is all about!!"
"What are you planning to do...Father...?!"
"Wahhahahahaha!!
 Natsuhi, {f:5:Beatrice}, stand by and watch!
 ......We\'ll show you what it means to be the head of the Ushiromiya family!"
"...That Battler, what is he trying to prove......?"
"There\'s no way he can do anything.
 ......This is a perfect locked room!"
"Aunt Natsuhi, come over here.
 I\'ll tell you how I want you to move."
Battler called Natsuhi over to the window and whispered something to her with his back towards the others...
"......Miss Dlanor,
 there isn\'t a remote chance of a mistake, is there?
 It {i:is} impossible for Kinzo and the witch to slip out of this room, correct?"
"Of {f:5:course}.
 ......Gertrude, Cornelia,
 and the imperial guard,
 double check that the seal of this locked room is {f:5:perfect}."
"For your attention: I beg to inform you of the following.
 Our barrier is perfect."
"For your attention: there are no hidden doors, and escape will not be granted through the door or the windows!
 Guards, if Battler breaks through the barrier, fire your arrows without hesitation!"
"Ch‐Chiester Troops, roger.
 Battler‐sama, prepare yourself...!"
"Escaping from this room...is impossible...!"
".........But he\'ll do it nyeh."
"H‐how...?!"
"He\'s certain he can succeed even without any basis.
 That\'s what it means to be the Ushiromiya head nyeh...!"
"............True.
 Let\'s watch."
"Yeah.
 ...Let\'s see the majesty of Riiche\'s opponent...!"
"Then I\'ll begin."
Everyone nodded and watched Battler\'s every move...
"So I\'m Grandfather, and I was lying in bed like this,
 grunting my understanding of Aunt Natsuhi\'s report or whatever."
Battler laid down on the bed himself.
As if it still mattered now, Erika grumbled about disturbing the crime scene, but no one listened to her.
"Then, I stop answering and fall asleep.
 .........Well, realistically speaking, I probably get tired of all that talking and only pretend to be asleep."
"Ahahahaha! You know me too well...!"
"I, ......I see that Father has gone to sleep,
 ...bow silently, and leave."
Natsuhi lowered her head to Battler, who was still lying down in the bed, and turned around...
Then, she started wandering around, as though doing an inspection of the room.
"......After seeing Grandfather go to sleep, Aunt Natsuhi apparently performs an inspection of the room before leaving."
"Of course, she has Shannon‐chan and the others clean it every day,
 but she still checks it thoroughly herself.
 ......Making sure there was no dust piling up.
 Making sure that he hadn\'t run out of any consumables."
"Y‐yes.
 This is the family head\'s treasured room, so I check everything carefully myself instead of relying entirely on the servants.
 I do this every single time."
".........Th‐that\'s true.
 Madam always checks things very carefully."
"Her inspection is very detailed, and she even checks all of the consumables in the washroom one by one."
"In other words, it\'s not just dust on the windowsill like you see all the time on TV.
 .........She even checks to see that there\'s enough soap and toilet paper in the washroom.
 Pretty devoted, if you ask me. It wouldn\'t kill you to skip a day from time to time."
"Th‐that is my routine.
 I mustn\'t become complacent in my inspection of the head\'s room for even a single day."
"............What is your point?
 Please don\'t waste our time putting on airs."
"*giggle*.
 Isn\'t putting on airs the detective\'s right?"
"Nn, gah, ......{i:I}...am the...d‐detective........."
"Since we\'re inside the study, you can probably tell, but even though we call it a study,
 it wouldn\'t be wrong to call it a second house inside the mansion."
"It has a sleeping room, a study, a washroom, and even a toilet and bath.
 So it\'s not so much a "room"...
as it is a "house"."
"......Thank you for the explanation of the study\'s {f:5:layout}.
 However, the move of having him hide somewhere within it has already been {f:5:defeated}."
"There won\'t be any hiding.
 But I\'m pretty sure there are plenty of blind spots.
 ......For example, if Aunt Natsuhi went into the bathroom to check the amount of toilet paper,
 most of the study would be out of her sight range."
"......In other words, for almost every location in the study, the observer would have disappeared."
"!!
 ......O‐observer disappearance...!
 We\'ve lost track of Kinzo...!"
"For your attention: I beg to inform you that the witch\'s darkness is filling the study."
"Good. ......It\'s being filled with the power of darkness.
 Heh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eheh!"
"And so what if the observer...if Natsuhi left...?
 ......So what?!"
"When Grandfather noticed that fussy Aunt Natsuhi finally leaving, he got up."
"Why?!"
"Wahhahhahhahhahha!!
 On a night of madness such as this, nothing goes better with a drink than enjoying the mad weather of the night sky!!"
"......Because Aunt Natsuhi was in the blind spot of the bathroom,
 it becomes possible for Grandfather to walk about the study at will."
It was possible for him to move without Natsuhi\'s knowledge.
{n}It was possible for him to move without contradicting what Natsuhi knew!
"Warning! Battler is approaching the study door!"
"For your attention:
 a loud noise is produced when the lock on the study door is released.
 Know that {p:1:you cannot leave through the door without drawing Natsuhi\'s suspicion}."
Because Battler had acted as though he was heading for the door, Gertrude, who was sealing the door, immediately issued a warning.
Maybe it was possible for him to leave the study while in Natsuhi\'s blind spot.
......However.
"That\'s right...the sound!!
 We know there\'s a loud sound when the auto‐lock\'s released!
 Even if Natsuhi was in a blind spot inside the study, she wouldn\'t have missed the loud sound of the auto‐lock releasing.
 There\'s no {i:way} she wouldn\'t find that odd...!!"
"For your attention:
 I beg to inform you that {p:1:Natsuhi did not hear the sound of the door opening while in the room}."
The washroom and toilet are very close to the door.
{n}Even if they hadn\'t been, that auto‐lock always lets off such a massive sound.
She\'d be able to hear that sound no matter what.
Natsuhi had already spoken with Erika and the others about the details of the previous night,
 and she had made it quite clear that nothing out of the ordinary had occurred.
The argument that Natsuhi could have failed to hear the lock would not work...!
"For your attention: I further inform you of the following.
 {p:1:Kinzo entering or exiting through the door will not be permitted}."
"For your attention: I beg to inform you that this is a useless struggle!
 It is foolish in the extreme...!!"
".........It\'s true that I can\'t break through the red of that girl by the door.
 .........But what about you over there by the window?"
".........!"
Turning his back to Gertrude, who claimed that leaving through the door was impossible,
 Battler locked his gaze on Cornelia, who stood in front of the window.
"Make sure you hold that barrier of yours up tight.
 ......Or else you\'re gonna be.........{i:sent flying}."
By now, Battler\'s target was clear.
 .........It was Cornelia.
{n}And......it was the window.
He was going......to smash this locked room from the window.
Not expecting to be chosen as the target herself,
 Cornelia was overawed for just a second, but she quickly regained her composure.
Although it was rare, it happened sometimes that a witch struggling to flee would directly target the one setting up the barriers.
And it was always the witch\'s last futile resistance at the brink of death!
"For your attention: I beg to inform you of the following.
 Battler\'s target is you, Cornelia.
 I ask that you be on your guard."
"It is foolish in the extreme!
 God, have pity on this foolish lamb...!!"
"I\'m no lamb.
 ......The head of the Ushiromiya family is an eagle.
 Even if he only has one wing.
 .........Don\'t think you can keep me shut up in this study forever with just a flimsy window like that."
......Starting from a low posture,
 ......both silent and supple,
 ......Battler ran forward like a white leopard.
"............Th‐
......this guy...
...couldn\'t possibly mean to.........!!"
"............!!
 Th‐this is...... .........gh.
 F‐for your attention...!
 There is no way to defeat my red!
 Know that your wish will not be granted...!!"
Cornelia thrust out both her arms and drew a sign.
{n}When she did, a red barrier blocked the way ahead of Battler.
"I beg to inform you that this is useless, Ushiromiya Battler...!
 For your attention: my {p:1:windows are sealed from the inside, and Natsuhi did not help Kinzo to escape}...!!"
"{p:2:I\'m not saying Aunt Natsuhi helped Grandfather escape.
 ......What if Grandfather snuck out, keeping it a secret from Aunt Natsuhi}?!"
"Wh‐why would Kinzo go out the window on his own?!!!"
"On this night of madness, leaping out into the rainy sky...
is but a leisure activity to pair with my drink!!!"
"But this is the third floor! It\'s impossible!!!"
"Even you must occasionally jump the bottom step when going down a flight of stairs, right?
 Three stories is nothing for Kinzo...!"
"I wouldn\'t put it past him."
"Yes, I wouldn\'t put it past him."
"Th‐that\'s...r‐ridiculous......!!!"
Blue cracks appeared in Cornelia\'s red barrier, and it shattered with a crisp sound.
It was all far too quick.
It looked almost as though she\'d gotten out of the way herself in fear of Battler.
"E‐...{ruby:99.9999999...:endless nine}...!!
 Magic resistance, {ruby:99.9999999...:endless nine}!!"
"Cornelia‐sama, you can\'t block it, retreat...!"
At the same time the barrier shattered, the window behind Cornelia\'s back was flung open.
The curtains fluttered for just an instant.
Though it was all filled with rain, the heavens and the courtyard were spread out in front of them...
{n}A fitting exit for an eagle leaping from this locked room!
"Cornelia, reapply the {f:5:barrier}!!"
"As you wish, Supervisor Dlanor!
 Kn‐know that you will not succeed in breaching this window...!!"
Cornelia quickly came back to her senses and set up another red barrier.
......However, this was the last one.
"For your attention: I beg to state the following...!!
 Let us temporarily assume that Kinzo did escape through the window...!
 In that case, how did he lock a window which cannot be locked from the outside?!
 {p:1:The window was locked from the inside}!!"
".........No good!"
"Yeah, it\'s no goddamn good at all!!"
Kinzo and Battler grinned!
She thought this feeble red could block the charge of Battler and Kinzo, the two family heads?
"{p:2:After Grandfather jumped out the window, Aunt Natsuhi probably noticed a slight draft.
 She then approached the window, realized that it was wide open, and quickly closed and locked it}...!!"
"{p:2:Natsuhi probably couldn\'t even imagine that I had slipped out the window}!"
"{p:2:Yeah!!
 So it\'s only natural that Aunt Natsuhi thought Grandfather was sleeping in bed}!!"
Now that Battler had found the answer, the red barrier was more fragile than thin glass.
The red magical wall of certainty had been smashed again, so easily that it disgraced the name of certainty itself!
Could it be believed?
That barrier was more firm than any shield Ronove had ever used against Jessica.
And yet it had been......destroyed so easily...!
Though Battler was charging furiously forward and had almost reached Cornelia, she didn\'t step aside.
Her steel spirit, worthy of the name Eiserne Jungfrau, didn\'t allow her to step aside.
She took a talisman from her pocket, placed it in thin air, and drew a sign.
Then, not red, but blue burned there.
{n}Though it was far more frail than the red barrier, it was her last method of resistance.
"Y‐you won\'t get through, you won\'t!! For your attention, for your attention!!
 {p:2:Be that as it may, this is the third floor...!
 How could a wingless human escape from the window}......?!!
 Know that you won\'t get through, you wooooooooon\'t!!"
"Just quit your whining and watch!!!"
"{p:2:This is the answe{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}er{-}r{-}r{0}r{0}r{0}r{0}ra{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhhh}!!"
Battler......flew.
He burst through Cornelia\'s blue barrier, smashing it away,
 .....and his body flew out the window into the darkness of the rainy sky.
The fragments of the blue barrier scattered, leaving blue dust in their wake, coloring the air beautifully.
The locked room...
...had been smashed open......!!
Battler......had jumped from the mansion.
He was in the sky above the rainy courtyard.
......All of the raindrops had become small round gems that were scattered through the air.
Battler was floating through the jewelry‐box world of this beautiful stormy sky filled with countless raindrop gems.
In the sky of a world frozen in time, Dlanor and Battler faced each other.
If Battler, who had smashed and flown out the window, was like a knight leaping off a white horse,
 ......then Dlanor, who floated in the air waiting for him, was also a knight.
In the air above the courtyard surrounded by the Ushiromiya mansion and frozen in time,
 ......the true new head of the Ushiromiya family and the disciple of heaven who would test him crossed paths......
"......Brilliantly {f:5:done}.
 Whether you live or die when you fall into the courtyard, it does not change the fact that Kinzo could have broken out of this locked {f:5:room}...!!
 You are a true martyr, giving up your life to {f:5:jump}...!!
 You did well to break our locked‐room {f:5:barrier}.
 I am {f:5:impressed}, Ushiromiya Battler!!"
"However, I am Dlanor A. Knox, Chief {f:5:Inquisitor}!!
 I cannot allow you to escape out from under my {f:5:nose}...!
 Now, at the end, allow me the honor of crossing swords with {f:5:you}!!"
"Sure, bring it on.
 ......This game isn\'t as easy as it looks."
In this world where the gems of rain......fell slowly like large snowflakes on a snowy field.
......Dlanor and Battler slowly.........crossed paths.
It seemed slow.
 And yet, ......it happened in a flash.
Their gazes crossed and clashed like lightning.
When knight confronts knight, it is always head‐on and decided in a single strike......!
Blue and red......crossed paths......
"{p:2:Was the existence of Natsuhi\'s blind spot within the study depicted {f:5:beforehand}?
 If it was not, this theory is {f:5:impermissible}}.
 {p:1:Knox\'s 8th:
 It is forbidden for the case to be resolved with clues that are not {f:5:presented}}...!!"
Dlanor\'s double strike with both the blue and red blades sliced at Battler,
 .........and missed.
Those longswords, which had never lost in a hundred battles, cut through the empty air......
"{p:1:When we entered the study, its structure was mentioned clearly}.
 ......Sorry, little miss."
For the first time, Dlanor showed an expression.
{n}......It was a soft smile.
She had known since long ago that the study\'s structure had been mentioned.
But she couldn\'t let him escape without making a single strike.
{n}As an Inquisitor, she could not do that.
So though she had known that she wouldn\'t make it, she had still crossed swords with Battler.
"Yes, I {f:5:knew}.
 ......That answer of yours doesn\'t violate Knox\'s eighth {f:5:commandment}."
"......Don\'t hold this against me. I hope you\'re ready."
"Yes, {f:5:come}."
In Battler\'s hand......was a blade that shone red.
{n}That blade etched out the red truth......
{p:1:― It wouldn\'t be an exaggeration to say that Kinzo\'s study was a small villa he had created inside the mansion.}
{p:1:― A study.
 A book archive.
 A place to sleep.
 And a bathroom and washroom.
 It was divided into multiple rooms.}
That was already presented.
And it suggests that room‐sized blind spots can exist within the study...
Without any mercy, ...no, without any reluctance that would have been dishonorable,
 ......the sword of red truth cut into Dlanor.
Its sharp trail cut the countless gemdrops filling the sky into beautiful hemispheres......
"Brilliant.........{f:5:work}......"
"........................"
Time...exploded into life.
Both of them...fell through the courtyard.
One drifted down.
 The other tumbled through the air.
Then, there was a soft sound and a dull thud.
......The first was the sound of Battler landing gently in the courtyard.
{n}The second was the sound of Dlanor crashing down.
After crouching down for a while,
 .........Battler slowly stood up.
Though he had jumped down from the third floor, ......he had landed as lightly as though he had merely jumped over a fence......
"B‐...Battleeeeeeeeeeer.........!!"
Beato leaned out of the study window, looking to see if the supposedly wingless Battler had landed safely.
"Beato!!
 Come on, jump!!"
"Huh......?!"
"That window is our way out!
 ......So jump!!
 You aren\'t the kind of witch who\'d let herself be trapped inside a locked room!!"
The study was no longer a locked room.
{n}She could jump from here, escape from here...!
The locked room which had threatened to capture the witch and suffocate her had now been destroyed.
"M‐......mm...!!
 Y‐you too, Kinzo...!"
"Go.
 From the moment Battler showed his answer, my spirit had already escaped from this room."
Kinzo\'s form became a group of gold butterflies and disappeared.
{n}The locked‐room barrier had dissolved, and the power which denies magic had scattered.
Beato ran towards the window.
{n}......That was the only exit from the locked room of this witch hunt.
After glancing at the Inquisitors and the Chiester Sisters,
 she readied her wound‐covered body and ran towards the window, just like Battler had done.
She looked like Cinderella running as she heard the bell toll.
"Y‐you\'re not getting away, {f:5:Beatrice}, you witch illusion!!"
Erika flew at Beato, trying to grab onto her as she dashed away,
 but it was like trying to catch smoke, and Erika landed face‐first on the floor.
......There\'s no way a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} can catch a witch.
{n}For one such as her, without love, even touching Beato was impossible...!
"Chiester Troops, shoot the witch! Shoot her dead!!"
"Alignment conflict. Unable to fire."
"For your attention:
 we have no barrier prepared which can block Battler\'s blue truth."
Both Chiester00 and Gertrude spoke with unbelievably calm voices.
"N‐no one can stop any of them?
 Not Battler? Or Kinzo?
 Or {f:5:Beatrice}?!
 If these guys escape, then...
...m‐
......my locked room, my deduction...!!"
"And I...
...the detective,
 ...Furudo...Erika...
kkg{0}g{0}g{0}h{0}h{0}h{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}g{0}g{0}g{0}h{0}hgh!
 Gyaaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}g{0}g{0}g{0}h{0}h{0}h{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhh!!!"
Erika crouched, screaming and clutching at her head.
"You\'re the great Golden Witch! You can\'t be defeated by something like that geezer\'s grubby study!!
 It\'s still just the first twilight!
 Show these newcomers that your game isn\'t that easy!!"
Just like Battler, Beato also......jumped.
She drifted down through the gemdrop jewelry‐box world into Battler\'s chest.
......Battler caught her with both arms as though catching an angel\'s wings.
It was like a knight catching a princess who had been locked up in a tower,
 ......like a beautiful picture of a scene in some fairy tale...
".........Crap, ......I think I\'m in love.
 ...Are all the Ushiromiya family heads guys like this?"
"If you were to chronicle all the daring exploits of Ushiromiya Kinzo,
 ......you would probably have a tale longer and wilder than all the grimoires in the study put together.
 It seems the tale of the next head will be worth writing down as well.
 In fact, it already is being written.
 It\'s already a very, very long tale.
 ......Pu ku ku ku."
The demons giggled on top of the roof, holding umbrellas.
{n}Then, they quietly looked down over the two in the courtyard.
"Hah, hahhahhahahahahahaha...
 ......You\'re......not bad at all......"
"I guess all your games\'ve toughened me up."
In shock, Beato.....actually praised Battler as he held her in his arms.
Battler laughed in his usual carefree way......
".........Th‐
......this is.........
impossible...impossible!!"
Erika looked down from the window and clenched her teeth, still clutching at her head.
Still holding Beato in his arms, Battler grinned back.
"Erika."
"......Wh‐...what is it...?"
"I\'m not giving the riddle of the Golden Witch up to you.
 I\'m going to solve it.
 ......That riddle belongs to the two of us.
 Right, Beato?"
"Y‐......yes...!
 My riddle is...yo‐......yo‐......"
"Yo?"
As Battler gave her a mischievous grin, Beato\'s face turned uncharacteristically red.
 But even so, she spoke with a refreshingly bright expression while laughing loudly.
"My riddle is...
yo‐......yours...
...yours alone...!! Ushiromiya Battler!
 I won\'t let anyone else solve it...!!"
"Heheh, listen to her, saying something like that...!!"
Battler snorted, amused that Beato had said something so unlike her.
And, still holding Beato in his arms, he spun around in a kind of waltz.
The falling gemdrops celebrated their overcoming of this trial......
".........He jumped down from the third floor...? ......Unharmed...?
 He jumped down......and escaped from the locked room...?
 Th‐this is ridiculous...... This isn\'t reasoning... ......It\'s insane!!"
If Battler had at least been seriously injured and writhing in the mud,
 ......Erika might still have had some ground to stand on.
She might have been able to claim that Kinzo couldn\'t have jumped down with his old body and gotten away unscathed.
......However, Battler stood calmly in the courtyard, looking up at Erika with the dignity of the victor.
"Le‐...let me ask all of you again.
 ......This...can\'t be possible, right?
 There\'s no way a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} can jump out of a third story window and land unharmed...!!"
"Isn\'t that right, everyone...?!
 Much less Kinzo‐san, jumping down from the third floor at his age!! There\'s no reasoning behind this!!"
Erika tried to get everyone\'s agreement and somehow turn things around,
 ......but their responses were no different from how they had been a short while ago.
"No, with Kinzo‐san, it\'s a possibility."
"Wouldn\'t put it past Dad."
"This is Father we\'re talking about......"
"There\'re plenty of crazy stories about that man.
 Somethin\' like this wouldn\'t surprise me at all."
"Wh‐......what.........?!!
 I‐...is there something wrong in your heads, in your minds, people?!?!"
"At any rate, ......it looks like your locked‐room argument wasn\'t perfect."
"Ah......gggrrrrrrrrggh...!!"
Not only the servants, but the family members also agreed.
They all agreed that there would be nothing strange about Kinzo jumping down from a third‐floor window.
J‐just who in the world...is this Ushiromiya Kinzo person...?!!
"Well, I\'ll give you 60 points...
 Kinzo would have done it with a bit more flash in his younger days.
 It needs some more tweaking."
"Oh, and how much should it be tweaked?"
"W‐well...
 Umm, ......h‐he might have jumped down with me in h‐his arms!"
"Got it.
 Next time we do this, I\'ll jump down with you in my arms."
"I, ......I\'d like to see you try..."
Beato\'s voice went very shrill, and she gulped.
Then, her body suddenly became a group of gold butterflies and crumbled away.
It was because many people had rushed up to the window, and she was being bathed with gazes filled with the anti‐magic toxin.
Beato\'s body became invisible to them and melted into the air...
So to their eyes, it appeared that Battler was standing all alone out in the courtyard...
"Battleeeeeeeeer!! You okaaaaaaaaay?!!"
"I‐it looks like he\'s alright...! Thank goodness!"
"......I am {f:5:defeated}...
 ......In that case, for the benefit of the people in the study, ......deliver me the final {f:5:blow}.
 Use your final blue truth to show how Kinzo escaped from the locked room of that {f:5:study}."
There was no pain in Dlanor\'s expression.
{n}...Pleasure and pain never showed up on her face in the first place.
However, she used her longsword as a crutch as she struggled to her feet, so it was easy to tell that she had taken heavy damage.
And despite her lack of an expression, you could tell that this was a loss she could accept.
Battler and Dlanor turned to face each other.
"Here I go."
"Yes, {f:5:come}.
 ....................."
As though readying herself, Dlanor quietly closed her eyes, but she still stood tall and maintained her air of dignity.
"This is my blue truth."
The blue power gathered.
{n}......Battler slowly approached Dlanor.
Then, he faced the rainy sky and yelled out the blue truth.
"{p:2:Ushiromiya Kinzo escaped from the study through the window when Aunt Natsuhi couldn\'t see him.
 Aunt Natsuhi didn\'t notice and locked the window.
 This way, Aunt Natsuhi can see Grandfather go to bed at eleven o\'clock and Grandfather can escape from the study without contradicting the lock of the window or the door sealed by the receipt.
 I proved through my demonstration that this escape was physically possible.
 Therefore, this battle is over}!!"
The blue wedge flashed through the courtyard along with a blue bolt of lightning,
 and roared down towards Dlanor\'s forehead as she stared up at the sky.
"........................ah."
".........Beato\'s games are no walk in the park.
 It\'s doubtful whether the conventions of the mystery genre even apply here.
 Your swordsmanship isn\'t bad, but you should be a bit more flexible in your thinking."
......A massive blue wedge which looked like a pillar......was above Dlanor\'s forehead...
...and had stopped with its tip just slightly touching her.
It didn\'t run her through.
......It made no mark larger than being poked with a pencil.
When Battler snapped his fingers, the blue wedge shattered,
 and became a shower of translucent gems,
 .........no, drops of rain that poured down over the courtyard.
Dlanor sat down in an absent sort of way...
Amidst the thunder and rain, the successor to the Ushiromiya family faced the people staring down from the study...
...and spread his arms wide...
".........Welcome to Beato\'s and my game.
 We receive you with open arms! Furudo Erika......!"
"Ahhaha......
 .........Ah{0}hah{0}hah{0}hah{0}ha, kah{0}hah{0}hah{0}hah{0}hah{0}ha...!!
 I like it, Ushiromiya Battler...!
 <Good>, truly <good>...!!
 Ah{0}hah{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha...!!
 I\'ll devour it whole,
 this riddle of the witch...!!
 All the way deep into its guts while it\'s still alive!!
 Ah{0}hah{0}hah{0}hah{0}hah{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}he{0}hyah{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahha!!"
Battler and Beato both looked calmly up at Erika, who couldn\'t contain that evil laugh......
"Ohhohohohohohohoho, ooo{0}ho{0}ho{0}ho{0}ho{0}ho{0}ho{0}ho{0}hyah{0}hya{0}a{0}aahhh!!
 Ah, this is good stuff!!
 Erika, that was so laaaame, ehi{0}hhah{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!"
"G......gah.........
 L‐Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}...
 ......M‐my apolo...gies......"
"That face of yours.
 ......It\'s so incredibly laughable that I\'d like to squash it flat and put a frame around it.
 *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*, my double is so...pathetic, pathetic, shameful, shameful, heh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eeheh{0}eh{0}ehi{0}hhhi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hhi{0}ha{0}ha{0}hyhah{0}aha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!"
Bathed in the sneers of {f:5:Bernkastel}, the being who was like a mother to her,
 ......Erika was so ashamed that it looked as though she\'d chew her lower lip to pieces...
"......For this...I swear...
......I swear.........
 Ghhhhh......!!
 Ushiromiya Battler...
 ......{f:5:Beatrice}......
 ......Ushiromiya...
.........Natsuhii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}iii.....
...iih{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi...!!
 Hi{0}hyah{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haa{0}ha{0}haaah!!"
"This riddle is ours.
 ......I won\'t let anyone else get in the way...!! {f:5:Beatrice}!!"
"Y‐......yes!"In the Golden Land, the quiet rain......just kept on falling.
In the arbor......sat the sad witch whose eyes had lost their glint......and Battler.
{f:5:Virgilia} could also be seen there.
{n}......She sat next to Beato, knitting quietly.
{f:5:Lambdadelta}\'s game had passed the climax of the first twilight, and they were taking a short break.
Gazing out at the golden rose garden soaked with rain,
 ......Battler thought back on the present, what was to come, and what had happened so far......
To Battler, thinking was itself a battle.
Even with the game stopped and Beato unable to speak, ......he could still keep on fighting.
......{f:5:Virgilia} suddenly stopped her knitting.
Battler had noticed too.
......Though none should have been able to visit this rose garden, they had noticed a silhouette approaching.
".........That\'s unusual.
 Not many people can reach this place."
"It\'s her..............."
That silhouette, ......walking through the quietly falling rain without so much as an umbrella,
 .........was Dlanor.
"......That was a splendid garden {f:5:maze}.
 A very nice way to enjoy the {f:5:roses}."
"Why.........are you here?"
"It has been some time, {nobr:Mrs. {f:5:Beatrice}.}
 ...Excuse me, it is {nobr:Mrs. {f:5:Virgilia}} now, is it {f:5:not}?"
"Long time no see, Dlanor.
 ......Come over here.
 We aren\'t ones to leave a guest out in the rain."
"..........................."
"Don\'t worry.
 She hasn\'t come to fight."
"......Do you know her?"
"She\'s one of my old friends from heaven.
 ......This really takes me back."
"Yes, it {f:5:does}.
 {nobr:Mrs. {f:5:Virgilia}} possesses a deep knowledge in Heavenly {f:5:Studies}.
 I have often battled with her over {f:5:interpretations}."
"Hoh‐hoh‐ho...
 My many intellectual adventures with you were quite enjoyable.
 I\'d like to do it again sometime."
"{f:5:Yes}.
 Let\'s do it again {f:5:sometime}.
 I\'d love to fight with you {f:5:again}."
They used the word "fight", but it didn\'t sound like they meant anything unpleasant by it.
{n}It sounded like something old chess rivals would say to each other.
Unlike Beato, it seemed that {f:5:Virgilia} had always acted properly and courteously,
 so she had many friends in various other worlds, including both heaven and the demon world.
Surprisingly, Dlanor was one of them......
Dlanor, who had crossed swords with "me" just a short while ago,
 bowed her head as if to thank us for allowing her shelter from the sudden rain, and sat in the seat {f:5:Virgilia} pointed out, like a guest.
"......Is there any type of black tea you would prefer?"
"{f:5:Anything}.
 ......Any tea you make is {f:5:superb}."
"Then how about some Darjeeling?
 ......Battler, Beato, would you like some more?"
"......Yeah.
 Beato and I would like a refill.
 ......Right?"
"......................................."
As usual, Beato didn\'t answer,
 ......but if you quietly gave her a cup, she would sip it from time to time.
There was still some black tea left in that cup, but it had already chilled.
So Battler asked for a refill for Beato as well...
"......I have heard the {f:5:rumors}.
 ......How pitiable that {f:5:Beatrice}, the Endless Witch famous for her cruelty,
 has been reduced to {f:5:this}."
"She\'s no longer participating in the game.
 ......{f:5:Lambdadelta} is the one controlling the Beato that\'s on the game board."
"I {f:5:know}.
 ......However, she is the original master of this {f:5:world}.
 And you are the proper guest, invited by that {f:5:master}.
 That is why I have come to greet {f:5:you}."
On the game board, Beato and I met Dlanor.
But those were the game pieces of those witches.
{n}They weren\'t Beato and me ourselves.
"Is that why you went out of your way to greet Battler‐kun and Beato here...?
 ...I see you\'re as conscientious as always."
"That is my way of doing {f:5:things}.
 .........Greetings, {nobr:Mr. Battler}.
 I am Dlanor {nobr:A. Knox}.
 ...We play opposing roles, but it is a pleasure to meet {f:5:you}."
"......Sure.
 I\'m Ushiromiya Battler.
 Pleased to meet you."
"Greetings, Miss {f:5:Beatrice}.
 I am Dlanor {nobr:A. Knox}."
"...................................."
"......Beato.
 She\'s saying hi.
 ........................"
"...................................."
"...............
 ......She says "welcome"."
"Thank you very {f:5:much},
 Miss {f:5:Beatrice}."
The witch and the Inquisitor whose job it was to hunt witches...
greeted each other around a tea table surrounded by the aroma of black tea.
......It was a strange sight.
{f:5:Virgilia} made gold butterflies appear from the palms of her hands...
and transformed them into a teapot and a can of tea leaves.
......It was a very witch‐like way of preparing tea.
She was a witch, so it wasn\'t a particularly unusual sight.
......Though I was a bit concerned about whether Dlanor, an Inquisitor, could allow herself to watch such a spectacle.
"......Have no {f:5:fear}.
 I am not so rude as to quibble about the way my tea is {f:5:served}."
"Even though the tea\'s being made with magic...?"
"......There is a tea set hiding in the shadows, and {nobr:Mrs. {f:5:Virgilia}} is making the tea with it in {f:5:secret}.
 We interpret and/or conclude that "it was made with magic", and it is written as such in the {f:5:tale}.
 ......It is an interpretation permitted even by Knox\'s 9th {f:5:commandment}."
"Oh my...
 I do believe the interpretations of the ninth commandment are such a delicate issue that they\'re even viewed as taboo by the Great Court......
 Even though it\'s just a personal opinion, if it became known that the Chief Inquisitor said such a thing, you might be sacked."
"No matter what kind of interpretation I might record,
 there is nothing false about the way your tea {f:5:tastes}.
 Therefore, I will never concern myself with how it was {f:5:prepared}."
".....................Aha..."
Though she looked cold, ......she was a surprisingly tactful person.
......If Dlanor were to deny that the black tea had been prepared with magic, this magic would surely be crushed in a instant.
However, even if it was depicted that a tea set existed here and {f:5:Virgilia} had used it to make the tea normally,
 the result, that {f:5:Virgilia} had made tea, would still remain unchanged.
"Magic that hides the result in darkness is {f:5:evil}.
 We will not permit {f:5:it}.
 However, magic that conceals the process is not necessarily {f:5:evil}.
 My foe is the evil, not the magic {f:5:itself}."
"I get it.
 ......The important thing is that you\'re being welcomed with some tea,
 so it\'s just common courtesy to avoid complaining about how it was made."
......That\'s right.
It\'s common courtesy to be grateful for tea that someone makes for you.
There\'s nothing elegant about pushing your way into the kitchen and poking around through the tea‐making process.
"You don\'t invite your guests into the kitchen.
 And when you set the table, you should adorn it beautifully in the spirit of hospitality.
 ......Here you go. It\'s hot."
"Thank {f:5:you}.
 I would also like some sugar and {f:5:milk}."
"*giggle*.
 You still can\'t drink it straight?"
"I am a {f:5:kid}.
 It has to be {f:5:sweet}."
".........So is magic...
...a white...
lie,
 ......then?"
"‘Lie’ is such a dirty word.
 The word "embellishment" is probably more fitting."
"When giving a child candy,
 you can either take a crumpled‐up one out of your pocket,
 or use a wonderful bit of sleight of hand to produce the candy, and the impression you give with each method is completely {f:5:different}."
"Sure, I mean, producing the candy out of nowhere is a cool little trick."
"{f:5:Wrong}.
 The meaning is in embellishing the result—a candy is given—in a way that makes it even more beautiful and {f:5:fun}."
"......Think of when you give Maria‐chan a candy.
 There\'s a huge difference between taking it out of your pocket to give to her,
 and saying a fairy gave it to her for being such a good girl...
after secretly slipping it into her pocket."
"In my opinion, it would be boorish to then question everyone about their alibis...
and investigate and pinpoint who it was that slipped it into her {f:5:pocket}.
 The important thing is the result: that the girl received the candy and was {f:5:delighted}.
 And the meaning lies in the fact that it was embellished in order to delight {f:5:her}."
"......That\'s surprising.
 When you showed up, I got the feeling you\'d deny anything that went by the name of magic."
"That is how I act in my capacity as an {f:5:Inquisitor}.
 It is my {f:5:job}.
 However, when I am away from my job, I don\'t enjoy being quite so cold‐{f:5:hearted}."
"So, this is what they call leaving your personal feelings aside when on duty?
 ......You do it well."
"As an Inquisitor, hunting witches is my {f:5:job}.
 ......Personally, I find witches {f:5:pitiable}.
 However, I condemn them mercilessly as an {f:5:Inquisitor}."
"......The result that I execute witches is {f:5:unchanged}.
 ......In the end, my pity is nothing more than a useless {f:5:embellishment}.
 Whether I have it or not, nothing {f:5:changes}.
 So it is better if I do {f:5:not}......"
".........Not at all.
 Even if the end result is the same, there\'s a big difference depending on your heart."
"......Your mother\'s cookies must have been more delicious than those made by a good pastry shop.
 ...That\'s because you know that they were made with heart."
"That\'s right.
 .........Even if the result appears to be the same,
 ......there\'s a huge difference depending on whether or not it had a little thing called sincerity..."
"I am not so {f:5:sure}......
 .........Whether I have a heart or not is completely {f:5:meaningless}."
Dlanor\'s gaze fell to her cup, a little sadly...
"That\'s not true."
".................."
"Because of everything you\'ve just said, I\'ve changed the way I look at you a little.
 ......So saying your heart is meaningless isn\'t true at all."
{f:5:Virgilia} was a little surprised to hear the words she should have said coming from Battler\'s mouth.
After all, understanding the "heart" was the first step towards magic\'s true nature.
......Perhaps Battler was unconsciously starting to understand, bit by bit,
 ...the essence of Beato, the essence of witches,
 and the very first essence of all, ......the essence of magic.
Whether you want to become a witch or vanquish them...
{n}......The very first step is learning about magic.
{f:5:Virgilia} was sure that she felt this faint change within Battler...
"......As for that last fight, thank you very {f:5:much}.
 I am grateful for the mercy you showed me at the very {f:5:end}."
"That "me" wasn\'t me.
 ......{f:5:Lambdadelta} was controlling him."
I joined in on the fifth game partway through.
{n}At "this point in the story", I still hadn\'t joined.
So up until the point when I did join,
 the piece "me" is probably being controlled by {f:5:Bernkastel} or {f:5:Lambdadelta}.
"......Just what kind of mood\'s taken those two?
 Trying to make it look all cool...
 They made me look like some kind of knight coming to save Beato."
"Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} wants both witches and {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s to be in balance, resulting in a draw.
 .........With Erika\'s appearance, the scales tipped strongly in the favor of the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} side,
 so she manipulated the tale in a way that supports Beato."
"Yes, I am {f:5:aware}.
 However, pieces cannot do things that are impossible for {f:5:them}.
 And they specialize in actions appropriate to their original {f:5:personality}.
 ......Therefore, that was certainly something that you......that Battler was capable {f:5:of}.
 That is why I am grateful to {f:5:you}."
"......It feels a bit weird to be praised when I didn\'t actually do anything.
 ......After the game continues a bit more, I\'ll probably regain control of my piece.
 Not sure I\'ll be going easy on you then."
"The same goes for {f:5:me}.
 I will not be caught unawares in our next {f:5:bout}."
"Perfect. I\'ll take you on anytime.
 Give me everything you\'ve got."
"You have my {f:5:word}. Everything I {f:5:have}."
......Dlanor.
I\'d thought she was an emotionless killer doll without a heart,
 ...but maybe she actually is pretty approachable.
......Though of course, neither of us will show any mercy when fighting on the game board.
For a while, we gazed at the rain‐drenched rose garden as we quietly enjoyed our tea.
".........There is one thing I must apologize {f:5:for}."
Dlanor suddenly murmured something.
"What is it?
 ......If it\'s about that fight a short while ago, it\'s already over.
 We both fought with everything we had.
 The outcome was just luck of the draw."
"No, it was not luck of the {f:5:draw}.
 ...We were unable to let the outcome be decided naturally by chance, so I came here to {f:5:apologize}."
"......What are you talking about...?"
"..................
 .........You\'re saying you threw the match, aren\'t you?"
{f:5:Virgilia} spoke softly, without hesitating in her knitting.
".........{f:5:Yes}.
 ......{nobr:Mr. Battler}."
"That "Mr." is really getting to me.
 Just Battler is fine."
"Battler.
 ......I {f:5:apologize}.
 We did not give it everything we {f:5:had}."
".........I know.
 ......{p:1:‘Kinzo is dead at the starting time for all games’}.
 Beato already told us that truth.
 ......Battler‐kun should only have been able to achieve a draw at best in that battle.
 He shouldn\'t have had any chance at all of winning."
"......You\'re right.
 ......If you just say that, the whole fight\'s already over.
 ......Why didn\'t you use that red?
 Are you telling me it was because of a stalemate or something like that?"
"{p:1:Knox\'s 2nd:
 It is forbidden for supernatural agencies to be employed as a detective {f:5:technique}}.
 We cannot use that red truth {f:5:directly}.
 However, the red truth that {p:1:"the window was never opened after it started raining"}...
was one I had given to Cornelia, who was protecting the window."
"Boom.
 ...That\'s checkmate.
 .........Why didn\'t that girl use that trump card...?"
"............!!
 Th‐this is...... .........gh.
 F‐For your attention...!
 There is no way to defeat my red!
 Know that your wish will not be granted...!!"
Though she had fought calmly up until that point,
 ......she quickly got flustered when I dashed forwards.
I\'d thought that she had been frightened by my sudden attack, ......but the truth was different.
Even though she held a trump card which could completely repel me,
 .........she suddenly became unable to use it, and hesitated.
"I am not {f:5:sure}.
 In that instant, use of that trump card suddenly became {f:5:forbidden}.
 Once we lost that, your victory was {f:5:guaranteed}."
".........The Game Master, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}, probably interfered."
"That bastard...
 .........So in the end, that whole fight was a farce in the palm of {f:5:Lambdadelta}\'s hand.
 She made "us" play out that entire act according to her script."
"I understand that you are {f:5:upset}.
 However, since you told me to fight with everything I had, I had no choice but to let you {f:5:know}.
 ......Please forgive {f:5:me}."
"Still, even though you\'d lost your trump card, you kept on fighting all‐out with your remaining cards.
 I don\'t believe anyone could find fault with what you did."
"......That\'s right.
 ......If I should be mad at anyone, it\'s {f:5:Lambdadelta} for butting in."
"{p:1:‘Kinzo does not exist’} should already be an established {f:5:fact}.
 Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} and Lady {f:5:Bernkastel} know this {f:5:well}.
 And yet, they are both leaving room for Kinzo to exist as they continue through this {f:5:game}.
 ......It is almost as though the two are conspiring to prevent Kinzo\'s existence from being {f:5:denied}."
"You\'re saying they let "Grandfather" escape on purpose...?"
"{f:5:Yes}.
 They must be after {f:5:something}."
"............That is a bit odd.
 ...Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} and Lady {f:5:Bernkastel} should always be in opposition unless the witch side is in a superior position.
 ......It\'s hard to imagine that those two would be conspiring together with things going as they are..."
"I cannot help but think that they have some sort of wicked {f:5:objective}.
 I came here because I wanted you to know {f:5:that}."
"......So, ...you came all the way here to tell us something like that?"
"{f:5:Yes}.
 ......Which means that my business here is {f:5:finished}.
 I think I will leave {f:5:now}.
 The game will probably resume {f:5:shortly}.
 I need to have a discussion with Erika about the {f:5:future}."
Dlanor gulped down the last of her black tea and stood up.
"I will see you next at the battle of the second {f:5:twilight}.
 There, I will once again raise my merciless {f:5:longsword}.
 ......So, Battler, I ask the same of {f:5:you}.
 Show no mercy towards {f:5:me}."
"......I know.
 ...If I go easy on you, I\'ll have my own head smashed in."
"On the game board, I am nothing more than Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}\'s piece and Furudo Erika\'s {f:5:agent}.
 In the future, I will likely block your way as an enemy many {f:5:times}.
 ......However, in my heart, I am always {f:5:neutral}.
 ......No, ......please forget {f:5:that}.
 ......It has no bearing on the nature of our {f:5:relationship}."
"It does.
 ......There\'s no doubt you\'re a fearsome opponent, but you don\'t piss me off anymore.
 Unlike that Erika, who totally pisses me off."
"I am {f:5:glad}.
 I also find Furudo Erika to be {f:5:obnoxious}."
"Heh, hahahahaha."
Dlanor\'s expression finally softened slightly.
{n}......At the very last moment, it felt as though we finally understood each other.
"Furudo Erika is a very evil {f:5:creature}.
 ......After her recent defeat and loss of face, she is burning with a desire for {f:5:revenge}.
 Even I cannot tell what she is {f:5:plotting}.
 However, it cannot be anything {f:5:good}.
 Please take {f:5:care}."
"......Just knowing she\'s {f:5:Bernkastel}\'s piece means I\'m not gonna let my guard down."
Dlanor nodded as though satisfied, left the eaves of the arbor and walked out into the rain.
"......Who could have thought that I would end up serving as an agent of such {f:5:evil}...
 .........Why was I called to this {f:5:world}?"
Dlanor let out a small sigh.
"Pieces" can do nothing except fulfill the function they have been given.
{n}And that function is given to them by the one who controls them.
......She probably can\'t disobey {f:5:Bernkastel}, the player in control of "her".
"............Lady {f:5:Bernkastel} may be the one who called you here.
 However, the one who let you into this world is Beato.
 ......If this child didn\'t wish it, you would never have been able to make it through the garden maze to arrive here.
 ......Right, ...Beato......?"
"...................................."
"........................
 ......Miss {f:5:Beatrice}.
 What is it that you want from {f:5:me}?
 ......I do hope that I can help you in some way, though I may be an agent of {f:5:evil}..."
She spoke to Beato, ......but of course, there was no response.
After bowing once more in thanks for the black tea,
 ......Dlanor disappeared off into the rainy rose garden......
"So, no one can reach this Golden Land if Beato doesn\'t want them to?"
"Yes.
 ......She is the one who called Dlanor here."
"...................................."
".........So, ......Beato called her here to meet me..."
......But...
I know of a person who reached this place despite Beato\'s wishes.
Ange.
...In the last game, Ange reached this place by herself...
...even though she was an uninvited guest.
Was that...
...also something...
...Beato desired......?
"That I am here, that you are here,
 that Beato is here,
 and that Dlanor was invited here...
......all of these things occurred because she wanted them to.
 ......Even the bit of time that you and Dlanor spent together drinking tea."
"...................................."
"......Beato.
 What was I.........supposed to learn from her......?
 Does it have something to do with finding your heart......and letting you rest in peace......?"
Dlanor A. Knox.
The natural enemy of witches.
 Inquisitor.
{n}......A vanguard of mystery...who denies fantasy.
Is she here to help me...
...gouge out your heart...
...and arrest your breathing.........?
....................................
"Please stand.
 On one leg."
"........................"
Cornelia slowly got up and stood on one leg, as she had been ordered.
Her hands were clasped behind her back.
 ...Because she had been ordered to do so.
Then, with a loud thump,
 Erika shoved her from behind with both hands.
Cornelia landed on the floor face first with a thud.
"Please stand.
 On one leg."
"........................"
Cornelia rose shakily.
{n}Then, once again, she stood on one leg as she had been ordered.
She had been ordered not to try to keep her balance.
{n}So she had fallen on her face over and over again.
She had barely managed to protect her nose, but after smashing against the floor so many times, her face was bright red.
She wasn\'t shedding any tears.
 No, she couldn\'t shed them.
{n}Because she was forbidden to do even that......
"Please stand.
 On one leg."
"........................"
Thump.
 Thud.
"Please stand.
 On one leg."
Thump.
 Thud.
Thump.
 Thud.
Thump.
 ............Thud.
Erika repeated this falling torture over and over again.
At times like this, Erika hated counting things.
So she decided that, when she ran out of fingers to keep count on, she would just keep on going until she lost interest.
However, Erika\'s main redeeming feature was that she never lost interest in anything,
 so the torture continued on without end......
......Erika didn\'t know the truth...
of why Cornelia had been unable to fully protect the window.
So the whole time since then,
 ......she had been criticizing her, blaming her entirely for their defeat.
"......For your attention: I beg to state the following.
 Please forgive Cornelia for her failing.
 She has already performed sufficient penance..."
"Oh, is that so?
 Then please take her place from now on."
"G‐......Gertrude bears no sin for which to repent......"
"Gertrude.
 .........Please stand.
 On one leg.
 Clasp your hands behind you."
"....................."
Gertrude followed the order...
...and clasped her hands behind her back, standing on one leg.
"You mustn\'t resist or try to keep your balance.
 You are not permitted to bend your knees.
 You are not permitted to shed any tears.
 Do you understand?"
".........As you wish......"
"Gertrude............"
Erika took her time walking behind Gertrude.
She was even enjoying making her wonder when she\'d push......
At that moment, Gertrude and Cornelia burst in a bright light and disappeared.
......Dlanor had returned at some point, and had sent them back to heaven for the time being.
Erika, who\'d had her fun spoiled, directed an openly malicious expression at Dlanor...
"Miss Erika.
 I will bear the punishment for my subordinate as her {f:5:superior}.
 Please have mercy upon {f:5:her}."
"............<No, thank you>.
 Punishment is meaningful because of the pain it inflicts.
 ......There\'s nothing remotely interesting about punishing an unfeeling doll girl that can\'t receive a single scratch."
Erika slowly grabbed hold of the back of Dlanor\'s hair and tugged on it unrelentingly.
Dlanor\'s neck tilted unnaturally backwards, creaking.
"......I cannot be harmed, but I can be {f:5:hurt}."
"Hmph.
 As if you have feelings to hurt.
 You witch‐hunting murder doll.
 .........Are you trying to talk back to me?
 Me, the envoy and double of the great Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}...?!"
".........{f:5:No}."
"{i:I} am being reprimanded by Lady {f:5:Bernkastel} because {i:you people} are useless...!!
 Never demonstrate such miserable incompetence again...!
 Are‐we‐{nobr:un‐der‐stood}...?!"
She pulled back the hair she had grabbed even more strongly...
This didn\'t cause Dlanor any physical pain,
 but she could clearly feel Erika\'s ill will.
"...............My {f:5:apologies}.
 Please forgive {f:5:me}."
"Filth."
With a sound like taut strings snapping, she ripped out several strands of Dlanor\'s hair.
Then, Erika waved her hand about as though trying to shake off something dirty that had gotten stuck to it.
"Well, that\'s enough.
 I\'m done.
 .........My anger has finally subsided, and my little gray cells are tingling again.
 ......Please call those two useless people back and reconstruct the crime scene.
 Let\'s start the deduction game."
"{f:5:Understood}.
 .........Gertrude, Cornelia."
""As you wish.""
The two of them reappeared behind Dlanor,
 and reconstructed the crime scene for Erika, the one who had just been tormenting them...
"......Kinzo disappearing was nothing more than an added bonus for the first twilight.
 Let\'s start investigating the first twilight proper.
 ......Oh, before that.
 Are you aware that we were actually presented with a mystery before the murders even occurred?"
"{f:5:Yes}.
 You mean the letter with the mark of the One‐winged Eagle, which appeared at midnight last night along with a knock by some {f:5:person}."
"That\'s right.
 The tale appears to describe that it was impossible for any of the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s at that moment,
 creating the illusion that an unknown witch exists.
 ......Let\'s start by crushing this witch illusion.
 We\'ll first check the situation in the dining hall last night when the letter was delivered."
"{f:5:Understood}.
 Gertrude, Cornelia.
 Reconstruct last night\'s family conference in the dining {f:5:hall}."
""As you wish.""
The family conference last night was conducted with the adult relatives and Battler present.
And partway through, the servants arrived to serve tea.
"Let\'s review everyone\'s whereabouts at the exact moment the letter appeared.
 How did that go again?"
"For your attention: I beg to inform you of the following.
 {p:1:Before the family conference, Erika, George, Jessica, Maria, Nanjo, Gohda, and Kumasawa left the mansion and moved to the guesthouse}."
"For your attention: I beg to inform you of the following.
 {p:1:Of those who remain, only Krauss, Natsuhi, and Genji were in the second floor corridor,
 while all others were in the dining hall}."
"Because the mansion had been entirely locked in advance of the family conference,
 everyone else was unable to enter the {f:5:mansion}."
"Aha.
 That would mean that no one inside the mansion could have knocked and placed the letter there, right?
 Eheheheh."
"{f:5:Yes}.
 The witch side will probably say that this person is the same who wrote the letter: the witch, {f:5:Beatrice}."
"Ridiculous.
 A stupid trick.
 .........There\'s no guarantee that the letter was placed there at the stroke of midnight.
 It\'s only sensible to consider that it might have been placed there earlier."
"Just a few minutes before the letter was discovered, Shannon and Kanon came in to serve {f:5:tea}.
 When they entered, multiple witnesses confirmed that there was nothing suspicious like a letter in the {f:5:hallway}."
"{p:2:Most likely, one of those not in the dining hall—Krauss, Natsuhi, or Genji—
simply saw their chance right after that and placed the letter there}.
 No, in fact, it would have been possible for the people who supposedly went to the guesthouse too."
"{p:2:We\'ve heard that the mansion was locked and that no one outside could get in,
 but if someone only pretended to go to the guesthouse and instead hid inside the mansion,
 it\'s perfectly possible that they could have placed the letter there}."
"For your attention:
 blue truth, valid."
"In that case, the problem is the {f:5:knock}.
 Unlike the letter, someone would have to exist there at the instant of the {f:5:knock}."
"I see, so this is the so‐called proof that a person who shouldn\'t be there, a witch, existed?
 This is completely ridiculous.
 Do they think that this is all it takes to get me, Furudo Erika, to surrender?
 *giggle*giggle*, ahhahaha!"
"{p:2:Firstly, I question whether the knock was even something hitting the door to the dining hall at all.
 For example, the mansion\'s construction may be such that when a certain pillar on the second floor is struck, the noise is transmitted down the pillar,
 and it sounds just like a knock on the door to people in the dining hall}."
"{p:2:Or they could have misheard some other random sound as a knock and misconstrued it in a similar way.
 Or a tape with the sound of a knock recorded on it could have been secretly playing,
 which had been carefully set up to be heard at exactly that time}."
"In any case, even if no one was on the other side of the door,
 I can think of many ways to make them hear a knock...!
 How is that? My master!
 What do you think of my reasoning...?!!"
".........Well, you heard her... How did she do?"
"Well, it looks like your cute little piece gave it her all to think up these blue truths,
 so I guess I\'ll be nice and give out a few red truths myself{p:0:♪}"
I guess I\'ll start with the letter.
There was that knock when the large clock struck midnight.
And when the door was opened, there lay a letter in an envelope bearing the One‐winged Eagle.
The idea that the people who weren\'t in the dining hall secretly placed the letter in the hallway is such an old one, right?
{p:1:Krauss, Natsuhi, and Genji did not even touch that letter}!
"......Oho?
 Then...
{p:2:when Shannon and Kanon came in to serve tea, who was the last {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} to enter the dining hall...?
 Let\'s say it was Kanon.
 Wouldn\'t it be easy if Kanon, the last person in, secretly dropped the letter there when he closed the door}?"
"{p:1:Not a single person in the dining hall—no, there\'s a simpler way to say it.
 Among all those inside the mansion at midnight,
 not a single one of them placed that letter in the hallway}."
"So you can\'t say that no one {i:touched} it?"
"Of course not.
 They "touched it" when they picked it up.
 Of course I can\'t say none of them touched it."
"I see.
 Then let\'s interpret it this way:
 {p:2:Someone who existed outside of the mansion at midnight placed the letter somewhere other than the hallway beforehand.
 Then, it moved by some means, and ended up "placed in the hallway".}"
"{p:2:Just as an example, let\'s say it was deliberately stuck to the underside of...
the serving cart carrying the tea set, which the servants wheeled into the room.
 It was simply affixed there in a way that would make it come unstuck after a certain amount of time,
 such that when it eventually fell off, it would become "the letter left by a witch who shouldn\'t exist".
 In other words, this is a classic trick where the true sender gives themselves an alibi by making the letter appear at a different time}."
"For your attention:
 blue truth, valid."
"In other words, the fact that it landed just outside the dining hall door was just the culprit\'s good luck.
 It could easily have fallen in the kitchen, the corridor, or even inside the dining hall itself."
"......Oh, <good>!
 If it had happened inside the dining hall, that would have been even more wonderful.
 Within everyone\'s sight, a letter would suddenly appear on the floor.
 And a red stating "it appeared suddenly in the locked room of the dining hall and was not touched by anyone there" wouldn\'t even be violated!"
"Well {f:5:done}.
 If the letter was stuck to the bottom of the serving cart, then anyone could be the {f:5:culprit}."
"That might work okay for the letter.
 But will that same type of argument work for the knock as well?
 Let\'s try this again, shall we?"
".........Please, go ahead."
"{p:1:Neither Krauss nor Natsuhi nor Genji knocked}!"
"{p:1:This isn\'t the limited meaning of them knocking on the door, okay?
 It means they didn\'t use a pillar to transmit the sound or push the play button on a cassette tape they\'d recorded or create that knock sound by any means!
 Of course, this includes all direct, indirect, intentional, coincidental, and unintentional means}!"
"This wedge has already been knocked in, but I\'ll repeat it.
 {p:2:Maybe someone other than Krauss, Natsuhi, or Genji made that knock,
 or else a sound that could be misidentified as a knock}."
"For your attention: I beg to inform you of the following.
 {p:1:At 24:00, except for Krauss, Natsuhi, and Genji in the second floor corridor,
 and all of the people in the dining hall, no other {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s existed inside the mansion}."
"For your attention: I beg to inform you of the following.
 {p:1:In addition to Krauss, Natsuhi, and Genji, none of those in the dining hall knocked,
 where "knocking" includes all direct, indirect, intentional, unintentional, and coincidental events that could create a knocking sound}."
{e:070:A direct knock refers to someone literally hitting a door to make a knocking sound.
{n}An intentional knock refers to someone creating a fake knocking sound with intent to make it appear that someone knocked.
{n}An unintentional knock refers to someone unintentionally creating a fake knocking sound.
{n}A coincidental knock refers to some kind of coincidence creating a fake knocking sound.}
"{p:1:In other words, it is impossible for anyone who was in the mansion to have been the source of a knocking {f:5:sound}.
 ......In this case, "anyone" also includes any people who might have gone undetected or {f:5:unobserved}}."
"Anyone who was in the mansion" also includes any unknown person X who was secretly hiding in the mansion.
Therefore, this literally meant...
that "it was impossible for anyone inside the mansion to knock", with no wordplay allowed.
"......I see.
 So no matter how much I toy with it, the only ones who could possibly have produced the knocking sound are those in what we might call the "guesthouse group"."
"Like me, for example.
 {p:2:What if I, Furudo Erika, recorded a knocking sound on a cassette tape,
 secretly installed it somewhere, and set it up so that it would start playing at exactly midnight?
 Of course, I wasn\'t in the mansion at midnight.}
 There aren\'t any problems with this, are there?"
"There are no {f:5:problems}.
 However, the knock serves to alert everyone to the existence of the letter, and does so precisely because the letter is on the other side of the {f:5:door}.
 If the letter had fallen in the kitchen, for instance, I do not think that the knock would have served to inform anyone of the letter\'s {f:5:existence}."
If the trick in Erika\'s theory about the letter being stuck to the serving cart was accurate,
 then the location that the letter fell was a matter of luck.
The people in the dining hall were able to notice it due to the knock only because it had fortunately fallen near the door.
However, if the location it fell was a matter of chance,
 ......it might have landed in the far‐off kitchen,
 ...or even remained stuck the entire time.
If that had happened, the knock would have been ignored as though they\'d just imagined it.
In other words, the knock by itself carries no message at all.
Only in combination with the letter...
is the knock capable of asserting that someone existed there.
In that case, the knock can\'t be combined with the theory of the letter falling from the bottom of a serving cart at a random location.
The letter must be reliably positioned "on the other side of the door" so that it can be discovered thanks to the knock.
However,
 it was declared in red that {p:1:no one in the mansion placed the letter in the hallway}.
"I\'ll reword that red about placing it in the hallway a bit.
 {p:1:No one in the mansion placed the letter in the hallway.
 That goes for every conceivable possibility: directly, indirectly, intentionally, coincidentally, and unintentionally}."
"......For example, let\'s assume there was a device on the serving cart that drops the letter when it stops moving.
 The culprit could predict that the cart would probably stop when those two knocked on the door to the dining hall,
 so you might think that with this theory, you could cleverly make it so that the letter drops right in front of the door."
"But even this doesn\'t work, okay?
 The action of "stopping the serving cart" would indirectly lead to "placing the letter in the hallway".
 That would mean that Shannon and Kanon, who were pushing the cart, "indirectly and unintentionally" placed the letter there!
 So even this is no good!"
"Furthermore, any setup so the letter peels off with the passage of time...
would mean that the people who pushed the serving cart to that location "coincidentally and unintentionally" placed the letter there.
 Of course, this is also no good!!"
"Repetition requested.
 "At midnight, only Erika, George, Jessica, Maria, Nanjo, Gohda, and Kumasawa existed outside the mansion"."
Say, if someone in the dining hall slipped out the window just for the instant of midnight,
 ......and "didn\'t exist in the mansion" at that time......
With a bit of wordplay like that, it might be possible to get around the red truth.
"......Repetition requeeeeeest...?
 I know I\'m being generous with the red, but aren\'t you getting a bit greedy?
 I\'m not an idiot like Beato,
 so I\'m not gonna go blabbing all the repetitions my opponent asks for..."
".........I\'ll give you a full‐body massage scrub in a bath with marshmallows and konpeitou sometime soon.
 Hard enough to rub your skin off."
"Eheheheheh, now you\'ve gotta keep that promise. *slurp*!
 ......Alright, then, here\'s a freebie{p:0:♪}
 I\'ll respond to your repetition request.
 "{p:1:At midnight, only Erika, George, Jessica, Maria, Nanjo, Gohda, and Kumasawa existed outside the mansion}"!"
In other words, try as we might, those eight people, including Erika, cannot exist inside the mansion, much less in front of the door.
And at the same time, try as we might, those who were inside the mansion cannot exist outside the mansion.
"{p:2:In that case, the letter might have been stuck to the ceiling of the hallway instead of the serving cart.
 The ceiling of the hallway is surprisingly high, so even if you just stuck it there out in the open, maybe no one would notice it.
 This way, it would certainly fall in the corridor.
 And you can slip by the red if someone outside the mansion did this}!
 <Good> job, me...!"
"For your attention: I beg to inform you of the following.
 {p:1:The letter never existed on the ceiling of the hallway}."
"For your attention: I beg to inform you of the following.
 {p:1:Know that the letter never touched the serving cart}."
".........Wh‐who cares about that?!
 The point is, some{y:0: Human}{n:0:one} outside the mansion used some kind of trick to place the letter there!!
 I know what you\'re trying to do, use that letter and knock to argue that {f:5:Beatrice} exists! Well, it definitely won\'t work on Furudo Erika!"
"For your attention: I beg to inform you of the following.
 {p:1:It was impossible for anyone outside the mansion to influence anything inside the mansion after the start of the family conference}."
"Then someone outside the mansion set up some kind of gimmick before the family conference.
 Something other than the ceiling or the serving cart!"
"For your attention: blue truth, invalid."
"Why...?!!
 That\'s the only possibility, right?!
 Someone outside the mansion used some kind of trick other than the ceiling or the serving cart...!!"
"F‐For your attention:
 unless you can specify or hypothesize {i:what kind} of trick, it will not be recognized as blue truth."
"For your attention:
 Lady Erika\'s blue truths regarding the letter have all been destroyed."
"All been destroyed......?!
 Take a little more care how you speak to me, you useless furniture!
 If I can just think of that trick, it\'s an instant checkmate...!
 {i:All been destroyed?!} Blue truth invalid?!
 I am...
...the detective...
...Furudo Erika...!
 ......How dare you speak to me like that.........!!"
Erika\'s face twisted.
......These words that seemed to deny Erika...
no, Erika\'s deductions...were the worst form of torture and humiliation for her.
"......Miss Erika.
 Why don\'t we postpone the mystery of the letter for {f:5:now}?
 ...Your blue stake regarding the knock, "someone outside the mansion played it with a cassette tape", is still {f:5:valid}.
 If it was possible to solve the noise, then it should be possible to solve the letter as {f:5:well}."
As Erika made to grab and pull Gertrude\'s hair, Dlanor stopped her with those words.
"That\'s right, my blue truth regarding the knock is still valid...!
 It\'s not true that everything\'s been denied...!!
 My master! I will solve the mystery of the letter without fail!
 Please allow me more time...!!"
"However, on the mystery of the knock, I\'ve produced results!
 I\'ve driven in the blue stake that "{p:2:someone outside the mansion set things up with a cassette tape or something to make a knock sound play}"...!"
"Eheheheheheheheheheheh...!
 Bern, your piece really is a cute kid.
 Very lively.
 She\'s shouting for your forgiveness, saying she may have resigned on one of the riddles, but she did solve the other.
 What are you going to do? Will you forgive her......?"
"...............Well, let me see.
 Normally, I\'d never forgive one of my pieces for the utter disgrace of surrendering,
 ......but if she\'s managed to solve one of the mysteries, maybe I\'ll let it slide for now......"
"M‐......my master......"
When {f:5:Bernkastel} said she\'d let it slide, Erika couldn\'t hide her relief.
"{i:Then it\'s time to get punished}, Erika‐chan{p:0:♪}"
{a:c:
{p:1:None of the characters would misidentify a knocking sound}.}
".........Oh?
 What\'s that supposed to mean?"
"{p:1:Misidentifying a knocking sound means this:
 they would not mistake a sound very similar to a knocking sound for a real knocking sound.
 Hitting a pillar to make something similar to a knocking sound is no good.
 When you record a knocking sound on a cassette tape and play it back, it becomes "the sound of a tape with a knocking sound on it", and not a knocking sound.
 So that\'s no good either}!"
"{p:1:In other words, all of them would correctly distinguish a knocking sound of something truly hitting the door,
 and they definitely wouldn\'t mishear it.
 It\'s totally impossible that any sounds except hitting that door directly would be misinterpreted as a knock}!!"
"Wh‐......what the......
 But that means......at the time the clock struck midnight,
 no one existed who could have hit the door......
 Gggh, ggghgghhhhh......"
"Yep, they don\'t exist.
 After all, it was the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice} who hit it.
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!!"
".........So in other words, there\'s no way around this other than hitting the door.
 So what about this?
 {p:2:There was some kind of device that could knock on the door.
 There was something like an automatic door knocker, and that made it possible for someone to knock without touching the door with their hands}."
"{p:1:‘To knock’ means someone hitting a door with their hand}!
 I won\'t accept hitting it with some contraption, eheh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eheh!!"
"They heard a knock at the same time as the clock struck midnight.
 Everyone inside the dining hall definitely heard it at that time.
 {p:1:And none of them would misinterpret a knocking sound.
 Krauss, Natsuhi, and Genji had no involvement in any knocking.
 No one else existed inside the mansion.
 And a "knock" refers to the action of standing directly in front of a door and hitting it with a hand}."
"......Hey, Bern.
 What do you think of my red?
 Don\'t you think this is pretty uncomplicated and enjoyable for something before the first twilight?
 The Golden Witch descended quietly with a knocking sound.
 *giggle*giggle*, ehe{0}he{0}he{0}he{0}he{0}he{0}he{0}he{0}he{0}he{0}he{0}he{0}heheh...!"
"..............................
 *giggle*giggle*.
 Ahhah{0}hah{0}ha{0}ha{0}hah{0}ha{0}haha!!
 This is interesting. This really is fascinating, Lambda...!
 Now we\'re talking.
 Ah, this is great!
 Aha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!"
The two witches doubled over laughing,
 as though this was the most fun thing in the world...
"Gah, ............
 ...M‐...my master...
 Have no fear.
 As long as my little gray cells are given the time, I will definitely reach an answer to this pitiful red...!"
"Is that so? Thank you.
 ......And I\'m disappointed, Erika.
 You\'ve bored me, Erika.
 As my piece and double, the fact that you have nothing is so pathetic, it\'s comical.
 If you don\'t know the answer, then be silent forever, please.
 And please open your mouth {i:only} when you know the answer."
".........You\'re nothing but a piece.
 Your absence wouldn\'t hinder my progress in this game in the slightest.
 If you can\'t think of any theories in particular, please just go back to the piece tray and gather dust or something.
 It\'s painful to even reserve space in my memory for useless pieces."
"......Bern {i:is} pretty forgetful.
 If you don\'t try a little harder, Bern\'s gonna forget you, you know...?
 You\'ll collect dust in that forgotten piece tray, awaiting your turn that will never come.
 ......I imagine that\'d be pretty harsh, don\'t you think...?"
"Ha‐have no fear, Great Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}, and my master...!
 I promise to deliver such a spectacular performance to earn your approval that you will never be disappointed in me again...!"
"............Oh, how reassuring. I guess you\'re my double after all.
 ......Then you\'d better make sure you do work hard, in all kinds of ways.
 If you don\'t make an impact, I might forget all about you......"
As the two witches giggled, they continued discussing the letter and the knock.
There was no room for Erika to step in.
If she resigned herself to that,
 ......she would literally have no place to go,
 ......and would be buried in an eternal oblivion.
Erika endured with a hideous expression, looking with shame at the back of the master who was ignoring her.
And with both fists clenched, she thought frantically for some kind of breakthrough.
I am the detective, I am Furudo Erika.
{n}I am the piece and double and servant of the great Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}...!!
I\'ll definitely make her satisfied...
satisfied...
definitely, definitely,
 gah, ggghggghhhhhh,
 ......Ushiromiya Battler...
...how dare you...
...humiliate me so............
As she stood there, ignored by the witches and shrouded in darkness,
 it looked like she had been made to go stand on her own in the hallway...
With the crime in the early morning, we\'d completely forgotten about breakfast,
 so we now had our first meal of the day at a time that could never be called breakfast time...
Even Gohda‐san\'s wonderful meal, which had supposedly been in the works since yesterday night, provided no comfort.
The several empty seats quietly burdened us with a pain‐filled sadness......
Then, in the middle of this meal that felt like a vigil, Erika suddenly stood up.
Everyone focused on her to see what was the matter.
Her expression was somewhere on the line between invigorated and insane, as though she\'d come up with some groundbreaking and strange invention.
"......Hey, what\'s up?
 Are you okay...?"
"I\'ve got it, I\'ve got it!!
 Did you think I wouldn\'t be able to work it out?
 Oh, I understand perfectly well, there\'s no way something so stupid could happen...!"
With an ugly expression covered with cold sweat, Erika glared and lashed out at Battler.
".........You\'ve got it?
 ......Got what......?"
"There\'s no way you jumped down from the third‐floor study...!
 Not one of us saw you fall down and land in the courtyard...!!"
"....................."
"{p:2:When you set up the ladder from the courtyard and saw Rudolf‐san go up it to the third‐story window,
 you closely observed the structure of the outer wall and realized that by cleverly using the rain gutters and other handholds, it would be possible to descend to the courtyard from the third‐floor window...!
 You didn\'t {i:jump down}!
 You used the rain gutters and so on and clambered down the outer wall like a loser}!!
 What do you think of my blue truth?!! Come on, where\'s your rebuttal?!"
".........My rebuttal?"
"You have no rebuttal?
 Then my truth is valid, yes?!
 There, you see?!
 {p:2:It may have looked like you jumped down all dramatically, but it was all an illusion!
 All you actually did was jump out and grab desperately onto the rain gutter}...!!"
"..................
 ......My argument then was about whether it was possible for Grandfather to escape from the study, remember...?
 And it was possible for Grandfather to escape through the window.
 All I did was prove that.
 ......Whether either of us jumped down or clambered down makes no difference."
"Don\'t try to change the subject!!
 A mere {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} can\'t jump down from the third floor...!!
 How do you like that, how do you like that...?!!
 What do you think of my reasoning, my master...?!!"
"......Are you short of sleep or something?
 Just calm down and eat your food."
When he escaped to the courtyard through the window...
Battler really did use the rain gutter to crawl down the wall, just like Erika said.
His hand slipped halfway, and he fell from a considerable height,
 but he managed to land on his feet without injuring himself.
......No one witnessed this,
 but most likely, everyone except Erika currently in the dining hall had realized that something like this had happened.
No one had believed that he\'d jumped down from the third‐floor window in the first place.
......Even if they hadn\'t witnessed it directly.
So they had no clue what Erika was complaining about and obsessing over all of a sudden,
 and started to whisper, glancing at her with cold eyes and dubious faces......
"You can\'t argue back, can you?!
 Your jumping was denied!
 My truth won out!!
 My blue truth is valid!"
"Please acknowledge this, my master!!
 I am not incompetent or a disappointment...!
 I will match up to your expectations without fail, so please don\'t abandon me!! My master...!!"
Facing someone that might have been somewhere beyond the ceiling, Erika spread her arms and yelled.
Then, .........as if in answer, a massive lightning bolt landed very close by.
It was an incredible sound.
 They could even feel the earth shake.
At the same time as that sound, Erika went limp,
 falling into her seat like a puppet who\'d just had all its strings cut.
Then, as the sound of wind and rain gradually filled the room once again,
 ......Erika slowly opened her eyes as though recovering from a bout of dizziness.
Then, she continued eating in silence as though nothing had happened.
As if she had been acting normally the whole time.
......Didn\'t Erika just stand up suddenly and rant at someone......?
Erika continued eating quietly, her behavior so perfectly normal that everyone started to doubt themselves.
After seeing her behaving so calmly, ......everyone convinced themselves that they were totally worn out,
 and that they must have just hallucinated Erika suddenly yelling.
So Erika\'s sudden transfiguration of a few seconds ago was treated as a daydream,
 and faded out of everyone\'s memory......
Erika quietly poked at her salad and muttered in a voice no one could hear.
Thank you very much, Great Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}......
 I am Furudo Erika.
 I am my master\'s piece and her double.
 ......I will most certainly present you with an incredible tale.
 Eheheh{0}eheh......
"Oh, yes, knives and forks are such primitive utensils, aren\'t they?
 Chopsticks are best.
 They\'re the easiest way to eat a salad, don\'t you agree?
 Well, everyone?""Battler‐san returned to the guesthouse at {nobr:3 a.m.}
 Then, the rest of you split up about thirty minutes later, is that correct?"
"Yes, that\'s right.
 We were getting pretty tired by that point.
 We decided to take a short rest before starting up again."
To smoke out the murderer of the first twilight,
 Erika closely questioned everyone involved to check their alibis and evidence.
To confirm these, she went around the mansion with them,
 and when needed, took several trips out to the guesthouse through all the rain.
......Her vitality was admirable.
......Though she was an uninvited guest,
 everyone had long since stopped feeling anything strange about the way she imitated a detective...
"......It seems Erika is also steadily building her foundation."
"It\'s useless.
 Whether alibis exist or not, she can\'t deny our existence.
 ......Kinzo escaped through the window and is now one with the mists of Rokkenjima.
 She can never capture or deny him."
"When all\'s said and done, perhaps you could say he\'s escaped to the underside of the chessboard."
"In that case, maybe it would be appropriate to say he\'s been stored away."
"......Come to think of it, about those corpses from the first twilight.
 They\'ve been stored away too, right?"
"Yes.
 They\'ve been put away in my darkness between the human world and the other."
"......And that would‐be detective won\'t be able to find them...?"
"Of course.
 It\'s absolutely impossible for a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.
 .........Want to check?"
"Just in case.
 And we also need to take this opportunity to reexamine what Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}\'s goals are likely to be from now on."
"As they say, if you know your enemy, you need not fear the outcome of a hundred battles."
"If you know the truth, you can win a hundred battles without fighting."
"Pukkukukukuku.
 Quite so."
Gaap opened up a large pitch‐black hole in the sky and had it swallow all of them up.
She invited Beato and Ronove to the gap between worlds where she had hidden the corpses......
......That place was nowhere in this world,
 and existed at no time of this world.
In other words, it truly and literally was a place not of this world.
In this place, questions such as "Where is this?" and "What time is it?" had no meaning.
Every single place led to here, but no place could be reached from here.
Furthermore, all times connected to this place, but no time could be passed to from here.
In short, ......this place was just what they said it was: the underside of the chessboard.
No, perhaps it would be most appropriate to call this the captured pile, where pieces that have left the game go......
......Then, deep within this pitch‐black world,
 five corpses came into view, illuminated by a glow like a faint spotlight......
The five pitiful corpses with their necks sliced open had been arranged neatly.
Their eyelids were shut and their hands joined.
{n}Apparently, even Gaap had respect for the dead...
"Oh my.
 .........There are five sacrifices for the first twilight in this game?
 Not six?"
"Oh, it\'s you, Master.
 I was worried about where you\'d gone.
 The game has already reached the first twilight, and as you can see, the first victims have emerged.
 ......Now it\'s time for the real show. I\'m getting all excited...!"
"I see.
 .........The version of you that\'s here looks to be in high spirits.
 I\'m pleased."
"Hm??
 If you took away my high spirits, my bewitching <body>,
 and my pleasant disposition, I\'d have nothing left!
 Wahaha."
For some reason, {f:5:Virgilia} praised Beato for her high spirits.
Though Beato was taken aback at such granny‐like words coming out of {f:5:Virgilia}\'s mouth all of a sudden,
 she answered while bumping a fist against her chest.
{f:5:Virgilia} had been absent often during this game.
She might even have been away from her seat when Battler solved the epitaph and during the uproar that followed.
Apparently, she had been absent for so many critical points...
that she didn\'t have a very good grasp of what had happened so far in this game...
"For now, we\'ve got five corpses.
 ......All slit through the neck, as you can see."
George, Jessica, Maria, Rosa, Genji.
Something sharp had sliced open all five of their necks......
Those gaping wounds opened wider than their mouths,
 ......and made it feel as though they would no longer need their mouths to breathe.
"......I see.
 So, {p:1:anyone looking at George, Jessica, Maria, Rosa, or Genji\'s corpses could confirm at a glance that they are dead}."
"Hmm?
 Red?
 Well, there\'s no point in me holding out against you.
 That\'s right,
 {p:1:at a glance, anyone could confirm that these corpses are dead, so it is absolutely impossible that they are just people playing dead}."
"Why did Lia use the red......?"
"Who knows.
 ......However, she is always thinking of Milady.
 She must have something in mind that will benefit Milady."
"......Hmmm."
But they had hidden the corpses here so that no one could use the red...
Despite that, however, Ronove was right—{f:5:Virgilia} always thought of {f:5:Beatrice} first.
The way that these corpses, which Gaap had gone to all the trouble of erasing, had now been confirmed with the red made a slightly displeased expression rise to Gaap\'s face.
However, in the end she remembered that she was only a guest and shrugged.
"Why did you have Gaap hide the corpses?"
"Well,
 since the epitaph has already been solved, this game of mine is different from usual.
 I now have serving and protecting Natsuhi as my goal."
"...........................
 How would concealing their corpses protect Natsuhi?"
"......We\'ve more or less figured out what our opponents\' moves will be.
 This is probably a trap made to corner Natsuhi.
 Most likely, they\'ll sort through alibis for the first twilight and find them for everyone except Natsuhi."
"Last night, Natsuhi‐sama was the first to leave the family conference, and then rested alone in her room.
 ......Unfortunately, she has no alibi whatsoever until the next morning."
"We have already ensured that Kinzo\'s existence is impossible to disprove.
 ......However, the enemy has one remaining method of breaking through that roadblock."
"I see.
 .........They can corner Natsuhi and make her confess that Kinzo doesn\'t exist."
"Mm.
 The enemy is probably after something like that.
 By watching the movements of the pieces involved with the family conference, we quickly realized that Natsuhi was isolated,
 noticed that trap of theirs, and countered with this move."
"The corpses disappear!
 Everyone has alibis, and no one exists who could have moved them.
 Not only does this support the claim that a witch exists, it also throws doubt on whether they were actually dead in the first place,
 making it just about possible for Natsuhi to avoid being a suspect."
"In other words, it\'s possible for Natsuhi‐sama to claim...
that the sacrifices of the first twilight were only playing dead."
"Even though many people confirmed their deaths for certain in the cousins\' room...?"
"‘Confirmation’ is nowhere near red truth...!
 No matter how strongly they claim to have seen unmistakeable corpses, the red truth doesn\'t exist in the human world!
 Because the corpses don\'t exist, Natsuhi can discount their words as a mistake,
 a trick, or by saying that all of them were lying,
 and it\'s possible for her to do this over and over to buy time for herself."
"In the human world, which lacks the red truth, perpetual check is an effective move."
"An endless argument with both sides denying the other\'s claims.
 ......Not pretty."
"True.
 However, beauty is secondary to victory.
 If someone who cannot achieve victory seeks it, it is nothing but a poison to them."
"They do say that might makes right.
 Wahahahahaha."
"And even if I don\'t think it\'s beautiful,
 those Voyager witches will probably like it and say it isn\'t boring..."
"............I see.
 I\'ve managed to grasp the flow of this game.
 ...It seems that it will get quite nasty."
"We\'re fully aware of that.
 ......And we already know that Natsuhi is probably about to be lured into yet another trap."
"A trap?"
"Mm.
 Someone Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} created, who calls himself a man from 19 years ago, has already threatened Natsuhi.
 She was ordered to go into a closet in a certain guest room at {nobr:1 p.m.}, which is only a few minutes away, and hide there.
 ......Krauss was taken as a hostage, so Natsuhi can\'t resist."
".........I see.
 How relentless.
 ...Can you protect her?"
"Of course.
 After all, Natsuhi isn\'t the culprit.
 No matter how much they treat her as one, both truth and illusions are on our side.
 There\'s no way we can lose.
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"
Natsuhi threw her cup of black tea to the ground in protest to show the anger that flowed throughout her entire body.
"......Wh‐what do you mean by that...?!!
 A‐are you......saying that you suspect me?!!"
"I hear what you\'re saying: you left before anyone else, returned to your room, and didn\'t leave that room until morning.
 I am simply explaining that I need you to prove that, otherwise it won\'t count as an alibi."
"Prove it...?!
 How...?!!"
"Any way you like.
 All you have to do is prove objectively that it was impossible for you to commit the crime.
 .........Everyone else is cooperating.
 I would very much appreciate it if you could also be a little less harsh with me and please give me your alibi and evidence."
"......That\'s right.
 The whole night is a blank space in time for Natsuhi nee‐san.
 ......After she left the conference saying she was going to bed, she might have gone to the guesthouse and attacked George and the others..."
"Don\'t be so ridiculous!!
 Why would I kill George‐kun, and most of all, whyever would I kill my own daughter?!!"
"Calm down.
 ......We\'re all equally suspicious.
 It\'s sad, but we all have to prove our innocence."
"Yeah.
 We\'ve all been thinking frantically about how to prove our alibis for last night so we can clear up the suspicion against us."
"I know you can\'t like being suspected, Natsuhi‐san.
 If it frustrates you, shouldn\'t your first priority be searchin\' for some way to prove your own innocence...?"
The relatives spoke as though they were all under equal suspicion,
 but the mood about the place didn\'t feel so peaceful.
Erika was still in the middle of confirming everything,
 but other than Natsuhi, who was unwilling to prove her alibi,
 everyone else had an alibi which was reasonably credible.
Only Natsuhi, who claimed that just being suspected was an insult, was uncooperative with Erika,
 and her position began to grow more and more perilous......
This parlor was no longer a place of comfort for Natsuhi.
{n}And the sound of the cup smashing had made that decisive.
"Th‐......this is ridiculous!
 Why must I be suspected when I\'ve lost a daughter...?!!
 You\'re maliciously trying to make me look like the culprit just because I went to bed early last night!
 I cannot stand this humiliation any further...!!"
"Oh, so what are you going to do about it?
 Show us some kind of alibi that proves your innocence.
 As if you could!!
 Give me back my George, you murderer!!"
"Give it a rest, Eva...!
 ......Natsuhi‐san, you\'re probably a little tired too.
 Of course, so are we.
 Why don\'t we take it easy for a bit...?"
".........Seriously.
 We\'re a little too high‐strung."
"Aunt Natsuhi......
 Where are you going...?"
"This search for alibis and culprits is truly ludicrous...!
 When the typhoon passes and the police arrive, everything will be exposed to the light of day.
 There\'s no reason whatsoever for us to play detectives.
 Am I wrong, Erika‐san?"
"Generally speaking, you would be right.
 However, I have the authority to do this."
Who gave her that authority?
 No one asked.
It was an authority given by words of power from a higher world,
 so the pieces weren\'t even allowed to doubt it...
"I will take my leave.
 I have no intention of playing along with your pointless questioning until the police are here.
 If you suspect me, feel free to do so.
 I will leave it to the police to investigate that and clear my name."
.........It may be a bit late to mention this, but—well, no, this happens every time.
As usual, the phone couldn\'t connect to the police.
Natsuhi said the police would come, but that wasn\'t exactly true.
Strictly speaking, the boat to pick them up would come tomorrow, and they would be able to use the radio on that boat to contact the police.
Well, ......it\'s not like I\'ll let everyone live that long anyway.
...*giggle*.
"......Natsuhi‐san, it\'s dangerous to be alone...
 Perhaps it would be better if you......"
"Why not let her?
 That might make for some excellent proof.
 If Natsuhi nee‐san gets murdered in her own room, that\'ll be excellent proof of her innocence."
"Quit it, Aneki.
 .........It\'s probably best if we all get a bit of rest.
 Our bodies won\'t last until tomorrow."
"Rest is fine, but let\'s not let our guard down, okay...?
 We might not make it through the night, much less tomorrow."
"............Aunt Natsuhi.
 If you\'re returning to your room, make sure you lock it tight, close the windows and shutters, and stay safe.
 ......I don\'t want to suspect anyone.
 And more than that, ......I don\'t want there to be any more victims."
".........Thank you, Battler‐kun.
 .........Then I\'ll return to my room.
 Gohda, you\'re in charge now.
 I know this is a horrible situation, but make sure that the guests at least have everything they need."
"Y‐yes, Madam......
 I shall do so......"
With everyone watching her, Natsuhi left the parlor.
From their faces, she could tell that they were expecting the classic mystery pattern...
that the first person to quarrel and leave the circle would become the next victim.
............Natsuhi......couldn\'t disobey because of the threat against Krauss, who had been taken as a hostage.
Very soon, it would be {nobr:1 p.m.}, the time that had been arranged.
She was to hide for an hour in the closet of a specific guest room.
It was easy to suspect that this bizarre order was a trap to select her as the next sacrifice.
She thought of various ways to resist,
 but all methods would be useless against a culprit who had a hostage and was observing her from close by...
So Natsuhi could do nothing but obediently follow his orders,
 and then claim that she had been forced to do this for her husband\'s safety...
As the arranged time had drawn near,
 Natsuhi had intentionally acted annoyed and smashed the cup on the ground to give her an excuse for slipping out of the parlor.
.........At any rate, no matter how cowardly a trap it may be, ......I cannot disobey now.
I am now the one who carries the burden of the One‐winged Eagle.
......Now that my husband, Krauss, has been captured,
 I must protect it even if I have to crawl through the mud...
".............................."
......Of course, I am prepared to do that.
 I am Ushiromiya Natsuhi.
Even if I am not permitted to bear the One‐winged Eagle on my clothes,
 .........Father gave me permission to bear it in my heart......
".............................."
......I think dashing away in a rage got me here without raising too much suspicion.
So far......everything has gone well.
Before my eyes was the doorknob of the specified guest room.
{n}......However, ...I wondered about the lock.
The servants are under orders to always lock any unused rooms.
......What will I do if it\'s locked...?
I dashed out of the parlor pretending that I was returning to my room.
Going back and asking a servant to unlock this guest room would be obviously suspicious...
If possible, ......I\'d like to get this eerie hide‐and‐seek over with without anyone noticing.
In that phone call from the one who claimed to be a man from 19 years ago,
 he said that I would win if no one found me, but lose if anyone did find me.
He said that he\'d release my husband whether I won or lost,
 ......but as a person with a hostage taken against me, I\'d rather not lose...
I don\'t like it at all, but I have to go along with this game.
I softly gripped the doorknob, ......and I could feel that it was unlocked.
Did Shannon or Kumasawa forget to lock it after cleaning?
......Or did that man unlock it in advance......?
That man...
...couldn\'t be waiting for me in this room, could he?
And then...
...he\'ll...
........................
All that about hide‐and‐seek might have been just an excuse.
I kept the fact that I was coming here secret, and all of the other people think I\'m resting in my room.
If I were to be killed in this situation, in this room,
 ......it might create a new baffling murder case, like an extension of the one which occurred this morning.
".........I‐...if that\'s what he\'s up to, so much the better.
 ...It will be a good chance to confront the culprit directly..."
Natsuhi had some experience with using a {ruby:Japanese polearm:naginata}, but only from casual lessons.
Unlike Eva, she couldn\'t brag about being able to hold off any single ruffian indefinitely.
As she was now, she had no realistic chance of prevailing over a man with malicious intent on her own, and no weapons that could make that possible.
".............................."
She readied herself......and slowly opened the door.
She couldn\'t afford to stand around in the corridor and risk being seen by someone...
The atmosphere inside the guest room......was ice‐cold,
 and she could sense no trace of a person waiting impatiently for her.
All she could hear were the unsettling sounds of the wind and rain.
At first, that seemed to be proof that no one existed to threaten her,
 ......but before long, it only stirred up the uneasy feeling inside her all the more...
The closet was just off to the side of anyone entering the room.
Lined up inside it was a set of hangers where guests could hang their coats.
This closet, which had nothing hanging in it, was large enough for even an adult to hide in...
She softly opened the closet.
 ......Of course, there was nothing inside.
She would have to hide quietly in here for an hour.
The room had a wood floor, but something like a carpet had been laid in the closet.
......It seemed that sitting down wouldn\'t be a problem.
She had been sure that someone would be waiting for her in this room,
 or that a strange letter would be lying in the closet.
......She had even imagined the worst, that her husband\'s corpse might be inside.
However, none of these things she imagined turned out to be true.
All that was here was a cold guest room...
and a lifeless closet which silently urged her to go inside......
"............And he told me...to hide in here for an hour...
 ......He\'s making fun of me."
Natsuhi shrugged, turned around, then locked and chained the guest room door.
"This way, no one will be able to get into this room.
 ......In other words, no one will be able to find me for the next hour.
 I win.
 What a stupid game of hide‐and‐seek."
This would certainly result in a total victory in the hide‐and‐seek game against that mystery man.
......However, it was such an easy victory, it made her feel uneasy.
This is normally against the rules of hide‐and‐seek...
......Even if I win, won\'t this displease the culprit?
And everyone thinks I\'m in my room right now.
If they find a room with a chain set, that will be an impossible locked room to them.
Erika was dashing around the mansion to confirm everyone\'s alibi.
If she notices that the chain is set on this room, there will probably be an uproar which will end in them cutting the chain and searching the room.
......If that happens, I\'ll be found hiding in the closet right away.
It would be easy for me to honestly confess why I was hiding.
But that man insisted that I not reveal that.
......If I tell them, ......I might be endangering my husband...
Thinking of it that way, setting the chain.........no, even locking the door might be a bad idea.
That\'s right.
 This room was unlocked when I came here.
If it were to suddenly become locked, it\'s conceivable that it might catch someone\'s attention.
......It\'s better if I don\'t do anything unnecessary...
{n}That man only told me to hide......
"............So in the end, ...I have no choice...but to do what he says......"
I hate doing it, ......but I can\'t disobey.
I undid both of those two precious locks,
 ......went into the dimly lit closet filled with the smell of old wood, and managed to close the door from the inside.
......Pitch black.
It reminded me of when I was young, when I used to hide somewhere and then surprise my mother,
 but that peaceful recollection wasn\'t enough to kill off my anxiety.
It really is pitch black.
From in here, I won\'t even be able to check my watch to see if an hour has passed.
I\'ll probably need to open the door a crack every once in a while to let in enough light for my watch.
......For now, .........I sat down and folded my legs.
I thought about holding my knees to my chest, but it hurt my back when I tried.
I\'m not as young as I used to be.
Even though I and the rest of my class were made to sit on the floor clasping our knees in every PE class as grade schoolers,
 I now have to struggle just to sit down.
Just sitting down here for an hour...
will probably hurt a lot......
"........................haah............"
I can\'t believe.........he expects me to sit in the darkness for a full hour, listening only to the wind and the rain.
Ironically, Natsuhi had made Jessica do the exact same thing in the past.
She had done it to scold Jessica\'s persistent bad habits and teach her a lesson when she was a little girl.
She had thought that making Jessica stay put in the darkness would sprout a desire to reflect on her mistakes,
 and that, this way, she would understand what she had done wrong.
......To Natsuhi, it almost felt like......she was being made to do the same thing.
If that was the true purpose of this hide‐and‐seek......
.......................................
"......How naive of me."
This must be my naivety, the hope that if his goal is to make me repent,
 nothing will happen here during this hour...
Uncertainty and fear of that man\'s shadow are not what I need right now.
Will someone suddenly come to this room, open this closet,
 ......and do something horrible to me now that I\'ve come here in total secrecy as promised?
......That\'s what I should be worrying about.
The culprit, ......or one of his accomplices, is very close by.
{n}If they weren\'t, they wouldn\'t be able to observe me so thoroughly.
I don\'t want to think it, but it\'s highly likely that the culprit bought off one of the servants.
The culprit was able to hide an eerie card with "autumn" written on it in my room.
My personal room is always locked.
{n}That trick wouldn\'t have been possible without a key.
Instead of believing that they obtained the key when the servants weren\'t looking,
 it\'s much more realistic to assume that one of the servants lent the culprit a hand...
"Still,
 .........h‐how...
......did they know that autumn is my favorite season.........?
 .........How ghastly........."
The thought that this mystery man might be peeking into my heart sent goosebumps running across my whole body...
It\'s true that I like autumn, but I\'ve never said that out loud.
{n}I don\'t think anyone\'s ever asked me, either.
......I could even ask my husband what my favorite season is and he would probably be stuck for an answer.
............N‐no.
{n}There was one time, one time I told it to a single person.........
That\'s right.
 ...............Shannon...
On an autumn day long ago, I happened to be in a good mood,
 and I mentioned that autumn was my favorite of the four seasons.
......I can\'t believe it... Then the culprit, or one of their accomplices, has to be Shannon...!
"Only Shannon could know that I like autumn...
 ......In that case, ......this is clear proof that Shannon is involved...!
 That card with "autumn" on it is proof...!
 ......Incredible...
 After ten years of being provided for by our family........."
I trembled and shook with rage.
......Didn\'t Kinzo once say that the emotion of anger...
is the fastest sedative to cure fear and uncertainty?
It\'s easy to tell the most fearful humans from within a crowd.
They\'re always the first to get angry.
......I remember him telling me that.
So I realized that this anger was a sign that I was actually frightened,
 and I tried my best to remain calm...
......However, this is a fascinating clue that I can use to turn things around.
Shannon may not be reliable as a servant,
 but if she\'s the accomplice used by that mystery man, this might actually be convenient.
She\'s a timid girl.
 If I threaten her, she\'ll probably spill the name of the mastermind in an instant.
I\'ll tell the police about this in secret.
{n}I\'m certain it will be a big clue that will help in arresting the culprit.
"......That card was probably meant to surprise me and control me,
 ......but he\'s actually dug his own grave."
{a:c:
{p:1:I never told anyone except Shannon that I like autumn}.}
This is unshakable proof that she\'s working with the culprit......
Though I\'d thought this time in the closet would crush me with uncertainty and uneasiness, it had actually given me the start of a counterattack.
If I hadn\'t been given this time in the darkness, I probably wouldn\'t have noticed this.
I felt almost grateful to the culprit for making up this foolish game.
......My mood brightened.
...I still couldn\'t guarantee that my husband was safe, but I was determined to take him back and force the culprit to face judgment...
I gripped my fists tightly, and further strengthened my resolve to avoid losing this fight at any cost...
Rattle, rattle!!
At that moment, I heard the sudden sound of someone trying to force a locked door open,
 and my heart leapt.
"......Oh, it was unlocked."
The voice was Hideyoshi\'s.
{n}I heard a quiet voice, as though he was talking to himself, coming from what was probably the hallway.
Apparently, he had thought it was locked and tried to unlock it,
 but had ended up locking the unlocked door instead.
Once again, there was the sound of the lock turning, and this time, the door opened with a faint sound......
......Why...
...is Hideyoshi‐san in this room......?!
Footsteps which sounded like his came in, and there was the sound of him closing and locking the door behind him.
Then came what seemed to be the sound of him setting the chain.
.........Don\'t tell me...
...Hideyoshi‐san...
...is the mastermind...?!
{n}Or else, an accomplice...?!
Is he planning to do something to me in this room...?
The door may only be locked from the inside, but it will still take some time to remove the chain.
......If Hideyoshi‐san doesn\'t intend to let me escape from here,
 there\'s no chance he\'ll give me time to fumble around with the chain...
In that case.........
......when he opens the closet door wide in just a moment...
...and looks down upon me sitting here pathetically,
 ......just what kind of horrifying words will he say...?
I don\'t want to be found, I don\'t want to be found...
{n}I beg you, pass right on by the closet door...
{n}Please keep going into the center of the room......!
My head was filled almost to bursting with a throbbing sound so loud that I almost missed hearing his noisy footsteps.
So when I heard a clunking sound coming from the center of the room,
 I finally realized that he\'d passed by the closet, and was deeply relieved.
"......Just in case.
 Can\'t tell if it\'s day or night in this weather anyway."
As he muttered, he did something that made a clunking sound.
{n}......He was probably closing the shutters on the windows.
Just in case?
{n}In case I try to escape out the window...?
No, ......that can\'t be it.
That\'s right.
When I left the parlor, everyone was talking about possibly taking a break.
After all, several murders had occurred.
 And the weather was bad.
{n}......There would be nothing abnormal about resting in a guest room here instead of returning to the guesthouse.
In that case, locking up and closing the shutters to guarantee safety was the proper course of action to take.
When he finished closing the shutters,
 ......there was a thunk
 as though he had flopped over on the bed.
......It was surprising how much of the situation could be grasped just by the sound.
.........What\'s going on here......?
Did the man from 19 years ago......plan all this out to put me in the same room as Hideyoshi‐san...?
No, ......that probably...isn\'t true.
Clearly he planned on me hiding here,
 ......but Hideyoshi‐san coming to take a rest here must have been outside the scope of his plan.
Thinking about it that way, .........having him in the room...
might help to secure my own safety in an odd sort of way.
......Unlike his wife, Hideyoshi‐san is the kind of person I can talk to.
{n}If Eva‐san comes, things will probably get complicated.
Maybe I should slip out of this closet now while he\'s still alone,
 reveal everything just to him, and ask for help......
But if I do that, my husband might be killed...
It isn\'t wise to do anything rash until my husband is released......
Should I go out and talk, or hide in here?
Moaning from my headache and biting my lower lip, I resisted the temptation to crawl out of here...
Even if I talk with Hideyoshi‐san, I don\'t know where my husband is being held.
 I\'m sure the informant who\'s observing me is nearby as well.
Just talking to him won\'t solve everything.
......I suspect that Shannon is an informant, but that doesn\'t mean that Gohda and the others aren\'t.
......It\'s no good......
 Leaving here and confessing is just too dangerous...
Eventually, ......I heard a strange, sobbing voice.
......Whose voice was it......?
I strained my ears, trying to hear that strange voice,
 .........and was shocked to discover that it was Hideyoshi weeping...
Now that he was all alone like this, Hideyoshi, ......who had lost his only son,
 was finally able to shed tears and cry...
......Thinking that he needed to support Eva in her distress, he had acted as though he alone was standing firm.
However, he had as good a right as anyone to cry.
......And now that he had found a place where no one could see his tears,
 he was finally allowing himself to let it out...
............I\'ve...
...lost my daughter too.
...I haven\'t seen her body with my own eyes, ......so it still doesn\'t really feel like she\'s dead.
But if the one who carried her off was the culprit...
and he had some repulsive motive for doing it, ......just thinking about it makes me feel as though my chest will tear itself apart...
The reason I\'m hiding in here now is that I\'m thinking more about my still living husband than my dead daughter.
......But if I were given the chance, ...I\'d be wailing at the top of my lungs too.
However, ......I still can\'t let myself do that.
......That isn\'t because the man from 19 years ago told me to hide.
It\'s because............I am the final...head of the Ushiromiya family......
It\'s been completely overshadowed by all of this,
 ......but last night, Battler‐kun found the hidden gold and even gained the Head\'s Ring from that mysterious envelope.
.........At the very, very end, when it\'s all over...
{n}I probably won\'t be able to prevent him from inheriting the family headship.
And when everything regarding the distribution of the inheritance is revealed,
 ......the Ushiromiya family honor and glory passed down from Father.........will plummet to the earth.
So, ......I am the final head.
Battler‐kun will probably inherit the remaining wealth of the Ushiromiya family.
However, its history and honor......will all end with my generation......
Therefore, ......I am the final head.
{n}I must not cry.
 .........Not yet.
Until I get my husband back......and avenge my daughter, I will not be allowed to shed tears......
As I listened to Hideyoshi‐san\'s sobs from the closet,
 I silently hung my head......
"Wh‐who are you...?!"
Huh?!
My heart leapt.
Hideyoshi‐san, who must have been lying prostrate on the bed, made a sound as though he had bounded to his feet.
......D‐......did he notice me......?
"How did you get in here......?
 ......Wh‐...what\'s that...?
 ......W‐wait a second...!
 Wai.........ngahh, ......mmpph—"
He was clearly in a struggle with someone.
......Who could it be?!
 No, it doesn\'t matter who it is.
It\'s probably the culprit, and they\'re probably trying to take Hideyoshi‐san\'s life at this very moment...!
Shouldn\'t I jump out of here and help him...?
{n}Even if I couldn\'t help him, I could at least call for help......
...No, but...if I do something like that, I\'ll be questioned about why I was hiding here...!
However, if Hideyoshi‐san goes on to get killed now......
No, now isn\'t the time to be saying that...
{n}At this rate, he\'ll definitely be killed...!
I\'ll jump out of here and help him right now...!
Aaah, but if I do that, even if I can save Hideyoshi‐san, ......I might be abandoning my husband\'s life.
Hideyoshi‐san\'s life and my husband\'s life.
{n}......How sinful it would be to try to weigh those against each other...!!
Just then, there was a loud sound of the door opening and the chain being pulled tight.
Someone was trying to open the door despite the chain being set.
"Honey, it\'s me.
 Could you open up?"
"......Eva, ......aah, gwaaaaaaggghhhh...!!"
"Honey?
 ...What?! What\'s happening?!
 Honey?!
 Open up!!"
"Ggh......
............gggh
............ggh........."
"Open up!
 Open up, honey!!
 S‐someooooooooooone!!"
She opened and closed the door over and over again with all her might, but of course, she couldn\'t snap the chain.
Eva‐san raced down the hallway calling for help in a loud voice......
By this time, the room had settled back into silence,
 ......and that earlier feeling of Hideyoshi being in a noisy struggle had disappeared completely.
What\'s.........going on here......?!
So, right now, ......I\'m in the same room as the murderer who killed Hideyoshi‐san......?!
In that case, the culprit should try to escape from the room as soon as possible, ......so why are they staying so quiet in here...?!
I haven\'t heard anything,
 ......nothing that might have been the culprit who attacked Hideyoshi‐san rushing away.
......No matter how much I strain my ears, I can\'t sense anyone in the room.
In fact, ......it\'s so silent that it makes what happened just a second ago feel like an illusion.
In other words, .........does this mean......that the culprit is holding his breath,
 standing right in front of this closet...
waiting for me to shamelessly come out......?
I don\'t even know what to be scared of anymore.
If only I could just melt away into the darkness of this closet...!
I mustn\'t remain in this room any longer.
{n}I get the feeling I have more to worry about than just my personal safety...
But what should I do?!
I don\'t even know if it\'s a good idea to leave this closet...!!
Before long, the clamor of many rushing footsteps approached.
I held my breath again and melted away into the darkness of the closet......
Eva dashed back, bringing everyone with her.
Gohda was gripping a bolt cutter.
{n}It was to cut the chain with.
After trying to open the door again and confirming that the chain was still set, she yelled through the crack in the door.
"Honey!!
 We\'re going to open this up...!!
 Cut it right now!!"
"Y‐yes...!"
Gohda stuck the large bolt cutter, which looked like it could slice off whole fingers,
 into the crack in the door and easily severed the chain.
"Dear!!"
As soon as it was severed, Eva pushed Gohda aside and dashed in.
The others tried to follow her, .........but they bumped into Eva, who had fallen to her knees, moaning.
So even though they couldn\'t tell much of what was going on inside the room,
 ...they could tell by Eva\'s moans that they were too late......
"......What the hell......"
"Honey...!! Honey{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}yyy!!
 Doctor Nanjo!!
 Look at my husband...! Quickly!!"
"I, I\'ll do it right now......"
"You\'ve got to be kidding me......
 ...It\'s only been about ten minutes since Uncle Hideyoshi went out saying he wanted to rest......"
"......Is there anyone in the bathroom?"
"N‐no...!
 There\'s no one here!"
"What could have happened, ...aaaaaahhhh......"
"Honey!!
 Honey{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}yyy...!!"
".........I\'m afraid to say...that there\'s nothing I can do......"
Nanjo stood up, hanging his head sadly.
It was only natural.
Because anyone, even if they weren\'t a doctor, would think that at a glance.
......Hideyoshi......was lying face down on the bed.
And stuck deep into his back.........was something like a blade with an intricate demonic design on it.
When Eva pulled it out with all her might,
 they could tell that it wasn\'t a blade, but some kind of stake.
And its sharp tip had penetrated nearly fifteen centimeters in.
It had probably dug deep into the lungs.
......If it had been stuck in any harder, the tip might even have pierced all the way through to the surface of his chest......
"Didn\'t I tell you to wait for me?!!
 Why did you go on alone...?!!
 Stupid, stupid,
 stupiii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}iiid!!
 Uwaaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhhh!!"
"......The culprit probably waited for us to get careless and split up......"
"That bastard......
 So he still hasn\'t had enough blood...?!"
"So he really is......hiding somewhere in this mansion...
...and coming after us......?"
"But there\'s something strange here.
 ......The doors and windows to this room are completely sealed."
"............ah.
 ...Th‐that\'s right.
 The shutters are all shut, and the chain was on the door until a second ago......"
"Huh?!
 Isn\'t that bizarre...?!
 In that case, how did the culprit attack Hideyoshi‐san in this room...?!"
"Perhaps they threw this stake through the crack in the door......!"
"Hideyoshi‐san\'s bed is in a total blind spot from this crack.
 You couldn\'t even kill him with a gun.
 .........This really is strange.
 It\'s a locked‐room murder."
"A, ......a locked‐room murder......"
"......It\'s a bit too early to be sure about that.
 Maybe the culprit removed the ceiling in the bathroom and escaped to the space above it, or maybe you can close the shutters from outside."
"The shutters.
 ............They didn\'t budge an inch from the outside.
 I just went and checked."
"......Erika........."
It was no wonder everything felt so quiet and relaxed.
{n}At some point, Erika had split from the group.
Just now, she had finally arrived and poked her face in from the hallway.
......She had heard that a crime had occurred in this room,
 seen everyone rushing towards it, and taken the opposite approach by circling around to the outer wall.
And she had gone all by herself to check that the shutters were down on the windows, that you couldn\'t do anything with them from the outside,
 ......and that there was nothing out of the ordinary.
"I assume that the inside of the room is perfectly cliché......?"
"......That was uncalled for."
"You have my deepest condolences.
 So? What is the state of the room?"
"..........................."
"......The chain was set on the door, so we cut it and entered."
"And all the windows have the shutters down.
 They\'re locked tight from the inside."
"......What are they bickering about in there?"
Eva was arguing with Nanjo about something.
Apparently, she wanted to carry the body to the parlor.
Nanjo tried to calm her, saying that they should leave the crime scene as untouched as possible until the police came.
"What happened to the other corpses when we did that?!
 The culprit carried them off somewhere!
 It may be that the culprit isn\'t satisfied with just killing, but intends to do something with the bodies as well...!!
 So no way!
 No way we\'re leaving my husband all alone here!!"
Eva did have a point.
After all, the prior victims were all carried away after we were shown their terrible and fatal wounds.
"......Erika‐chan.
 ...You\'d probably like to preserve the crime scene, but could you just let this one slide...?"
"........................
 ...Do as you wish.
 All I\'m interested in is the fact that a locked room has appeared that\'s much more serious than Kinzo‐san\'s study.
 I have no interest in corpses, so do as you please."
"....................."
Battler looked at her with an expression of clear disgust,
 ......but it rolled off her like water off a duck\'s back.
"......Well? You can take the corpse away now, I don\'t mind.
 Or am I in the way?"
Erika backed away from the door to open a path.
......There was no trace of any sadness for the dead.
{n}Her eyes simply blazed at the thought of this locked‐room murder that had appeared.
In any event, the great detective had given her permission.
......Eva and some others wrapped Hideyoshi\'s body up in the sheets, and Gohda and Rudolf started to carry him out...
The sheets quickly turned red.
It was so painful to see that Shannon and Kumasawa stripped the blanket off the bed to further cover the body...
"......Hey, out of the way."
"Yes, I am out of the way."
"Let\'s carry him to the parlor."
"Y‐yes...!"
"Honey, honeyyy{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y, awaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}ahhhhh...!!"
"......Listen up, everyone.
 From now on, we\'ll always move as a group.
 You must not let yourself be isolated."
"The culprit probably got a master key when he attacked Genji‐san.
 It\'s clear that locking up will no longer keep us safe."
"B‐but...even the chain was set. How did they do it......?!"
"......It\'s impossible...
 The shutters and the chain were firmly set.
 ......Even with a master key, it\'s impossible to force your way into that room......!"
"It must have been {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama\'s doing.........oooohhhhh......"
"......Th‐there\'s no way {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama did this...
 ......The epitaph has been solved, so there shouldn\'t be any more reason to hold the ritual..."
"As if we could understand her reasons...
 This is impossible for anyone except a witch...!"
"......Impossible for anyone except a witch...you say?
 <Good>!
 That has a nice ring to it."
"Erika‐chan, are you listening?
 We\'ve decided to stick together from now on.
 First, we\'re carrying Hideyoshi‐san\'s body to the parlor.
 Can you hold off playing detective until we get there?"
"........................"
When she heard the words "playing detective", Erika grimaced visibly.
Then, after everyone had filed out, she took a single step into the now empty guest room,
 .........looked around, and burned the scene into her eyes.
......Erika claimed to have a photographic memory.
If that was true, those few seconds were more than enough for her.
Later on, she could sip black tea in the parlor while perusing her mental photographs of the crime scene,
 and enjoy playing the part of the armchair detective...
Then, suddenly, her eyes stopped on the closet off to the side.
......A closet for hanging overcoats.
If it was large enough to fit a coat on a hanger,
 .........a person should be able to hide in it............
Slowly, ............Erika...
...stretched her hand out towards the closet............
".........ah—"
Erika\'s shoulder was grabbed roughly from behind.
"......Let\'s go, Ms. Detective.
 Didn\'t they teach you to stick with the group on school field trips?"
"Well, whenever I go traveling, someone always dies."
"Hey, what do you think you\'re doing, brats?!
 Move it...!!"
Rudolf told them to hurry.
After clicking her tongue and glaring at the closet, Erika followed Battler back to the parlor for the time being...
.........The sound of their footsteps finally faded.
That time of terror,
 when I feared that even the dripping of the cold sweat that covered my cheeks might be noticed, was finally......over.
I slowly opened the closet door with hands that still couldn\'t stop trembling and dashed out into the hallway.
It\'s alright, no one\'s found me......
{n}Still, it\'s a good thing they didn\'t lock the door...
If they had, I wouldn\'t be able to lock behind me after I left, and they\'d find that suspicious...
Anyway, I should leave this place.
Then I\'ll return to my room and pretend that I was sleeping the whole time...
That\'s right, I have to get back quickly...
A new murder has occurred.
{n}They\'ll probably try to tell me about it.
And they\'ll probably do it immediately after they carry Hideyoshi‐san\'s body back to the parlor.
I can get around a phone call by saying I was asleep and didn\'t notice, but if they come knocking directly, that\'ll be bad...
I have to get back quickly, before they try to force their way in......
I don\'t even know whether I should sprint back noisily to save every second I can, sneak back with hushed footsteps,
 or walk around normally as though I don\'t know anything has happened......!
The one thing I\'m certain of is that I have to avoid bumping into them on their way back to the parlor.
I have to get to my room......at a quick pace, without being noticed by anyone......!
I passed through the hall...
...to the lobby.
Once I\'ve ascended the main staircase in the lobby, ......I\'ll be almost there......
{a:c:
"Natsuhi‐san."}
"Hyeek......!!"
Just as she was about to go up the large staircase, Natsuhi heard Erika call out to her,
 and was so surprised that she visibly jumped.
"......I was just about to go tell you."
"Th‐thank you very much.
 Did something happen......?"
".........Natsuhi‐san, were you just...
going up the stairs...?
 Your room {i:is} upstairs, isn\'t it......?"
Erika coldly pointed out this strange fact.
{n}......Natsuhi cursed her bad luck.
"I, ...I couldn\'t sleep, so I was going to return to the parlor,
 ......b‐but I wasn\'t sure whether I had locked my room or not, so I was about to head back.
 ......I\'m a worrier, so this sort of thing happens a lot.
 Don\'t worry about it..."
"Ah, of course, that is quite common, isn\'t it?
 It\'s a common quirk among people who aren\'t confident in their ability to remember things."
Erika was clearly making fun of her, and Natsuhi might have put on an annoyed expression under normal circumstances.
However, right now,
 Natsuhi was extremely relieved to hear Erika admit that this was nothing out of the ordinary...
"Why are you by yourself, Erika‐san......?"
"I thought I might examine that guest room."
"Guest room......?"
"Yes.
 Things have gotten pretty serious, haven\'t they?
 And investigating the scene of the crime is my right."
......Erika\'s probing gaze peered deep into Natsuhi\'s eyes.
She could tell.
{n}Erika was already suspicious of Natsuhi.
......Judging by the subtle nuances of her words,
 this was almost certainly an attempt to make Natsuhi slip up and reveal that she knew about the Hideyoshi murder she hadn\'t yet been told about.
Natsuhi played dumb and asked again what had happened.
"..........................."
"..............................
 ......I‐...is something wrong...?"
"No, I was just thinking.
 ......This is a repeat of the first crime, isn\'t it?"
"What do you mean...?"
"Again, you were in your room.
 And again, you can\'t prove your alibi, can you?"
"......I don\'t know what you mean.
 To turn it around, how can you prove that I wasn\'t in my room...?"
"Oh, an interesting response.
 Then let\'s take this one step at a time.
 ......Please worry about your lock later.
 I have something vitally important to discuss with everyone."
"I\'ll come back after I check my lock.
 Please get started without me."
"......Hideyoshi‐san has been killed.
 We\'ll be talking about that."
"Wh‐.........what...?!"
She had planned on escaping to her own room using her lock as an excuse,
 ......claiming to have a sudden headache, and staying in bed the rest of the time.
However, now that she had been informed of Hideyoshi\'s murder,
 it would be clearly suspicious to say that could wait and escape to her room.
......She was already under suspicion after being seen heading up the stairs to the second floor.
She couldn\'t afford to do anything else suspicious......
Natsuhi gave up and headed for the parlor as Erika had urged her to do...
When she opened the door to the parlor, Eva\'s sobs poured out.
And everyone stared at Natsuhi with grave faces.
Those gazes almost made it look......as though they suspected her.
It was now painfully apparent to Natsuhi.
{n}This must have been what that man was after.
It was a trap to create a baffling locked‐room murder......and frame her for it.
But I couldn\'t disobey.
 I couldn\'t sacrifice my husband\'s life...!
And while it\'s true that I was hiding in the closet, that was all.
I haven\'t committed murder!
I might fall under enormous suspicion, but I\'m still not the culprit.
And most importantly, I\'m not under suspicion yet.
......I\'ll tell the police everything.
 I\'ll have to endure until then.
I\'m sure one of the servants is feeding information to the culprit.
Even in a situation like this, if I talk about my husband being a hostage,
 the culprit will hear, and it might be used as an excuse to kill him......
"Natsuhi‐san has just come back.
 Now that we\'re all here, I have something very important to discuss with you all."
"......Something very important......?"
"Yes, it\'s very important.
 ......Here in front of you all, I would like to set out the facts of everything that\'s happened, from the first crime to the last."
"Then you can leave me out of it, if you please.
 I think we should leave that sort of thing to the police.
 I\'m not interested."
"I have something very important to say once I\'ve cleared everything up.
 Neither you nor anyone else has the right to refuse."
"Wha............"
Erika used her detective\'s authority to proclaim the start of an assembly.
{n}None of the pieces could disobey.
Praying that she wouldn\'t become the topic of conversation, Natsuhi reluctantly sat on the sofa as she\'d been urged to.
".........Oh, sorry.
 Could you close that door for me?"
""Y‐yes...""
Shannon and Kanon closed the door.
......Since they had just now decided to lock all doors and windows carefully, Kanon locked it as well.
The lock which existed to protect the safety of this room...
felt like a lock on a prison cell to Natsuhi—one that would hold her there and prevent any escape......
......Natsuhi still hadn\'t noticed.
That ever since Erika had left into the corridor to go check the crime scene in Hideyoshi\'s room......her goal had changed.
In short, from Erika\'s point of view, the sound of that lock was truly...
"Checkmate."
Erika said that suddenly.
{f:5:Bernkastel} said that suddenly.
"Oh, fast!
 Wow, so you\'ve figured out the culprit already?
 We\'ve barely gotten to any of the crimes, you know?
 You could\'ve let me kill a few more and gathered all kinds of clu~es."
".........Alright, Lambda, gather all of the pieces.
 Now we\'re getting to the most entertaining part.
 Let\'s both enjoy it to the fullest."
"We\'ll see about that...
 Why don\'t you show me what you\'ve got?
 *giggle*giggle*...!!"
"To think that she\'d lay down the challenge without waiting for the game to be over at midnight...!
 What a hasty person, that Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}...!"
"It is quite an early challenge.
 To think that she already feels she can win at this stage..."
"......Claiming a witch exists is normally all you need to do to win,
 ......but with Natsuhi and Kinzo, we\'ve got a lot we need to protect this time.
 ......Sounds like this fight\'ll be a pain."
"I welcome a troublesome fight!
 I won\'t let them do as they please with my golden island any more...!!
 I shall meet your challenge, Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}!
 Furudo Erika!"
......In the Golden Land, the endless rain continued to fall.
Battler was nowhere to be seen.
It would very soon reach the time when Battler had joined in on the fifth game,
 and control of his piece would be passed on to him.
In other words, only now, in this final stage of the game when {f:5:Bernkastel} had pinpointed the culprit,
 was Battler finally going to be allowed to participate.
He had left the arbor a short while ago for that reason.
Now, the only ones in sight were {f:5:Virgilia}, who continued to knit silently,
 ......and Beato, ...who just sat there blankly amidst the smell of her black tea,
 not even putting the cup to her lips......
{f:5:Virgilia} stopped knitting for a moment...
...and looked out across the vast golden rose garden that extended as far as the eye could see.
"......At least in terms of mere culprit‐guessing games,
 ......I think we can say that Battler‐kun has gained the strength to never again surrender."
"......................................."
"You gave him every message he needs by the end of the fourth game.
 .........That is to say, ......Battler‐kun possesses all the tools to reach the truth at any moment.
 .........However, he has a weak side.
 ......Because of that,
 even if the game goes on to repeat a hundred times,
 he will never solve it.
 He\'ll just wander forever like someone trying to find the blue bird."
And that, ............{f:5:Beatrice},
 goes for you as well.
Even if you play this game hundreds more times,
 you will never arrive at the answer you seek.
{f:5:Bernkastel} will abuse this game without a doubt.
{f:5:Lambdadelta} will also churn this game about with the utmost arrogance.
At a glance, that may be humiliating and appear to you and Battler as though the game has been stolen from you.
.........However.
That is something the two of you need right now.
To bring an end to Battler\'s weak side.
 To bring an end to your hesitation.
"And that is why...
you called the two of them here.
 To end the eternal torture between the two of you."
"......................................."
"Those two will bring you either victory or defeat.
 But either result will now be one filled with compassion.
 .........You should understand that as well by now."
{f:5:Virgilia} faced Beato, whom she had come to adore like a daughter,
 ......with cold eyes that she must not have shown often.
It was like the gaze of a mother who, instead of scolding, silently urges their child to recognize their mistake.
"{f:5:Beatrice}.
 .........How long do you intend to stay there...
...neither alive...
nor dead,
 .........not ascending to heaven...
nor descending to hell,
 there in a daze on the peak of Mount Purgatory......?"
"......................................."
"I am {f:5:Virgilia}.
 I have guided him through Purgatory and brought him to you at its peak.
 ......And you are {f:5:Beatrice}.
 You must choose whether to take his hand and rise up to heaven, or embrace him and fall into hell."
Did you know that the tribulations of Purgatory, which lies in the gap between heaven and hell,
 are sometimes more torturous than even hell itself...?
On the gates of hell, it is written that you must abandon all hope.
......A human without hope can accept their suffering and give up.
However, the denizens of Purgatory have hope.
{n}A hope of possibly reaching heaven, a hope that cannot be abandoned.
And that tortures them.
Even in the depths of hell, ...no greater torture device exists than the single pin known as hope......
"Leap.
 Leap from the cliff of Purgatory.
 ......Cast open Pandora\'s box, and cast aside your fleeting, fragile, foolish hope and all the longing it brings.
 You\'re afraid, aren\'t you?
 Of opening the box."
Beato was silent,
 .........but with a single tear, she nodded slightly.
"Is the cat in the box alive or dead?
 The time has now come...to check.
 ......If the cat is dead, hold a funeral for it quickly and have it rise to heaven.
 If the cat is alive, feed it quickly and give it all of your affection."
"Whether it is alive or dead,
 your cat box eternally desecrates the cat.
 .........Those two have brought you the key to the box that you were too afraid to open."
{f:5:Beatrice}.
{n}The time has come for you to die.
I hope...
that your heart will be stopped...
...by the hand of the person you desire..........All of the pieces from the game board were gathered.
All of the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s, furniture, witches, and the witches on an even higher level...
...had gathered in one place.
That place was like a solemn cathedral, with an unbelievably high ceiling.
White stonework.
 Golden ornaments.
Though there were windows, there were no entrances nor exits.
{n}It was a strange, strange place.
But for some reason, no one wondered where this strange place was.
......Because they were not given the right to think of this place as strange.
"Pieces.
 Are you all gathered?"
"All present, ma\'am."
"Good work.
 ......What a spectacle.
 I wonder just how many people there are here."
"............No matter how many we see, every being outside the 18 is an illusion."
"Making you acknowledge them is what my game\'s all about.
 *cackle*cackle*!"
The three witches were seated on special thrones set upon a very high balcony.
In the center sat the Game Master, {f:5:Lambdadelta},
 and on either side of the semicircular balcony sat {f:5:Bernkastel} and {f:5:Beatrice}, facing each other.
Below them, Erika ran forward, lifted the corners of her skirt and bowed respectfully.
"Great Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}, I thank you for granting my request for an assembly.
 ......And Great Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}, my master.
 You can expect great things from this assembly.
 Though it may be only for a short while, I will most certainly make you forget about the poison that torments you."
"Yes, great things are what I expect.
 .........Because you are my double,
 and my piece."
Erika and {f:5:Bernkastel} exchanged nasty smiles that would make anyone want to avert their gaze.
"Hear me, witches, {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s!!
 I hereby announce the assembly of a witches\' coven! The Court of Illusions is now in session!!"
The ruler of the game spoke with words of power.
Though her words were spoken inside such a vast space,
 they rang out with the force of a bell in a bell tower...
"Your lives and roles within this game are over!
 The fifth game is hereby closed, and the 24:00 answer session shall begin!
 ......I\'d love to get started right away, but why don\'t we have everyone quickly introduce themselves first?
 Since there\'s so many of us here."
"Eheheheheh!
 I am {f:5:Lambdadelta}!
 The Witch of Certainty and the new ruler of this game!"
".........{f:5:Bernkastel}.
 Witch of Miracles.
 ......My goal is to penetrate {f:5:Beatrice}\'s witch illusions."
"I am the Endless Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}.
 My goals are to assert my own existence and to protect Natsuhi and Kinzo."
"................................."
"......Battler‐sama.
 You come next in rank."
".........I\'m Ushiromiya Battler.
 I\'m fighting Beato\'s—no.........I\'m fighting the witches.
 ......That\'s all."
"As I believe you know, you joined in on this game partway through.
 This means that at the time the coven commenced, you were not yet a participant.
 Do I need to explain further...?"
"I get it.
 ......You mean I don\'t have the right to speak for the time being, right?"
"Thank you for understanding."
Even though Battler held a rank second only to the witches,
 he sat on the foremost pew with the other relatives, all by himself at one end.
He met the gaze of Beato, who was up on the balcony.
"You could simply have said you were my arch‐enemy."
".........Well, you aren\'t necessarily my only enemy."
"Hmph...
 .........Let\'s take this game back.
 It belongs to us."
".....................Yeah."
I almost said that I was fighting Beato\'s witch illusions.
{n}............Originally, Beato was my one and only enemy.
But now, ......Erika and those witches who started tampering with Beato\'s tale...
...are my enemies as well.
Who should I fight and how?
{n}Maybe it\'s a good thing I won\'t have the right to speak for a while.
I\'ll keep a cool head and calmly watch everything unfold......
"I am the detective and the initiator of this coven, Furudo Erika.
 I will expose the culprit of the fifth game and bring this tale to a pleasing conclusion."
Erika greeted the witches above her and the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s behind her once again.
"I\'m looking forward to your performance too.
 Okay, remaining pieces, introduce yourselves in whatever order, and make it quick."
"{y:0:Human}{n:0:Human}s!
 Introduce yourselves, all of you...!"
Urged by 45 to introduce himself, Kinzo stood up.
"......I am Ushiromiya Kinzo.
 I slipped out of the study window and am hiding somewhere on Rokkenjima."
"Ushiromiya Krauss.
 I have been captured and am currently being confined somewhere."
"I\'m Ushiromiya Eva.
 I\'m alive."
"I\'m Rudolf.
 ......The rest of us are all Ushiromiya too, so let\'s just skip the family name."
"I\'m Ushiro—......Rosa.
 I was killed on the first twilight."
"Jessica.
 Same here, dead on the first twilight."
"I\'m George.
 ......Likewise, I died on the first twilight."
"Maria.
 I died, but look, I\'m here talking.
 See?
 Dying isn\'t a big deal, right?
 Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi..."
"I\'m Ushiromiya Natsuhi.
 ......I am alive."
"............Eheheheheheheheh."
"..................kh..."
"Hideyoshi here.
 I was killed just a short while ago."
"Kyrie.
 I\'m still alive."
"Nanjo......
 I am also hanging in there..."
"My name is Genji.
 .........I died on the first twilight."
"I\'m Shannon.
 ......I\'m still alive."
"I\'m Kanon.
 I\'m also alive."
"I, I\'m Gohda.
 Pleased to meet you, everyone......"
"I am Kumasawa...
 Pleased to meet you......"
"Now, on to the witches!
 Everyone, introduce yourselves!"
{f:5:Virgilia}\'s group could also be seen.
There was a second balcony, different from the one Beato\'s group was on, which jutted out like raised audience seating.
 They sat there, looking down as though they were at a theater...
".........My name is {f:5:Virgilia}.
 I am {f:5:Beatrice}\'s master in magic."
"I\'m Gaap.
 Making corpses disappear is my job."
"Ronove.
 I am charged with making the tea.
 Pu ku ku..."
"I greet you in the name of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory.
 I served in the murder of Hideyoshi on the second twilight."
""""""The Seven Sisters of Purgatory, right here!""""""
"Let us then have Lady Erika\'s furniture introduce themselves."
"Gertrude.
 I am an Assistant Inquisitor."
"Cornelia.
 I am an Assistant Inquisitor."
The two of them could also be seen on the second‐floor balcony.
{n}They sat apart from {f:5:Virgilia}\'s group.
Then, ......Dlanor, who was seated between the two, slowly stood up.
She had a presence and dignity about her, as though she was overseeing everything from that place.
"Dlanor A. Knox is my {f:5:name}.
 .........I am Lady Erika\'s primary {f:5:assistant}."
"........................"
"Battler.
 I am expecting a lot of {f:5:you}.
 Please do not disappoint {f:5:me}."
"......Let\'s just both give it all we\'ve got."
"Most of the time, there will be no need for Dlanor to step forward.
 However, when the witch side plays around with ugly word games, I\'ll need to have Dlanor pass judgment on them.
 ......The miracle in the study will not occur again."
"..........................."
"And finally, let us introduce ourselves.
 We are the Chiester Sisters Imperial Guards, who have been tasked with management of proceedings at this coven."
"H‐hello, everyone...!!"
"Nyeh nyeh{p:0:♪}"
"This ends the introductions of all pieces.
 A total of 38 people are present here!"
The number of characters was 38 if you only took the fifth game into account,
 but if you added all the pieces who appeared in previous games too, it would probably rise even higher.
This mysterious game, which had so often been likened to chess, now had far more pieces than a chessboard.
"Good.
 Then I guess we\'ll get started.
 Initiator, please begin!
 ......Oh, excuse me, you, the goat over there.
 Refill my drink."
"......And some popcorn for me."
"Oh, that\'s right.
 .........It {i:was} you who decided that popcorn was the only proper accompaniment to demonic theater, after all."
"Yes, I intend to enjoy this.
 .........And could I get some black tea and mustard miso?
 Erika, begin.
 I\'m already starting to get bored."
"Yes, my master, leave it to me...!!
 Order!! Silence!"
At the sound of her voice, the Chiester Sisters troops straightened up, lifted their right knees, and stamped down hard on the floor with their heels.
It became a low, deep rumble in the ground, which instantly erased all chatter in the cathedral...
and turned their eyes and expressions even more hollow and empty.
......The room fell back into silence, almost as though they were a collection of wax models...
Amidst this heavy silence, there was the sound of footsteps...
as Erika walked out into the center where she could catch everyone\'s attention.
When she signaled with her chin, a goat attendant appeared from behind a pillar,
 .........and carried a single, plain chair out into the front and center of the room.
It must have been......the defendant\'s chair.
"I, Furudo Erika, will make an accusation.
 The murderer of the fifth game is—"
"Ushiromiya Natsuhi‐san.
 You are the culprit."
Erika pointed at Natsuhi and spoke......
The Natsuhi wax doll alone...twitched and regained its expression.
{n}......It was an expression of panic.
"Chiester Sisters.
 Please take the defendant to her chair."
"Understood."
"Wait, ......what are you doing?!!
 Let go of me!!"
45 and 410 pinned Natsuhi\'s arms behind her back...
and led her to the chair in the center.
Natsuhi resisted, but the Chiester Sisters were surprisingly strong, and she couldn\'t do anything.
She turned to the relatives for help, but they just remained silent like wax models...
"I, Furudo Erika,
 will now reconstruct why the crime was only possible for Ushiromiya Natsuhi."
".........Beato.
 Of course, you\'ll be defending her, right?"
"Naturally.
 I am the Ushiromiya family alchemist, {f:5:Beatrice} the Golden.
 ......Furudo Erika, I accept your challenge.
 I shall take these false accusations you\'re trying to place on my master...
and tear them apart!!"
"B‐...{f:5:Beatrice}......!"
"Fear not, Natsuhi.
 You are my master.
 And you are the true head, with the One‐winged Eagle engraved in your heart.
 Do not fear a crime you have not committed."
At those words, Natsuhi jerked back, ......and gulped.
{n}Her panic finally disappeared, and she stood up straight.
"...Th‐that\'s true...!
 I am Ushiromiya Natsuhi!
 I will confront any challenger who would dare blaspheme the name of Ushiromiya!"
".........*giggle*.
 How can you make such an empty boast in a situation like this?
 ......You really are the bullied kid in every single fragment."
"So, Bern.
 Make your claims."
"I, {f:5:Bernkastel}, claim...
...that a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}, Ushiromiya Natsuhi, is the culprit of this game."
"And you too Beato, okay?"
"I, {f:5:Beatrice}, claim...
that the culprit in this game is not {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}!
 I am the culprit!"
{f:5:Bernkastel}, who smiled daringly, and {f:5:Beatrice}, who smiled firmly, crossed gazes.
"Do you hear this, witches, {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s?!
 Two claims have appeared for a single truth!
 Is the culprit the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} Ushiromiya Natsuhi?
 Or is the culprit the witch {f:5:Beatrice}?!"
"If the witch wins, the truth of the fifth game will disappear into darkness.
 If Erika wins, the witch illusion will be wiped from the game board.
 ......In other words, for Beato alone, this is a battle where losing is not an option. Are you prepared?"
"And what am I supposed to be preparing myself for?
 This is what I\'ve been craving all along...!"
......If Erika were to win, the witch illusion would be destroyed.
That would mean the existence of the witch would be denied.
{n}Beato was fighting for her life.
However, this wasn\'t the only time she had been fighting for her life.
{n}.........It had always been a life‐or‐death struggle, even when she fought with Battler.
...Because if Battler had won and broken through the witch illusion in any of the previous games,
 Beato would have been destroyed.
"......That\'s dirty.
 Erika\'s the only one with nothing to lose if she fails."
"I wouldn\'t be so certain of that.
 ......Lady {f:5:Bernkastel} is not a compassionate person.
 ......I can\'t imagine she\'d give any warm treatment to a piece that didn\'t perform as she had hoped..."
It was inconceivable that the ruthless {f:5:Bernkastel} would place no blame at all on a piece who had suffered defeat.
......Erika was probably fighting for her life just the same.
The two claims would clash, and one would be weeded out.
One would fall...and would not leave this place alive......
The only ones who truly had nothing to lose......were those witches.
"OK, no problems!
 Now begin!!"
".........In that case,
 I would like to go first.
 The murder of Hideyoshi‐san is very simple.
 It should be impossible to suspect anyone other than Natsuhi‐san.
 Except for the victim and Natsuhi‐san, all of us were in the same room, correct?"
It really was simple.
......Everyone except Natsuhi was in the parlor.
{n}And because it was so simple, it was decisive......
"......No matter how you look at it, the one who killed Hideyoshi was Natsuhi.
 No, it\'s the other way around.
 ......No matter how you look at it, no one except for Natsuhi could have killed Hideyoshi.
 There\'s no room for discussion or debate."
"I, I\'m telling you, you\'re mistaken...!!
 It may be true that I don\'t have an alibi.
 However, I don\'t believe a lack of an alibi proves that one is the culprit...!"
"Hmph, I understand that Natsuhi is the only one without an alibi.
 But wait.
 The scene of the murder was a locked room.
 It should have been impossible for anyone, including Natsuhi, to have committed the crime in that room.
 Except for me, since I could have done it with magic."
"I\'ll explain the locked room trick—the howdunit—later.
 We are starting with the whodunit for the time being.
 ......So for the reason I just mentioned, it\'s impossible to suspect any character except Natsuhi‐san for the murder of Hideyoshi‐san."
".........Milady.
 It may be dangerous to press any further on this."
"I agree.
 It\'s a fact that Natsuhi was hiding in the closet of Hideyoshi\'s room.
 ......If they use a repetition request to check her location, we\'ll be cornered."
"......Probably.
 Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} is the ruler of this game.
 ......If it suits her fancy, she\'ll set up Natsuhi as the culprit regardless of the facts."
If the typhoon were to pass and the police were to come and perform a scientific investigation,
 perhaps the true culprit {i:would} be identified and the false accusations against Natsuhi lifted.
However, the police would never arrive at this closed‐off Rokkenjima.
......In other words, the real truth would never be revealed.
Inside a cat box that will never be opened, false charges that everyone accepts have exactly the same value as the truth.
"Their aim is most likely to use the simple murder of Hideyoshi to give the impression that Natsuhi‐sama is the culprit...
before moving on to the first twilight\'s reconstruction, which has more uncertain elements."
"It\'s not good at all to proceed while under the Game Master\'s suspicion.
 We should take the initiative."
"Indeed.
 ............Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}!
 As you are well aware, a fair number of murders were committed during the fifth game,
 and we are skipping the rather lengthy chunk of time from midnight until the early morning."
"Skipping to Hideyoshi\'s murder...
and stepping backwards and forwards in time will only lead to confusion.
 It is my belief that we should follow events chronologically and in order, though the decision is yours, of course."
"Objection.
 Chronological order has no significance in the process of building a case against the culprit."
"Objection.
 Furudo Erika is trying to manipulate perception in her favor by mixing up the chronological sequence."
"Ugh, I don\'t like it when things get all muddled either.
 I accept Beato\'s claim.
 Erika, start with the first twilight instead of jumping to the second."
"...............Tch."
I definitely saw Erika click her tongue.
......Now I understand.
 This is {i:how the tales of Rokkenjima are created}.
After being guided by {f:5:Virgilia} and meeting {f:5:Beatrice},
 ......now I stand here, at this peak from which I can see everything below me, and I finally understand the truth of this world.
"This is......that thing you talked to me about before."
".........Yes, that\'s right.
 Truth is very fragile in this place."
"As long as each side makes its own claim, different truths can exist at the same time..."
Yes.
 This really is a trial.
{n}Both sides put forth their own truths.
This here truly is the Braun tube trial that {f:5:Virgilia} once used as an analogy......
"Then I will follow Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}\'s orders and start from the first crime at the first twilight.
 As you know, at midnight on October 4th, the first day,
 following a short break in the family conference, Natsuhi‐san left on her own, saying that she was going to bed early.
 Therefore, her alibi is completely lost from that time until the next morning."
"Oh, is that so?
 I believe there are several people besides Natsuhi who have dubious alibis.
 Unless you can clear suspicion from all of them, I cannot allow you to call Natsuhi the culprit."
"True.
 If Erika wants to claim that Natsuhi is suspicious,
 she should first show that everyone besides Natsuhi has an alibi.
 Right, Bern?"
".........Yes, of course.
 Erika will provide a complete explanation that covers everyone."
"Of course, my master...!
 In that case, I would like to explain things in order.
 Let\'s forget about Genji\'s murder for now and focus on the crime in the guesthouse.
 The inclination here is to suspect the servants who were in the guesthouse, yes?
 On that night, Gohda‐san and Kumasawa‐san were in the guesthouse.
 Isn\'t that right, you two?"
She turned to face the direction where those two people were seated, ......and just those two wax models came back to life.
When they weren\'t allowed to speak, they probably weren\'t even granted a soul.
In that case, it would have been much better if Natsuhi\'s soul could simply have disappeared as well...
......Natsuhi, who was in the defendant\'s chair, kept her soul the whole time, and was constantly hanging her head, looking nervous...
Gohda hurried to his feet and answered Erika\'s question.
"Y‐yes, that is correct.
 On that evening, I was alone in the guesthouse servant room..."
"Well, look at my age.
 Staying up the night would be a heavy burden, so I returned to the servants\' quarters in the guesthouse...
and went to bed right away on my own... Yes, you\'d better believe I did...!"
"......Doesn\'t that mean Gohda and Kumasawa have lost their alibis?!!
 Kumasawa claims that she was sleeping alone in the servants\' quarters.
 Gohda claims he was alone in the servant room.
 Either of them should have had enough time to go to the cousins\' room and commit murder!!"
"N‐n‐nonsense...!
 Why would we do something like that...?!"
"That\'s right, that\'s right...!
 How could we ever kill another person...?!"
"Natsuhi said it all.
 Both Kumasawa, who was sleeping alone in the servants\' quarters, and Gohda, who was alone in the servant room,
 are in the exact same situation as Natsuhi in her room.
 Both of them have lost their alibis."
"Have no fear.
 I guarantee that neither of these two are murderers.
 Firstly, Kumasawa‐san—following dinner, she left the mansion with me and the others and went to the guesthouse,
 entered the servants\' quarters, and slept until morning.
 It\'s the same for Gohda‐san.
 Once he finished with his job, he chatted with us in the lounge and went to sleep afterwards.
 Neither of them had the opportunity to commit murder."
"Hmph.
 So, we\'re finally here."
"......I see that it\'s time for me to stand up as well.
 Your turn is over already, Erika.
 ...Go summon that bodyguard you rely on so much."
Beato glanced at where Dlanor sat on the second‐floor balcony.
{n}......However, Dlanor just stared back with those usual expressionless eyes.
"Repetition requested.
 "We have absolute proof of Gohda and Kumasawa\'s alibis"."
"Decline repetition.
 .........Why give a hint to an enemy?
 There\'s no way we\'d answer."
"Hah!
 Did you hear that, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}?
 They say they have no proof!
 Is it acceptable for them to claim that Gohda and Kumasawa have alibis without proof?!"
"Good point.
 What do you say, Bern, Erika?
 How can you claim that Gohda and Kumasawa have alibis?"
"Stay out of this, Erika.
 My opponent is Dlanor over there.
 A mere {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} like you is not fit to argue with a witch!"
".............................."
"No.
 There\'s no need for Dlanor to step forward.
 .........In fact, it is precisely this, a "mere {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}" defeating a witch, that will spell the end for the witch illusion.
 ......So go ahead.
 Use the red and blue as much as you like.
 ......I\'m ready for you."
In response to Erika\'s challenge, Beato smiled boldly yet gracefully and slowly stood up.
And they glared at each other between the floor and the balcony......
"{p:2:Gohda and Kumasawa have no alibis.
 The two of them were in the guesthouse and could have reached the cousins\' room to commit murder at any time.
 Unless you can eliminate that possibility, you cannot treat Natsuhi as the culprit}."
Beato\'s blue truth struck out rapidly.
{n}The curtain had finally dropped, and the battle had begun......
"......A {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} like Erika can\'t use any red.
 How could she turn this around without calling Dlanor?"
"Though Erika cannot use it, her master, Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}, can.
 ......We mustn\'t let our guards down."
"Blue truth, valid.
 ......What\'ll you do, Bern?
 Will you or Dlanor step in instead?"
"It is still not my {f:5:turn}.
 And it is not Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}\'s turn {f:5:either}."
"......Yes, that\'s right.
 There\'s no need for us to show up for something like this.
 ......This is important precisely because a mere {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} like Furudo Erika will defeat you, Beato."
"......Because you\'ll be defeated by a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}, we\'ll know.
 We\'ll all know that the fake witch who calls herself "{f:5:Beatrice} the Golden" is nothing more than a sub‐{y:0:Human}{n:0:human} illusion."
"*giggle*giggle*...
 If you really can do that, it\'ll be seriously interesting...
 Okay, Erika.
 Let\'s see what you\'ve got...!"
"I will begin with Kumasawa‐san. It is extremely simple.
 Kumasawa‐san, stand."
"Y‐.........yes...!"
"Kumasawa‐san, from the time you went to bed last night...
to the time you were informed about the crime in the morning, did you ever leave the servants\' quarters?"
"No!
 I was sound asleep until morning, I really was!!"
"The truth is...
......after dinner last night, I had a chat with Eva‐san, and she told me something very interesting.
 ...And I tested it out myself."
"What are you talking about...?
 ......You don\'t mean..."
"That\'s right.
 It\'s what cornered and sealed Kinzo in the study.
 ......I learned that you can create a seal by putting something between a door and the frame."
".........Are you kidding...?
 Did she actually......do that to the servants\' quarters where Kumasawa‐san was sleeping?!"
"Erika was in the guesthouse, so there\'s no obstacle to her having been capable of that."
"After all, it was an unsettling night, and a massive amount of gold had just been discovered. Many sorts of crimes might have occurred.
 ......Where there is a detective, there will be a crime.
 I foresaw that some kind of crime would take place,
 so I used this to seal away people whose alibis might otherwise be lost."
Erika held a small, folded piece of brown paper high in the air.
"After I watched Kumasawa‐san, who returned to the guesthouse with me, say goodnight and enter the servants\' quarters,
 I used this to seal the door."
"Then, in the morning,
 when the crime was discovered and caused a big uproar, I immediately went to check Kumasawa‐san\'s quarters,
 where I confirmed that the seal was still intact.
 Therefore, I can prove Kumasawa‐san\'s alibi!"
".........<Good>.
 A wonderful alibi. Absolutely airtight.
 Kumasawa returned to the guesthouse with Erika, went to the servants\' quarters to sleep, and never left the room until morning.
 {p:1:In other words, after Kumasawa returned to the guesthouse, she never went to the second floor until morning}."
The proof Erika had shown was elevated by {f:5:Bernkastel} and became red truth.
This truth, which had become red, could no longer be overturned, even by Beato...
In other words, in that instant, Kumasawa\'s perfect alibi had been absolutely guaranteed.
"Hohoh!
 Then what about Gohda?!"
"Gohda‐san holed up in the servant room right after reaching the guesthouse.
 I sealed him up in the same way.
 Then, when Rosa‐san returned at {nobr:1 a.m.}, I happened to notice her when I stepped out into the corridor.
 I let Gohda‐san, who was still in the servant room, know this."
"The seal was intact at that time, so from the time we arrived at the guesthouse until {nobr:1 a.m.},
 Gohda‐san never left the servant room.
 And afterwards, he was with me in the lounge until {nobr:3 a.m}.
 And after {nobr:3 a.m.}, I was upstairs,
 so I can guarantee that Gohda‐san didn\'t come up."
".........Erika\'s seal proves that Gohda was holed up in the servant room until {nobr:1 a.m}.
 And Erika can testify to his alibi from then until {nobr:3 a.m.},
 because she was passing the time in the lounge with him.
 And after that point, he never set foot upstairs until the morning after.
 Erika can attest to this as well."
"{p:1:In other words, after Gohda returned to the guesthouse, he never went up to the second floor until morning}."
"Red truth, valid.
 ......Well done, Erika.
 The alibis due to your seals on those doors have been acknowledged by Bern and elevated to the status of red truth."
"Thank you very much, my master.
 ......I am the detective! A being greater than {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s, who can invoke the red truth despite her {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}ity!"
"You claim to be greater than {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}......?
 You conceited brat! Live another thousand years, and then you can talk!"
"It\'ll be a pain to have you try anything funny, so I\'ll make this clear now.
 In fact, I should have done this in the beginning.
 I apologize for being so roundabout.
 This is the state of the guesthouse at midnight."
".........The gold had been found, an emergency family conference called, and Battler‐san had gone to the mansion with the relatives.
 I, the three cousins, Doctor Nanjo, Gohda‐san, and Kumasawa‐san remained in the guesthouse."
"I have already explained Gohda‐san and Kumasawa‐san\'s alibis.
 George‐san, Jessica‐san, and Maria‐san were playing cards in the cousins\' room.
 I actually joined in for a little bit, and I clearly witnessed that they were alive at that time."
"My master, I request that you repeat this!!"
"Yes, I\'ll oblige you.
 {p:1:At 24:00 in the guesthouse, George, Jessica, and Maria were alive,
 and they were in the second‐floor cousins\' room.
 Nanjo, Gohda, and Kumasawa were on the first floor}."
"And, since there\'s no need to hold off on it anymore,
 I\'ll confirm that all the victims so far are dead.
 {p:1:George, Jessica, Maria, Rosa, and Genji—these five really are dead}.
 How could they be playing dead with their necks sliced open like that?"
"Thank you for repeating, my master...!
 I had to make these things clear, you see, or I might have started hearing about how they were already dead before I guaranteed everyone\'s alibi,
 or that they weren\'t actually dead at all."
".........gh..."
Unsurprisingly, Beato\'s side couldn\'t get away with the simple plan of claiming that the victims were only playing dead.
But in order to overcome Gohda and Kumasawa\'s alibis, it should have been possible to suppose that the crime occurred before those doors were sealed.
However, the opponent had predicted this move perfectly.
It had now been shown in red that the crime did not occur before the time period covered by Erika\'s alibis.
"Got it.
 That\'s the last time the victims were confirmed to be alive.
 I wish you\'d said that in the beginning.
 ......This means we can ignore everything that happened before midnight."
".........To go even further,
 {p:1:at 24:00, Natsuhi, Krauss, and Genji were in a corridor on the second floor of the mansion.
 All the remaining people were at the family conference in the dining hall.
 Of course, at that point in time, no murder had occurred.
 Genji was also alive}."
"That isn\'t something that Erika observed,
 but we can\'t move the game forward without establishing it.
 Okay, I\'ll acknowledge that red truth."
"Thank you very much for that red truth, my master!"
Since Erika had been in the guesthouse,
 it was only natural that she could explain the situation there.
However, since she hadn\'t been in the mansion at the time,
 explaining the situation over there would have been extremely difficult for her.
......Beato would normally have attacked there with the blue truth,
 saying that the people in the dining hall had all agreed to keep to the same story,
 and that someone might have snuck out of the dining hall and committed murder in the guesthouse.
However, because Bern had instantly settled that matter with the red truth,
 Beato had completely lost her chance to strike back......
"Damn you............"
"......Very troublesome.
 ......To think we would be put at such a disadvantage..."
"This is almost the exact opposite of Riiche\'s fights with Battler......"
"......In fact, the situation might be even worse than it was back then."
At a glance, the fight between the two of them resembled our previous fights.
However, there were some vital differences.
The first was whether or not Beato was the Game Master.
The Beato who fought against me was the Game Master.
{n}So she knew all the truth.
That\'s why she was able to use the red truth at will.
However, the current Beato isn\'t the Game Master.
{n}She\'s just a single piece on the game board.
......In other words, even Beato doesn\'t know the truth.
So you could say that Beato is now in the same position I once was.
Also, though Erika may seem to be in the same position I once was,
 the situation for her is totally different.
She\'s connected to the witch called {f:5:Bernkastel}.
......Even though she isn\'t the Game Master, she\'s capable of elevating Erika\'s statements to become red truth.
Because of this, Erika can use the red truth even though she\'s neither a witch nor the Game Master.
Beato, who\'s supposed to be the witch, possesses no truth or red she can use.
{n}And yet the detective, Erika, can use the red truth.
The advantage has completely flipped over to the other side.
......You could probably say that the current Beato is in a much worse position than I was when I fought with her.
After I got used to the game, Beato stopped responding to my repetition requests,
 but in the beginning, she responded to almost all of them, giving me quite a few hints.
That\'s why we were able to fight on par.
However, {f:5:Bernkastel} is different.
She fully understands the rules of this game, and is prepared to corner Beato without even a hint of restraint.
.........And all this made me realize.
......Beato was going easy on me so that we could fight on par with each other......
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*......
 This has become quite an interesting fight.
 ...I see, so I must fight from the position Battler once stood in."
".........Beato......"
"I once insulted you and called you incompetent.
 ......I can handle much, much worse than this. *cackle*cackle*!"
"It\'s now impossible to suspect Gohda and Kumasawa.
 You can\'t win by arguing that point any longer."
"Yep.
 Let\'s switch to a different approach."
"The next in line would probably be Nanjo.
 He was also in the guesthouse."
"Nanjo was in the lounge with Erika, if I\'m not mistaken.
 ......But the time periods before and after that should be wide open."
"That\'s right, I\'ll strike there.
 ......Nanjo.
 You were relaxing in the downstairs lounge of the guesthouse with Erika and Gohda, correct?"
"Yes......
 I was with Erika‐san the whole time..."
"And during what time was this?"
"F‐from 1 to {nobr:3 a.m}."
"Yes, that\'s right.
 Between {nobr:1 a.m.} and {nobr:3 a.m},
 Doctor Nanjo, Gohda‐san, and I were relaxing in the lounge.
 ......Repetition requested, my master!"
"I\'ll respond.
 {p:1:From {nobr:1 a.m.} to {nobr:3 a.m.}, the trio of Erika, Nanjo, and Gohda...
spent their time in the lounge on the first floor of the guesthouse}."
......Though she had flat out refused Beato\'s repetition request, she responded to Erika\'s immediately.
The red truth...was starting to corner Beato.
......Beato grimaced as though in pain, but she still struck back with the blue truth.
......No, she really was in pain.
As alibis were steadily established for everyone other than Natsuhi, the witch illusion was also being denied.
Beato perceived the denial of her existence as pain...
"{p:2:Even so, he shouldn\'t have an alibi for the time period before and after you were in the lounge!
 It was possible for Nanjo to commit the crime too}!"
"That\'s right.
 I get that Nanjo was in the lounge with Erika from {nobr:1 a.m.} to {nobr:3 a.m.}, but what about before and after that?
 ......Well, Erika?"
"Of course.
 First, the alibi for before {nobr:1 a.m}.
 This is no problem at all.
 I played cards with the cousins in their room until midnight,
 and then went downstairs to the lounge, where I met Doctor Nanjo."
"That\'s right......
 At midnight, I met Erika‐san as she was coming down the stairs, and spoke with her, learning that she was quite the connoisseur of the mystery genre.
 I realized that I\'d found a kindred spirit......"
"When I went into the archive to solve the epitaph\'s riddle,
 I noticed that there were several original copies of famous foreign mystery novels stored there.
 So, I wanted to discuss them with the actual books in hand.
 We moved to the archive and were talking the whole time.
 Constantly, until we moved to the lounge."
The archive in the guesthouse had enough books in it that you might even call it a small library.
In it were several famous foreign mystery novels...
that Kinzo had once taken a liking to.
Of course, they were all originals and in English, but English was no problem for both Erika and Nanjo.
On that occasion, Erika had again borrowed the key to the archive from Gohda in the servant room.
She added that she had rechecked the seal at that point and, of course, reset it.
Damn her.
Even though she keeps it sealed for anyone else to enter or leave, she alone enters and leaves whenever she wants.
"I see.
 So, from midnight until {nobr:3 a.m.} when you went to bed, you were with Nanjo the whole time?
 That means Nanjo\'s alibi is the most rock solid of them all."
"Yes, that is indeed the case!
 Repetition requested, my master...!"
"I\'ll respond.
 {p:1:After 24:00, Erika was with Nanjo the whole time until {nobr:3 a.m}}."
At midnight, the crime in the cousins\' room still hadn\'t occurred.
So this establishes an alibi for the period before the time he spent in the lounge.
"After that, we walked out of the archive and into the hallway at {nobr:1 a.m}.
 When we did, we just happened to bump into Rosa‐san as she returned.
 I then told Gohda‐san about that.
 ......I figured it was probably a servant\'s responsibility to welcome in a guest."
Gohda asked if he should bring a towel, but Rosa refused.
She quickly headed up to the second floor.
At this point, Erika, Gohda, and Nanjo gathered together and decided to have a drink......
Their alibis in the lounge up until {nobr:3 a.m.} have already been proclaimed in red, so there are no problems there.
"Let\'s continue on to after {nobr:3 a.m}.
 This is Doctor Nanjo\'s alibi after we split up.
 At {nobr:3 a.m.}, Battler‐san returned and the people in the lounge went their separate ways.
 Doctor Nanjo, Battler‐san and I went up to the second floor.
 I then said good night to Doctor Nanjo.
 At this time, of course, I put a seal on the door to the doctor\'s room as well."
"And it went unchanged until the crime was discovered.
 I flew out of my room the moment Battler‐san screamed,
 and I confirmed that the door to Doctor Nanjo\'s room was still sealed.
 Therefore, Doctor Nanjo\'s alibi is perfect both before {nobr:1 a.m.} and after {nobr:3 a.m}...!"
"Splendid, Erika.
 {p:1:Both your seal and your red truth are perfect.
 Nanjo had the alibi of being with Erika until {nobr:3 a.m}.
 And he didn\'t leave his room after {nobr:3 a.m.} until morning}."
Using the seals she had placed on the doors,
 Erika was granted red truths from {f:5:Bernkastel} one after another......
When I gave Beato a repetition request, it was about maneuvering and tactics,
 ......but it\'s totally different for Erika.
For her, it\'s like having a trump card which can make red whenever she wants......
"This concludes the proof of alibis for all suspects in the guesthouse.
 ......No problems, I assume?"
"I, ......I do have a problem...!!
 And that problem is, ......umm........."
Beato racked her brains to find some point to latch onto, but Erika\'s red had been ruthlessly perfect.
......There was no point she could take issue with...
Beato kept thinking hard, trying to fault Erika on something,
 but her expression was so wrought with desperation that anyone could tell by looking...
"I\'m overruling you, Beato.
 I can\'t sense any problems at all.
 ......It\'s totally <pop>, <cute>, and <perfect>!
 The alibis for all humans in the guesthouse have now been proven."
"......Hold it, Erika.
 You\'re gonna leave me out of this?
 I\'m pretty sure Ushiromiya Battler also had a chance to commit the crime.
 ......After all, I was in the same room as the victims all night.
 There\'s no way I\'ll let you carry on this discussion while ignoring me.
 ......?!"
At that moment, an arrow twisted like a golden snake and hit me.
It didn\'t pierce through me, but it slapped me hard on the cheek like a whip.
"Battler‐sama, your right to speak has not yet been recognized.
 Be warned."
"......Oooww... Dammit......"
"Yeah, I understand, Battler.
 ......And my apologies. Forgive me.
 ......Erika!
 You still haven\'t shown an alibi for Battler!
 Battler is the man who was sleeping alongside the victims.
 Shouldn\'t he be placed under the greatest suspicion of all?!"
"Beato\'s right.
 You can\'t go skipping Battler like that."
"My apologies.
 I had completely forgotten about him."
"After Battler returned at {nobr:3 a.m.}, you went upstairs with him.
 And I believe you also went to your own room and slept.
 You may have gone to the cousins\' room at midnight, but I don\'t think you went there after {nobr:3 a.m}."
"......Will you now claim that you went to crawl into Battler\'s bed later on?
 *cackle*cackle*!
 Of course, if you tell me you were looking at Battler\'s sleeping face all night long to confirm his alibi in the cousins\' room,
 I might just be willing to accept your proof...!"
"Yes. I listened to him breathing in his sleep all night long. Got a problem with that?"
"......What......?!"
"I, Furudo Erika, can prove that Battler‐san returned to the cousins\' room at {nobr:3 a.m.},
 that he went straight to bed afterwards, and that he went straight to sleep.
 And I can prove that until he woke up, noticed the gruesome situation the room was in, and let out a scream, nothing happened in that room."
"So you have no need to worry.
 Battler‐san isn\'t the culprit.
 He\'s just the charming first discoverer who entered the murder scene without realizing it was one and slept until morning."
"That\'s insane...
 Even with those seals you love so much, it shouldn\'t be possible for you to prove that...!
 How can you prove this?!!"
".........It\'s a load of crap.
 I entered that room alone.
 And Erika must have gone into her own room as well.
 How can she say something like that, as though she saw the whole thing...?!"
"She never said that she saw it.
 ......The room Erika was assigned to—where was it located?"
"Erika, tell me, please.
 How can you prove so much about Battler?"
".........*giggle*giggle*.
 I\'d expect no less from a true detective......"
"My room was right next to the cousins\' room.
 There was only a single thin wall between them."
"Y‐
......you don\'t mean......
 ......You...put your ear against the wall...
...to check what was happening in the cousins\' room...?"
"Yes.
 My ears are perfect.
 Right after Battler‐san entered the room, I put my ear against the wall and listened carefully to make sure nothing out of the ordinary occurred."
"......You said you could prove that nothing happened until Battler let out a scream the next morning...
 ......You don\'t mean..."
"Yes.
 I put my ear against the wall and listened in on that room until morning, without sleeping a wink."
...............Everyone...
was stunned into silence.........
She put her ear against the wall...
...and for the entire time until morning...
.....she listened to what was going on in Battler\'s room......
Just what would that have looked like......
Until dawn, she had silenced her breathing in a pitch‐black room,
 clinging to the wall shared with the cousins\' room......
Like some kind of creepy venomous spider clinging to the wall of a darkened room......
{f:5:Bernkastel} alone was grinning in triumph.
"......Due to the progression of the game, I realized that Battler, the one who had received the Head\'s Ring, would be a key player.
 ......I was sure that Battler would be a victim of the first twilight."
"Yes.
 So, just as my master told me to do,
 ......I put my ear against the wall until morning without a wink of sleep, checking to make sure nothing unusual happened...!"
"Erika has a photographic memory.
 And her hearing ability is on par with a tape recorder.
 ......It would have been impossible for Battler to kill George and the others and slit their throats without Erika hearing it."
"......It\'s an accepted power of the detective\'s authority.
 I have no choice but to acknowledge it.
 I\'ll confirm it in red...!
 {p:1:Ushiromiya Battler returned to the cousins\' room at {nobr:3 a.m.} and fell asleep.
 After that, until the discovery of the crime, absolutely nothing out of the ordinary happened in the room}!"
"{p:1:In other words, it was impossible for Battler to commit murder or damage the corpses}."
".........nn...
...ggghh........."
The red from the two of them forced Beato to show an expression of considerable anguish...
It was only natural.
The red truth they had spoken not only guaranteed Battler\'s alibi, but a number of other things as well.
First off, it meant the murder was impossible for {i:anyone} after {nobr:3 a.m}.
And since the cousins were confirmed to be alive as late as midnight, the time period of the crime automatically became...
“between midnight and three o\'clock”.
That also automatically provided a guaranteed alibi...
for everyone who wasn\'t in the guesthouse before {nobr:3 a.m.}
".........That one hurts...
...a lot........."
"After midnight, Erika was in the guesthouse the whole time.
 So, it should have been difficult for her to prove alibis for all of the people in the mansion..."
"It should have been almost impossible to prove alibis for Eva and the others.
 ...But now, all she has to do is prove that they never visited the guesthouse between midnight and {nobr:3 a.m.},
 and she can prove those alibis..."
"......Anyway, we\'ll have to construct it so that the murders were possible before {nobr:3 a.m}.
 And we have to prove that it was possible for one of the people in the mansion to do it...!"
The people who were in the guesthouse all had alibis.
{n}The crime didn\'t occur before midnight.
{n}The crime couldn\'t have occurred after three o\'clock.
In other words, there was no way for the murders to happen unless someone from the mansion committed the crime between midnight and three o\'clock......
In order to protect Natsuhi, she had to establish that it was possible for someone other than Natsuhi to commit the crime.
Ironically, the witch had to prove that a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} could have committed the crime...
"............Still, that\'s a tall order.
 ......Until {nobr:3 a.m.}, Erika was in the lounge.
 And you have to pass through there to get upstairs.
 In other words, she\'s practically like a sentry for the upstairs floor of the guesthouse."
"......This is an unimaginative suggestion, but if it was possible to reach the upper floor without Erika noticing,
 we would probably be able to prove that the crime was possible for anyone."
"It\'s probably possible for a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} to climb up to the second‐story windows if they really wanted to."
Of course, Beato had also thought of striking back that way.
......And {f:5:Bernkastel} must have thought this as well.
"Battler, Nanjo, Gohda, Kumasawa.
 We realize that the crime was impossible for all these people in the guesthouse.
 ......However, what about the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s in the mansion?!"
"As I have already said, and as my master has even proclaimed with the red truth,
 I was in the lounge on the first floor of the guesthouse.
 And to reach the second floor, one must pass through the lounge.
 In other words, it was impossible to reach the second floor without me seeing it."
"And what if that wasn\'t impossible?
 {p:2:For example, what if someone placed a ladder against the outer wall of the guesthouse and snuck in through a second‐story window?!
 There must be a way to reach the second floor without passing through the lounge!
 If this is the case, it would be possible to reach the crime scene without you seeing it}...!"
Beato finally struck back.
Before now, she had let Erika take total control and attack her with the red over and over.
During that time, Beato\'s counterattacks with the blue truth had been few in number, even including this one...
"Of course, I knew you\'d try saying that.
 I can\'t have my lookout in the lounge become meaningless.
 So first, I must prove that my lookout was perfect."
"......Firstly, because of how the guesthouse is constructed,
 it is impossible to reach the second floor without me seeing it from the lounge.
 There are no places under cover, and neither are there any physical or mental blind spots.
 ......My master, I request you repeat!"
"{p:1:It is impossible for someone to reach the second floor of the guesthouse without anyone in the lounge noticing it.
 ......Though of course, this only refers to reaching the second floor from inside the building}."
"<Good>, my master!
 ......So, next is Lady {f:5:Beatrice}\'s theory that there might be a way to reach the second floor from the outside.
 This really does pose a problem.
 After all, there are trees that could probably be climbed, and someone could have used a ladder.
 We also can\'t be certain that crawling up the rain gutter would be impossible.
 But I {i:can\'t let you do that}."
"Hoh, you won\'t let me...?
 And how\'s that?
 Did you stay up all night circling the guesthouse?
 No, you couldn\'t do that, could you?
 You were in the lounge...!
 From the lounge, you can only see a small part of the outer perimeter through the window!"
"That\'s true.
 I couldn\'t prevent all methods of climbing up to the second floor from the outside.
 ......However, I was able to prevent all entry from the second floor."
"Prevent...entry...?!"
"......I had already foreseen this move.
 ......Frightening......and so persistent...!"
"Because of how the guesthouse is constructed, the only method of entry from the second floor is the windows."
"The locks? They don\'t matter at all.
 I only had to prove that none of the windows or shutters were opened even once."
"After I witnessed the location of the hidden gold, I returned to the guesthouse...
and immediately began severing all methods of entry to the second floor that didn\'t pass through the lounge.
 .........Yes, it\'s exactly the same.
 No different from the rest...!"
"......Don\'t tell me...
you used that seal of yours......on all the windows of the guesthouse......?
 In that weather, ......dressed like that...?"
"Well, I did have my swimsuit from when I drifted here."
".........She\'s insane......
 ...At a house where she was welcomed as a guest, before anything had happened at all, she went out in all that rain,
 and did something like that......?"
"For a normal {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}, it would certainly be an impossibly dubious action.
 ......However, she is the witch\'s piece."
In the middle of all that rain,
 Erika sealed all the windows from the outside...
...to create an alibi showing that no one could have snuck into the guesthouse from the outside.
She climbed up the walls herself, ......and did that to all the windows on the first and second floor.
{n}No, to all things which could possibly have permitted entry.
After hearing that she\'d listened to the cousins\' room all night long without sleeping a wink,
 even this bizarre behavior didn\'t seem quite so impossible......
That had probably also......looked like a venomous spider.
A repulsive venomous spider crawling eerily over the outer walls of the guesthouse in the middle of a storm......
".........You...
 ......Just what do you think...
...of the house of Ushiromiya...?
 Is this how you repay us for welcoming you as a guest...?!"
"To the detective, the Ushiromiya house is nothing more or less than the stage upon which the crime occurs.
 ......Before the outbreak of the crime, it was important for me to memorize the names of the characters, memorize the lay of the land,
 and prepare for the upcoming crime by devoting my time towards collecting and creating all possible alibis."
"From my perspective, detectives who make no preparations before the outbreak of the crime are pretty third‐rate.
 After all, we all know that someone will die wherever we spend the night."
".........Furthermore,
 at the moment the crime was discovered, Erika confirmed that none of those seals had been broken.
 That\'s why Erika wasn\'t the first one to reach the cousins\' room when the corpses were discovered."
"Even without inspecting the corpses, she could be certain of several things thanks to the red truth.
 It was more important to check the seals and construct alibis."
"You are perfect, my master.
 All I did was prove everything to perfection by following your orders...!"
"Well done, Erika.
 My double, my piece...!
 What do you think, Lambda?
 I\'d say this proves that Erika\'s lookout in the lounge contains absolute reliability as far as constructing alibis is concerned..."
"......Yeah, I\'ll acknowledge that.
 Erika, your seal is perfect.
 I\'ll acknowledge it in red.
 {p:1:It was impossible to reach the second floor of the guesthouse without passing through the lounge,
 and impossible to reach it at all without Erika, who was in the lounge, knowing about it}!"
"Thank you very much, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}...!
 So, you know what\'s coming next, Great Lady {f:5:Beatrice}!
 {p:2:Therefore, the time of the crime is limited to the single hour between midnight, when they were confirmed to be alive,
 and {nobr:1 a.m.}, when our party in the lounge started}!"
"Ug...
...gah...
...ah......"
"I\'ve already said it, but at midnight, I went down to the lounge,
 hit it off with Doctor Nanjo, and was engrossed by a discussion of the mystery genre in the archive until {nobr:1 a.m}."
"......It\'s a bit embarrassing, but I grew so engrossed with this discussion...
that I wouldn\'t have noticed if anyone had passed through the corridor during that period.
 ......Quite a regretful mistake for a detective."
After doing all that maneuvering and setting up seals to guarantee a perfect alibi,
 she became too engrossed in a mystery discussion and left an opening......?
Her relaxed smile was completely shameless, the total opposite of her words.
It almost seems like it\'s the other way around.
It\'s enough to make you think that this is an intentional trap,
 said in full awareness that only Natsuhi doesn\'t have an alibi for the hour following midnight...
"To put it the other way around, this has the following corollary:
 the only ones who could have reached the cousins\' room and committed the crime...are those who have no alibi between midnight and {nobr:1 a.m.}!"
Her eyes clearly hinted that Natsuhi was the only one who fit this description...
......It had been a crime that occurred at a completely unknown point during that long night.
But because of the alibis Erika had constructed,
 that time period had been compressed and restricted to the single hour following midnight.
Erika left the cousins\' room at midnight.
{n}This is the last time we have confirmation that George and the others were alive.
And after the party in the lounge started at {nobr:1 a.m},
 it was impossible to reach the cousins\' room by any method.
"............All this from a mere {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}......"
"This is quite bad...
 The night has been sealed up into an hour, ......and at this rate, there won\'t be many pieces left to suspect..."
"......Damn you, Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}...
 ...Not bad at all........."
"Unlike Battler, I\'m not an idiot.
 ......After this game\'s repeated five times, I have more than enough cards in my hand.
 ......
*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!"
"Then let us continue.
 Let\'s examine the alibis of the remaining suspects, the people in the mansion.
 After all, we only have to worry about the single hour between midnight and {nobr:1 a.m}.
 That shouldn\'t be difficult at all."
"First, midnight.
 At this time, Natsuhi, Krauss, and Genji were in the second floor corridor, and all of the others were in the first floor dining hall.
 This has already been given in red truth by my master!"
"Yes, that\'s right.
 {p:1:At 24:00, Natsuhi, Krauss, and Genji were in the corridor on the second floor of the mansion.
 The rest of them were in the dining hall on the first floor}.
 And as you know, there was a mysterious knock, and a letter with the One‐winged seal on it appeared.
 The discussion surrounding that continued on until {nobr:1 a.m}.
 I will say it with the red truth.
 {p:1:Of all the people in the dining hall, not one of them left the dining hall until {nobr:1 a.m.}}...!"
The time that the crime was possible had been limited to between midnight and one o\'clock.
And it had been guaranteed that the adults in the family conference did not leave the mansion between midnight and one o\'clock.
 This gave them all proven alibis.
"......A‐......and how do you intend to prove that?!
 Erika\'s in the guesthouse!
 Did someone prove it by using one of your favorite seals on the dining hall door?!
 You have no convincing evidence or proof...!!"
"{p:1:The red truth is simply truth, and there is no need to provide evidence, proof, or room for a counterargument}!!
 ......You made that rule.
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*giggle*giggle*giggle*ehe{0}he{0}he{0}he{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha...!!"
This overbearing red truth hadn\'t only given alibis to the adults in the dining hall.
It also gave alibis to Shannon and Kanon, who had come to serve tea,
 and even guaranteed that they never left the dining hall.
In other words, ......the only ones who didn\'t have proven alibis......
were three people: Natsuhi, Krauss, and Genji...
No, ......there were only two left.
If alibis were proven for Krauss and Genji,
 it would prove that no one but Natsuhi could have been the culprit...!
"Let\'s move on to Genji.
 He\'s a victim, but we can\'t rule out the possibility that he committed the crime in the cousins\' room and then was killed himself."
"And furthermore, although he was in the second‐floor corridor at midnight,
 he then returned to the servant room to transfer the phone call for Natsuhi and was completely isolated."
"Which means that it was possible for Genji to commit the crime—"
"I\'ll say it in red.
 {p:1:When Genji finished transferring the call, he immediately returned to the servants\' quarters}.
 That\'s just a cold, hard truth, without any evidence, proof, seals or alibis, got it?"
"Then, at {nobr:1 a.m.},
 there was another break in the family conference, and Rosa returned to the guesthouse.
 ......At that time...
 I\'m truly thankful for your cooperation, Ushiromiya Eva‐san.
 Please rise...!"
".........Erika‐chan wasn\'t the only one, you know?
 I was also certain that something would happen that night."
"She\'s the person who taught me how to make those seals.
 And she helped me to check the alibis of those people under suspicion...!"
"During the break at {nobr:1 a.m.},
 I went to Genji‐san\'s quarters and used the same seal as Erika‐chan...!
 In other words, if this wasn\'t broken,
 it would mean that no one could have entered or left that room between {nobr:1 a.m.} and the next morning...!!"
"Now, Kanon‐san and Kumasawa‐san.
 Please rise."
Kanon rose expressionlessly, and Kumasawa got to her feet timidly.
"In the morning,
 you two went to wake Genji‐san because he had slept in, right?
 And at that time, you noticed that the door was sealed, broke the seal, and opened the door, correct?"
"......Y‐...yes.
 ......I thought it was some kind of prank."
"I didn\'t think deeply about it at the time."
"I\'m not asking for your opinions. Just give us the facts.
 Did you break the seal when you entered the room?"
""Y‐yes...""
"With the red truth, I\'ll guarantee that Eva, Kanon, and Kumasawa\'s statements just now are the truth.
 {p:1:At {nobr:1 a.m.}, Eva sealed Genji\'s sleeping quarters, and that seal was broken by Kanon and Kumasawa in the morning when the crime was discovered}.
 Just to save time, I\'ll add on some more."
"{p:1:During the short break at {nobr:1 a.m.}, the first two to leave the dining hall were Rosa and Eva.
 Until Eva returned, everyone in the dining hall remained there.
 After seeing Rosa off, Eva went to the sleeping quarters and sealed it.
 Of course, she did not enter the room at all at this time}."
"This is all information I discovered by gathering it from the people involved.
 These are not baseless red truths.
 They are truths I arrived at through proper reasoning constructed from testimony.
 And not only testimony—I took fingerprints and performed every kind of forensic test available to me."
"After all, Kinzo‐san\'s study is a treasure trove of all kinds of chemicals!
 I obtained all sorts of scientific evidence, which is truth in its purest form and infinitely close to red truth.
 However, this isn\'t a science mystery, so I\'ll spare you the details."
As Erika swaggered around the cathedral, she arrogantly touted her scientific knowledge.
She had thorough knowledge of all the chemicals in Kinzo\'s study and had used them to conduct a scientific investigation,
 which had now been acknowledged and made into red truth by {f:5:Bernkastel}.
......Without going into too much detail, the results she had obtained would have been convincing even without the red truth.
Fingerprint collection with aluminum powder.
{n}Composition analysis on the mud under people\'s shoes. Various chemical reactions from clinging rain water.
......Erika had walked in and out of the study that didn\'t belong to her several times,
 using all manner of chemicals however she pleased without asking the family\'s permission.
However, no one could fault her for this.
{n}The pieces couldn\'t hinder any action the detective might take for the investigation.
{n}That was the power of the detective\'s authority.
"............You act like you own the place...
 ......From now on, I\'ll warn everyone I meet never to welcome in any guest who calls themselves a detective."
"I believe that would be wise.
 Giving shelter to a detective is just about the worst omen of misfortune out there."
".........This is proof...
that it was only possible to reach Genji\'s sleeping quarters and commit the crime...
between midnight and {nobr:1 a.m}, just as with the murders in the guesthouse.
 And furthermore, Erika\'s investigation also proved that it was impossible for Genji to reach the cousins\' room."
It had already been made clear in red truth that, after transferring the phone call to Natsuhi,
 Genji had gone straight back to the servants\' quarters.
Now, based on the results of Erika\'s scientific investigation, they added a further red truth:
 {p:1:Genji never left the mansion after 24:00}...
This made it clear beyond doubt that Genji couldn\'t have reached the guesthouse,
 much less the cousins\' room......
"That leaves......only Krauss and Natsuhi...!
 All other people have had their alibis proven!!"
"......Im...
...possible.........
 ...............—"
Natsuhi\'s mouth flapped open and shut like a goldfish starved of oxygen.
And that was an accurate analogy.
......Natsuhi\'s mind was blank and spinning out of control, and she felt as though she really would suffocate.
"......Ushiromiya Natsuhi.
 ......I\'ll give you one last chance.
 Confess that all of the crimes were the work of your husband."
"D‐......don\'t be ridiculous!!
 Do I look like the kind of woman who would falsely accuse her husband?!!"
"......Beato.
 Natsuhi\'s denied it.
 I\'ll give you the same chance.
 ......You understand, right?
 ......Please don\'t tell me...
that you expect to be able to take advantage of the fact that Krauss is missing to try and pull a Devil\'s Proof on me......"
".........gah, ghh............"
Beato realized that they were rapidly approaching the end of this battle.
Normally, these alibis of Erika\'s would still have many places that Beato could argue against using the blue truth.
However, all of those alibis had been accepted by {f:5:Bernkastel} and {f:5:Lambdadelta} as red truth,
 and Beato no longer had any room to argue......
"......It\'s like.........Erika\'s creating the plotline,
 and those witches are distorting things so that everything matches up with it..."
"That\'s right.
 If the Game Master, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}, accepts a truth, its authenticity will not be questioned.
 The world that comes after will be formed based on the truth that remains in the end.
 ......This happens no matter how far this final truth is from the real truth."
"There\'s no way Uncle Krauss is the culprit.
 He\'s being held prisoner somewhere.
 ......W‐wait,
 we can\'t deny the possibility that Aunt Natsuhi was skillfully tricked into believing that during the phone call......"
"Do you suspect Natsuhi and Krauss, Battler‐kun?"
"Well............"
"Erika\'s truth has been constructed in a cowardly fashion, but it is a proper truth.
 She may be colluding with a witch, but it has still been acknowledged as red truth.
 In other words, it cannot be a fake truth built only on lies."
"......This means that even Erika\'s truth makes sense.
 The truth about Natsuhi and Krauss being the culprits is also very possible.
 It may be a hollow truth, but it is {i:consistent}.
 ......It\'s a fiction that holds the same worth as truth.
 ......Which of those two truths will you believe?
 That is for you to decide."
".........No.
 ......I\'ll...............trust Aunt Natsuhi...and Uncle Krauss.
 I realize that they\'re in some money trouble."
"But even so, ......I don\'t want to believe that they\'re the culprits.
 No, I can\'t believe it...!"
"How do you intend to get Natsuhi out of this position, where she\'s so cornered by red which is slowly but surely closing in on her?"
"I, ......I don\'t know......
 But I......seriously don\'t want to give up...!
 Aunt Natsuhi\'s been caught in a cowardly trap, that\'s all.
 ...And Erika\'s reasoning is all part of it...!
 So whether it\'s intentional or she\'s being manipulated, Erika is aiding the true culprit."
".........Even if Erika {i:has} accused Aunt Natsuhi of being the culprit, ......and even if everyone else here believes that,
 ......that\'s exactly why I want to be the one person who trusts her...!"
If everyone assumes it\'s true, does it become the truth?
{n}If everyone accepts a lie, does it become the truth?
Must the solitary truth‐teller...
be dragged to the guillotine to the jeers of liars?
"I......don\'t like it.
 ......If no one will believe Aunt Natsuhi, then I will...!!"
"Real truth isn\'t something that\'s determined when everyone thinks something sounds reasonable!
 It\'s something you arrive at after thoroughly investigating both possibilities...!
 So this trial is a downright lie!
 It\'s a kangaroo court that exists for no reason other than to set Aunt Natsuhi up as the culprit!!"
"......Beato is doing all she can to plead Natsuhi\'s case, you know."
"Wrong.
 Beato is trying to refute Erika\'s argument.
 ......She\'s just defending!
 You can\'t fight in this trial by simply resisting all of your opponent\'s claims.
 This is why Beato always cornered me in the past...!"
"She isn\'t going to beat Erika by finding flaws in her reasoning!
 She has to find a different truth and show {f:5:Lambdadelta}, the ruler of this game...
...
that her truth is more correct than Erika\'s...!!"
"Without violating any of the red truths that Lady {f:5:Bernkastel} has shown,
 can you weave together a truth where Natsuhi isn\'t the culprit......?"
"......I, ......I don\'t know...
 But, .......as long as I don\'t believe that Aunt Natsuhi is the culprit, there\'s got to be a different truth!"
"I don\'t even care if the culprit for the crime ends up being a witch.
 That\'s better than having Aunt Natsuhi be framed by an incorrect truth...!!"
".........So, no matter how much red truth you are shown,
 you won\'t believe that Natsuhi is the culprit, correct?"
"Yeah......!
 For everything, there should always be some people who believe and some who don\'t...!
 No matter how much evidence is stacked up against her, someone has to believe that she\'s innocent!
 I\'m sure there are countless truths in the world that can\'t be proven with evidence.
 I don\'t ever want to accept that something\'s true just because everyone says it is!!"
How can you be sure that there\'s nothing on the far side of the moon if you\'ve never seen it?!
Is there some reason that you have to believe it?!
Until you see the far side of the moon with your own eyes,
 you can\'t rule out the possibility that nothing is there,
 and neither can you rule out the possibility of a thriving culture of space bunnies...!
You should never assume something is the truth until you actually check it.
This court is maliciously trying to force a single interpretation on a truth that can\'t be checked.
I once believed there was a society on the far side of the moon!!
But that was in elementary school, and I was made fun of and laughed at.
 So I thought it was embarrassing to think that a society lives on the moon......
...and I threw away that belief.
I\'d been told by a book my mom read me that rabbits lived on the far side of the moon,
 and I believed that for a long, long time.
......But when everyone said that was wrong,
 I abandoned that truth without even trying to check it!
......Even without evidence,
 I abandoned the truth I believed in......!
And now, everyone is starting to believe that Aunt Natsuhi is the culprit.
Even though not a single piece of decisive proof has been shown...!
There\'s no proof, but Erika\'s words sound reasonable, so they\'re probably the truth......?
 {i:That\'s} your reason to abandon your belief that Aunt Natsuhi is innocent?!
"If no one else will believe, ......then I will...!
 I believe that real truth only surfaces if you look with both eyes, one denying and one affirming...!!
 No matter how much they try to make Aunt Natsuhi out to be the culprit, it\'s my belief that she isn\'t!
 And I\'ll never give that up!!"
"...............I understand.
 Then allow me to grant you a single red truth.
 This is the single bit of power I will give you, now that you hold the will to fight in the truest sense."
"Power.........?"
"By the name of the Finite Witch {f:5:Virgilia},
 .........no, as the former witch {f:5:Beatrice}, I grant you this red truth."
{a:c:
"{p:1:Ushiromiya Natsuhi is not the culprit}!"}
"............!!!!"
"Plea bargain.
 ......If you acknowledge that Krauss is the culprit,
 Erika will cease her pursuit of Natsuhi.
 From then on, the investigation will proceed assuming that Krauss, whose location is unknown, is the culprit."
"What\'ll you do, Beato?
 At this rate, Natsuhi\'s in serious trouble, right?
 ......Will you accept the plea bargain?
 If you\'re willing to abandon this Ushiromiya family honor thing, Bern says she\'ll let you off with a draw.
 She\'s being really soft on you, you know...?"
Krauss was currently missing, and it was unknown whether he was alive or dead.
{n}Like Kinzo, he was no different than a "cat in a box" that had disappeared into the mists of the island.
The cat in the box is a creature of infinite variation; no interpretation of it can be denied.
It is the root of endless interpretations.
 The true source of the Endless Witch\'s power.
In other words, no matter how much {f:5:Bernkastel} were to claim that Krauss was the culprit,
 ......she wouldn\'t be able to make that the sole truth.
That is, the Krauss culprit theory and the witch theory could exist in almost perfect balance.
......Beato could make the game a draw.
{f:5:Bernkastel} was......tempting her.
 She was offering her a second chance if she would abandon the honor of the family she\'d sworn to protect...
and consent to weaving a fragment that would trample all over that honor.
There was no room for false confidence.
 For Beato, to lose was to die.
......Unless she could see herself having an overwhelming advantage in this game, the right move had to be to actively pursue a draw.
"......Mmg.........ugh........."
"I will not allow you to call my husband a killer!!
 My husband is the next in line to the Ushiromiya family headship!!
 The one person who will inherit the glory of the Ushiromiya family!
 I will never allow you to brand him as a criminal...!!"
"......Are you sure, Natsuhi......?
 .........If you refuse to suspect Krauss, ......then...you\'ll be the only one left.
 ...Alibis have been proven for everyone else, ......in other words, Hempel\'s Raven...!
 Even without any evidence, ...it will be determined that you are the culprit...!"
"And so what if I\'m the only one left?!
 I am Ushiromiya Natsuhi!!
 I will not run or hide!
 I am innocent!!
 And I am the representative of the noble head, with the One‐winged Eagle engraved into my heart!!"
"If you wish to insult me, go ahead!
 If you wish to ridicule me, do as you please!!
 But none of you can damage my honor with fiction!!"
With a dignified voice, ......Natsuhi stated her case openly before the witches above her.
However, this response of hers...
might have been exactly what {f:5:Bernkastel} had intended...
"......Natsuhi refuses the deal.
 .........And you, Beato?
 ...You understand, right?
 The instant Natsuhi is singled out, Lambda will deliver her verdict.
 As soon as that happens, the witch illusion will be denied, and you\'ll vanish into mist.
 ......Do you plan to let Natsuhi\'s foolish stubbornness drag you down to the depths of hell...?"
"...............nn............gah........."
"......Riiche.
 You fought well.
 ......Now\'s the time to withdraw.
 Convince Natsuhi and try to work out a compromise...!"
"Both Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} and Lady {f:5:Bernkastel} have boredom, not you, as their true enemy.
 ......I imagine they would like to play this game over again.
 If they see that you\'re willing to make a concession, they will most likely accept it gladly...
and move on to the next game."
"If we move on to the next game, .........then what will happen to the Natsuhi of this game,
 ......the Natsuhi of this fragment......?"
"Now isn\'t the time to be worrying about that!
 Natsuhi is just a piece!
 Even if she gets removed from this game, she\'ll show up again in the next one!"
"But the same does not hold for you, Milady...
 Through this game, I believe you have learned the moves that Lady {f:5:Bernkastel} has up her sleeves.
 It\'s a more realistic goal to make use of that and aim for victory in the next game instead.
 ......Accepting Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}\'s deal might be your one and only good option right now...!"
"Throw away that useless pride of yours!!
 Neither Kasparov nor Deep Blue won every game!
 The person that wins more games wins in the end, right?!
 If a witch gets too attached to a single match, a single life, a single piece,
 ......that witch dies!!"
"............My apologies,
 .........but I cannot do that.
 .........I know the strength of a man who believed even though everyone said he was wrong,
 ......and I know the suffering he went through when he was forced to abandon that belief...!"
"I will not abandon Natsuhi!
 Why?
 Because if everyone else suspects Natsuhi, then someone has to believe in her!
 Because truth can only be found in the gap between those who doubt and those who believe...!!"
"I won\'t abandon her!
 Even if everyone believes that Natsuhi is the culprit, I will still claim that a witch is responsible...!!
 If I can\'t even make that claim, my existence isn\'t worth anything...!!"
"......I can\'t afford to lose.
 "Truth" isn\'t for anyone to deny."
"......It\'s something that disappears...when you doubt it and abandon it yoursel{-}l{-}l{-}l{-}l{-}l{-}lf!!"
"Is that your answer, Beato......?"
"Yeah, of course I refuse!!
 Ushiromiya Krauss is not the culprit!!"
".........Fool.
 There\'ll be no coming back from this, you know...
 Here\'s what you get for being a quick‐tempered moron.
 By the name of {f:5:Bernkastel}, Witch of Miracles, I speak with the red truth.
 {p:1:Ushiromiya Krauss is not the culprit.
 And he was killed long ago.
 Shortly after you heard his voice over the phone, in fact}."
"N‐.........no.........
 ...D‐.........darling...............aaah...aaagghhhaaaaaaaaahhhh........."
{f:5:Bernkastel}\'s cruel and ruthless red blade gouged Natsuhi......
......It was......all too merciless.........
The lack of knowledge of whether Krauss was alive or dead had almost crushed Natsuhi with anxiety, but she had at least been capable of believing that he was alive...
And now, ......that hope...that expectation.......had been crushed......without any chance for a miracle......!!
She had thrown herself into this trap out of concern for her husband\'s safety.
With the loss of her daughter and husband.........she had now lost everything she had gained since marrying into the Ushiromiya family.
No, ......even after all this,
 .........one thing still remained.
If her husband was lost, .........then right now, she was the last person who could protect the honor of the Ushiromiya family.
She still......couldn\'t let it end here.........
Even wrapped up in so much sadness, ......Natsuhi would do all she could to protect that honor...
with her last ounce of strength......
"Nope, it\'s all over!
 It\'s been determined with the red truth that none of the remaining people in the dining hall left that room until one o\'clock.
 In other words, alibis have already been proven for everyone except Natsuhi!"
"......Well done, Erika and {f:5:Bernkastel}!
 You\'ve fully proven that the crime was impossible for everyone except Ushiromiya Natsuhi!
 Why don\'t I start reading aloud from the verdict."
"......At midnight on October 4th, 1986, the defendant, Ushiromiya Natsuhi,
 left before the others while pretending to return to her room to sleep,
 and murdered George, Jessica, Maria, Rosa, and Genji one after another during the one hour period before {nobr:1 a.m.}!"
"Let me add something on.
 Due to circumstantial evidence, include the murder of Krauss."
"Yeah, that\'s right.
 In this situation, it\'s unthinkable that anyone except Natsuhi could kill Krauss!!"
"A revision to the verdict!
 During the hour before {nobr:1 a.m.},
 Ushiromiya Natsuhi killed Krauss, George, Jessica, Maria, Rosa, and Genji one after another!
 It\'s only possible for any of these murders to have taken place between midnight and one o\'clock!
 The only person without an alibi during this time was Ushiromiya Natsuhi...!
 From this point forward, the game will proceed treating the defendant as the true culprit."
"Furthermore, because it has been fully proven that the crime was possible for {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s...
 {f:5:Beatrice}, the Endless Witch...!!
 This Court of Illusions hereby denies your existence!!"
"You have a chance to plead your case. Can you prove an alibi for Natsuhi?
 Or can you show the possibility of someone other than Natsuhi being responsible?
 If you can just do that, Natsuhi will stop at being one shade short of absolutely guilty,
 and the denial of your existence will be put on hold for this game......"
If Natsuhi had an alibi, Beato would have shown it long ago.
{n}In fact, wasn\'t the whole point of that trap to make her lose her alibi......?
"Even if her alibi is not proven, ......I will believe in Natsuhi\'s innocence...!!
 No matter how much you all try to pin your fake truth on her!!
 I am the true culprit!
 Natsuhi is innocent!!
 Even without any proof!!"
"......The truth is known only by the master of the night on this island, {f:5:Beatrice} the Golden.
 I am Ushiromiya Natsuhi!
 Now that my husband has passed away, I am the head of the Ushiromiya family!!
 My spirit will not be broken no matter how you try and humiliate me!"
"Why, you ask?
 It is because Father gave me permission to engrave the crest of the One‐winged Eagle into my heart...!!
 How can your evidence and alibis negate the honor and the crest engraved into my heart?
 They cannot!!
 The Ushiromiya crest emblazoned on my heart is immortal!!"
.........Now that Natsuhi and {f:5:Beatrice}...
had practically been placed on the guillotine,
 ......they cried out with all the strength of their determination...
However, that did nothing except bring a cold smile to the game master {f:5:Lambdadelta}\'s face.
Erika had constructed a truth that {f:5:Lambdadelta} could accept.
......And no one could construct a more convincing truth to deny Erika\'s.
In that case, the most convincing truth would swallow up everything else......and become the one and only "truth".
Even if it happened to be different from the real truth.
The truth of those in the past is swallowed up by the truth of those in the future.
......Even if that truth is a fiction.
{n}As long as everyone acknowledges it to be true...!
".........You\'re all bark and bluster.
 ......I like it best when witches sob and beg for their lives when they\'re about to be burned at the stake.
 When they try and act tough like you do, it\'s such a buzzkill.
 So I think I\'ll send you one final gift: a red truth to crush your bluster once and for all."
"Wh‐.........what do you mean.........?"
"......D‐
.........don\'t, ...Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}...
 ......Isn\'t it already going to be overwritten with the truth you desired......?
 Your truth and Natsuhi\'s should be able to coexist...
 Please don\'t defile it......
 .........Please............"
"{p:1:Natsuhi.
 When did Kinzo ever say it was okay for you to engrave the One‐winged Eagle into your heart?
 Those were just the words of the Kinzo from your delusions.
 ......The real Kinzo?
 Throughout his entire life, not {i:once}...
did he ever trust you from the bottom of his heart,
 and not once did he ever consider letting you bear the family crest}!"
When that heartless announcement was made.........Kinzo stood up.
"Natsuhi!! You need not listen to this!!
 No one can defile the crest engraved in your heart!!
 That is yours alone!!
 Do not ever forget your pride as the final head of the Ushiromiya family!
 Natsuhii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}iii!!"
"Just shut up and disappear.
 You putrid delusion, vomit of Natsuhi\'s mind."
"Nngggaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhhhh!!
 You can\'t erase me! You can\'t erase my soul!!
 Not as long as Natsuhi continues to engrave the crest into her heart!!"
"You lying illusion.
 {p:1:The real Kinzo would never say such a thing.
 Begone,
 you fantasy of Kinzo inside Natsuhi\'s mind, beautified by her to suit her own purposes}."
"Gwaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}ah{0}h{0}hha{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}ahhhh,
 Na...
tsuhi......
nnggwoo{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}oohhhhhhh...!!!"
Bright red flashes of lightning smashed Kinzo over and over again as he screamed.
Then, he crumpled like a doll......and sat back down in his chair as though nothing had happened.
The fierce emotion had left Kinzo\'s face.
He had truly......become like a wax model.
{n}And so, .........he would never again share kind words with Natsuhi...
.........Yes.
The true Kinzo...
......never once trusted Natsuhi during his entire life.
The true Kinzo...
...never once thought about allowing Natsuhi to bear the One‐winged Eagle.
......Although it doesn\'t deserve repeating,
 ...Kinzo had already passed away before the game began.
The Kinzo appearing in this game...
......was nothing more than Natsuhi\'s...
......delusion......
Everything about this Kinzo,
 ......who believed in Natsuhi and entrusted her with protecting the family honor...
...was an illusion...
......created by Natsuhi.........
"{p:1:Pitiful woman.
 Now is the time for you to face the truth that you never gained Ushiromiya Kinzo\'s trust as long as he lived}."
"Wah...
......waaah......"
"......Natsuhi.........
......don\'t cry.
 ......Kinzo...
entrusted the Ushiromiya family...
to you, did he not......?"
......No, he didn\'t.
Not only did he not entrust her with that,
 ......he never said hello...
......or met her gaze even once.........
"......Uu, ......uwaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahh......!!
 Aaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}ahhhhhh!!"
Natsuhi\'s cry,
 a mixture of sadness and many other emotions,
 echoed throughout the cathedral......
......Natsuhi could no longer stop her tears.
Some last, faint element that had cheered her up until today,
 that had allowed her to endure as an Ushiromiya, as the wife to the head\'s representative, ......and as the final family head...
......had been torn to bits......
Natsuhi no longer...
...had anything left.
Natsuhi could no longer allow herself to even call herself an Ushiromiya.........
The difficult days, the painful days.
The days where she still gave everything she could for the family she\'d married into despite it all.
......The rare happy days that existed among them.
All of these flitted through her mind, one after another...
......and disappeared.
All of those once beautiful memories,
 ......now crushed by {f:5:Bernkastel}\'s red truth,
 .........smashed into tiny shards that scattered everywhere,
 ...buried themselves deep into her hands,
 ......and soaked them red with the blood of sorrow...
.........It was...
the red of sadness...
and truth.
"That is all.
 ......All it takes is the presence of this crime,
 and a deduction like this becomes trivial for Furudo Erika.
 ......Your thoughts, ladies and gentlemen...?"
{f:5:Lambdadelta}...clapped.
Then, a little later than expected, {f:5:Bernkastel} began to clap as well, looking satisfied.
The expressionless, wax‐figure‐like audience followed suit,
 and the unshakable verdict was welcomed with great applause.........
And so, .........the "truth" of this tale...
was decided.........
Right now, no humans exist on this island except for those in this parlor.
And with one exception, it has been shown that none of them have committed murder.
And, the culprit is among these people.
"......Whoa, whoa.
 ...In that case, ...it\'s conclusive, isn\'t it...?"
"Unless the culprit is a witch who committed murder with magic, that is..."
"............It was you?!
 You killed George, killed my husband?!
 Why?!!
 Whyy{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}yyy?!!"
"I, ...I didn\'t kill anyone...!
 I, I, d‐didn\'t do...!!"
"....................."
In a panic, and with a voice that really couldn\'t be called flowing,
 ......in a manner that was, to put it coldly, unsightly...Aunt Natsuhi denied the suspicion placed upon her...
However, ......there was no longer any way around it...
{i:The girl} stood up, ...brushed back her long hair, pointed at Aunt Natsuhi, and said it one more time.
"......You are the culprit.
 Ushiromiya Natsuhi‐san."
Red‐faced and tear‐streaked,
 ......Eva walked up to Natsuhi...
...and grabbed her by the collar.
Then, wordlessly, she slapped Natsuhi\'s cheek.
Natsuhi, who had never been slapped in her life,
 was shocked by her first ever taste of iron.
It turned into a scuffle between Eva and Natsuhi.
Battler immediately tried to stop them,
 but Eva planted a sharp knee into Battler\'s gut and he doubled over.
"Give them back, give back George and my husband!!
 Why did you kill them?!
 You murderer, murdereeeeeeeer!!"
Sobbing, Eva kicked Natsuhi, who had fallen to the ground, over and over.
Battler tried once more to cut in and stop them, but he was brushed aside,
 ......and after that, no one tried to stop them.
Repeating her son and husband\'s names over and over, Eva kicked Natsuhi.
 And kicked her.
Then she started grabbing whatever her eyes fell upon and throwing it.
......Natsuhi was hit with a steaming teacup,
 ...then a can of black tea, whose tea leaves fell out all over her.
She was kicked, her hair pulled and dragged up,
 her cheek slapped so many times that it started to swell.
No one tried to stop it.
{n}It wasn\'t because they were worried about Eva kicking them too.
It was because they thought it an appropriate act of retribution for a person who had lost her beloved son and husband.
A proper...retribution.
 A proper...truth.
Everyone in the parlor accepted that Natsuhi was the culprit.
 ......They accepted the truth that Erika claimed.
So it became a proper truth, and Natsuhi was designated as the proper culprit.
She had already lost the husband and daughter who would have protected her,
 ......and even Kinzo, who should have given her a final bit of strength, had already vanished like a bubble in the ocean of illusions......
No longer...would anyone protect her.
 No longer...would anyone believe her. So she was now...the true culprit.
Eva\'s shoulders heaved with her heavy breathing.
{n}......Apparently, her anger still hadn\'t abated.
Erika patted Eva\'s shoulder and made her take a step back.
......Of course, this wasn\'t to protect Natsuhi from violence.
It was to further humiliate her, ......now that she had been branded as the culprit.
"Natsuhi‐san.
 I\'ve solved two of the three riddles.
 The whodunit.
 The howdunit.
 The final riddle—the whydunit—must always be confessed by the culprit herself.
 Please follow the rules of the mystery genre and confess."
The whydunit......refers to the motive.
"If this was a third‐rate mystery,
 ......you would let out a high‐pitched laugh about now, confess to the crime,
 and start telling the story of your sad past.
 ......Don\'t tell me you intend to make me explain that part as well?"
"......I am not the culprit!!
 Someone, believe me!!
 I had my husband taken hostage, and I was blackmailed......I was framed...!!"
Natsuhi, with her hair a mess and her face red and tear‐streaked,
 ......protested to everyone,
 .........but no one met her gaze.
Because it had already been resolved that Natsuhi was the culprit.
Because {f:5:Lambdadelta} had acknowledged that the culprit of the tale was Natsuhi and woven it that way,
 none of the pieces would pay any heed to Natsuhi\'s......to "the culprit\'s" words...
"Natsuhi isn\'t the culprit!!
 I am the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}!!
 I am the one who commands Rokkenjima\'s night and who has reigned since long before the time you were all still scared of the dark!"
"Why can\'t you just call it my sin? Why must you suspect Natsuhi?!!
 Acknowledge me!!
 I committed all the crimes!!
 It cannot be the work of a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}! It cannot beee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}ee!!"
The witch illusion had already been crushed, ......and Beato\'s voice didn\'t reach anyone.
The verdict had already been announced.
 ......Everything had been decided.
"No one can hear you.
 You\'re a phantom, a mere illusion!
 Go back to being a simple portrait!
 You\'re a frail illusion of a witch, born when the relatives shared in Kinzo\'s fantasy!!
 That is the truth chosen by this world!!"
"So, Great Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}!!
 Now is the time for you to bury this presumptuous and foolish illusion that calls itself a witch...!!"
"Goodbye, {f:5:Beatrice}.
 .........I made you a witch hoping that you would either become my friend,
 or help distract me from my boredom.
 And you\'ve answered my expectations.
 The second one, that is.
 ...Eheheh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eheh!!"
"......I...
...am a witch......
 Even if you don\'t acknowledge it, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}...
 ......I am a witch........."
"You wouldn\'t even have been capable of believing that if I hadn\'t become your guardian in the first place...!!
 Okay, it\'s game over for you now.
 I\'ll bury you in accordance with the rules of your game board.
 ......What happens to the losers in your game, again...?"
"Beato has already shown that clearly in a previous game.
 You get tossed into the goats\' dinner party as a lump of living flesh and are chewed to bits."
"Now there\'s a fitting end for you, {f:5:Beatrice}.
 And I did come all the way here just to hear the death cries of one as haughty as you...!!"
One by one, a massive number of unspeaking goat attendants
 slipped out from behind pillars and began to fill the cathedral.
The goats paid no attention to Natsuhi, who was seated in the center,
 but the crowd completely enveloped her.
From Beato\'s point of view up on the balcony,
 ......it must have looked like a huge boiling pot of goats.
"...............Heh,
 ......*cackle*,
 ...haha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!
 That\'s right,
 ......this was our contract from the beginning...!"
"Yep.
 Our contract said that whenever you stopped entertaining me,
 you would relieve me of my boredom with your life!"
"Come, strip the title of witch from this woman and throw her into the pot of goats!!"
Suddenly, there were goats standing right behind Beato.
......They lifted her up roughly.
"Let me hear some nice screams.
 You\'re a bottle of wine we\'ve been saving for this day."
"......Then remaining silent will be my final strike back at you..."
"Yes! I made her say it!
 Uhihihahaaah!!
 The screams of those who gift me that line as their parting shot are the most gratifying of all!
 ......Now fall!
 {f:5:Beatricee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}eeee}......!!!"
The goats carrying Beato no longer viewed her as their master.
After holding her above the pot of clambering goats,
 which were snorting heavily in anticipation......
...they threw Beato\'s slender body into the air.
All at once, the squirming goats faced the heavens and raised their arms.
It was almost as though...
devouring her flesh would allow them to forget their pain for just a short while.
As she flew through the air, Beato tried to smile boldly,
 ......but it was so forced that it seemed even more pathetic,
 greatly pleasing {f:5:Bernkastel}.
When Beato fell into the pot, the goats caught her.
Of course, they didn\'t do it gently.
The arms of countless goats pulled at her flesh to keep it for themselves.
They tried to tear her to bits.
It didn\'t have to be flesh.
{n}Hair, fingernails, shoes, even bits of her dress worked just fine.
The mouths of those goats were the gateway into hell.
However, Beato was too big to pass through that gateway.
So they had to chew and tear her...
into bits small enough to fit into it...!
.........Beato let out a bold laugh.
{n}She laughed from inside the pot of goats.
However, her expression was very different from the one she had intended.
 .........It was an expression not of a witch, ......but of a single {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} screaming out for the final time.
Then, the sea of goats parted.
Dlanor leapt forward, slicing all the goats in her path with a single flash of her longsword.
......It was a thin slice, like cutting through butter.
The goats were surprised by Dlanor\'s sudden appearance and stepped back.
In the center, {f:5:Beatrice} cowered in tatters,
 ......sobbing......
"What\'s the meaning of this?
 Inquisitor Dlanor."
"My apologies, but I have something to {f:5:say}.
 There is someone who has an objection to this {f:5:verdict}.
 His name is...
Ushiromiya Battler."
All of the goats stared at Battler.
"What do you find unsatisfactory about the court\'s {f:5:decision}...?
 ......I assume you possess new evidence or truth sufficient to request a {f:5:retrial}...?"
"........................gah......"
I get it.
 ......Dlanor is offering me a helping hand.
If she hadn\'t jumped in here, it\'d all be over.
And I fully understand now how I\'m supposed to fight.
But it\'s that very understanding......that makes me unable to fight.
Because I know I can\'t win by simply countering Erika\'s truth.
If I want to deny her truth, I\'ll need to present a different one.
...And I still don\'t have a clue what that truth is......!
"There is nothing that time cannot {f:5:heal}.
 And there is no truth that cannot be reached if you spend enough time {f:5:searching}.
 ......However, all courts place time limits upon determining the {f:5:truth}.
 And a truth that cannot be reached within that time limit cannot become {f:5:truth}."
......Yeah, ...I know that......!!
{n}By now, everyone is certain that Aunt Natsuhi is the culprit.
{n}It might be too late now, ......even for the real truth...!
Aunt Eva\'s violence will probably go unstopped,
 and no one is even thinking about protecting Aunt Natsuhi.
It\'s no longer a situation where we can say "oh, the truth will eventually be found".
And in this world, ......even the time allotted to us to expose the truth...is very short.
It\'s already midnight and the end of the game.
The police won\'t come.
 The truth won\'t be revealed!
Only the truth decided upon here and now will remain...!
"..........................."
I slowly stood up,
 ......walked in front of Beato,
 ......and faced Dlanor.
.........I have no plan.
 I don\'t know the truth.
......However, ......if I don\'t jump in now, I won\'t get another chance to fight...
The red used by Erika\'s group is mercilessly strict.
I seriously doubt that I can put together a truth where Aunt Natsuhi isn\'t the culprit without violating that red......
"......Why the uncertain {f:5:face}?
 How {f:5:pathetic}."
"D‐.........dammit........."
"......B‐......Battler......"
"I\'ll be the one to kill you.
 ...I want to keep that promise.
 ......And yet,
 ......right now,
 ......I don\'t have any plan at all......"
"............That\'s okay...
 In this world,
 ......there is no truth.
 ......The truth is made later on and overwrites what comes before it.
 Real truth...
...doesn\'t exist anywhere......"
"This is a wonderful turn of events, Dlanor.
 Yes, the execution of a princess would be no fun at all without a knight appearing to rescue her.
 ......And there could be nothing better than having him beheaded before her very eyes!
 Bury the old piece and the unneeded player together!!"
"As you {f:5:wish}.
 Glory be to the great Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}!
 I am the Chief {f:5:Inquisitor}, Dlanor {nobr:A. Knox}...!!
 Step {f:5:forward}, Ushiromiya Battler!!"
"D‐......dammit, I\'ve got nothing more to lose...
 If you wanna see me struggle, here you gooo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}ooo!!"
The only reason Erika\'s theory is so strong is because of those seals.
She was given red so quickly just because {f:5:Lambdadelta} easily bought the alibis created by those seals.
But the seals aren\'t red truth!
{n}Just sticking paper in a door crack is far from perfect.
There\'s no way something like that can prove anything with "certainty"...!
"Begin, Battler!!
 Ready to let those goats turn you into a pile of meat along with your beloved {f:5:Beatrice}?!"
"Oh, and I\'ll mix the leftovers from your precious sister into that pile.
 Wouldn\'t that make for a wonderful stack of meat?
 ......Then we can wrap it up in a dumpling, steam it and maybe add some soy sauce!!"
"No, the best way would be to fry them in a pan with some eggs and ketchup!!"
""Ahyahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hhhya{0}hhya{0}hya{0}yhya{0}ha{0}ha{0}haa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaahhhh!!""
"D‐dammiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiittt!!"
"{p:2:Can\'t we doubt the reliability of these seals of Erika\'s?!
 Something like wedging some paper in a door can\'t create a perfect alibi!
 It might be that someone noticed by chance and happened to put it back in the same place}...!!"
The blade of my blue truth should have slashed diagonally through Dlanor\'s chest.
...However, Dlanor\'s expression didn\'t budge in the slightest, and there wasn\'t a single wound on her chest.
"I was wondering what you\'d throw out there, but this is ridiculous..."
"......Allow me to explain.
 This is what I sealed the doors with.
 ......Did you think this was paper, Battler‐san?"
Erika once again held up the thing that looked like brown paper.
"This is duct tape.
 Its adhesive power is extremely strong.
 ......I scored it with scissors to make sure it tore easily."
"Furthermore, across the center seam and the edges affixed to the door and the frame...
I wrote my signature, which is impossible to reproduce.
 Therefore, it\'s impossible to tear it off without leaving a mark, and it\'s impossible to reattach too...!"
"Applying to unsheathe the Red {f:5:Key}."
"Granted."
"{p:1:Due to the above, the seals are guaranteed to be {f:5:perfect}.
 Miss Erika\'s seals were not broken by anyone, and deception is {f:5:impossible}}!!"
"{p:2:I\'ll acknowledge Erika\'s seals...!
 However, Auntie Eva\'s seal on Genji‐san\'s room should be different}!!"
"{p:1:Eva\'s seal was of the same type as Miss Erika\'s.
 That is because this method of sealing was one that Miss Erika and Eva conceived of together after {f:5:dinner}}."
"{p:2:Erika fished through the chemicals in Grandfather\'s room saying she\'d use them for forensic testing, right?!
 There might have been some kind of solvent among them!!
 If you used that, you might be able to tear off the duct tape without leaving fingernail marks}!!"
"For your attention: I beg to inform you of the following.
 {p:1:It is impossible to tear off any of the seals by any method without leaving marks}."
"For your attention: I beg to inform you of the following.
 {p:1:There were no suspicious marks on any of the seals}...!"
"This proves that there was no tampering done to any of the seals.
 Repetition requested!!"
"Yes, gladly.
 {p:1:All of Erika and Eva\'s seals...
were not tampered with in any way that hindered their ability to act as seals, such as being scraped off}."
"......Dammiiiiiiit...
 damn you, sticking duct tape all over the place that leaves marks on whatever it touches......!"
Dlanor isn\'t my only enemy.
{n}There\'s also her subordinates, Gertrude and Cornelia.
{n}And also Erika and her master {f:5:Bernkastel}.
{n}And even {f:5:Lambdadelta}, the one who hijacked Beato\'s game!
Everyone in this cathedral is an enemy.
That fierce rush of red immediately repelled my feeble truth.
......It\'s obvious why. I don\'t have any alternate truth.
{n}Even at this final stage, ......I have nothing...
"Were the seals all that you had to {f:5:discuss}?
 You promised to give me everything you {f:5:have}."
"..................kh........."
If I only knew a truth that could prove Aunt Natsuhi\'s innocence...
{n}If I could only make a theory that weaves its way through Erika\'s red......
......Dammit, I don\'t know anything!!
".........Do you have any chance of winning...?"
"......I left it at home.
 Mind if I go back and get it?"
"I have already lost.
 ......I am prepared for my fate."
"......I promised that I\'d kill you.
 So I won\'t let anyone else do it.
 I never break a promise...!!"
"That\'s a lie.
 ......I will never trust one of your promises again."
"Huh?
 When did I ever make a promise to you and lie about it...?"
"............Heheheh, ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*.
 ......After hearing you say that, hell might not be so bad.
 ......Eha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha, gaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha...!!
 Kill us! {f:5:Bernkastel}, {f:5:Lambdadelta}...!!
 Hyahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haa{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!"
Beato let out a shrill cry, overcome with laughter.
{n}......It was a broken laugh, and tears streamed down her cheeks.
Battler\'s words would no longer reach her ears.
She kept on laughing insanely, like a broken record......
"Is it {f:5:over}?
 {f:5:Pitiful}.
 I truly am {f:5:disappointed}, Ushiromiya Battler...!!"
"Hyah{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha, hiihha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haa{0}ha{0}ha{0}hah{0}hya{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahh!!

 Doesn\'t that violate Knox\'s somethingth or whatever}?!!"
"Be advised that {p:1:the red truth is simply truth, and there is no need to provide evidence or proof}!!"
"Wh‐
......what the...
.....d‐
......damn it aa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}ll......!!"
In the face of these insane arguments,
 ......all my effort to overturn the truth treating Aunt Natsuhi as the culprit is completely meaningless.
Each time I brandish my desperate blue truths,
 Dlanor and the others\' red truths knock me down to the floor.
......It\'s getting hard to even stand back up again.
...Does that mean......my body is telling me that I\'m about to surrender...
to the truth where Aunt Natsuhi is the culprit...?
Their red truth is getting more and more perfect......
Each time I think I can slip through a chink in their armor,
 Dlanor smacks me down with the red longsword of Knox......
"......Hihihiha,
 hiihii,
 ......haha, haha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha......"
"............Beato......"
"That\'s enough, Battlerr...
 ......This will at last be...
the end of the eternal torture that torments me—no, us.
 ......Let us fall together into the depths..."
"........................gah..."
I don\'t...
want to see Beato like this......
Her majesty as the ruler of the Golden Land...
...and her enthusiasm as my adversary...
...are completely gone.
She\'s just a pitiful woman who\'s been trampled over and who has lost all hope,
 with tears streaming down her face and a tragic smile that I can\'t bear to look at......
"Does your truth no longer {f:5:exist}?"
No,
 ......I have one...
...last thing.
"......And that is a different truth, where Natsuhi is not the {f:5:culprit}?"
......No.
 All I can do is prove that Aunt Natsuhi isn\'t the culprit.
I can\'t show...
...what the real truth beyond that...
...is at all......
"......But even so, ......maybe at least you\'ll be saved that way."
"Why.........?"
"......I can show without a doubt that Aunt Natsuhi isn\'t the culprit.
 ...But I cannot present a different truth.
 ......If Erika\'s truth is dispersed, the crime will return to darkness, and there might still be room for you to exist."
"Assuming you can pull it off.
 .........But if you can\'t present a new truth, that means you\'re incompetent and useless as a player.
 I\'ll have you vanish from this game board for all eternity."
At this point, the Game Master is {f:5:Lambdadelta},
 ......and she\'s there too.
This probably doesn\'t mean defeat in a single game,
 but being banished from this game for all eternity as the loser.
From what the witches have said in the past,
 I can faintly imagine the place "pieces" are sent when they\'re banished.
It\'s known as the depths of oblivion,
 ......an eternal darkness that lies on the far side of an eternal oblivion and where there is no concept of life or death...
......I\'m...going to disappear.
 But still, ......Beato will remain.
As long as Beato remains, no matter how suspicious Aunt Natsuhi is,
 ......there will always remain space for the witch to be the culprit...in other words, room for Aunt Natsuhi to not be the culprit.
......As long as that wiggle room is there, ......someone will eventually expose the truth.
It doesn\'t have to be me.
Eventually, ......someone, at least, will smash this fake truth to pieces......!
I understood that this...
...was the time to abandon myself for the sake of this other person who would eventually appear,
 ......for the sake of the real truth......
"......Well,
 ......it looks like I\'ll have to break my promise to kill you after all."
"Don\'t.
 Don\'t leave me as the only one alive.
 I\'ll disappear with you.
 Let that be your final tribute to me.
 ......I beg you, if you just grant this one wish, I won\'t need anything else......"
".........Have you said your last {f:5:goodbyes}?
 ......I really am disappointed in {f:5:you}, Ushiromiya Battler."
"Hurry up and put him out of his misery.
 We still have to get to my monologue exposing Natsuhi‐san\'s crimes."
"You guys really are interesting.
 {f:5:Beatrice}.
 Ushiromiya Battler."
"......But I\'ve gotten tired of you.
 You aren\'t needed in {i:our game}.
 .........
*giggle*giggle*giggle*,
 ehe{0}he{0}he{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahah!!
 Do it, Dlanor!!"
"This is the {f:5:end}.
 ......If you still have one last bit of power,
 let me see you muster it now, in your last {f:5:moments}...!"
"Nn.........
......nnnggaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aagghhhhh!!!"
It\'s a small but brilliant red truth.
{n}My last trump card, courtesy of {f:5:Virgilia}...!!
Erika......this takes your theory back to square one...!!
"Go for it...if you think you can."
{a:c:
Take thiiiiiiiiiiis}!!!
"{p:1:Ushiromiya Natsuhi is not the culprit}!!!"
The red truth is simply truth, with no evidence or proof required.........!!
This will make Dlanor stagger...!!
Even if that\'s all it does,
 ......it\'s the first and last strike I can make...!!
"{p:1:Knox\'s 2nd:
 It is forbidden for supernatural agencies to be employed as a detective {f:5:technique}}."
...............Huh......?
 My...
...red truth...
......was blown away by Dlanor\'s red longsword......
"......In this court, if anyone other than witches is going to speak the red truth,
 they\'ll have to construct an appropriate proof for it.
 Erika has been following this protocol, why can\'t you...?"
True, Erika herself hasn\'t used the red even once so far.
......She\'s always had the witch {f:5:Bernkastel} make those statements by using repetition requests......
"Your red truth isn\'t something you obtained for yourself.
 ......It\'s a supernatural truth gifted to you by a paranormal entity.
 In other words, it isn\'t reasoning.
 It\'s no better than a random thought......"
I‐
......in that case,
 ......if I have {f:5:Virgilia}...
...say the same red truth......
Where is......{f:5:Virgilia}.........?
"If you are to present that red truth, you must construct an appropriate {f:5:argument}.
 ............Can you do {f:5:that}......?"
No, .........it\'s impossible............
I just have the truth that Aunt Natsuhi isn\'t the culprit...
.........without any basis or evidence.
".........See......?
 ......Real truth......is a very fragile thing.
 ......Does real truth exist...?
 And is it necessary......?
 ......Even without it, ......the story goes on......
 ......Battleeer........."
"Now, Battler.
 ......Prove the red you have {f:5:shown}.
 ......If you cannot, this is {f:5:goodbye}."
"............Then...
...this is goodbye.
 ......Sorry,
 Beato."
"......Don\'t say that.
 Thanks for sticking around with me.
 ......It was such a blood‐stained tale...
......but it was fun..."
"{p:1:This court is now {f:5:disbanded}.
 {f:5:Dead}.

"<Die the DEATH>!
 <Sentence to DEATH>!!{n}
 <Great equalizer is the DEATH>}!!"
Then, the trial for the fifth game was over.
{n}The detective, Furudo Erika, accused the culprit, Ushiromiya Natsuhi.
There are three riddles that the detective must explain.
The first is the whodunit.
 Who is the culprit?
As previously stated, it is Ushiromiya Natsuhi.
The second is the howdunit.
 How did they carry out the crime?
During the hour between midnight on October 4th, 1986 and {nobr:1 a.m.} the next day,
 Ushiromiya Natsuhi went to the cousins\' room on the second floor of the guesthouse and the servants\' quarters on the first floor of the mansion.
 There, she carried out the murders.
It is only possible for the crime to have taken place during that hour,
 and for that one hour, alibis have been proven for all characters except Natsuhi.
From the sky, a massive, red longsword, even greater in size than the one Dlanor held, came crashing down like a thunderbolt,
 and pierced through Battler\'s heart, pinning him in place while he still stood......
In that instant, {f:5:Beatrice} vanished in a spray of gold,
 ......and her former minions disappeared as well.
As the heartless witches looked down at the cathedral\'s center, laughing coldly,
 ......all that remained was Battler, with the red longsword sticking through him, and Dlanor.
"Agh.........nng...
...............gghh........."
"......Rest in {f:5:peace}, Ushiromiya Battler.
 It is a {f:5:shame}.
 I thought you were a more capable person than {f:5:this}."
"...............guh........................"
Battler blew bubbles of blood,
 ......closed his eyes slowly,
 ............and expired......
Dlanor stared on in silence,
 ......then turned on her heels when she saw his life leave him.
After that, all that remained was the corpse of this sorrowful man, pierced by the sword that acted as a massive, red grave marker,
 and lit by the faint glow let in from the cathedral\'s skylight.........
And then, there is the third riddle that the detective must uncover.
The final riddle...the whydunit.
{n}Why did they commit the crime—
the motive.
In third‐rate mysteries, there\'s no need to uncover this.
After all, even if you don\'t expose the motive, the culprit will just confess it when all\'s said and done.
However, Furudo Erika was first‐rate, so she would expose even this.
Natsuhi was confined in the parlor, under everyone\'s watchful gaze.
Then, with everyone\'s assent,
 Erika diligently and persistently searched all places, even Natsuhi\'s room, for clues about her motive.
"Well, now that we have all gathered,
 just what is it that drove Ushiromiya Natsuhi‐san to commit these terrible murders?
 Through my investigation, I, the detective Furudo Erika, have discovered the general outline that explains this.
 I would like to announce it now."
Everyone remained silent, urging her to continue......
Erika tossed some of Natsuhi\'s possessions that had been "confiscated" onto the table...
"First, these are past diaries that were discovered in Natsuhi‐san\'s room.
 They have barely been used at all in recent years,
 but they describe in detail the period shortly after she became a part of the Ushiromiya family."
"Most of them were locked, but in order to find the full truth behind this crime,
 I used my authority, which everyone has acknowledged,
 to destroy the locks on all of them."
"......Y‐
......you monster......
 ......Reading...
...another person\'s diary......"
"If we\'re monsters, what does that make you, murderer?!!
 A criminal like you has no right to privacy!!"
"And this is what I found from these diaries.
 Natsuhi‐san ended up married to Krauss‐san due to special circumstances."
"......I imagine that all of you here know much more about this than I do.
 Natsuhi‐san and Krauss‐san were not married because of love or as a normal arranged marriage.
 ......If anything, it was more like taking a hostage."
"Th‐......that is not true!!"
"This is written on the 24th page of this red diary:
 .........‘I am a hostage being imprisoned by the Ushiromiya family under the guise of marriage.
 However, if everything can be resolved this way......’"
"Natsuhi‐san.
 Right here, you\'ve already admitted that you were a hostage.
 ......Kumasawa‐san, you have served Natsuhi‐san since the time she first came here, right?
 Could you tell me about what it was like at the time?"
".........Y‐......yes, that\'s correct.
 ...I did catch wind of something similar to what you describe...
 ......I think that by now, the only ones who would know the details of Madam\'s marriage...
...are Doctor Nanjo and myself..."
"Very true......
 ......That was during Kinzo‐san\'s golden era, when he did whatever he pleased...
 He defeated all of his enemies and expanded his financial power.
 ......Natsuhi‐san\'s family was one of those enemies."
As though the time to talk had suddenly come at hand,
 Kumasawa and Nanjo openly delved into territory that should never have been touched upon again......
It concerned the period during which Kinzo was most feared for his ferocity.
Although he was financially very powerful and had many connections,
 the elite looked down upon him as an upstart, which gave him a complex about his social standing.
To combat this, Kinzo wanted to find Krauss a wife from a noble family...
and use this to raise the Ushiromiya family\'s status...
He waged a financial war against Natsuhi\'s family, beat them down, ......and then proposed that a marriage be performed as a method of reconciliation.
And the person he picked......was Natsuhi.
She was a veritable princess, raised good and true by a family of Shinto priests.
By choosing her, not only did Kinzo cause them the worst possible humiliation,
 he also won what he considered to be the greatest possible trophy.
So that marriage proposal was humiliating to Natsuhi from the very beginning......
"Regarding the events of this period, both Kumasawa‐san and Doctor Nanjo\'s claims just now...
match with the contents of the diaries."
"Therefore, since the time Natsuhi‐san first took the name Ushiromiya Natsuhi,
 she has held a strong animosity towards the Ushiromiya family.
 ......What do you have to say, Natsuhi‐san?
 Do you admit this?"
All of the cold gazes turned to face Natsuhi...
"I‐......it\'s true that I thought that at first......
 I thought I was being forced into a marriage without love, ...a hostage under the guise of a bride......"
"However, ......my husband......never viewed me as a mere hostage......
 ...He understood what I had gone through and gave me compassion and affection......
 My husband......was the only person who could understand me...!"
"......I see.
 That makes sense.
 There are indeed a number of places in your diaries illustrating that Krauss‐san knew of your difficulties...
and showed concern for you."
"However, on page 47 of this diary here,
 you describe these moments as being unpleasant, correct?"
"Let me read aloud.
 ‘When Krauss tries to show consideration, it only makes me feel more wretched.
 Sometimes, I think he might even be trying to humiliate me further.’
 ......From this, we can tell that Natsuhi‐san was repulsed by her husband and the concern he showed."
"W‐......wait...!
 Yes, I may have thought that at the beginning...!
 Back when I lived every day in fear for my future, I couldn\'t accept his concern as true...
and yes, I may have written of my distrust from time to time...!
 But I eventually realized he was sincere and grew to accept his feelings...!"
"Well, nothing like that appears in any of these diaries."
"I, ......I never even wrote it down,
 those feelings were so secret...!"
"Multiple diverse pieces of evidence and testimony...
make it clear that you had an intense hatred for your husband.
 On the other hand, your claim,
 that you eventually accepted his feelings, is unsupported by evidence."
".........I, I loved my husband...!!"
"You can\'t find any testimony or evidence that can be used to elevate that statement to the level of red truth, can you?"
"D‐......does a person need evidence to say they\'re in love...?!"
"Nothing can be trusted except for red truth...!!
 Statements that aren\'t red don\'t count as evidence at all, and they can\'t be trusted at all!
 All text that is not red is a falsehood that exists to deceive me!!"
"‘I love him’?
 Who would believe a profession of love in white text?
 No non‐red words can ever be trusted!!
 The only things that can be trusted in this world are the red truth and the pieces of evidence I offer to my master to obtain it!!"
"You lying {y:0:Humans}{n:0:humans} can\'t speak the truth!!
 {y:0:Humans}{n:0:Humans} lacking the red truth have no right to speak of love or the heart or truth!
 Did you know?
 Men aren\'t as stupid as you women think they are.
 Men never really take it seriously when a woman says "I love you"...!"
"......What a pitiful person......
 I see you\'ve never truly loved someone..."
"Romance is unnecessary for a detective.
 I don\'t think I\'ve ever used the word "romance" except to explain the motive for murder."
"No matter what you say, we loved each other...!!
 I owe my husband an apology for always writing down my complaints and nothing else...!
 But I gave my heart to him...!!
 Even if I can\'t prove it with evidence, ......that is the truth!!"
"Overruled.
 You just don\'t know when to give up, do you?
 From evidence and testimony, it\'s clear by now...
that you hated both your husband and the Ushiromiya family."
"That\'s right!!
 I can\'t even count the number of times I\'ve heard you complain...!!"
"Don\'t we all...? I remember there being days when you talked behind Hideyoshi‐san\'s back...!"
"You {i:killed} my husband!!
 How {i:dare} you say that?!!
 Die! Die so you can apologize to my husband in the afterlife!!"
"Please cease your violence, Eva‐san.
 This is my delectable moment where I question and convict the culprit.
 It\'s not yours, okay?"
"Now then.
 Over the next several years, she appeared to have gotten used to her new way of life,
 but in actuality, an intense hatred still lurked in her heart.
 Taking that into consideration, there would be nothing odd at all about her deciding to take revenge."
"D‐don\'t act like you know what I\'m thinking...!!"
Each time Erika read from Natsuhi\'s diaries,
 ......she exposed another of Natsuhi\'s emotions during those painful days.
......Natsuhi hadn\'t written them down to record them for posterity.
{n}She had written to forget those memories and seal them away.
That was why, after writing down her feelings during those painful days,
 ......she had locked them up and sealed them away for all eternity.
However, Erika claimed that these were Natsuhi\'s true, hidden feelings...
that had been locked away and concealed.
Since it had already been "concluded" that Natsuhi was a murderer, everyone accepted Erika\'s claim.
By this point, the red truth wasn\'t even necessary to establish Natsuhi\'s motive.
{n}As long as the reason seemed plausible, everyone would believe it.
No matter how much Natsuhi might object, no one would believe her.
No one could accept the truth Natsuhi spoke of, about the days she had spent loving her husband.
And so it was being painted over by a false truth, in which she hated her husband and swore revenge against him......
The pen of the gods that composes the truth had been given to Erika.
"And so what?!
 Who gives a damn about your past?!!
 Murderer, murdereeeeeer!!"
"S‐stop that...!
 I can understand how Natsuhi‐san felt...!"
"I always thought this day might come, eventually......
 ...Poor thing, poor thing......"
"I think she\'s another one of the pitiable victims...
of Father\'s wild life."
"I knew of the pain in Madam\'s heart......
 I always tried to support her......
but I failed, and look what has happened......"
"......I don\'t...
...even understand...
...the emotions of love and hate."
".........You will, someday.
 They can give you a reason to live...
and also a reason to kill."
"....................."
"...........................
 ......I‐
......is Aunt Natsuhi...
...really the culprit...?"
"Well, now that you mention it, there is...
one last person besides Natsuhi‐san that might be the culprit."
"Wh‐......what?
 Hey, are you serious...?!
 Why the hell didn\'t you say something that important sooner?!!"
"Natsuhi‐san.
 The truth is, there is one person besides you for whom the crime was possible.
 ......If you insist on claiming that you aren\'t the culprit,
 it means that person must be the culprit."
"............Huh......?"
"Who is it...?!
 Who...?!"
"Ushiromiya...Kinzo‐san."
".........Ah, ............"
"Early this morning, Kinzo‐san...
went outside through the window of the third floor study, and his location is unknown.
 Isn\'t that right, Battler‐san?"
"......Mgh........."
"Just like Natsuhi‐san,
 Kinzo‐san has no alibi whatsoever.
 The truth is, for this crime, it was possible for Kinzo‐san to be the culprit as well."
"I simply assumed that he never existed in the first place,
 so I completely forgot about him until this very moment.
 Allow me to apologize."
She didn\'t look shy or apologetic in the slightest.
Erika bowed in as unpleasant a manner as ever...
......Even now, she\'s still holding a grudge over her defeat in the study...
"Natsuhi‐san, you gained Kinzo‐san\'s trust and are the person who served closest to him, isn\'t that right?
 In that case, I think you understand better than anyone else...
...that this incident is actually the crime of the family head, carried out by Ushiromiya Kinzo‐san."
"Y‐
.........you dare...
...call Father......a criminal......?"
"Don\'t worry.
 Even if Kinzo‐san is actually the culprit,
 I have prepared more than enough evidence and testimony to explain the whydunit.
 Even if you were to say, for example, that you were putting yourself on the line to cover for Kinzo\'s crime, I am more than capable of carrying forward such a plot."
"In recent years,
 even the theories created by the detective can sometimes change the plot itself.
 You really can\'t afford to be careless in this day and age."
"......Branding Father as a killer...
...is something I will not allow!!"
"Natsuhi‐san.
 Calm down, place your hand on your chest, and think carefully.
 ......If you accuse Kinzo‐san of being the culprit, this entire case will be resolved.
 You will no longer be held accountable for another person\'s actions, and your honor will be restored."
In other words, by pushing the crime onto Kinzo, Natsuhi would be saved......
However.........
"I, ......I have been entrusted with the honor of the Ushiromiya family......by Father...
 ...Do you really think......that I would defile Father\'s honor...the Ushiromiya family honor...
just to clear away the false accusations made against me...?!!"
Of course, Natsuhi knew that she wasn\'t the culprit.
{n}And she also knew that Kinzo wasn\'t.
So being framed herself and pushing the blame onto Kinzo...
were both unacceptable, unbearable outcomes.
"Are you sure?
 As I have already established quite thoroughly,
 alibis have been proven for everyone except you.
 If you do not accuse Kinzo‐san,
 ......then it really will be clear that you are the culprit,
 and that {i:will} become the truth......"
"If labelling me as the culprit is what you call truth,
 then you can do as you please...!
 I am certain that God knows I am innocent...!
 And one day, he will prove it!!"
If it came to a choice between her or Kinzo being framed for these crimes...
{n}......Natsuhi would sacrifice herself.
Perhaps...
...that was her way...
...of protecting the Ushiromiya family honor.
"...............Aunt......Natsuhi........."
"And I even gave you a chance..."
...............Stupid woman.
This future where your name will eventually be cleared...
doesn\'t exist, not for you or any of the other pieces in this game.
Natsuhi......had made her decision.
If they were going to call her the culprit,
 ......she would let them.
She boldly rejected the thought...
of selling Kinzo\'s honor to gain a momentary truth where she wasn\'t the culprit......
And, therefore...
...the tale would be woven with her as the culprit.
If, in the future, the accusations against her were to be proven false,
 this tale would probably be rewritten......
However, such a future would never come.
......I think...
truth is a fleeting thing.
Even if I am a good person up until my death...
...if some heartless person after my death writes down that I wasn\'t a good person,
 and that is shared with everyone else...
......then even all the goodness in which I lived my life will be overwritten easily.
And so, I think...
{n}I must live as a good person for all eternity......
"......If you claim that Kinzo‐san was not the culprit,
 he will need an alibi which proves that the crimes were impossible for him.
 Otherwise, we cannot truly be certain that you are the culprit, Natsuhi‐san."
Erika had to be well aware by now...
...that Kinzo was nothing more than an illusion to muddy the waters of the inheritance problem.
However, proving him to be an illusion would be very hard.
The only way to do this would be to confirm Kinzo\'s death,
 ......but Kinzo died a long time ago, as revealed by the red truth of previous games.
And in this fifth game, his body hasn\'t even appeared.
Under these circumstances, it wouldn\'t be easy to prove his death conclusively......
If Kinzo\'s death could be confirmed, ......it would practically erase that defeat in the study.
It was the only way Erika had of negating the humiliation of her loss.
And there was something that could confirm Kinzo\'s death almost as certainly as real proof.
And that was...............“the confession of the culprit”.
She would have Natsuhi herself admit that Kinzo no longer existed in this world.
That way, it would be acknowledged that Erika\'s reasoning in the study was correct,
 ......that loss would be painted over, and it would be rewritten as Erika\'s victory......
Battler hung suspended by Dlanor\'s red longsword.
Beato had disappeared by having her existence denied, ......and her minions had gone too.
Now that they had disappeared from this cathedral,
 ......only Natsuhi and the witches convicting her remained.
"So,
 ......you still claim that Kinzo is alive and remains somewhere on this island......?"
"Yes, I do...!
 Father is in good health...!
 No matter what anyone says, I will not change my statement...!"
"The red truth from the previous games says that
 {p:1:Kinzo is already dead}.
 ......But that\'s not enough to satisfy you, right, Bern?"
"......Yeah, that\'s right.
 I\'m after a perfect victory.
 ......So there\'s nothing interesting about getting a checkmate just because Kinzo\'s death has been confirmed by the red.
 ......I want to win by forcing Natsuhi to say that she\'s resigned.
 *giggle*giggle*giggle*!"
"Then why don\'t you try it?
 Show me what you\'ve got."
"My master, let us now achieve a perfect victory...!!"
"Of course.
 ............Natsuhi.
 You say that Kinzo is certainly alive, but you don\'t know where he is, correct?"
"Yes, that\'s right...!
 Father left through the window and his location is unknown...!
 He is so troublesome sometimes......!"
"Lambda.
 I\'m going to make Kinzo\'s location from midnight until the morning absolutely clear.
 ......
{p:1:From midnight until morning, Kinzo stayed in the same room}."
"......?
 Well, duh, he was a corpse after all.
 ...........................
 ...No, I\'m sorry.
 That\'s right, totally right.
 I won\'t butt in.
 It sounds interesting, so keep going."
".........From now on, I will use the word "Kinzo" to mean "a living Kinzo".
 After all, Natsuhi claims that he\'s alive.
 ......I\'ll say more with the red truth.
 {p:1:Kinzo does not exist anywhere outside the mansion}.
 ......Isn\'t that right? Erika."
"Y‐yes, my master...!!
 I searched for Kinzo all over the premises outside the mansion...!
 However, I was unable to find him...!"
Because of the detective\'s authority, Erika could "find all clues".
Therefore, if Erika was unable to find "a hint that Kinzo existed outside the mansion",
 it was the same as proving that Kinzo didn\'t exist outside the mansion.
Therefore, {f:5:Bernkastel} repeated that truth of Erika\'s...
"{p:1:Kinzo does not exist outside the mansion}.
 ............So, Natsuhi.
 That means that {i:if Kinzo exists}, he must be somewhere inside the mansion.
 Do you have any idea where Kinzo might be hiding......?"
"H‐how could I know...?!
 After all, think of the weather.
 After going out into the courtyard, it would not be surprising at all...
if he hid somewhere in the mansion to escape the rain...!"
"Pfft, ......*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*.
 I\'m going to repeat that same question several times during this process.
 ......I\'ll give you many chances for an honorable surrender.
 ...If you\'re too stubborn, you\'ll lose even your true honor."
".........N‐no matter how you threaten me, I will not give in...!!"
"*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*.
 I just love teasing pieces like you.
 ......Then, let\'s keep going."
"......For these reasons, it is unthinkable that Kinzo‐san might be somewhere outside the mansion.
 ......After learning that, we performed an extensive search of the third floor, where the study is."
"However, there was nowhere he could have been hiding.
 .........We didn\'t catch any trace of Dad on the third floor."
"So then, where is he, Natsuhi‐san?"
"I, I don\'t know...!
 If he isn\'t on the third floor, perhaps he\'s hiding in the basement...?"
"Ah, yes, the basement.
 We searched all of that suspicious basement, including the boiler room and the underground storeroom."
"Yes, I searched too...!
 I didn\'t see Father anywhere...!"
"I\'ll ask again.
 Where is Kinzo‐san, Natsuhi‐san?"
"I‐in that case, he was probably on the first floor or the second floor...!!"
"I see, process of elimination does tell us that, doesn\'t it?
 We then thoroughly searched the first floor.
 And the result?"
".........Nope.
 We were unable to find Father."
"I\'ll ask again.
 Where was Kinzo‐san, Natsuhi‐san?"
"Th‐then he was probably hiding on the second floor...!!
 How should I know where Father is hiding?!"
"Are you sure about that...?
 I think you know very well where Kinzo‐san was hiding..."
"M‐
......Madam knows where the Master was...
...hiding......?!"
".........That\'s...impossible..."
"That......can\'t be true......"
Both Shannon and Kanon knew that Kinzo was no longer alive.
So they didn\'t have a clue how Erika was planning to corner Natsuhi...
using a phantom of a person who didn\'t exist......
"{p:1:Kinzo is nowhere outside the mansion.
 Kinzo isn\'t on the third floor.
 Kinzo isn\'t in the basement.
 Kinzo isn\'t on the first floor.
 Therefore, the only place Kinzo could possibly exist is the second floor}."
"I accept that red truth.
 ......Natsuhi.
 Kinzo should be somewhere on the second floor.
 Will you still not tell us where he\'s hiding...?"
"N‐no matter how many times you ask, it won\'t change the fact that I don\'t know!"
"Erika.
 Investigate the entire second floor, starting from one end and going in order.
 ......Use the detective\'s authority to avoid missing a single clue and to see through all types of hidden doors and hidden rooms...!"
"Yes, my master...!!
 Natsuhi‐san, you\'re quite slow, aren\'t you...?
 Can you still not see where we\'re going with this?"
"*giggle*.
 No need to give it away.
 Come on, Erika.
 Take everyone with you and begin the investigation...!"
Erika used her detective\'s authority to take everyone, even Natsuhi,
 up to the second floor to search every room, starting at one end.
Even for rooms that were thought to have nothing at all to do with the crime, Erika did not relax her search in the slightest.
...Her search was thorough in every single room as they moved through them all......
"So, you still won\'t tell us where Kinzo‐san is hiding?"
"Stop saying that!
 How many times do I have to say that I don\'t know...?!"
"Natsuhi‐san.
 ......It doesn\'t matter where we search, we won\'t ever be able to find Kinzo‐san, will we?"
"......?!"
Of course not.
 Kinzo doesn\'t exist.
No matter how long this search continues, it\'s just a waste of time.
This was known by both Erika, who was the witch\'s piece, and Natsuhi, the one who knew the truth......
"In that case, this search will end at the room on the far end of that corridor.
 ......In other words, it will have been proven...
that Kinzo wasn\'t in any of the rooms except that one. What do you think will happen then?"
He isn\'t on the third floor or the first floor or the basement,
 and he isn\'t in any of the rooms on the second floor except possibly the one at the end.
So if he really did exist inside the mansion,
 .........it had been proven that he could not be in any room except for that room at the end.
In other words, this was Hempel\'s Raven.
Because it had been established that a "living Kinzo" didn\'t exist anywhere except the final room at the end of the corridor,
 that automatically meant that a "living Kinzo" existed in that final room...
......And that room at the end of the corridor was......
"Oh, ............ah.................."
"Which room was at the end of the corridor, again?"
{f:5:Lambdadelta} was munching on another refill of popcorn.
"That\'s Natsuhi\'s room, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}...!!"
"......In other words, Kinzo had no place to hide except inside Natsuhi\'s room.
 ......*giggle*giggle*giggle*!
 Do I need to say it in red?"
"Of course...!"
"{p:1:Kinzo does not exist anywhere outside Natsuhi\'s room}!"
"Well then.
 That means this room is the only place left.
 ......From everything we have learned, we now know that Kinzo‐san isn\'t anywhere outside this room."
"B‐......but this is my room!!
 Where exactly in my room do you claim Father is hiding...?!"
In a rage, Natsuhi unlocked the door to her room and pointed inside.
......Of course, Kinzo was nowhere to be seen.
"Do you see Father anywhere in here?!
 Look!!"
".........Yes, it seems as though he isn\'t here.
 Do you think he realized we were coming and escaped out of the window again?"
If Kinzo wasn\'t in this last room, ......it meant that he didn\'t exist anywhere.
"There is no living Kinzo outside the mansion".
{n}"There is no living Kinzo inside the mansion".
Therefore, “no living Kinzo exists”.
However, Erika didn\'t make that argument.
{n}She had brought things to this point, but she didn\'t make it checkmate...
It was because {f:5:Bernkastel} didn\'t want to win by cornering Natsuhi with the red truth,
 but by forcing Natsuhi to admit to a humiliating resignation......
"I have not only been searching for Kinzo‐san himself all this time.
 I have been looking for any sign at all that Kinzo‐san hid in these places between midnight and the morning.
 And no such signs have existed."
"......In other words, we know that from midnight until morning,
 Kinzo was always holed up in the same room,
 and that was Natsuhi\'s room!"
"It means the checkmate of red truth has finally...
trapped the piece known as "the illusion of Kinzo" inside Natsuhi\'s room."
"So, Natsuhi‐san.
 This means you were with Kinzo in this room until morning.
 Do you still claim that you didn\'t know where he was?"
"I\'ll acknowledge it with the red truth...!!
 {p:1:For the entire duration of the night between midnight and morning,
 a living Kinzo could not have existed anywhere outside Natsuhi\'s room}!!
 Based on this truth, I permit you to continue the debate under the assumption that he could only have existed in Natsuhi\'s room!"
"Plea bargain.
 ............Come on, Natsuhi.
 ......Even someone as stupid as you must have realized the fix you\'re in now.
 This is your last chance.
 .........Make Kinzo the culprit."
"Call the Ushiromiya family head a criminal and crush the head\'s honor to save your own skin.
 If you show that you have the guts to do that,
 I\'ll change the plot into one of a tragic heroine taking the blame to protect the family head."
"Father is innocent!
 I cannot call Father a criminal!!"
"......Deal refused!
 Ehehehehehehehe, okay, Bern.
 Do it...!"
"{p:1:For the entire duration of the night between midnight and morning,
 a living Kinzo could not have existed in any place except inside your bed}."
".........Wha—
......and...
...wh‐
...what do you mean...by that............?"
"After conducting a thorough search of this room,
 and detailed forensic testing,
 I discovered that Kinzo did not exist anywhere in this room between midnight and morning.
 However, your bed alone is excluded from this."
A shocked silence dominated the room......
{n}Natsuhi completely forgot to close her open mouth...
"Last night,
 at around the time the gold was discovered—I estimate 23:00—
Kinzo‐san escaped from the window on the third floor and snuck into the bed in your room.
 ......And, as an even more unfortunate result from my investigation,
 it has been proven that you were also sleeping in that bed."
"I\'ll repeat that.
 {p:1:For the entire duration of the night between midnight and morning,
 a living Kinzo could not have existed in any place except inside Natsuhi\'s bed.
 And last night, Natsuhi also slept in that same bed}."
"Wow, look how close they were.
 So, you two were so close to each other, you slept sharing the same pillow?"
"Blue truth:
 {p:2:Therefore, we can conjecture that Ushiromiya Natsuhi and Ushiromiya Kinzo had sexual relations with each other.
 Why else would a man and a woman share the same bed all night long}?"
"H‐how dare you!!!
 T‐t‐to suggest that I would...
...d‐do such a thing......with the father I respected so much...
...I won\'t allow you to say such things!!"
"Natsuhi.
 Use the red truth to counter this blue truth.
 Of course, you aren\'t a witch, so there\'s no red that you can use.
 So I\'ll speak with the red truth in your place.
 If you can show me convincing proof...!!"
"H‐
......how could there possibly...
b‐be proof of that?!!
 How low are you willing to sink to mock me?!
 Y‐you vile creatuu{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}ure!!"
Natsuhi tried to attack Erika,
 ...but Eva pinned her arms behind her back, so she couldn\'t do anything.
"How unsightly.
 ......In order to take revenge against the Ushiromiya family,
 you first schemed to take control of everything the family owned.
 For that reason, you used your body as a weapon and ensnared Kinzo‐san."
"I would never do anything of the sort!!
 I have never given my body to anyone except my husband!!"
"I understand why you\'d want to deny it,
 ............but testimony from several witnesses makes it clear that you have had repeated secret meetings with Kinzo‐san."
"I mean, even last night, you and Kinzo‐san...
were all alone in his study when you went to "say goodnight to him", weren\'t you?
 Not only that, I have obtained multiple pieces of testimony claiming that there were clear traces of sexual relations."
"Are you insane?!?!
 Who was it?!
 Who said something so ridiculous?!
 G‐Gohda?!
 Shannon?!
 Was it Eva‐san?!
 Yes, you must be behind something this ludicrous!!"
"Who was it?! Whooooo?!
 Aaaaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}hhhhh!!!"
"I acknowledge receipt of the relevant parties\' testimony.
 Wow, this is pretty fatal.
 *giggle*giggle*giggle*...! No room for doubt now!"
"Hey, Natsuhi.
 Looks like you don\'t even have a scrap of honor left now.
 ......I\'ll give you one final chance before I weave you the worst of all possible fragments.
 ......Say to me that there was no Kinzo."
"Yeah. Natsuhi, you sure are stubborn.
 ......The Ushiromiya family has already been torn to ribbons, right?
 ...Are you really that desperate to confuse the inheritance problem by pretending Kinzo exists?"
"This is my final trial, entrusted to me by Father......in protecting the honor of the Ushiromiya family...!!
 My husband\'s business will definitely......definitely bear fruit!!
 Until we can use that to repay our debts, I cannot hand over the inheritance of the Ushiromiya family!!"
"I will protect Father\'s honor and my husband\'s!!
 That is......my mission!!!"
"......Wanting to protect the honor of the dead is an admirable trait."
"He\'s not one of the dead.
 We\'re talking about the honor of a convenient delusion inside Natsuhi\'s head.
 ......
{p:1:The real Kinzo never once ordered Natsuhi...
to do anything like protect his honor}."
"Waaaaaaaaaaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}ahhhhhhh!!"
As Natsuhi screamed, she fell down to her hands and knees......
She no longer...
...had any way to reject the fake truth...
...that {f:5:Bernkastel} and Erika had weaved......
".........By my name as the Game Master, {f:5:Lambdadelta}!
 ......I acknowledge that Lady {f:5:Bernkastel} is the victor of this game.
 ......If anyone has any objections, state your name now!!"
.................................
Of course, there were none.
 All of those who might have objected had been erased......
"No objections!
 You win, Bern, and what a win it was!
 Now weave the fragment of truth!!"
"Sure.
 Then I will now weave the truth.
 ......This is the truth of this sad and foolish tale.
 ......Although, what I really wanted was for Natsuhi to admit to her crimes while smiling through tears and then tell her own story.
 After all, that\'s standard in the genre, right?

"Then just say that I did it, okay?!
 That\'s what you want me to say, right?!
 Waa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhhhhh...!!!"
As though she had given up and decided that it would be useless to try and talk her way out of this any longer,
 Aunt Natsuhi said that and screamed.
......It was a sad incident.
I wanted to believe that, despite the pitiable circumstances which led to her marriage into the Ushiromiya family,
 ......Aunt Natsuhi had been able to find some small measure of happiness with Uncle Krauss and Jessica.
......But instead, by Aunt Natsuhi\'s own hand, Uncle Krauss,
 ......and even her beloved daughter Jessica,
 ......had been heartlessly killed...
It was even harder to believe that Grandfather had been an accomplice and hid the bodies...
However, several people had given clear testimony that Grandfather\'s mental state for these last few years...
had been far from what anyone would consider normal.
Perhaps, possessed by a mad devotion to the mistress he had lost long ago,
 ......Grandfather might truly have believed that Aunt Natsuhi was a reincarnation of {f:5:Beatrice}.
Where is Grandfather now?
Like Erika theorized,
 did he really believe that he could revive {f:5:Beatrice} by carrying out murders following the epitaph,
 and succumb to Natsuhi\'s cajolery?
......Right now, is he holding some kind of disturbing ritual with the bodies he carried away......?
"Are you............
......satisfied now.........?
 ......This...
...is what you wanted to make me say, right......?"
Aunt Natsuhi sobbed as she spoke.
"......This is...
......your revenge, isn\'t it......?
 You, the man from 19 years ago...!!"
This "man from 19 years ago" that Aunt Natsuhi kept mentioning was the man who had supposedly framed her.
However, referring to "a man from 19 years ago" was as far as she would go,
 and she made no attempt at all to explain what had actually happened back then...
"I\'m certain......that a pawn of that man is among us now.
 ......I\'m sure that right now, that man is ridiculing me through one of you..."
".........So tell me...!
 Are you happy now?
 Has a little of that pain and suffering you\'ve endured for 19 years gone away...?!
 .........I finally understand.
 ...The reason you brought me down to this point......is because......you wanted to make me admit it, isn\'t it......?"
"......Natsuhi‐san.
 Other than us, there\'s absolutely no one here.
 Please stop this insanely desperate charade and quit pretending that someone who doesn\'t exist actually does."
Erika laughed mockingly, but, as Aunt Natsuhi looked at us...
......no, as she looked at some being behind us, ......she hung her head and shook.
Then, .........she confessed to her sin.
"I.........committed murder......"
"So you finally admit your crime directly."
"No,
 this is not about what has happened today and yesterday.
 .........I confess to a murder that occurred 19 years ago."
The adults all whispered together, wondering what this was about.
{n}......Because they had never heard about a murder case 19 years ago.
"......19 years ago,
 ......I.........committed a sin.
 .........I couldn\'t tolerate it.
 ......That.........baby...!!"
"Baby?
 Now what are you talking about?"
"......On that day 19 years ago,
 ...Father entrusted me with a baby.
 .........Since I was having so much trouble conceiving a successor, Father told me to adopt a child,
 ......and he brought me a baby which he said was from a welfare institute......and he put it in my arms..."
"Do you have any idea......how humiliating that was to me as a woman...?!"
With a mix of conflicting emotions, of anger, sadness, regret and possibly defiance,
 Aunt Natsuhi confessed.
The humiliation as a woman that others had given up hope on her ever bearing a child.
{n}And also, the indescribably unpleasant feeling of being made to nurse a strange baby.
It caused her great sadness and rage,
 and before very many nights passed, it ate a hole into her heart......
And then, ......I sold my soul.........to demons...
.........It happened when I went on a walk through the rose garden to the harbor, along with a servant holding the baby...
......I wanted to be alone,
 ......but that servant woman holding the baby faithfully followed me everywhere.
I was unable even to tell her to stop following me, ......and therefore unable to escape from the child\'s crying......
.........That day...
marked the beginning of 19 long, headache‐filled years......
.........Then, we were by the fence overlooking the cliff.
If by taking that baby...
...and throwing it down onto the rocky beach far below me,
 ......I could make all this go away...
......I really did hear that demonic temptation in my ear.
And.........for the smallest of moments, I thought of how wonderful it would be if I really could do that,
 ......and lent an ear to that temptation.
 ......And that was when—
The servant holding the baby stepped on a large rock, twisted her ankle, and staggered......
She leaned against the rough fence, ......and at that moment, I thought I heard the fence creak loudly.
I told her to look out and went to grab her shoulder.
......No,
 ......I shouldn\'t be so vague...
 I\'ll repent.
 I\'ll confess.
 .........At that moment, I\'m sure that......as I told her to look out,
 ............with both hands,
 I reached for that servant\'s shoulders,
 and with a thud,
 ......I pushed her away hard......
The rough fence snapped from the base,
 .........and the servant,
 ......along with the baby held in her arms,
 .........fell down towards the rocky beach below......
Even though...
...I remember that moment vividly,
 ...for some reason I recall a vague...
...and very strange feeling.
It almost felt as though instead of falling,
 ......the two of them were silently swallowed up into empty space.
So I never even heard the sound of them crashing to the rocky beach.
No, I must have heard it.
But because I wanted to think that they\'d simply disappeared,
 ......I must have erased that sound from my memory...
".........A‐.........and then.........?"
"For an instant, ...I thought it was a dream.
 ......It was high enough that I couldn\'t see the two of them below me just by leaning over.
 So I couldn\'t tell whether their fall, ......the events of just a few seconds earlier, had actually happened or not..."
I must have been wishing so strongly that the child would fall from there...
that I hallucinated the whole thing...
Trying to make myself believe this, I hurried back to the rose garden.
 ......I decided to say that I\'d left the baby with the servant and had been taking a rest alone in the garden...
......Then,
 .........Father asked what had happened to the baby,
 ............
.........which caused a stir over the disappearance of the servant...
......who I\'d left the baby with.........
Eventually, the broken fence was discovered,
 .........and the two corpses were found at the bottom of the cliff...
......The baby\'s origins apparently couldn\'t be made known, so its existence was hushed up,
 ......and the official story was that the servant simply died in an accident alone.
That\'s right.
I......stole away two innocent lives in one go.........
As for the poor servant......her family was generously compensated.
This was enough to satisfy her aged husband, who grieved over the unfortunate accident—he never knew the truth.
Then, just a few years ago, he died of old age, .........and I confessed the truth over his grave, apologizing.
".........But to this day...
......I have never apologized to that baby.
 ......Yes,
 .........that\'s what you\'re after, isn\'t it......?"
"So right here, right now, I\'ll confess to my crime!
 ......I, Ushiromiya Natsuhi,
 .........did 19 years ago...
......push you off a cliff...
...and try to kill you......"
......But...
......you didn\'t die after all......
.........You\'re still alive,
 ......and you still call me "Mother"...
.........You came to this island,
 .........and took your revenge on me, didn\'t you......?
When you learned...
......that you were pushed off a cliff by the woman you should have been calling a mother for the past 19 years,
 ......you must have lived a life so full of hatred...
"......And now, ......you\'ve taken everything I\'ve gained since pushing you off that cliff,
 18 years of my life, ......and smashed it all to pieces...
 ......I no longer have my beloved husband or daughter.
 ......And I\'ve lost even my honor,
 ......and am being called a murderer...
 .........No, ......I really am a murderer, aren\'t I......"
"Yes, that\'s right.
 ......It all went according to your plans.
 ......I\'m now regarded as a killer..."
"...............How is this for you...?
 Is this enough...
...for your revenge......?"
"My husband and daughter have been killed!!
 ......I\'ve been made to look like a murderer......like an adulteress even......
 After seeing me put through such terrible humiliation,
 ............are you satisfied......?!"
"Yes, I\'ll bet you\'re quite satisfied...
 ......Because my family...
...my honor...
......everything.........has been taken from me......
 ......Uuughuu...
...*hic*......
uuu{0}u{0}ughh{0}u{0}u{0}h{0}h{0}uuu!!"
".........After all this, you still claim that you were framed?
 Seriously, you just don\'t know when to give up."
"Can you hear me?! You, the cursed baby from 19 years ago...!!
 Are you satisfied now?!
 You\'ve taken everything from me!!
 What more do you want?!
 ......Please,
 ......just...
......forgive me............"
{a:c:
"......No good."}
"Huh.........?"
".........Battler‐san,
 did you say something?"
{a:c:
"No good at all."}
".........B‐
.........Battler......ku......n......?"
".........Yeah.
 ...It\'s no good...
 It\'s no goddamn good at all......"
"Ah......
.........aaahhhh...............!!""......Erika, Dlanor."
"Yes, my master."
"You {f:5:called}?"
"......I want you two to stay in this fragment...
...and explain everything in the remaining first through fourth games.
 That pitiful transient witch no longer exists to assert her witch illusions.
 Expose the naked truth with extreme prejudice."
"*giggle*! Leave it to me, my master.
 There is no mystery that Furudo Erika cannot solve."
"......Of course.
 That\'s why you\'re my piece, my double.
 *giggle*giggle*giggle*!"
{f:5:Bernkastel} wore a massive...and horrible smile, which Erika shared.
......{f:5:Beatrice}\'s witch illusions would disappear,
 and the results of all of the previous games would be painted over.
It had been crushed in every way possible, ......and only the naked truth remained.
To Erika, such a weak truth might as well have been fish on a chopping board...
"All four prior games...
can be explained as either Natsuhi\'s crimes or freak exceptions.
 I won\'t let anyone talk about them as the crimes of some witch called {f:5:Beatrice} again.
 I\'ll start compiling it together at once and present you a first‐rate tale."
"*giggle*......
 You mustn\'t leave even a single fragment of Beato\'s Legend of the Witch behind.
 The rumors among the servants, the way people talked about unexplained events as though a witch was the cause,
 the witch illusions used alongside the illusion of Kinzo.
 ......Deal with all of them completely."
"Of course.
 I\'ll get to it right away.
 ......We currently have the furniture in custody.
 We\'re hurrying to identify their vessels."
The Seven Sisters of Purgatory had already been taken into custody.
Those noisy sisters who had served Beato now faced nothing but denial.
What sort of fantasy were they based upon which allowed them to "manifest"?
......Everything would be exposed...
...and denied.
"Eiserne Jungfrau has already begun its {f:5:investigation}.
 Our most recent findings indicate that there is a high probability they were produced during the 1960\'s in New York or somewhere {f:5:nearby}.
 An aide has already been sent to the {f:5:location}."
"The 1960\'s? The Seven Sisters of Purgatory are <Made in USA>?
 Pfft, *giggle*giggle*giggle*......
 Even though they bragged about being furniture connected with King Solomon and serving a thousand year old witch, they\'re a total sham.
 So what are they...?"
"According to the report, there\'s this group of big‐time swindlers...
...who make money by selling high‐priced imitation goods to rich fans of the occult."
"The deceived millionaires resell the articles with invented histories,
 and this may have caused the items to become falsely deified among {f:5:collectors}.
 We are rushing to find confirmation and further {f:5:details}."
"Ushiromiya Kinzo was apparently a big customer of theirs who\'d pay exorbitant sums for the most blatantly fake objects."
"......*giggle*giggle*, ...ahahahahahahahaha...!!
 And that\'s what the Seven Sisters of Purgatory really are...?
 That\'s ridiculous,
 aha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hah{0}hha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hha{0}ha{0}hahha!!
 A total sham, just what I\'d expect from one of Beato\'s witch illusions."
"So despite calling themselves the seven deadly sins, they\'re actually cheap, fake souvenirs.
 ......Of course,
 from the first time I saw them, I figured they were nothing more than paperweights sold at some shady souvenir shop."
"*giggle*giggle*!! Paperweights...!
 Ahhah{0}hah{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!
 Have you confronted the Seven Sisters with that truth yet?"
"No, not {f:5:yet}."
"They still seriously believe...
that they were created by a great magician over a thousand years ago.
 ......I can\'t wait to thrust the truth and perfect evidence in their faces...
and let them know that they\'re mere paperweights worth less than 30 US dollars."
"I wonder what kind of expressions will register on their faces as they lose all hope?
 ......*giggle*, I can\'t wait.
 Call me when you do it.
 I\'ll come to watch, with some of the best black tea and dried plums."
Beato\'s witch illusions had already been seen through,
 and it had been proven that every one of them was simply the result of a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} fantasy.
What kind of fantasies created them and what was their basis?
{n}The illusions would be confronted with this perfectly proven truth...
......And at that time, they would disperse like smoke and be completely annihilated.
This was called......“execution”.
"......An execution is not a {f:5:show}.
 As a general rule, it is not open to the {f:5:public}."
"This is an inspection by the great Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}, member of the Senate,
 so she can observe that the Great Court is performing its duties satisfactorily.
 Do you, a mere Inquisitor, intend to obstruct this...?"
"Yes, that\'s right.
 I\'m just observing as a representative of the Senate to make sure you observe the proper procedures when you carry out your work.
 ......*giggle*giggle*giggle*."
"We are currently preparing to take {f:5:Virgilia}, Ronove, and Gaap into custody as well.
 The Chiester Sisters Imperial Guards are conducting that investigation."
".........Of course, after that is done, we will then detain and execute the three Chiester Sisters, who are also connected to {f:5:Beatrice}."
"Dlanor, what is the true nature of the Chiester Sisters?"
"......We believe there is a high likelihood that their vessels are weapons used in the {f:5:crimes}.
 My senior aide, Gertrude, has formed a dedicated {f:5:team}.
 We are currently investigating their individual {f:5:cases}."
"I\'m looking forward to the Chiester Sisters\' execution too...!
 One at a time?
 Or all of them at once?"
"No one\'s stupid enough to empty the entire can of tea leaves into the pot at once.
 You\'ve got to enjoy it slowly, one spoonful at a time."
"*giggle*giggle*! Exactly.
 Let\'s hold their executions on consecutive days.
 One for each witch and piece of furniture.
 I\'ll present you with a new execution show every day."
"Wonderful.
 .........After all, there really are a lot of them.
 Looks like we\'ll be able to enjoy ourselves for a full two weeks."
"......Maybe we could let them decide among themselves which of them to execute first.
 Heh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eheh!
 Make sure you think up something great for the execution concepts.
 ......I\'d like to enjoy executions both old and new from East and West every day."
"......The rules state that the method of execution is to follow Great Court {f:5:regulations}."
"Leave it to me, my master.
 I will most certainly prepare you a fascinating execution show!"
"I expect quartering at the very least."
"Of course.
 I shall make a list of the highest forms of execution from countries across the world from Europe to Asia,
 which were used by kingdoms East and West for nothing less than treason against the king!"
"......I\'d like to propose an execution method myself.
 ...Pondering that will be the perfect way to relax on those sleepless nights.
 ......*giggle*. I\'ll come up with an idea and send you a letter soon."
"Certainly, my master.
 Then we\'ll use the {f:5:Bernkastel}‐style execution for the grand finale.
 ......At the very, very end, when all of the illusions have been broken and Beato\'s system of magic has been completely crushed,
 ...I shall present you with the finest execution you desire...at the execution of {f:5:Beatrice}...!"
"Thank you, Erika.
 ......Thanks to you, it seems I\'ll be able to forget the pain of my illness for a little while......
 *giggle*giggle*, hehe{0}he{0}he{0}heh{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!
 You\'re just perfect.
 My piece, my double,
 ......and my precious daughter."
"Y‐......your words are too good for me...! My master...!!"
"Erika, I will give you honor and a reward.
 ......Beato\'s greatest symbol, the portrait in the reception hall.
 Take it down, smash it to make firewood, bake a cake over that fire and eat it.
 Then you have my permission to put your own portrait up in the empty frame."
"...Th‐......thank you very much...!
 It is the greatest of honors...!"
".........You will eradicate and erase {f:5:Beatrice}\'s name and all traces of her.
 Until that is all finished, I order you to become the master of this sealed‐off Rokkenjima."
"......By the name of the Witch of Miracles, {f:5:Bernkastel},
 I hereby grant you the rank of witch until that day arrives.
 ......From now on, you will call yourself {f:5:Erika}, Witch of Truth."
"W‐
......Witch...of Truth......!
 ......Th‐
......thank you very much, my master...!!
 I vow to work even harder so that this honor is not wasted...!"
Even though she was nothing more than a piece,
 .........she was being granted the honor of calling herself a witch like her master, if only for a brief stretch of time......
Erika was so moved at having her hard work acknowledged in this greatest form that she trembled......
"Dlanor, continue to aid {f:5:Erika}...
and report on her progress to me."
"......As you {f:5:wish}."
"............By the way, where\'s Lambda?"
"She is over {f:5:there}."
From the guest seating on the second floor, she pointed downwards.
{f:5:Lambdadelta}.........could be seen beneath Battler, who hung there dead, run through by the red longsword.
".........Ushiromiya Battler...
 You were an interesting guy.
 ...You could have been so much more interesting...... Such a shame."
"I think it was a wonderful way to die.
 .........{f:5:Erika}!
 You can hang Battler\'s corpse in the mansion\'s reception hall.
 ......The next time I come to visit this fragment, welcome me in front of it."
"Certainly, my master.
 I\'ll make that foolish man an eternal monument to your victory!"
"*giggle*, that sounds wonderful. Super stylish.
 Maybe you can coat him with plaster and make a beautiful white statue.
 ......And it\'d be even better if you decorated him all cute!"
"Yes, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}.
 I will strive to answer your expectations...!"
"Grats on your witch promotion.
 Even though it\'s only temporary, I welcome you as a friend."
Erika was so overcome with emotion that tears came to her eyes.
.........Because no greater pleasure exists for a piece than having its efforts acknowledged by its master.
"In the end, I\'d like to have Beato stuffed too.
 Then I\'ll have her displayed on high in the reception hall."
"Lake Shirakaba?"
"The {c:86EF9C:{y:0:Human}{n:0:human}‐hunting Count}."
"......You know,
 I read that back when I wasn\'t a witch.
 ...I wondered, how can humans who obtain eternal life become so cruel?
 I always found that strange.
 ......At the time, I honestly couldn\'t relate."
".........After becoming a witch and living a thousand years, I fully understand it.
 ......That writer could understand our cruelty really well, in the truest sense.
 *giggle*giggle*!"
"......Where to next?
 I guess we\'ll go off in opposite directions like always?"
"Only because I don\'t want to bore you."
"Thanks, Bern.
 But you can be sure that I\'ll count to a hundred and then start searching for you again."
"You never let me get bored, do you?
 That\'s why I like you, love you.
 ............Let\'s meet again somewhere.
 Of course, that might be a hundred or a thousand years from now...or never again for all eternity."
"It\'ll work out.
 The sea of fragments is tiny to a pair who love each other."
"The Third Man?"
"No, Children of Paradise, of course."
".........If each time you smashed one of those countless fragments that glitter like a starry night,
 you could escape the poison of just a single evening\'s worth of boredom,
 even you would want to count the stars in the sky."
"Ooh, not bad...pfft, *giggle*giggle*...!"
The witches known as Voyagers travel across the countless glittering futures of possibility,
 ......and gobble them up, trying to escape their illness called boredom for as long as they can.
The tiny, tiny fragment created by the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} known as {f:5:Beatrice}...
...had now been gobbled up by the two witches...
...and had lost its glitter.
The two who had earlier called themselves rivals in front of Beato...
now stopped that charade and laughed together playfully.
"{f:5:Erika}.
 The new ruler of this fragment.
 .........Weave the truth, ......and create the tale that leads up to this world\'s demise.
 ...Umm, the next was the sixth game, right?"
"Yes, it\'s the sixth game."
"Decide the title for Episode 6 yourself.
 After all, you\'re already the spinner of this tale, as well as its Master."
"Thank you very much.
 ......Actually, I\'ve already decided on one."
"......Oh, already?
 ......Then let me hear it.
 What\'s the title?"
"It is...
Episode 6.........
heheheheh, actually, I\'d like to tease you a bit, but I\'ll tell you."
"*giggle*!
 Come on, stop being a smartass and tell us.
 A newbie witch like you shouldn\'t be teasing your seniors!"
"Episode 6: Checkmate of the Golden Witch!"In the cathedral devoid of people,
 .........a figure could be seen still staring up at the heavens,
 its chest pierced with a long red sword which pinned it in place to the ground.
 ......It was the figure of Battler.
......Ironically,
 it looked just like what he had done to Beato with blue wedges in the fourth game......
Battler had died quite some time ago.
No, .........in this place, the concept of death means nothing except that one has stopped thinking.
Therefore, in a sense, Battler was not dead.
......After being defeated in a fight over the truth, he no longer had the strength to think of a way to resist.
And so...he was dead.
Dlanor\'s massive longsword, which had been left in place of a tombstone,
 ......fastened Battler to the spot even after his death...
This was being lit by a faint light seeping out of a high, high skylight.
Quiet footsteps rang out across this still cathedral......
From the darkness behind a pillar, ......a woman slowly stepped forwards.
......It was {f:5:Beatrice}.
Her eyes had no light in them, ......and looked the same way they had for so long in the Golden Land,
 still muddied over with gray.
Previously, she couldn\'t even drink black tea properly without assistance,
 ......but now, though it was slow, ...and though there was no life in her eyes,
 ......she was, surprisingly, walking.
And with slow, deliberate steps,
 she reached Battler,
 ......who was still dead and pierced......
Then,
 ......slowly...
...she touched him.
{n}......She tugged...
on his sleeve.
However, Battler showed no reaction......
......When she realized that it wasn\'t sleep...
...but death,
 .........the witch with the forlorn gaze...
...drooped her head even lower...
Then...
...she quietly...
......whispered...
"...............
 ............You
......liar........."
Beato...
...softly touched Battler.........
{n}Then,
 ......she pressed her forehead against Battler\'s chest.
There was no longer......
......any heartbeat.
It wasn\'t just because he had surrendered.
{n}It was because the witches had banished him from the game board.
......So now...
{n}......Battler would never......return...
So now...
.........the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}...
...had no more reason...
......to exist............
{a:c:
.........Thank you...{n}
......Liar......{n}
...Goodbye......{n}
And.........{n}
...I\'m sorry.}
Then,
 ......the Golden Witch,
 ...her task...
...completed,
 ...scattered...
as a spray of gold.
In the Golden Land,
 ......the gray rain...
gently continued to fall.
......There was a faint aroma of good black tea.
Beato stared blankly at the surface of the tea.
There was {f:5:Virgilia}, continuing her knitting,
 .........along with me and......Dlanor, talking to each other.
......This is...
......a flashback......
A flashback to a memory of Battler\'s, which Dlanor\'s sword must have given him as it pierced him......
A flashback of that time Dlanor had come to visit the tea party in the Golden Land.........
"The same goes for {f:5:me}.
 I will not be caught unawares in our next {f:5:bout}."
"Perfect.
 I\'ll take you on anytime.
 Give me everything you\'ve got."
"You have my {f:5:word}.
 Everything I {f:5:have}."
......Dlanor.
I\'d thought she was a ruthless killer doll without a heart,
 ...but maybe she actually is pretty approachable.
......Though of course, neither of us will show any mercy when fighting on the game board.
For a while, we gazed at the rain‐drenched rose garden...
as we quietly enjoyed our tea.
"......Still, it really is terrifying.
 The way you fight.
 ......Knox\'s Ten Commandments, or the Decalogue, wasn\'t it?
 Those fallbacks of the mystery genre, right?"
"{f:5:Yes}.
 ......They are commandments conceived by my {f:5:father}."
"Hidden doors must not exist.
 That\'s Knox\'s third commandment, right?
 That means there\'s no need for detectives to even look for hidden doors.
 ......Sounds pretty ridiculous."
{f:5:Bernkastel} talked about this.
She said that even searching for hidden doors was a waste of time because they\'re forbidden by Knox\'s third commandment.
It makes me want to argue back and say it isn\'t so uncommon for a rich family\'s mansion to have a hidden door or two built into it.
......But apparently, you can get away with that kind of rule in the mystery genre.
As an aside, there exist many wonderful mysteries in which hidden doors appear,
 and where hidden doors are the theme.
......Though of course this is limited to novels which have the "premise" that hidden doors exist.
Without that "premise", hidden doors mustn\'t exist.
{n}So if that "premise" isn\'t there, there\'s no need to search for hidden doors.
......I think that\'s probably the essence of her ridiculous argument.
I get the feeling that the detective trying to expose the truth and the illusion trying to mask it with fiction...
are getting blended together, leading to a bizarre form of argument similar to a Devil\'s Proof.
Making a locked‐room murder seem to be accomplished by a witch with magic—that\'s fantasy.
Exposing that it was a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}\'s crime done with tricks—that\'s anti‐fantasy.
Investigating all possibilities to expose what those tricks are—that\'s mystery.
But claiming that possibilities with no hints supporting them are unworthy of investigation—that\'s......also mystery?
Hidden doors, by definition, are hidden in a way that there can\'t be any clues.
Would claiming that hidden doors therefore necessarily exist even if the detective can\'t find them...
...be anti‐mystery?
.........That\'s enough of that.
{n}This argument is too far of a digression from the riddles I\'m actually supposed to be solving.
My fight is very simple.
I\'m only fighting to explain that it was possible for a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} to carry out these crimes which were supposedly carried out by a witch.
This whole discussion about "mystery" and "anti" doesn\'t serve any purpose.
So I can\'t bring myself to have any particular interest in the rules known as the Knox Decalogue...
"............Do you dislike Knox?"
"It doesn\'t work for me.
 ......There\'s something just wrong about making it possible to deny the existence of all hidden doors without investigating.
 ...It\'s about as dubious as a Devil\'s Proof.
 ......Even though it\'s supposed to be the exact opposite of fantasy, it somehow feels like it\'s the same kind of argument."
"..........................."
"......Ah, I shouldn\'t have said that.
 Your dad was the one who made them, after all."
"Pay that no {f:5:mind}.
 ......After all, there are some who say they are nothing more than mindless {f:5:fun}."
"The Decalogue feels like something very arrogant to you, right, Battler‐kun...?"
"......To be honest, yeah.
 ......If there was ever a detective who said he didn\'t need to look for hidden doors because they must not exist,
 everyone should start looking around on the floor to see if some of his screws had come loose..."
"In that case, Battler,
 ......let us say we did away with the third {f:5:commandment}.
 In that case, what would happen to locked‐room {f:5:mysteries}...?"
......What if Knox\'s third commandment, "hidden doors are forbidden", didn\'t exist...?
".........You mean if hidden doors became OK to use as the solution to locked‐room mysteries?"
"I do not mean hidden doors with hints or {f:5:foreshadowing}.
 ...I mean hidden doors that even the detective cannot find because, of course, they are {f:5:hidden}."
"Battler‐kun, you often fight by using a Devil\'s Proof to propose an undiscoverable element X.
 ......That\'s what this is about."
"That\'d be horrible.
 Locked‐room mysteries would just unravel as stories."
That was another way of saying......that those kinds of stories would simply no longer work.
No one would want to try solving the mystery in the first place if they knew the answer might just be an unforeseeable hidden door.
"......If you aren\'t first given some guarantee that no hidden doors exist,
 you don\'t feel like trying to deduce anything.
 ............I see.
 Knox\'s third commandment is needed.
 ......Without it, locked‐room mysteries wouldn\'t even be worth anyone\'s time."
"If you don\'t feel like trying to deduce anything...what does that mean...?"
"It means you don\'t even feel like reading to begin with."
"That is {f:5:correct}.
 ......{y:0:Humans}{n:0:Humans} are weak creatures who cannot even think unless they have assurance that reasoning is {f:5:possible}."
"...That reasoning is possible.
 ......In other words, they need encouragement that they can solve it if they do their best."
That......might actually be true.
......It\'s the same with exercising.
If you\'re told to run ten laps around the campus, you can tough it out.
But if you\'re made to run without even knowing how many laps it\'s going to be,
 you\'ll probably get tired out before you make it around three times.
The same thing goes for thinking and reasoning.
Depending on whether or not a problem is guaranteed to be solvable,
 the way we humans react to it changes completely......
"In detective novels, there\'s always a scene where the detective announces that he\'s discovered who the culprit is.
 ......That\'s a sign saying "The hints have all been given in the previous parts of the story,
 so dear readers, please try to reason it out"."
".........Huh.
 I always thought it was just a classic line... Never knew it had that meaning."
"To put it harshly,
 as long as the detective doesn\'t say that,
 ......even the most avid mystery lover who prides himself on his deductions won\'t feel like trying to solve it."
"......In the previous games, you were like that yourself, were you {f:5:not}......?"
"...................................."
Come to mention it,
 ......maybe that really was the case.
My fight against Beato began in earnest starting with the second game, I think.
When Beato threw locked‐room mysteries at me, at first,
 I didn\'t seriously try to tackle them.
After all, I knew nothing except that people had died in a locked room, and the windows and doors were all locked from the inside.
......I had basically no hints.
So I refused to debate, on the grounds that I couldn\'t fight because the lack of clues made reasoning impossible.
......After that, Beato sneered at me, didn\'t she...
asking whether I would repeat that over and over forever in an endless repetition of moves......
At that time, Beato said this:
— The reason you incompetent fools always stop thinking and then moan about it is "lack of information"!
 If you are then given information, you start doubting whether the information is true or not by "denying the basis"!
 Aren\'t those convenient?
 What clever little words to hide your own incompetence.
Then, she said she\'d give me reliable information that couldn\'t be denied,
 and created the rule called the red truth.
Only after Beato had done all that for me did the curtain finally rise on my battle with her......
"......So, ......once I finally had the guarantee that I could solve this tale if I tried,
 ......that\'s when I stepped into the ring with her for the first time......?"
"{f:5:Beatrice}.
 ......She is a strange {f:5:person}.
 Mysteries are the only spaces where witches can live, and yet she herself began to give you the red truth, a method by which those mysteries could be {f:5:solved}."
You could say that the red truth is a hint Beato gives me so that I\'ll agree to compete in this war of reasoning.
......It\'s a carrot.
Being given a hint is like she\'s saying,
 “Go on.
 Try solving it.
 It is possible.”
......An enigma which is guaranteed to be solvable...
...can\'t be called a true "enigma".
"Isn\'t this almost as though...
......Beato herself...
is admitting that she...
...isn\'t really a witch...?"
"Well now.
 That does seem logical.
 ......She truly is a strange child."
"................................."
Beato gave no answer.
With gray eyes, ......she did nothing but blankly gaze at the steam rising from her black tea...
"My father created the Decalogue to act as a crutch for the power of {f:5:thinking}.
 ......It most certainly was not created to arrogantly insist on the way things must {f:5:be}."
"......A crutch...for the power of thinking......"
"{f:5:Yes}.
 Knox\'s 8th: It is forbidden for the case to be resolved with clues that are not {f:5:presented}.
 ......This does not only mean that one must avoid making baseless guesses that are not supported by {f:5:clues}."
"If you turn it around,
 .........it means that the one posing the mystery must present clues which lead to the solution."
"......So, in other words,
 ......if a story follows the Decalogue,
 ......all riddles must have hints,
 ......and therefore, it\'s guaranteed that finding the solution is possible."
I see......so this is what she means by a crutch for the power of thinking.
If you can believe that it\'s solvable, you start feeling the desire to have a go at those riddles.
If you\'re capable of believing that hints do exist, you get fired up about rereading the story to search for them......
"I\'ll admit......it might have the power of giving courage to people trying to solve it."
"The Knox Decalogue is often thought of as a series of restrictions imposed by the one who made the mystery,
 but it is also vital for the {f:5:readers}.
 .........By using the Decalogue as a crutch,
 we are given the courage needed to use reasoning, as well as the willpower to reread the tale several times...
in search of the clues we know must be hidden {f:5:there}."
".........It\'s like the lid of a jar of jam which is too tight and won\'t open.
 ......Like Mom always used to say,
 ......if you think you can\'t open it, then it really won\'t open no matter how hard you try.
 ......The same thing happens in sports.
 They say that whether or not you have a strong image of yourself and believe you can win no matter what...
has a large impact on the records you set."
In that case,
 the Knox Decalogue isn\'t really a set of arrogant and strict restrictions.
 ......You can also see it as a way to encourage readers, who are trying to solve the mystery, by telling them to give it their all since it\'s definitely solvable...
".........That\'s an interesting way to interpret it.
 ......But I\'ve heard that not every detective novel in the world necessarily follows the Decalogue.
 .........If you ran into one of those, wouldn\'t you feel betrayed...?"
"Even the Decalogue is nothing more than a single interpretation, and it does not apply to all mystery {f:5:stories}.
 ......Though among fundamentalists of my father\'s work,
 it seems there are those who harshly criticize works which violate the Decalogue and call them {f:5:heresy}..."
There\'s no end of arguments like this in the mystery world.
Is this or that famous detective novel a "fair" mystery—in other words, one that follows Knox\'s Ten Commandments?
That sort of argument is already an eternal theme of the mystery world.
In fact, in mystery discussions,
 arguments like these sometimes become more heated than talk about the actual solutions......
"I can understand the criticism.
 ......You try your best to solve a mystery, trusting that it follows the Decalogue and can be solved,
 but then it turns out that it was never made to be solvable in the first place...I can understand how irritating that must be."
That\'s right.
When fighting with the Decalogue, ......there\'s just one thing you want guaranteed from the beginning.
And that is.........the guarantee that the detective novel will adhere to the Decalogue.
If a work labels itself as an orthodox mystery, then you have nothing to worry about.
However, the mystery genre contains many unorthodox sub‐genres within it.
.........Does that mean that trying to use reasoning in an unorthodox detective novel...
is a complete waste of time......?
"......Looking at it that way,
 ......it really does feel arrogant."
"{f:5:Yes}.
 I also find it extremely sad that my father\'s Decalogue has been used as such an elitist {f:5:weapon}."
"............So...you just fought Beato using the Decalogue as a weapon.
 ......Can I take that as proof that this game world of Beato\'s follows the Knox Decalogue......?"
"......................................."
When I asked that, ......there was a strange silence.
{f:5:Virgilia}, Dlanor,
 ......and of course, Beato...
...all remained silent for a while......
Almost as though my question had touched at the core of something...
"That......is something I cannot answer myself."
"Why...?"
"This is a game that this child made.
 ......A game to determine a winner between you and her.
 ......She called it a confrontation between mystery and fantasy."
"But unfortunately, she has never called it an orthodox mystery.
 That means you have no guarantee that it follows the Decalogue."
"......But at the same time, Miss {f:5:Beatrice} has said that this game is a contest between you and {f:5:her}.
 ......That means there is room for you to achieve {f:5:victory}."
"In other words,
 ...............you\'re trying to say that it\'s possible to deduce the solution?"
"......................................."
".........If you asked her that question, she would probably say that it is.
 ......However, just as she is the challenger and you are the challenged, the two of you are different creatures.
 ......Something Beato might have proposed thinking it is solvable...
may or may not be something that is solvable for you as well."
For example, let\'s say we pose a simple riddle that any Japanese person would be familiar with.
......However, if the person we\'re telling this riddle to is a foreigner with a Japanese‐English dictionary in their hand,
 it might be almost impossible to solve.
......In other words, it\'s possible to have a one‐sided "solvable problem",
 which might be easy for the questioner but extremely difficult for the person trying to solve it...
By the way, do you know of the foreign riddle:
 "Why do dragons sleep all day?"
The answer is:
 "Because they fight knights".
It\'s a riddle from the English realm, so it might be a little tough for a Japanese person.
"For that reason,
 .........I cannot promise that this tale is something you will definitely be able to solve.
 .........However, I can promise you one thing.
 ...I will guarantee it with the red truth."
".........What?"
"{p:1:Beato wanted you to solve it,
 so she created this game—
and the riddles of this tale—to be solvable}.
 That alone, I will guarantee with the red truth."
It was...
...the one guarantee...
......that all those who try to use reasoning desire.
"I do not know whether the answer can be derived by following the Decalogue my father {f:5:created}.
 ......However, if you run into a tight spot and want a compass for your reasoning,
 please try using my Decalogue if you {f:5:remember}.
 ......It might give you renewed courage and possibly even some new {f:5:discovery}......"
"Thank you.
 If I\'m truly stuck, I\'ll think about your fighting style.
 ......Are you sure it\'s alright to help out an enemy like this?"
"Pay that no {f:5:mind}.
 I came to this tea party without a {f:5:gift}.
 I hope you enjoy this in place of a {f:5:snack}.
 ......And...if you come face to face with me {f:5:again},
 there will probably be no time to speak of something so {f:5:casually}."
.........Knox\'s Decalogue...
...and {f:5:Virgilia}\'s red truth.
"{p:1:Beato wanted me to solve the riddles of this game,
 so she created them to be solvable}."
In other words, ......Beato thinks I can solve it.
Isn\'t that......proof that it\'s possible to apply logic to this......?
......Of course, that\'s from Beato\'s point of view,
 ......and it doesn\'t necessarily mean that it\'ll be possible for me to work it out......
But compared to before now, when I didn\'t even know whether applying reasoning was possible or impossible,
 ......that one sentence might give me a great deal of courage and strength...
At least it has the power to silence any negative thoughts about it just being useless anyway...
"......Unless the other party assures you that it\'s possible to deduce the answer, you won\'t try.
 ......It\'s almost like love between shy, young people."
"Love?"
"Yes.
 .........Unless the other person first proves that they love you, you don\'t want to love them.
 ......Right?"
Both boys and girls......want to hear someone say "I love you" to them first without being prompted.
That\'s the dream.
......They don\'t want to love another person...
until they\'re sure that person will love them back.
After all, there\'s nothing as painful as a one‐sided love,
 ......and the emotional scars of a love that doesn\'t work out last a long time.
Because they\'re afraid of that pain,
 ......more than anything else, they want assurance that the other person will love them back...
"I {f:5:see}.
 That is an interesting way to explain the relationship between writer and reader in a detective {f:5:novel}."
Yes,
 ......maybe you could liken detective novels to that.
Both the writer and the reader...
...first want the other party to tell them "I will solve it", or "It can be solved".
Until the writer is assured that readers will definitely attempt to solve their story, they don\'t want to write it.
The same goes for the readers.
Until they are assured that they will definitely be able to solve the story if they try, they don\'t want to read it.
Because they don\'t want to write what they consider a masterpiece and be hurt when no one reads it.
Because they don\'t want to apply logic to what they consider a masterpiece and be hurt when they realize it was all useless.
"By that argument...
......it really isn\'t a stretch to say it\'s like love between shy elementary or middle school‐aged kids.
 ......Even though they are interested, they don\'t have the courage to reveal their feelings,
 so they wait uncomfortably for the other person to confess......and by the time summer ends, nothing\'s happened."
"Heheh, sometimes they\'ll even hook up with a different person.
 That\'s what my first love was like, ihihi."
Along with these one‐sided feelings they can\'t express, they lament the passage of a summer which will never come again, and the days of their youth end.
The writer who wouldn\'t write until he gained the support of readers...goes for all eternity without releasing his maiden work.
The reader who waited for the writer\'s rise to fame...goes their whole life without knowing the joy of the mystery genre.
"......Battler‐kun.
 When does this "the chicken or the egg" type of shy love...
reach the level where it progresses into mutual love......?"
"Well, .........it\'s probably gradual over time.
 ...It starts as a relationship between friends, they communicate with each other more,
 ......and they start thinking "I like this person and I think they like me"...
...and when both of them reach the stage where they\'re no longer in doubt, then...
......well, I guess...they probably just naturally become a couple."
"The impression I\'ve gotten so far is that relationships which start with a sudden confession of love tend to break up more often,
 whereas couples who never actually confess to each other but realize that they\'ve always been together usually stay together for a surprisingly long time."
"In other words,
 it happens when a relationship of trust forms where each person trusts the other,
 ......is what you are {f:5:saying}."
".........Yeah, maybe.
 ......I\'m surprised.
 ...I always thought mysteries were a battle between the writer and the reader, ......but maybe they actually aren\'t."
"Yes.
 They can only exist if there is mutual trust,
 ......a relationship with love."
"................................."
"................................."
"......Then...you\'re saying that me and her...
...aren\'t in a battle to the death but a loving relationship?"
"......*giggle*.
 Though it doesn\'t look like anything more than a pair of elementary schoolers bullying each other to me...
 Heheheheh."
{f:5:Virgilia} joked at us in a middle‐aged‐woman sort of way.
Still, ......though I\'m not expecting friendship or a trusting relationship,
 ......I can accept her as a rival.
Beato is fighting at full force, trying to make me acknowledge that she\'s a witch.
And I\'m responding to that and going all out trying to deny that witches exist.
"You say that Miss Beato is fighting at full {f:5:force}.
 How can you be so sure of {f:5:that}?"
"I mean, you can tell by looking, can\'t you?"
"It is not as though she has proclaimed in red that she was fighting you at full {f:5:force}.
 ......And yet, you have no {f:5:doubt}?
 You are the one who said you would not believe anything except the red {f:5:truth}."
".........ngh.................."
"*giggle*.
 ......This must be the stage where communication increases and you learn not to doubt your relationship,
 as you mentioned earlier."
{f:5:Virgilia} and Dlanor giggled together.
......One guy, multiple women.
 The topic is love.
......Wait a sec, isn\'t this the worst formation for getting made fun of?
I tried a couple of times to change the subject...
and clumsily brought up more refined topics in an attempt to return the mood to something more suitable for a tea party in the rainy Golden Land,
 but each time, {f:5:Virgilia} saw right through me and laughed at me......
..............................
Even amidst this, Beato kept looking downwards with those gray eyes,
 staring into her black tea.........
........................
.........Yeah, that\'s right......
{f:5:Virgilia} and Dlanor.........gave me so many hints back then...
And yet, I barely thought about them at all...
It\'s way too late now, but......
.........{i:Let me think}.
Now that it\'s too late to change anything and I have an endless amount of time on my hands, .........let me think.
......One more time, let me think about the red truth {f:5:Virgilia} gave me...
and the crutch called the Decalogue that Dlanor lent me......
With the red truth,
 .........{f:5:Virgilia} guaranteed that at the very least, Beato left enough room in this tale for me to achieve victory.
......That red truth guarantee...
...will give me the power to start my heart beating once again...
And......there\'s the crutch of the Decalogue, which Dlanor lent me.
Even she began by warning me that the Decalogue isn\'t so almighty that it can solve all riddles.
But even so, she kind of described it as a method to solve...
...no, to take on riddles.
......Let me try it.
Even though there\'s no guarantee whether this tale is mystery or fantasy,
 ......let me believe that I\'ll definitely be able to solve it,
 ......that it is a solvable tale,
 ......a mystery,
 ......and let me make one last attempt......
When I came to,
 ......I was suddenly...
...in that strange tea room,
 ......where I had often argued furiously with Beato across a table.
......Of course, Beato was nowhere to be found.
{n}It was just me......isolated and alone.
That\'s alright.
 Even so, ......I won\'t stop thinking.
Okay then.
.........What were Knox\'s Commandments again......?
I\'m sure Dlanor explained most of them when slamming me with them.
Of course, even I recall them vaguely.
What was......the first one, again......?
"......I beg to inform you of the following.
 Knox\'s 1st:
 It is forbidden for the culprit to be anyone not mentioned in the early part of the story."
When I muttered about what the first one was...
.........Dlanor\'s subordinate appeared,
 ......as if in answer to my question.
Without bothering with an unnecessary "hello", she told me nothing more or less than what I wanted to know.
"......Yeah, that\'s it.
 The first commandment.
 ......The culprit has to be one of the people mentioned in the early part of the story."
.........Does that mean that by the end of the first game,
 ......the culprit must have appeared already......?
True, that is the most basic of basics in the mystery genre.
 A given.
......A given...?
......Have I really...
......kept that as a basic assumption......?
With each new game, the number of people in this tale keeps increasing.
That violates the closed circle rule.
From that moment onwards, everything is screwed up.
Did I give up on the inside,
 ......thinking that the true culprit or mastermind must not have shown up yet and that reasoning was therefore useless......?
If I read this tale as a fantasy,
 ......new characters keep showing up to the point where even having demon kings or gods or divine creators appear wouldn\'t be strange at all.
Even if the true mastermind first appeared in one of the last Episodes, I\'d just accept it as that kind of story.
However, ......if I read it as a mystery and stick with that conviction...
...then there\'s no need to worry at all about anyone who shows up later.
Because Knox\'s 1st clearly rules them out,
 stating that it\'s impossible for the culprit to be anyone who appears later on in the story.
............Of course, there\'s also what both Dlanor and {f:5:Virgilia} said.
There\'s no guarantee that this tale follows the rules of the Decalogue,
 so of course, I can\'t deny the possibility that the culprit first appeared in the second game or later.
However, ......this is one way of thinking.
This time...
...I\'ll forget about the Devil\'s Proof completely......and try to borrow the power of the Decalogue in my thinking.
After all, I know by now that I\'ll never be able to reach the truth without looking from multiple perspectives.
"In that case, .........that means the culprit in all of these repeating games...
is one of the 18 people.
 From the very beginning......there was no need for an illusion of a 19th person."
......Even the first of Knox\'s commandments...
...denies the existence of an unknown person known as the witch from the very start.
If I had followed that in the truest sense...
...I might not have suffered so miserably in the second game.
"......Knox\'s 2nd?"
"I beg to inform you of the following.
 Knox\'s 2nd:
 It is forbidden for supernatural agencies to be employed as a detective technique."
Dlanor\'s other subordinate appeared without a sound...and gave me an answer to my question.
......That\'s right.
 A detective can\'t go around using magic.
"So, ............
......if this is a fair battle,
 ......does that mean that, like the detective,
 ......the culprit also isn\'t allowed to use magic......?"
"I beg to inform you of the following.
 ......Know that the interpretation is up to you."
"Figures.
 ......Right.
 Then I\'ll interpret it my way."
If this game is a fair battle between me and Beato...
......then because this tale is solvable,
 it features no elements which are impossible to explain with logic.
In other words, magic cannot—must not—exist.
When it does appear, I shouldn\'t suspect that the mystery element is breaking down,
 ......but I should instead question why it was shown and suspect the witnesses and observers.
That\'s right,
 ......that was...
...Beato\'s greatest weapon in the second game.
Depictions of magic that have no place in a mystery.
By showing me that, she forced me to think that this tale wasn\'t a mystery,
 and therefore, that reasoning was impossible, ...and I surrendered......
However, if I had believed unshakably that it was a mystery...
......it would have been completely obvious to doubt the witnesses who claimed to have seen those things.
Also, at the end of the first game,
 it was revealed that this tale had been passed on to people in the future by means of a message bottle.
......Someone wrote down the incident...in the form of a story.
In other words, ......this entire story is a world which includes the personal opinions of an observer,
 namely, the person who wrote that message in a bottle.
In other words, the observer isn\'t God.
 It\'s a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.
Therefore, there\'s no guarantee that the descriptions are truly impartial.
By the end of the first game,
 it had already been made clear that the text violated a constant premise of mystery stories:
 that they must be told from a God\'s‐eye view.
For that reason, it\'s possible to doubt not just the witnesses, but the observer as well.
If I could\'ve doubted this much,
 ......then no matter how many seemingly unsolvable displays of magic appeared,
 I wouldn\'t have had to blindly accept them and give up......
However, that raises the question:
 .........is it even possible to solve a story written by an observer who isn\'t impartial?
.........All reasoning ends here if you get obsessed with this.
That\'s why......it\'s so important for me to believe.
That Beato...
......is trying to fight me through this tale.
Because it\'s a fight,
 ......that means I\'ve been given a chance of winning.
And the fact that I\'ve been given that...
......must mean...
......that reasoning is possible.
......This part......is the hardest.
Unless I believe that the cruel witch took on the risk of losing to try and have a fair fight with me,
 ......I can\'t get past this part.
......{f:5:Virgilia}\'s right, ......it\'s just like love.
If I can\'t believe that Beato is fighting me head‐on with everything she\'s got,
 ......I won\'t be able to reason any further than this.
.........Alright, ...I\'ll admit it.
Unless I admit that we\'re "in love",
 ......I won\'t be able to get any further.
When {f:5:Virgilia} ran out of patience with the two of us, shy and incapable as we were of admitting that out loud,
 she gave me that red truth instead.
That was the red truth saying
 “{p:1:Beato wanted me to solve the riddles of this game, so she created them to be solvable}”.
......What the hell is that?
It\'s like "Satou‐san in class A says he likes you~".
{n}Like hearing a love confession via a friend...
.........I really am...
......pitiful.
Reasoning......is love.
If we don\'t love each other,
 ......the logic won\'t open up.
In that case, why can\'t we just say that we love each other?
"If you think you can solve it, just you try."{n}"You\'re incompetent, like hell you can solve it."
......Yeah, according to George‐aniki, you call that sort of thing "tsundora".
Heheh, that brutal witch is finally starting to look a bit cute.
......If I meet her again, I wanna try saying "You\'re such a tsundora".
If I meet her again, ............somewhere...
.......................................
"......Tell me the other parts of the Decalogue.
 I don\'t care about the order.
 ......Give me something that seems useful."
"I beg to inform you of the following.
 Knox\'s 8th:
 It is forbidden for the case to be resolved with clues that are not presented."
"I beg to inform you of the following.
 Knox\'s 6th:
 It is forbidden for accident or unaccountable intuition to be employed as a detective technique."
It must not be solved with clues that aren\'t presented.
{n}And it must not be solved by luck.
If this tale is made to be solvable...
then we can read this the opposite way.
In other words,
 ......clues must have been prepared so that the tale can be solved.
And it has to have been made in a way that it can be solved without relying on luck.
If I can believe strongly that Beato is challenging me to a fair game where reasoning is possible...
......I can be sure of that.
That must mean......that Beato has already concealed...
clues, hints, and messages within the tale so far.
......It isn\'t from the Decalogue, but Erika or someone said this:
{n}There are three riddles to be exposed in a mystery.
One is the whodunit.
 Who is the culprit?
{n}One is the howdunit.
 How did they commit the crime?
{n}One is the whydunit.
 Why did they commit the crime?
All of this means that clues related to these three riddles are already present inside this tale.
......No, strictly speaking, it\'s like this:
......Beato scattered hints about because she wanted me to solve those three riddles.
Though whether I\'m capable of catching those hints or not is another matter...
Even if you pose a riddle thinking it\'s easy...it might be difficult for the person trying to solve it.
Therefore, it\'s only natural for there to be a difference in how difficult each person thinks it is.
.........That\'s why...
...as Beato went through each successive game, she watched me closely and tweaked the game as needed to get a good arrangement.
When Beato realized that I\'d completely surrendered in the second game because it was too hard,
 she secretly worried.
If I surrendered and lost the will to fight, ......the game would no longer remain on an even footing.
Therefore, in order to make me regain my will to fight,
 ......from the third game onwards, she set things up in a way that made it easier for me,
 giving me tips on how to fight and a few hints.
The appearance of {f:5:Virgilia} and Ronove was obviously so that they could help me.
Also, though we still had the usual crazy magic shows,
 she gave me the metaphor of the Braun tube trial, as well as tips on how to fight back.
I finally understood how to fight,
 .........and at the end of the fourth game...
......Beato managed to have the all‐out showdown with me that she had probably wanted most of all.
......Then, Beato acknowledged that my abilities had become full‐fledged,
 .........and entrusted me with her heart,
 ...............entrusted me with explaining this tale, didn\'t she...
In that case, ......it was really dumb of me to boycott most of the fifth game,
 just because I was so disgusted with those two witches...
It doesn\'t matter who the Game Master is.
All I need is to search for the truth in Beato\'s game.
......On the contrary, I should probably thank those two witches just a little,
 for continuing the game in Beato\'s place now that she\'s gone and left everything to me.
Of course,
 I doubt those evil witches were trying to do anything of the sort......
Culprit.
 Crime.
 Motive.
The answers, the hints, to those three ultimate riddles.........must be scattered throughout the tale shown so far.
It\'s probably a very faint light, ......like trying to find beads that have fallen onto a sandy beach.
They\'re definitely there.
......However, they\'re so faint that unless I believe strongly, there\'s no way I\'ll be able to find them.
"For your attention:
 I beg to state the following."
".........What is it......?"
"Go back......through the tale.
 ......Know that you have now been given eyes that will not miss the truth\'s faint light."
"............Now is the time...
............to go back......"
"Be advised that for reasoning to be possible, a trusting relationship is required."
"......Yeah,
 ......I know.
 .........In fact,
 ...I might have just realized at last."
It\'s something that has been repeated over and over again throughout the tale...
...persistently so.
"......Without love,
 ......the truth...cannot be {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen}......"
Slowly, the tea room dissolved into darkness......
Then, as though I was slowly sinking into a pitch black sea,
 .........I passed through the cracks of the long journey I\'d taken with Beato...
......and kept on falling and falling......
It was a bizarre experience......
like crossing over the boundary of sleep while still conscious.
The several tales that had come before became faint bubbles—no, perhaps small shining fragments—
that were scattered like stars in a pitch black sky.
I kept sinking on and on...
...into that sea......
The tales up until now...
......one after another...
......after another.........
Vergilius guided Dante to Mount Purgatory,
 ......and led him to Beatrice, the eternal lady who waited at the top.
Therefore,
 .........the innermost depths lay not at the bottom,
 .........but at the peak of Mount Purgatory.
The eternal lady...
...had been waiting there for Dante...
...the whole time......
{a:c:And then.........I knew.}
......I finally...reached the truth.........
.........In the depths, ...no,
 .........at the peak...of Mount Purgatory...............
............Idiot............
......You...
......really are...
...an idiot......
"...Ah,
 ......gwah...
.........that hurts........."
He woke from the sleep of death,
 ......and bit by bit......his sense of pain came back to him......
As Battler hung there pierced by the longsword, his head still tilted towards the heavens,
 ......life gradually returned to his face...through an expression of suffering......
"You...
......really are...
...an idiot......
 ......A huge idiot........."
Battler...noticed.
......The whole time,
 .........Beato had been snuggling up against him......sleeping.
And when he held her,
 .........he found...
......that it was not Beato...
......but her crumbling...
...remains.
And because her form was as fragile as ash,
 when Battler tried to hold it,
 .........just like a sandcastle made on a beach...
...being washed away by a small wave,
 ......it fell apart and lost its form......
At Battler\'s feet......lay nothing but the ragged remnants of Beato\'s dress......and a pile of ash.
No, ......on top of that pile of ash......he could see something sparkling gold.
......It was...
.........the husk...
...of a single gold butterfly...
...which had been torn to bits......
And so, .........Battler...
knew......
{n}I......did reach the truth...
......But......I wasn\'t able to do it...
......while Beato...
......still remained in this world............
"......Beato......
......you...
......really are...
......an idiot......"
I finally reached the truth...
...of this ridiculous riddle...
...you created......
......Just...
...like you wanted......!
I didn\'t lose heart...
...and I finally...
...made it all the way to the end.........
So why...
......did you lose heart...
.........without waiting for me......?
......You believed so strongly, didn\'t you......?
 That I\'d......definitely reach the truth......
So, .........why.........?
Why...
............couldn\'t you believe with me...
.........and wait............?
It wasn\'t you who was forcing an endless torture on someone.
It was me...!
 I\'ve been the one putting you through a cruel torture...!
You resisted until the very end and kept on appealing to me......
 ........And now...
...even though I finally...
......reached the truth...
You...
......couldn\'t wait any longer...
......and it\'s all too late.........
"Y‐.........
...............you idiooooot.........
 ......Why......did you give in...
......before meeeeeee..."
It\'s my......fault......
 I forced her to endure this torture.
{n}In fact, I\'m amazed she endured for so long......
She kept on appealing to me, over and over and over again,
 .........and because I was so incompetent......I couldn\'t even begin to understand the truth.
"Idiot......
......idiot.........
 ......Your riddles...
...were too damn twisted......!!
 ......Why couldn\'t...
...you say it...
.........more simply......?
 ...You foo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}ool!!
 Aaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}agg{0}gh{0}h{0}hhh!!"
His scream of pain...
...filled...
......this cathedral of sorrow...
The sad witch who wasn\'t able to let Battler know of the truth.
{n}The sad man who wasn\'t able to understand the witch\'s truth.
Battler howled in anger and sadness for both of them......
The clock hung in the cathedral showed that it was midnight on October 5th, 1986.
Time was up...
......for everything.........
If you\'re going to create a riddle as hard as this and be so proud of it,
 ...don\'t go and set a goddamned time limit on it......
".........No,
 ......I understand......
 Even though there was such a faint chance of that miracle happening,
 .........you prayed for it to happen......
 ......You\'re...
......just like Grandfather."
You prayed for and bet on the power of a miracle...
......one so unlikely that it was totally impossible, less likely than finding a bead you\'ve dropped on a sandy beach.........
And because you did...I {i:have} now arrived at that miracle.
But......your time...
...didn\'t last long enough............
If I had reached this point even a little sooner...
If I could have {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen} the truth......!!
Even if it had been right before time was up,
 .........I might...
......have been able to save you...!!
But now, ......I\'ve been run through pathetically,
 ......and I can\'t......even hold what remains of you......!
......I struggled, attempting to pull the longsword out,
 ......or at least touch her remains by stretching out my arms......but neither worked.
"......Shiiiiiit......
dammiiiiiiiiiittt.........!!!"
.........At that time, I noticed a golden glint on the palm of my hand.
It was............a single wing from a gold butterfly.
That small fragment of gold...
......was the only piece of Beato...
...that I was permitted to touch.........
I cried with all my strength, .........gripped that fragment...and pressed it against my head, apologizing.
......Why couldn\'t I reach the truth earlier......?
Then I pressed it to my chest,
 ............promising that even though things had come to this,
 ......I would never again...
...lose...
...the truth......
When I pressed my hand against my chest, ......the sword piercing my chest cut my wrist, and blood dribbled out.
That blood spread throughout my fist...
......and it must have...
...soaked that gold fragment with my red blood.
It must have been......the only way of telling her...
...that I\'d found the truth she had wanted to tell me......
I clutched the wing of the gold butterfly...
...with my freshly bleeding hand...
......and pressed it against the red sword that impaled me......
In this moment,
 ......Ushiromiya Battler...knew.
 And understood.
......He had arrived...
......at the entirety...
...of this tale......
At that moment, ......it seemed as though a faint golden light...
...leaked out of the gaps in his clenched fist.
The two witches had their backs turned,
 and Erika was laughing at Battler\'s corpse.
"......What a disgrace you are, Battler‐san.
 Your foolishness will be immortalized in this statue......
 ..................Huh......?"
Just then, Battler\'s chest...
...no,
 .........the red longsword impaling Battler...
......began to shine gold from deep within his chest......
That bright golden light.........began to change the red sword\'s color...
...turning it gold......
"............What\'s going on......?"
"B‐......Battler is......
 ......What...
......is this......?!"
"..................!"
"Gwah...!!"
Battler coughed up blood and groaned.
His consciousness...came back.
 His will to live, his will to fight...came back...
The red longsword impaling Battler......could no longer be described as such.
...By now, it had become a golden longsword.
Then...
......slowly...
...slowly...
......it pulled itself out of Battler\'s chest......
After it had finally pulled itself out of Battler completely, it flipped through the air...
...and stuck upright into the ground in front of Battler\'s eyes, as though it knew who its master was.
Battler, crawling on the floor and moaning, grabbed the golden longsword...
...and though it looked painful,
 ......he slowly...
......rose to his feet once again.
"......This sure is an elaborate act.
 ...Is this one of your tricks, Lambda?"
"Th‐
.........that glow...
 ............I‐it can\'t be........."
Lambda stared wide‐eyed at that bright golden glow in awe...
Noticing that Battler\'s resurrection wasn\'t part of a script Lambda had thought up,
 Bern also frowned slightly...
"......Sorry. Retrials will not be permitted.
 Chiester Sisters, eliminate this resurrection illusion..."
"Understood, ma\'am.
 45, 410, firing permission granted."
"I‐......it\'s......unable to target!!
 IFF error, code 999...!"
".........Whoa."
"...Three Nines...?! Impossible...!"
The Chiester Sisters hesitated, unable to carry out {f:5:Bernkastel}\'s orders...
"Lambda, what kind of farce is this?
 ......The witch illusions have been completely destroyed, and the trial ended with our victory."
".........Sorry, Bern.
 ......You\'ll have to stick around a bit longer.
 .........Isn\'t that right, Ushiromiya Battler......?"
"...............Yeah.
 ......Sorry to keep you waiting, Erika,
 ......{f:5:Bernkastel}.
 ......Now it\'s time for my truth......"
"I accept your request for a retrial.
 ......The coven retracts the adjournment of the Court of Illusions!!"
"O‐objection.
 The trial has already been concluded and the verdict has been announced...!"
"Objection overruled...!!
 All verdicts are overshadowed by new truths!!"
"Objection!!
 Not only has Battler been banished as a player, he also doesn\'t hold the rank of witch...!
 He has no right to appeal...!"
"Objection overruled!!
 The thing is...he does now. Have that.
 ......I acknowledge it by the name of the Witch of Certainty, {f:5:Lambdadelta}...
 ......Ushiromiya Battler...!
 I acknowledge you as the new Golden Witch,
 ......no, .........as the new Endless Sorcerer, Ushiromiya Battler...!!!"
"......Wh‐
...what did you say......?
 ......B‐
......Battler got...
......the rank of a witch......?!"
The rank of a witch, which she had desired for so long, had been granted to Battler so quickly.
And on top of that, this wasn\'t anything temporary.
{n}......This was an official, proper authorization by {f:5:Lambdadelta}.
Erika couldn\'t accept it, and her face turned bright red...
".........Hmph, ......heh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}ha{0}haa{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haaah!!
 Looks like that kid\'s game really will keep us entertained until the very end...!
 Sure, I\'ll play along...!"
"{f:5:Erika}, accept his challenge...!
 The red truth you\'ve created with me is perfect...!
 The construction of truth which makes Natsuhi the culprit is perfect...!
 Battler will never be able to break it!"
"O‐of course, my master...!!
 There\'s no need to worry at all!
 Anyway, Chiester Sisters, my master ordered you to fire!
 How long is it going to take you to carry that order out?!"
"E‐error code 999!
 A‐an access code is required to target the territory lord...!"
".........Nyeh.
 I told you he\'d do it nyeh."
"Territory lord...?! Who is?!
 Who controls this fragment?!
 I do...!!"
".........Territory lord......
 ......You don\'t mean.........
......Battler is.........?"
"Yes.
 Ushiromiya Battler has been authorized as the official territory lord of this fragment, ma\'am...!"
"Yes, that\'s right.
 ......You still don\'t understand?
 You don\'t know what that golden glow signifies?
 .........Battler......has reached it.
 ......He\'s made his way to the innermost depths of all truths!!"
".........................................."
"That means Battler\'s understood everything about this world, this tale, this game.
 ......In other words, he\'s reached the position of the game\'s ruler.
 ......*giggle*, I\'ll bet you don\'t want to believe it, right, Bern?!"
"......Heh, .........*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!
 No, I don\'t want to believe it for a second...!!
 Alright, I\'ll test Battler to see whether he really understands everything...!!
 {f:5:Erika}!"
"Too bad, {f:5:Erika}.
 .........I know you were excited to be appointed as the territory lord of this fragment, but I\'m stripping you of that title."
"The new territory lord of this fragment is Ushiromiya Battler.
 ......*giggle*, is it awful? Tell me, tell me, don\'t you feel just awful?!
 How\'s it feel to have that title ripped away from you just when you\'d finally gotten it?! How\'s it feel?!"
"Ahh,
 ...waaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}ahh{0}h{0}h{0}hggh!!"
"Battleeeeeeeeeeee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}er!!!
 You think you can disprove my theory?! I\'d like to see you tryy{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}yyy!!"
"It can\'t be done,
 it can\'t
 it can\'t
 it can\'t
 it can\'t
 it can\'t
 it can\'t
 it can\'t
 it can\'t
 it can\'t
 it can\'t
 it can\'t!!
 The theory I\'ve created has no holes!!
 It\'s impossible to rule out Natsuhi as the culprit!!"
".........
{p:1:I can construct a theory with someone other than Aunt Natsuhi as the culprit}.
 ......It may be that your truth is impossible to disprove.
 ......If so, that means your truth won\'t be able to deny my new truth either......!"
Battler spoke with the red truth allowed him by his status as a sorcerer.
"A......a culprit other than Natsuhi...?!
 ...H‐......hah!! And how?!!
 Dlanor!!
 Please entertain Battler‐san\'s delusional rambling...!!"
......Slowly, ......Dlanor stepped forwards.
In her hand......was the red longsword of the Decalogue.
 She also had a blue shortsword.
In Battler\'s hand......was the golden longsword.
......The two rivals once again...
......no, for the first time,
 ......they truly confronted each other.
".........Battler, I have been {f:5:waiting}."
"Sorry to keep you."
"Not at {f:5:all}.
 Your return was sooner than I {f:5:anticipated}."
"Kill him,
 Dlanor A. Knoooooooooooxxxx!!!"
Dlanor\'s form disappeared in an instant.
{n}As though her slow, dignified movements from before were only a lie...!
......The trail drawn by the longsword of red truth burned itself into the retinas of those who saw it.
Before anyone had enough time to follow that trail, ......it was already approaching Battler\'s chest...!
"{p:2:Lady {f:5:Erika}\'s reasoning has solved the fifth {f:5:game}.
 No new facts exist to overturn this logically derived {f:5:truth}}...!!"
"{p:1:It\'s possible to present a different truth using a different interpretation}!!
 When multiple truths exist in parallel, the authenticity of both is questioned!!"
In this closed‐off world, it\'s possible for differing truths to exist at the same time.
Furthermore, as long as multiple truths exist, it\'s impossible to claim that any of the truths are the single truth.
In other words, even if I can\'t overturn Erika\'s reasoning, by questioning its credibility...
......and conquering it, I can defeat it...!
"Bern\'s reasoning is perfect. You won\'t be able to overturn it easily.
 ......But still.
 If you can present a theory on par with Bern\'s, the fight will come down to a verdict.
 That means it\'s possible that either one of the truths will be defeated and denied!"
".........This plot twist is truly laughable...!!
 I\'d expect nothing less from a demon\'s script!!"
"Then let me {f:5:ask}!!
 If not Natsuhi, who do you theorize is the {f:5:culprit}?!!"
Battler\'s golden longsword drew both red and blue trails at will.
"{p:2:It\'s possible to construct a theory in which this was the revenge of the baby from 19 years ago mentioned by Aunt Natsuhi in her confession}."
"{p:1:Knox\'s 1st:
 It is forbidden for the culprit to be anyone not mentioned in the early part of the {f:5:story}!
 A person first introduced in the fifth game cannot be named as the {f:5:culprit}}...!!"
"{p:2:What if the baby from 19 years ago was among us since the very beginning?
 For example, ......what if it was me}?!"
"{p:1:Knox\'s 8th:
 It is forbidden for the case to be resolved with clues that are not {f:5:presented}}!
 Was there ever any foreshadowing showing that you might be the baby from 19 years {f:5:ago}?!!"
"{p:1:The red truth from the fourth game that I am not the son of my mother Asumu.
 The feeling that Dad was hiding something in both the first game and this game.
 In particular, in this game, it was made clear that there were some special circumstances having to do with my birth}."
Battler proposed that he might be the baby from 19 years ago,
 ......and announced that he would reconstruct the crime with himself as the culprit.
As Dlanor cautiously held her sword at the ready, she gauged the distance between them...
Now that Battler had inherited the position of this world\'s territory lord and even attained the rank of Endless Sorcerer,
 his movements surpassed {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} understanding.
By now, the physical distance between them probably counted for nothing.
Because their extremely agile battle was surpassing the point where the concept of distance made any difference.
"......A good {f:5:start}.
 Let us hear......your theory with Battler as the {f:5:culprit}...!"
"Yeah, I\'ll let you hear it.
 I\'ll prove that this explanation also works,
 ......and that you can\'t be certain Aunt Natsuhi is the culprit...!"
"<Good>!!
 If you\'re supposed to be the culprit, that creates several contradictions!
 I\'ll use those contradictions to reap your feeble truth!
 I, Furudo {f:5:Erika}, the detective and the Witch of Truth...!!"
This time, Erika stepped forward.
......In her hand, there appeared a scythe like one a grim reaper might hold.
{n}A ruthless scythe for reaping everything that threatened her theory...!
"{p:2:It\'s only possible for the crimes to have taken place during the single hour after midnight}!!
 {p:1:During that one hour, you were in the dining hall of the mansion}!!
 {p:2:Therefore, it was impossible for you to commit the crimes}!"
"{p:1:It has not been specified that the time of death was during the single hour after midnight}.
 {p:2:Therefore, it\'s possible that the crimes didn\'t occur between midnight and {nobr:1 a.m.}...!"
"I\'ll speak exclusively about the murders in the cousins\' room!
 {p:1:It is impossible for the crime to have been committed in the cousins\' room between 1 a.m. and the time of the crime\'s discovery}!!"
"Dlanor, now!!!"
"{p:1:Knox\'s 8th:
 It is forbidden for the case to be resolved with clues that are not {f:5:presented}.
 If the crime actually was carried out in the cousins\' room, clues must have been {f:5:shown}.
 Because clues were not given to the detective, Lady {f:5:Erika}, who was on the watch for any abnormalities inside that room until morning, such a crime is {f:5:impossible}}...!!"
"{p:2:The "time of the crime\'s discovery" refers to the point at which I let out a scream and everyone gathered there.
 Even if it was impossible to kill them before that point, it was possible to kill them afterwards}...!!"
Battler used a blue flash to deflect both of the red truths that Erika and Dlanor had flung at him...!
Erika\'s eyes went wide.
 After all, what he had said was completely absurd.
......At that time,
 ......they still hadn\'t been killed...?!
Even though corpses were lying there with their necks sliced open?!
"{p:1:The deaths of the four in the cousins\' room have been declared with the red truth}!!
 Are you trying to use a witch illusion?!
 Are you trying to resurrect George and the others using the concept of magic even though they were dead at the time?!"
"I see, since you believe they were dead by that point,
 it must look to you as though the dead are being brought back to life...!
 So this will probably be magic to you."
".........In that case, I won\'t be the one to take the next shot at you!"
"Shut it!!
 How often do I have to say it?!!"
"{p:1:The deaths of the four in the cousins\' room have been declared with the red truth!!
 And their dead bodies were witnessed by a large number of people!!
 And it\'s already been declared with the red truth that no examination of any corpse is ever mistaken}...!!"
"Take that, dead people!!!"
"{p:2:......To what point in time did that red truth refer?
 Have you forgotten, Miss}?"
The fierce shower of red was blocked by a magical barrier set up by Ronove, who suddenly appeared right in front of Battler.
Now that Beato was gone, the demons shouldn\'t have been able to manifest themselves in the real world...
However, ......he "existed" here,
 ......and calmly dealt with Erika\'s attack.
"Y‐...you, ......Ronove!!
 H‐how did you get here...?!
 Well, who cares, this all works out nicely. Now there\'s no need to go looking for you.
 I\'ll capture you here and deny your existence too!!"
".........I\'ll leave it to you.
 Teach her that you can\'t control everything with a single, arrogant truth."
"<Yes, Your Majesty>.
 .........Well then, ...allow me to spar with you for a while.
 Go ahead, Miss."
"{p:2:The red truth pronouncing them dead referred to what point in time, then, according to you?!
 Are you saying you can pinpoint that?!
 You can\'t pinpoint it, so you can\'t disprove that it declared them dead at the time of the crime\'s discovery}!!"
"{p:1:When this court was opened, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} made a proclamation.
 She said this was a 24:00 answer session}!
 {p:2:......They were pronounced dead at 24:00 on the second day, in other words, at the end of the game.
 That does not deny the possibility that the murder occurred after the morning of the second day, after the so‐called "discovery of the crime"}...!"
"Then, you\'re saying......that the victims were alive at that time?!
 Even though their necks were sliced open?!"
"{p:2:Did you see that yourself, Miss Detective...?
 True, it has been said that no examination of any corpse is ever mistaken no matter who performs it,
 ......but it has never been said that there was a rule against describing something other than a corpse as a corpse}."
Erika swung her scythe recklessly,
 but Ronove blocked everything with elegant gestures made with the shield on one of his hands.
"S‐......so, at that point in time, no one was dead?!
 Are you telling me...there weren\'t even wounds on their necks?!
 But...in that case...why did Battler scream?!"
"{c:86EF9C:Never leave your feet unprotected}, little girl.
 {p:1:.........Ushiromiya Kinzo is already dead at the starting time for all games}!"
"Huh?! Ah—"
A pitch black hole opened beneath Erika\'s feet and swallowed her up.
She could probably see through to the other side of the hole.
......It was the same thing you\'d see if you looked down through the skylight on the ceiling of this cathedral.
"Lia!!"
"Yes."
{f:5:Virgilia} could already be seen in midair inside the cathedral.
As Erika fell from the heavens, {f:5:Virgilia} was right below her and thrust upwards with her divine spear glowing blue!
"{p:2:......Shouldn\'t you rethink your reasoning?
 Kinzo doesn\'t exist.
 Therefore, the way for the bodies to disappear in your theory breaks down}."
"{f:5:Correct}.
 ......Unless someone other than Kinzo makes the corpses disappear, your theory {f:5:unravels}."
"Geh...
......gah...
......gammiiiiiiit, this is nothing...
......graggh...gah.........!!"
{f:5:Virgilia}\'s blue divine spear skewered and pinned Erika in midair.
Erika struggled, filled with hatred, but she couldn\'t get it out easily.
Then, all around her,
 ......several small, fast things clanged off the walls and surrounded her.
Seven people manifested at once.
"We are the Seven Sisters of Purgatory...!!
 Know this, foe of our master!!"
"......You.........lowly paperweights.........!!"
"{p:1:After George\'s death, his body was never moved}!"
"{p:1:After Jessica\'s death, her body was never moved}!"
"{p:1:After Maria\'s death, her body was never moved}!"
"{p:1:After Rosa\'s death, her body was never moved}!"
"{p:1:After Genji\'s death, his body was never moved}!"
"{p:1:After Krauss\'s death, his body was never moved}!"
"{p:1:Therefore, the bodies couldn\'t have vanished after being discovered!!
 Your theory about Kinzo carrying the bodies away breaks down}!"
"AAAaaaaaarrggghhhhhhhghhh...!!!
 And so what?!
 Even without Kinzo, I can explain how......the corpses disa—......
......nnngg, ......gaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aggghhh!!
 {i:I}...have to revise {i:my} theory......?!
 Nnnnnngggaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}ar{0}r{0}rrggghh!!
 Me?! ...The detective?!!"
"Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrggghhhhh!!"
......Even with Kinzo\'s existence denied,
 Erika was probably capable of escaping this pin by making only a small revision to her theory.
However,
 ......to her, having to revise a theory she had already created...
.........was extremely......humiliating!
"Looks like you toyed around with your plan too much in order to corner Natsuhi like that."
"You played around too much with your reasoning.
 ......At this point, your master isn\'t the only one who can speak of Kinzo\'s death with the red truth."
"This is what you get for playing around in the witches\' darkness.
 ......Know that, Furudo Erika...!"
"Nngh, ......gggh, ggh.........!!"
Of course, even Erika had doubted Kinzo\'s existence from the beginning.
However, in the trial that had taken place before,
 no one except {f:5:Bernkastel}, as well as {f:5:Lambdadelta} who was going along with her, had been capable of denying Kinzo\'s existence.
And because of the willful silence of those two, she had been free to shape the truth about Kinzo in any way she desired.
She never expected that Battler......would become a witch......a sorcerer,
 capable of using red without proof!!
However, she had her own Inquisitor who could also use red without proof to counter!!
"D‐Dlanoooooooooooorrrr!!!!"
"{p:1:Knox\'s 2nd!!
 It is forbidden for supernatural agencies to be employed as a detective {f:5:technique}!
 If you intend on showing that Kinzo has died with the red truth, I demand that you present evidence of a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} truth supporting such a {f:5:statement}}...!"
"......Forgive me, you crazy old bastard."
"Go forth, Battler.
 Step over my dead body...!!"
"{p:1:Presentation of evidence.
 I present a body which can be identified as Ushiromiya Kinzo}...!!"
"{p:2:Can you prove that this is Ushiromiya Kinzo\'s {f:5:body}?!
 No matter how much it resembles him, unless you can prove that it is him,
 it is possible to claim that it is a substitute corpse from someone {f:5:else}!!
 Can you show that it is Kinzo\'s body with {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} truth {f:5:alone}?!
 In this one case, I will treat any rebuttal that uses only the red truth as {f:5:invalid}}...!!"
"......Ooh.
 Any counter with the red truth will be invalid?
 That\'s novel."
"It may be true that the existence of third‐party corpses has already been denied with the red.
 However, if saying that in red is forbidden,
 ......*giggle*, Battler has nowhere to run to.
 Heh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eheh!"
"That\'s right......
 {p:1:In this closed‐off Rokkenjima, there is no objective way to show that this corpse is Grandfather\'s}."
"{p:2:And that itself suggests the possibility that this corpse is a body {f:5:double}!
 This unidentifiable body cannot serve as proof of Kinzo\'s {f:5:death}}...!!"
"{p:2:......Checkmate...!!
 My theory is rock solid}!!"
Dlanor had sealed off the red truth as a means of proving that Kinzo\'s corpse had been shown.
......Even with the power of witches, Battler couldn\'t argue back......!
".........How are you going to prove that the corpse is Kinzo\'s if the red truth is sealed?
 It\'s impossible.
 ...It can\'t be done...!"
"......Not with red or blue, ...right......?"
"{p:41:I guarantee that this is the corpse of Ushiromiya Kinzo}...!!"
Then,
 ...when Dlanor...
...met with Battler\'s golden flash,
 .........she was unable to fully block it with either her red longsword or her blue shortsword,
 ...and she was blown backwards into the air...!
It was a direct hit......without any miscalculation.
Though she had always seemed as firm as a small giant before now,
 she was finally blasted away and slammed against the wall as though she was the slender girl she appeared to be...!
"D‐......Dlanor?! Wh‐what are you......"
"......A splendid gold {f:5:truth}.
 .........It is {f:5:valid}."
"......G‐......gold truth......?!"
The golden longsword, which had been drawing red and blue trails before now,
 finally drew a trail which retained its divine golden color.
The truth it showed.........was neither red nor blue.
{n}.........It was gold...truth...!!!
"Wh‐what is that...?
 Lambda, does this follow the rules?!"
".....................
 ......Yes.
 ......Gold truth, valid.
 The gold truth...
......can only be used by the territory lord of this world...
...no, ......only by the Game Master himself!!"
"Wh‐......what did you say............?"
"......Gold {f:5:truth}.
 A divine truth woven in a different fashion than the red {f:5:truth}.
 ......Its strength is on par with the red {f:5:truth}.
 ......It may sometimes be {f:5:inferior}.
 But it is sometimes {f:5:superior}!!"
"That brilliant shine......is the proof that Battler‐kun has truly understood Beato."
".........I\'ve shown it.
 Shown that the corpse is Grandfather\'s."
"{f:5:Yes}.
 Gold truth, ......{f:5:accepted}.
 Unless Lady {f:5:Erika}\'s theory undergoes some revision, it will be {f:5:destroyed}...!"
"Wh‐......what the......
ah, aaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}ar{0}rrghhh!!!"
Erika cried out in pain.
 ......It wasn\'t the pain of her body being impaled.
It was the pain of her own theory being defiled...!
".........I see.
 ......I thought this was nothing but a mishmash of narrative tricks...
 ......Just when did it become........................
 .........*giggle*giggle*,
 ahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haa{0}ha{0}ha{0}hah{0}haa{0}ha{0}ha{0}hah{0}hahah!!
 What a crazy string of great works!!"
"Battler, it would be beyond boorish to say more.
 Even without saying another word,
 you\'ve made your truth about the corpses\' disappearance fully "understood"!"
"Yes, what you\'re thinking of doesn\'t conflict with any of the red in this trial so far!
 I completely understand and accept your truth based around the revenge of the man from 19 years ago!!
 I proclaim your truth established!!"
"Wha.
 What the...?!
 Why is that, Great Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}?!!
 He still hasn\'t explained everything...!!
 I still have many ways to argue back, ......like Hideyoshi\'s locked room, the seal on Natsuhi\'s room and the button in the closet!"
"......Uh.
 ......You {i:still} think it\'s possible for you to argue back against Battler...........?"
"Ggah, ......gwwaagghgghggghhh.........!!!!"
Only Erika, the one who was supposedly so intelligent, couldn\'t understand.
......She couldn\'t understand that Battler had already found the real truth.
"{p:1:Grandfather\'s absence has therefore been proven,
 and the dishonorable relationship between Aunt Natsuhi and Grandfather has been removed from consideration}!!"
"{p:1:Aunt Natsuhi is pure and faithful!
 I won\'t permit this vulgar tale you\'re all so fond of}!!"
".........B‐.........Battler‐kun......!!"
"{p:1:Furthermore.
 Because doubts have been raised about the time of death for all who have died so far, the alibis for everyone besides Aunt Natsuhi are null and void}...!!"
"{p:1:The argument that the crimes couldn\'t have been committed by anyone except Aunt Natsuhi no longer stands}!!"
Dlanor, who must have risen to her knees at some point,
 slowly stood up......
The flash from the golden longsword was still carved deep into her chest.
Though pain didn\'t show in her expression,
 her awkward movements clearly showed how serious the damage she had taken was.
Even though she herself knew that this spelled the total end of the match...
...Dlanor didn\'t abandon her duty...!
"{p:1:However, in the cousins\' room, you witnessed dead bodies which were impossible to {f:5:misidentify}...!
 Are you trying to say that was a {f:5:falsehood}?!
 ...Knox\'s 7th: It is forbidden for the detective to be the {f:5:culprit}}!!
 The detective is obligated to have an objective point of {f:5:view}.
 Your theory violates this {f:5:obligation}!!"
"{p:1:Furudo Erika is the detective in this game, not me!!
 And by Knox\'s 9th, observers are permitted to put forward their own conclusions and interpretations}...!!"
"{p:1:Knox\'s 8th: It is forbidden for the case to be resolved with clues that are not {f:5:presented}!
 Until now, you have been the {f:5:detective}!
 Was it ever shown that you were not the detective this time, and that you were an observer with a subjective {f:5:viewpoint}?!!
 Unless it was, you do not have the right to falsify your point of {f:5:view}}!!"
"{p:1:In this game,
 when I figured out the device of the epitaph\'s riddle, I witnessed Grandfather.
 ......As has already been shown in red, Grandfather doesn\'t exist.
 It was impossible for me to witness him!
 Therefore, it has already been shown that my viewpoint wasn\'t objective}!!"
"{p:2:It is possible that it was just a sheet or something fluttering in the wind and rain which you mistook for Kinzo.
 It cannot be used as foreshadowing to form a basis for Knox\'s 9th...!!
 Mistaking things for something else is a right permitted to all observers}!!"
"{p:1:There\'s the red truth which Beato showed during the fourth game!!
 No person would mistake Ushiromiya Kinzo by sight}!"
It\'s the red truth Beato used to counter my blue truth claim that someone disguised themselves as Grandfather...
and thereby made it seem as though he had appeared.
{p:1:In other words, on this island, anything which might lead someone to visually mistake something for Grandfather, including someone else pretending to be Grandfather, {i:cannot ever work}.}
The scheme Aunt Natsuhi once put together to make it seem as though Grandfather was alive...
only involved her saying things like "he was here just a second ago" or "he\'s in his study alone now",
 cleverly exploiting the relatives\' blind spots to pretend he was there.
She never tried to make anyone mistake something they saw for Grandfather himself,
 so there are no contradictions.
If she had tried to dress one of the servants in Grandfather\'s robe...
it would probably have been seen through in an instant......
It has been guaranteed that none of the characters in this tale...
would "mistake something for Grandfather by sight"...!
If someone still claims to have seen Grandfather, it becomes a "falsehood".
Everyone is permitted the right to falsify their observations...
...but there is one person who does not have that right.
And that person is...
“the detective”...!!
"{p:1:Because of the right granted by Knox\'s 9th, everyone is allowed to mistake a sheet in the wind for something else and talk mistakenly about what they saw.
 ......However!
 Mistaking it for Grandfather in particular is not permitted in this game due to the red truth}!!"
"......So, once you claimed to have seen Kinzo,
 it was no longer misrecognition...
but {f:5:intentional}.
 ......In other words, this disproves the objectivity of your viewpoint...
...is what you are {f:5:saying}......?"
In this case, unintentional {i:misrecognition} is not permitted by the rules of this game.
{n}However, it is possible to intentionally {i:lie about seeing} something you never saw...!!
And that is an action not permitted to a "detective" burdened with the responsibility of an impartial perspective......
"Forgive my crazy argument...
 This is the end."
"No, it is {f:5:alright}."
............If a man like you had been in the {f:5:world},
you would surely have protected the fragile truth from any kind of {f:5:arrogance}.
Faced with the tyranny of a single plausible truth claiming to be the sole truth and exterminating all the fragile others,
 ......you would surely have protected the real {f:5:truth}...!!
Battler\'s golden longsword.........drew a massive blue arc as though splitting the heavens.
"I am glad to have been able to fight with {f:5:you}...!!"
"{p:2:Therefore,
 my perspective in this particular game is based upon the ninth commandment, not the seventh...!!
 The fact that I claimed to have seen Grandfather is proo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}oof}!!!"
......The noise which rang out across the cathedral...
......was the sound of Dlanor\'s longsword clattering to the floor.
Simply letting go of that was the same as resigning to the proud Dlanor.
Though the blue trail Battler had drawn was aiming right for the top of Dlanor\'s head, .........it stopped a hair\'s breadth away.........
If it hadn\'t, Dlanor would probably have been annihilated without leaving a single scrap of flesh behind.
".........I {f:5:resign}.
 ......I give up on denying your {f:5:truth}..."
"I\'ve paid my debt.
 ......My respect goes to your father.
 ......The Decalogue was neither arrogant nor judgmental...!"
"R‐......respect to...my {f:5:father}........."
Dlanor......sat down on the floor...
...and completely abandoned her will to fight.
"Wh‐......what are you doing, Dlanor?!!
 Shameful, pathetic!!
 You stupid half‐wit murder doll!!
 You\'ve tainted the honor of your own father, shame on you!!
 You still call yourself mystery\'s wedges?!
 You\'re surrendering to magic?!
 The history of the mystery genre forbids it!!"
".........You\'re the one...
...who doesn\'t understand a thing about mysteries.
 ......If you see mysteries as nothing more than a weapon with which to sneer at your opponent intellectually,
 ......I won\'t let you ever speak of them again!!"
"......B‐.........Battleeeeeeeeeer......!!!"
"{p:2:I present a truth that conflicts with yours!!
 Aunt Natsuhi was threatened by a phone call over the internal line made by the man from 19 years ago: me}!"
"{p:2:His goal was to make Aunt Natsuhi look like a murderer...!!
 From the beginning, this has all been a drama of revenge intent on framing Aunt Natsuhi}...!!"
"{p:2:Th‐that\'s wrong, it\'s a drama of revenge against the Ushiromiya family planned by Natsuhi!!
 Your theory outright opposes mine}!!"
"......Can you still not pull out the blue spear that\'s sticking through you?"
"Yep, good point.
 Erika, you haven\'t given me a single way for the corpses to disappear that doesn\'t involve Kinzo.
 Your theory is being denied as I speak...tick tock!"
"Th‐this spear is just...
............ugh, ......gaaaaahh......!!
 You paperweights...
...get out of my way.........!"
......The deeply piercing blue spear and the seven red stakes tormented her theory.
They won\'t come out......... They won\'t come out.........!!
"...............I acknowledge the mistakes in Erika\'s reasoning and the need for revision."
"Wh‐......what the......my master?!?!"
Watching Erika\'s face contort with pain as she struggled to escape from the spear,
 {f:5:Bernkastel} declared this with a disgusted expression.
For all intents and purposes, ...it was as if {f:5:Bernkastel} had acknowledged Erika\'s defeat herself.
With eyes of shock and despair, Erika looked up at the master who no longer had any confidence in her victory...
"......I don\'t give a damn about your pride.
 How long do you intend to shame yourself like that?
 ......You, my double who\'s been granted the same blue hair as me, ......how long do you intend to hang there pierced through like that......?
 Do I {i:really} have to descend myself......?"
".........I\'ve changed my mind, having a piece is a waste of time.
 Aah, what a pain, what a pain, what a total pain...
 Who needs a piece, I should just get rid of it... Ahh, what a terrible regretful discouraging disappointing misguided mistake...!!
 ......Get on with it, you filth!!
 Didn\'t I tell you to revise your pathetic attempt at reasoning?!?!"
"Ooh, ......agh...hh.........y‐yes, my master...!!
 I\'ll revise it... I\'ll revise my theory...!!
 Uuu{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}ughhu{0}u{0}uh{0}h{0}h{0}u{0}uuu......!!"
As Erika\'s face twisted in humiliation and tears streamed from her eyes,
 she withdrew and revised her own theory in accordance with her master\'s order......
Mumbling quietly, she made various revisions with the blue truth,
 had them acknowledged by {f:5:Lambdadelta}, and finally had the blue spear smashed and was freed......
Though that blue truth did indeed explain how the bodies had disappeared,
 ......it was truly shabby reasoning that reeked of desperation.
".........My master......
 .........I, ......I\'ve taken it out.........
 ...My theory...
......is perfect......"
"Are you kidding me?
 It\'s woefully pathetic.
 .........But I\'ll forgive you.
 Because your face and your theory are both so shameful it\'s funny!
 *snicker*snicker*snicker*snicker*snicker*!!!"
Erika was taunted by her master, who wore an ugly expression.
{n}She thrashed about on the floor, crying bitter tears.
The wounded Dlanor stepped out before her, as though shielding her, and she spoke to {f:5:Bernkastel}, as well as Battler.
"......Regardless of how shabby it might be,
 ......Lady {f:5:Erika}\'s revised truth is {f:5:valid}."
"Yeah, that\'s right.
 Regardless of my truth, yours can exist at the same time.
 ......That\'s what this world is like.
 No one can disprove them, so even if there are various truths and even if they contradict each other wildly, they can exist at the same time.
 Here, as many truths exist as you can imagine.
 No one can unilaterally deny them...!"
"Yes, that is {f:5:true}.
 ......I will not allow anyone to deny Lady {f:5:Erika}\'s {f:5:truth}."
"D‐......Dlanor........."
"As long as I am here,
 I will protect that {f:5:truth}.
 ......No matter how shabby it might be, I will not laugh at that {f:5:truth}."
"Uugh......uuuuughhhuuuuuu!!"
......The words of Dlanor, whom Erika had previously looked down upon, led Erika to once again thrash about on the floor, sobbing.
"And...
because no unique truth exists, everything is covered in darkness.
 ......Therefore,
 although both my theory and Erika\'s are impossible to deny, neither is the single truth.
 They are uncertain things, neither of which can be denied, and neither of which is absolute...!!"
"And as long as there\'s no definite answer, the witch illusion still exists.
 .........It isn\'t Erika who\'s allowed to expose that, and it isn\'t any of the rest of you, either.
 ......It\'s me alone!
 I won\'t let anyone expose {f:5:Beatrice}\'s illusion except me!!!"
"The verdict is revised...!!
 Because of the truth presented by Ushiromiya Battler, Erika\'s truth is no longer unique!
 However, Erika\'s truth is impossible to disprove!
 Therefore, both of their truths exist together!
 The conclusion of the fifth game is rescinded!"
"The game goes back to being even!!
 And I transfer the position of Game Master from myself to the Golden Sorcerer, Ushiromiya Battler!!"
"Ushiromiya Battler, step forward!!
 I appoint you as the new Game Master!!
 Will you accept?
 You will, right?!
 Do it, you new Endless Witch!!!"
"Yeah!!
 I\'m the new Game Master!!
 I\'ll weave the sixth game...!!"
"Erika, let\'s settle things for good this time!!
 Stand up!!"
"......Y‐......yes,
 ......you bet I\'ll stand......
 ......You will rue...
...giving me a chance to recover from this humiliation......!!!
 My master, please give me an opportunity to fight with Battler again in the sixth game!!"
"............Sure.
 Of course I\'ll give you a chance."
"Wow, incredible.
 For you to "give someone a chance".
 Isn\'t this a miracle? Witch of Miracles, {f:5:Bernkastel}."
".........Erika.
 You\'ve miraculously managed to escape with your life.
 ......In the sixth game, ...Battler\'s game,
 .........you had better expose the truth no matter what...
 Unless you want to be tossed aside into the darkness of oblivion!!"
"Y‐yes, my master...!!!
 .........D‐......Dlanor..."
"Of {f:5:course}.
 I will give it my all in the next game as {f:5:well}."
"Heh, ......heheheheheheh!!
 I won\'t pretend to be a guest any longer.
 ......Together with Dlanor, I\'ll tear your game to bits!!"
"Sure.
 I\'ll invite you to my sixth game...!!
 Sorry, but that title of yours...{0}<Checkmate of the>...isn\'t cutting it."
"It\'s your game. You can decide the name yourself!
 Just bring it on...!!
 I, Furudo Erika, ............am a detective before I am a witch!!
"
"I acknowledge you as the new master of this game, ......and I declare war!!
 I swear......I swear I\'ll expose everything you try to hide!! I\'ll kill you!!
 Golden Sorcerer, Ushiromiya Battler!!!"
"Yeah, come at me with all you\'ve got!!
 Furudo Erikaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aaa!!!"
Just watch, Beato.
 ......I\'ll take charge of your game!!
And in this next game, I\'ll prove that I completely understand all of your riddles...!!
