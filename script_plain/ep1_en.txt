"............You\'ve...
been indulging in alcohol again, haven\'t you?"
The old physician let out a sigh as he removed the stethoscope.
Two elderly men could be seen in the dimly lit study, which was filled with dust and a sickly sweet stench.
In the corner of this room, which was much larger than what most people would call a study,
 there was an expensive‐looking bed, a man undergoing a medical examination, and the physician conducting it.
{n}There was also what appeared to be a servant watching over the whole scene.
"The bottle is my friend.
 It is no less of a friend than you, and it has stood by my side even longer than you have."
The man who had bared his chest for the stethoscope spoke unapologetically as he straightened out his clothes.
"............Kinzo‐{c:86EF9C:san}.
 ...Your body only appears to be well thanks to the effects of the medicine.
 However, if you continue to drink such strong spirits, the treatment will become meaningless.
 ...Trust my judgment.
 Temper your drinking."
"I thank you, though only for the sentiment,
 my friend.
 .........Genji.
 Another glass.
 Water it down slightly.
 That way Nanjo can save face."
".........Are you quite sure?"
After eyeing both the master who demanded the alcohol and his doctor who forbade it,
 Genji, the old butler, silently gave a slight nod and carried out his master\'s orders faithfully.
Nanjo, the man\'s personal doctor, let out a deep sigh once again as he watched the butler busy himself alongside the liquor cabinet...
There was a smell filling up the room.
...This sweet, poisonous aroma felt as though it melted the heart, if not the soul itself.
 It was the smell of that venomous green drink that the man couldn\'t bring himself to part from.
"......Nanjo.
 You are my close friend of many years.
 I am deeply grateful for all that you have done to keep me alive this long."
"I have done nothing.
 ......After all, you never listen to my advice as your physician."
"Hahahaha...
 And you never listen when I warn you about a mistaken chess move you\'re about to make.
 It seems we are even."
"......My lord."
"Thank you.
 ......I wouldn\'t die if I ran out of your medicine, but I would if I ran out of this."
With one eye on Nanjo, who had his face set in a resigned expression, Kinzo took the glass that Genji was holding out to him.
...There are probably very few people who would associate the venomous color which filled the glass with an alcoholic beverage.
".........Nanjo.
 Be honest with me.
 How much time do I have left?"
"Well now...
 How short must I make it to get you to stop drinking?"
Nanjo once again let out a sigh of resignation.
{n}As he watched Kinzo down the glass regardless, he spoke.
".........You don\'t have much time."
"...What precisely do you mean by that?"
"......Let us illustrate it with the chess game here.
 You are closing out the game quite well, but I do not ultimately see you cornering my king."
Nanjo\'s gaze was directed at a side table with a stately chess set placed on top of it.
Judging by the positioning of the pieces, the match was well into the endgame.
{n}The black rook and bishop were cutting deeply into the enemy lines.
The white king had already been castled and cornered, so that even an amateur could see that the match would reach its conclusion before too long.
Every time Nanjo came to give a medical examination, both of them would make a few moves.
Nanjo was stating with confidence that Kinzo would most likely fall into his eternal sleep before this game could be concluded.
...These were less the words of a physician than they were the words of an old friend.
"............Were you a normal patient,
 I would recommend that you write a will at this point."
"......And what is a will, Nanjo?
 Handwritten instructions to the vultures on how to devour and scatter my corpse?"
"No, not at all.
 ......As the word suggests, it is a way for you to record your will for later generations.
 It is far more than just a means to divide up your inheritance."
"Hoh.
 ......And apart from the division of the inheritance, what might I write of?"
"............Oh, there\'s your regrets...
and matters you have left unfinished.
 Things you want to be passed down...
...and things you want to tell.
 ......Anything you want."
"......Hmph.
 .........Things I want to be passed down and things I want to tell?
 Ridiculous.
 I, Ushiromiya Kinzo, have not one thing I want to tell or leave behind!!"
"I was born with nothing.
 I will die with nothing!
 There is nothing I wish to leave to my foolish children!!
 Even if the end were to come today—even if it were to come right now!
 I shall accept this fate of death without a trace of fear!!"
"......Kinzo‐san."
"I created everything.
 My fortune!
 My prestige!
 Everything!!
 Those were built up by me, and they will be lost along with me.
 There is nothing I wish to leave behind!!"
"Nothing!!
 After I\'m gone, I care not if it all goes to waste!
 I desire no tomb, no coffin!!
 Those were the terms of the contract I made with the witch!
 When I die, everything will be lost!
 That has been part of the promise since the beginning, and that\'s why nothing will be left behind.
 There is nothing I can leave behind!!"
After reaching a furious crescendo, Kinzo suddenly slumped over.
...His expression was limp and feeble, as though an evil spirit had possessed him and then left.
"..................
 However, I do have one regret.
 I have nothing to leave behind, but there is one thing I cannot leave undone..."
".........You would do well to write it down.
 Of course, it would be best if you could finish it before your time comes.
 However, even if the worst happens, those who come after you will carry it to completion.
 You must leave behind your regrets so that they can be resolved even if you are unable to do so yourself.
 ......That is the purpose of a will."
When Nanjo tried to gently pat Kinzo\'s shoulder, the dying man flew into a sudden rage and batted away Nanjo\'s hand.
"That is no good, no good, no good!!"
"It must be done while I still live! At the moment of my death, my soul will be devoured by the demons of the contract and wiped out of existence!
 For me, there will be no peace or another world after death!
 That\'s why everything must be done before I go!!
 That\'s why a will has no meaning for me!!"
"And if I had the time to write such a thing...
 ...If I had such time to spare!!
 ...I\'d want to see it.
 I\'d want to see it one more time!
 I want to see {f:5:Beatrice}\'s smiling face one last time!!"
"Oh, {f:5:Beatrice}, why do you resist me so?!
 I would return everything you have given me right this very moment—I am prepared to lose everything!!
 So please, show me your smile just one more time..."
"{f:5:Beatrice}, I beg of you—you must be able to hear this final plea—that\'s the kind of woman you are!
 I beg of you, show yourself to me!!
 You\'re here, aren\'t you?!
 You\'re standing there invisible, listening to every word I say, and even now you\'re mocking me from somewhere in this room, aren\'t you?!"
"Please, appear before me one more time and smile!!
 Feel free to scold me, even snatch away my life by your own hands if you wish!!
 I don\'t want to die alone like this!!
 I cannot let myself die until I\'ve seen your smile just one more time!!"
"Aah, {f:5:Beatrice}, {f:5:Beatrice}!!
 I offer up this life of mine, I offer it up to you!!
 I\'m begging you, {f:5:Beatriceeeeee}!!!"
"Whoa...
 Things sure move with the times...
 I can\'t believe we\'ll be able to make the trip in just twenty minutes..."
I couldn\'t help but scratch my head and marvel at how far things have come in recent years.
{n}We used to go by boat.
Back then, we were all forced to endure nearly half a day of swaying back and forth over the sea before we reached Niijima.
 Things have gotten so much more convenient these days.
Still, I\'ve never been on a plane this small.
{n}I\'ve flown in a huge jumbo jet before, but this will be my first experience in such a tiny one.
...It\'s going to shake, isn\'t it...
 They say that smaller boats shake more, so I guess the same rule probably applies to planes.
...Aaah, just spare me.
"Haahahaha, don\'t worry, Battler‐kun.
 It\'ll shake much less than that boat did."
"Gyah?! ...I‐is that you, George‐{c:86EF9C:aniki}?!"
"Heheh, don\'t scare me like that... You just shaved three years off my life.
 Anyway, what\'s shaking got to do with anything?"
"Ihihihi, you don\'t think I\'m actually scared of the plane shaking or maybe falling out of the sky or something, ri~ght?"
"Oh, of course not, my mistake.
 I\'m sure that you\'ve changed a lot since we last saw you.
 After all, it\'s been six years since then.
 You\'re not a kid anymore.
 Hahahahaha."
"Sheesh, and here you are, old enough to smoke and drink.
 I\'ve got no interest in smoking, but I\'ve always wanted to try some booze, heheheh!
 Well, if you\'ve got your dad\'s genes, I\'ll bet you can hold your own when it comes to drinking, right?"
"Well, I usually drink for business rather than pleasure.
 It\'s pretty hard to do business in Japan without it."
"Ihihihi!
 That\'s exactly right!
 So I was thinking I\'d take my first shot at it tonight at dinner!"
"Th‐that\'s no good, Battler‐kun, you\'re still a minor!
 Drinking alcohol is known to stunt the growth of minors and...
...um, never mind."
"Come on, I\'m tall enough already!
 In fact, it\'d be easier to find clothes if I shrunk a little!"
I puffed my chest out proudly.
Until I hit my growth spurt, my height was below average in my class.
But then, I grew and grew, and before I knew it, I was over 180 cm.
I guess I have all that muscle training and those shady mail‐order performance‐enhancing drugs to thank for that.
Before then, I\'d never dreamed that I\'d shoot ten centimeters above George‐aniki, who\'d reached his peak height early on.
......Damn, I\'ll bet my relatives all say "look how big you\'ve grown, Battler‐chan!" or something.
...That kind of thing is really embarrassing, so I hope they cut me a break.
Anyway, my name, "Battler"...
...well, it\'s pretty damn weird, don\'t you think?
I\'ve got to wonder what my parents were thinking when they gave me that name.
{n}I\'ve never met anyone who could read it right the first time.
I usually get called "{c:86EF9C:Sento‐kun}".
{n}Too bad, swing and a miss.
My name is written {p:0:右代宮 戦人}.
{n}Can you read it?
 The first part is my family name, "Ushiromiya".
 That\'s a fairly plausible Japanese pronunciation so far.
The problem is my own name.
{n}.........{p:0:戦人} is made up of the characters for "fight" and "person", and it\'s pronounced "Battler".
Put it all together, and you\'ve got Ushiromiya Battler.
Pretty crazy, right?
 It\'s crazy enough that my parents decided to call me that, but it\'s even more crazy that some government worker let them make it official.
 ...Both groups are at the top of my must‐kill list.
Anyway, this is one of my cousins.
His name is {p:0:右代宮 譲治}, pronounced Ushiromiya George.
He\'s five years older than me, so he\'s probably turning 23 this year.
{n}Since the Ushiromiya cousins consist of two boys and three girls, I ended up playing with George all the time.
And because I\'ve always thought of him as a big brother, I still call him "Aniki" today.
"Whoo, Battler‐kun, look how big you\'ve gotten.
 You know what they say, "leave a boy for three days and you\'ll hardly recognize him"!"
"It must be in his blood, I suppose.
 Rudolf wasn\'t that tall either until around his high school years.
 Perhaps people end up taller if their growth spurt comes late."
"Nah, it\'s nothing special.
 A real man needs to be tough on the inside too!"
"Exactly!
 Battler‐kun here knows how it works!
 Real men win or lose based on what they\'ve got on the inside!
 Can\'t ever forget to keep up your trainin\' and discipline.
 You do that, wait verrry alertly for the perfect moment...and strike!"
"Now, even I never imagined that I\'d become the company president I am today, master of my own domain...
 Yep, to think I\'ve come this far after starting out penniless and ruined...!"
This portly and slightly chubby man...
is George‐aniki\'s dad, Uncle Hideyoshi ({p:0:秀吉}).
He\'s the husband of Dad\'s older sister.
{n}In other words, we\'re not blood‐related.
He\'s nice to children, sociable all the time, even quick to give out some spending money to us kids—simply put, he\'s an awesome uncle.
He speaks in an odd and very noticeable Kansai‐style dialect seemingly of his own creation, but he\'s actually a natural‐born Kanto man.
Apparently, leaving an impression is everything in the business world,
 so speaking in a different style than other people is an act that makes him stick out more.
......However, I hear that he gets embarrassed when talking within earshot of a real Kansai person, so he switches back to standard Japanese.
...I don\'t really get it, but he\'s definitely an interesting person.
"If only you weren\'t so quick to brag about your life\'s story.
 That\'s enough for now, I think.
 I\'m sure Battler‐kun\'s getting tired of it.
 Aren\'t you?"
"Nope, not at all, hihihi!
 Nothing wrong with that.
 I think it\'s pretty cool for a man to have some stories he can brag about.
 I don\'t have anything like that at all."
"Oh, really?
 I\'d imagine a man with your looks would leave girls crying left and right, so I have trouble believing that you have nothing at all to brag about..."
"Nonononono!
 Y‐y‐
you\'re joking, right?!
 Of course nothing weird like that\'s ever happened to me!
 In fact, if you know anyone, I\'m all ears!"
"Oh, I\'m sure you do have some stories!
 ...*giggle* You must tell your aunt all about it later.
 After all, George never comes to me with anything of the sort.
 Heheheh..."
This is my aunt and George‐aniki\'s mother, Auntie Eva ({p:0:絵羽}).
She\'s my dad\'s older sister.
{n}She and Uncle Hideyoshi are a pair of jokers, and they\'ve always teased me back as far as I can remember.
This sometimes made them a bit hard to get along with when I was small.
{n}...That said, I\'m currently in the process of discovering that they still are hard to get along with.
Even so, George‐aniki\'s family is interesting and fun, and they seem to get along just fine.
......Sheesh, that\'s pretty much the total opposite of my family.
"Battler‐kun,
 have you seen Rudolf‐san?"
"Huh?
 He headed off to the bathroom a while ago.
 Is he {i:still} not back?
 Heh, maybe the poor geezer dropped dead... {c:86EF9C:Namunamunamu}."
"That\'s no way to talk about your own father.
 Still, this isn\'t the first time he\'s taken so long in the bathroom."
"Yeah, the guy\'s always been that way.
 Does he really have to take a magazine with him every time he needs to take a dump?
 Oh, what on Earth might he be doing with those?!
 Ihihi!"
"Oh, you don\'t need to worry about that at all.
 As long as we\'re together, I won\'t be letting him do that on his own."
"Hihihi!
 Oooh, I\'ll have to get the juicy details later!
 Sounds like Dad\'s got his balls in an iron grip."
"You know exactly what would happen with that man if I didn\'t keep a tight grip, don\'t you?"
"Oh, no kidding.
 You\'re the only one capable of reigning in that old bastard.
 As his son, I\'m more than happy to let you take over."
"Yes, leave it all to me.
 After all, that\'s my specialty."
This woman is my dad\'s wife.
Her name is Ushiromiya Kyrie ({p:0:霧江}).
As you can probably tell from our conversation, she\'s not my real mother.
{n}She\'s basically my stepmother.
My real mom died six years ago.
{n}Kyrie‐san is the woman Dad married afterwards.
I mean, I\'m not a kid anymore.
{n}It\'s way too late now for me to start calling his second wife "Mom".
And I doubt she feels like using the word "son" on this massive kid who\'s no relation to her at all.
We aren\'t little kids.
{n}We know there\'s nothing to be gained by fighting.
So, we decided that we wouldn\'t force ourselves to pretend that we were family.
{n}I\'ve decided to act a bit more frank with her, as though she\'s a friendly neighbor instead.
It\'s much easier to just keep a little distance, instead of forcing ourselves to act all close and making each other uncomfortable.
Kyrie‐san has been very open about all this, and thanks to that, we\'ve been able to get along pretty well.
As we were capitalizing on Dad being away in the bathroom to badmouth him,
 the man himself came back, wiping his hands with a handkerchief.
"Hmm?
 Battler."
"Hey, what\'s up, Dad?"
"...Owowowowww!
 Don\'t pinch my ear, gaah!"
"So, you\'ve been talking trash about me with Mom again, haven\'t you?
 What makes it so hard to show a little respect for your father, hmm?"
"Owowow, owowowowow!
 Dammit, that hurts, you old bastard!
 Stretch my ear all you want, I\'m still not gonna be able to fly—owwwww!!"
"C\'mon now.
 Upwards,
 upwards,
 sideways,
 sideways,
 round in a circle,
 back the other way,
 multiplier maxed out,
 with an extra x2 on top!
 Now say "Father, please forgive me for being so rude"."
"Like hell I will, go find yourself some members‐only store if you want it that much!
 Gyaah, let goooo!!"
......This old bastard is my dad.
{n}I think I\'m pretty tall, but Dad\'s about the same height.
It\'s probably no surprise that Auntie Eva started talking about Dad\'s blood when she saw my height.
By the way, my height isn\'t the only thing I got from him.
{n}It seems having weird names runs in the family.
Dad\'s full name is written {p:0:右代宮 留弗夫}.
......Can you read it?
 Not many could, I\'ll tell you that.
{n}That mess of characters is pronounced "Rudolf".
Haha...he must hate Grandfather for giving him that name.
Still, that\'s no reason to pass that weird naming tradition onto me.
As the old bastard twisted my ear all over the place, Auntie Eva snuck up behind him and grabbed his ear.
"Hey, Rudolf?
 Don\'t take your frustrations out on your kid."
"Gyaah, that hurts, Aneki..."
The scene before me was a perfect realization of the trope of the older sister who deals out punishment to her prankster younger brother despite his size.
"I think that\'s good enough for now, Eva nee‐san.
 I\'ll make sure to stretch out his other ear later on."
"Oh, my apologies.
 I must leave some pulling for you to do, Kyrie‐san."
"Rudolf?
 Make sure Kyrie‐san gives you lots and lots of punishment later on, alright?"
"You\'re one to talk, Aneki, bullying your little brother like that."
"Hideyoshi nii‐san, I\'d like to thank you very much for picking her up.
 If you hadn\'t been so generous, she\'d still be unsold in the store.
 You have my gratitude and apologies."
"...Hmm~?!
 Who are you calling "unsold"?"
After taking two or three steps back,
 Auntie Eva unleashed one of her beautiful high reverse roundhouse kicks, which stopped just a centimeter away from the tip of Dad\'s nose.
After starting out with Tai‐chi‐chuan for her figure, Auntie Eva had then developed an interest in the Chinese martial arts.
 After that, she went through karate, taekwondo, capoeira, ...and what is it she\'s learning now, again?
...Well, anyway, they say a woman\'s weapons are in her lower body, and that\'s literally true for Auntie Eva.
"Rudo~lf?
 Did you know that a single direct blow to the side of the head like that would knock you unconscious?
 Not so long ago, I accidentally connected in a practice match, and my opponent was out cold."
"...Sheesh, what a pain.
 Guess I have to apologize for her tendency to lash out with her feet, too."
Dad, completely unfazed, shrugged and smiled ironically at Uncle Hideyoshi.
"Wahahaha, never had a brother or sister myself.
 So, when I see you two bickerin\' with each other, it makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.
 It sure is nice to have a big family and siblings."
"Oh, then why not consider making a little brother for George‐kun?
 He\'s already a fine adult who\'s about to go off on his own, so it might be a good time to have another child."
"Hey, have a little sympathy for the new kid and all the pain and suffering he\'d have to live through.
 I\'m surprised even George‐kun turned out as well as he did after being born from this sinister sister of mine."
"And what an awesome kid he is.
 Please share some of that with our blockhead of a son someday, will you?"
"That\'s not how it worked.
 It\'s thanks to Eva nee‐san\'s proper rearing that George‐kun became the good, gentle kid he is now.
 Isn\'t that right, Nee‐san?"
"Oh, come now...heheh, you think so...?
 Our George still has a long way to go."
"Ah, by the way, how\'s your little Ange‐chan doing?
 I heard she was vomiting?"
"Oh, that\'s right!
 And I was hopin\' to finally see her face after such a long time.
 Is she alright?"
"She often catches a cold when the seasons change.
 She\'s very frail...
 I did want to bring her along, but we decided to have my family look after her this time."
"I think that\'s a wise move.
 She\'ll be on the mend faster if she\'s not exposed to that toxic head house.
 A child\'s health is always more important than an adult\'s convenience, don\'t you think?"
"I know of some great medicine for vomitin\' colds like that!
 When we get back home, I\'ll send it over right away, so be sure to give her some!"
"Thank you very much, Hideyoshi nii‐san.
 I\'m always in your debt..."
...And once the conversation suddenly veered off in that direction, we kids didn\'t have any chance of butting in.
For now, I\'m just happy that Auntie Eva gave Dad his just deserts for tugging on my ear.
"Looks like we\'re still waiting for the weather report."
George‐aniki pointed at the counter.
{n}The "Pending Weather Clearance" sign was still stuck next to the scheduled departure time for the flight we were scheduled to board.
According to Aniki, smaller planes are more subject to winds and other effects of the weather,
 and it\'s not at all uncommon for flights to be delayed because of that.
......Wait a sec, it isn\'t really going to shake...is it...?
From down here on the ground, it just looks cloudy, not windy.
...Well, I guess it\'s different up where the planes fly.
"The weather\'s a bit uncertain today."
Auntie Eva was looking at a TV in the lounge.
{n}The weather forecast was being broadcast, informing us that a typhoon was approaching the Kanto region.
"A typhoon again?
 ......I guess we\'re doomed to these, with the family conference being in October every year.
 Couldn\'t he choose a better season?"
"I agree.
 I\'ve always hoped we could have it sometime around the Obon festival in mid‐August.
 In that case, why don\'t you suggest that to Father and Nii‐san during the conference?"
"...Very funny.
 Why don\'t you do it yourself?
 Our brother would never listen to anything I suggested."
"No way.
 It doesn\'t really bother me that much to have it in October.
 You were the one who complained about the typhoon, so I said "ask them to change it then",
 that\'s all."
"I only said that typhoons always come around this time of year.
 You\'re the one who said you wanted to move it nearer to Obon."
"Well, you said it too last year!
 Didn\'t you say that it would be easier to fit into your schedule if we had it nearer Obon?!"
"I\'ve never said anything like that."
"Oh yes, you did.
 I certainly wouldn\'t forget something like that!"
"No, I didn\'t... You\'re the one saying that all the time!"
"Are you aware?
 Stopping a kick just a hair\'s breadth away is a very high‐level technique."
"Sheesh, women your age should be more proper than that!"
Dad and Auntie Eva\'s argument looks no different from a couple of brats bickering...
"I expect that\'s because, although they normally act as mothers and fathers,
 they turn right back into kids again when they meet their old siblings at these family conferences."
"You\'re the one who looks like a real adult, analyzing it all calmly.
 ......I hope I never turn out like that old bastard.
 I\'d much rather end up as an intellectual adult like you, Aniki."
"Like me?
 Oh, I still have a long way to go.
 I still have very little experience out there in the real world, and I need to work on becoming more bold and sociable.
 ...I think you\'ve far surpassed me on all of those counts, Battler‐kun.
 I\'m sure you\'ll outstrip me fast enough when you become an adult."
George‐aniki scratched his head and laughed, as though trying to hide his embarrassment.
{n}Of course, he was just being humble.
Aniki entered a university and became an apprentice at Uncle Hideyoshi\'s company at the same time, studying both academics and how to become a business emperor in parallel.
Then, right after graduating, he got into Uncle Hideyoshi\'s company as his father\'s aide, piling up a lot of real‐life experience as he devoted himself zealously to his work.
He even has grand dreams, of one day standing on his own and becoming lord of his own domain.
Aniki is a real paragon of a man, sparing no effort as he strives towards his goal.
 It\'s no exaggeration to say that I really respect him.
And then there\'s me.
 I\'m nothing at all like Aniki.
I\'m living my happy‐go‐lucky idle high‐school life to the max.
I\'ve got no dreams for the future!
{n}I\'d like to just sit back, stay cool, and let the money flow in, but of course that could never happen.
...When Aniki was my age, he had already formed an impressive objective and had started devoting himself towards studying for that goal, so I guess I can\'t compare at all.
My dad just says "sure you can study at my company, if you like cleaning toilets".
Dammit, I\'m not gonna be in the debt of that old bastard.
{n}I\'ll find my way myself!
{n}.........I guess that intensity is my one qualification towards adulthood.
Should I go on one of those self‐searching journeys that are all the rage these days?
{n}......Well, it\'s not like I could mooch off my parents for that kind of money...
"......hm?! Ohh~!"
Right then, Uncle Hideyoshi shouted out loudly.
{n}Uncle\'s a really nice person on the whole, but he does have a problem controlling the volume of his voice.
When I looked over, I saw that he was greeting Auntie Rosa, who had come late.
"Ohoooooooooh!!!
 If it isn\'t Rosa‐san!
 Maria‐chan, long time no see!!"
"Long time no seee!
 Uu!"
"Maria!
 Shouldn\'t that be "It\'s good to see you again"?
 Greet your uncle properly."
"Uu.
 It\'s...good to see you again..."
"There you go!
 Well said!
 How about some candy as a reward?!
 ......Oh, huh?
 Where\'d I put \'em..."
"Rosa‐san, it\'s good to see you again.
 It\'s good to see you too, Maria‐chan."
"It\'s been too long, Kyrie nee‐san, Hideyoshi nii‐san."
"...And...
...oh my, Battler‐kun?!
 Look how big you\'ve gotten...!"
"Ah, come on, hahaha...
 It\'s embarrassing hearing that from every person I meet...!"
"Hey, Rosa.
 You\'re late.
 If the plane was on time, you\'d barely have made it..."
"I\'m sorry.
 We had some trouble making our train connection.
 So we\'re waiting on the weather yet again?"
"Oh, don\'t complain.
 I much prefer the thirty‐minute plane trip to spending six hours bouncing about on a boat.
 Even if we\'re kept waiting here for an hour, it\'s still much faster overall."
"Maria‐chan\'s gotten huge too!!
 So, how tall are you now?"
"Uu!
 So, how tall am I now?!"
Maria parroted Uncle Hideyoshi\'s question, looking up at her mother.
I guess she doesn\'t remember her own height.
{n}She\'s probably right in the middle of a growth spurt, so her height must change every month.
In just a few more years, she\'ll probably start looking very feminine.
"Umm, ...how tall were you the last time you got measured...?
 She just keeps getting bigger and bigger.
 Don\'t you?"
"Uu!"
"I think she\'s grown a lot since last year.
 Let\'s see, she turned nine years old this year, didn\'t she?"
"Nine years old.
 Uu."
"That\'s right, you\'re nine years old now.
 Glad to see you\'re doing well too, Maria‐chan!"
"Up you...
...nng...
 I guess you\'ve gotten a bit too heavy to play airplane with..."
"George‐aniki, what a rude thing to say to a lady.
 Here, I\'ll do it... Up ya go~..."
"......Uu."
When I went to lift her up in Aniki\'s place, Maria stiffened defensively, staring suspiciously at my face.
...Ah, that\'s right.
 The last time I met Maria, it was six years ago, and she was only three years old.
Of course she doesn\'t remember my face.
"Maria‐chan, don\'t you remember?
 It\'s Battler‐kun.
 You used to play together, remember?"
".........Uu."
"I doubt you\'ll have any luck.
 The last time she met Battler, she was only three.
 You don\'t keep memories at that age."
She must know everyone\'s face apart from mine because she meets them every year, but I haven\'t had contact with the Ushiromiya family for about six years now.
So, it\'s no surprise that this nine‐year‐old girl doesn\'t have any memories of me.
Even I can only just barely remember her being a three‐year‐old crybaby.
"Maria.
 This is Battler onii‐chan.
 Uncle Rudolf\'s son.
 ...Understand?"
"............Uncle\'s son is...
 Uncle\'s the son...
 ............??
 ......Uuuu!!"
That "uu" was probably the sound of her brain breaking, unable to understand the complicated explanation.
I guess it was a bit too confusing for her.
"Maria‐chan.
 This is Battler‐kun.
 He\'s your cousin, like me."
"......Like George onii‐chan?
 ...........................Battler?
 Cousin?
 ......Uu."
"That\'s right.
 You got it."
This part of Aniki is what makes me really look up to him.
For someone who isn\'t married, he\'s just great at dealing with kids.
{n}I\'m sure that he\'ll be an indulgent father in the future.
"...Battler onii‐chan?"
Maria looked straight at me with a questioning expression, as though asking whether it was alright to call me that.
"Yep, that\'s me, Battler.
 Nice to meet you, Maria!"
"Uu!
 Battler!"
"Maria!
 You mustn\'t address him without honorifics—call him Battler onii‐chan...!"
"It\'s cool, Auntie Rosa.
 I don\'t sweat the small stuff.
 Right, Maria?!
 We\'re buddies on a first‐name basis, us two, aren\'t we?!"
"Battler, Battler, Battleeerrr!
 Uu‐uu!"
"That\'s right, Maria, Maria, Mariaaa!
 Uu‐uu!!"
We horsed around for a while to make up for the six‐year gap in our friendship.
She probably still thinks of me as nothing more than a big new friend, but things\'ll probably work out as we get to know each other again.
But I\'m surprised.
 She\'s just the way I remembered her being six years ago.
Seems that people just don\'t change that much after all.
{n}I\'m a bit happy that she\'s still the pure, innocent girl I remember.
Her name is written {p:0:真里亞}.
{n}...That one\'s not so difficult to read.
 Of course, it says "Maria".
{n}The third character looks like a cross, which is pretty cool.
Her feelings don\'t usually show up on her face, so it can be difficult to know just what she\'s thinking, but that\'s just how she looks on the outside.
{n}On the inside, she\'s just a sweet, normal girl.
Then there\'s Maria\'s mother, Auntie Rosa.
{n}She\'s my dad\'s younger sister.
Rosa is written {p:0:楼座}.
 ...Here\'s a name that\'s totally not Japanese.
Sorry to say it, but her name\'s almost as ridiculous as Dad\'s...
 I\'ve got to respect her for not ending up as screwed up as he is.
...When I think about it, all the names in my family sound foreign.
{n}Just why is Grandfather so obsessed with this?
Because of him, even us grandchildren have to put up with this weird naming sense.
{n}It\'s even more annoying since Grandfather\'s own name is perfectly normal.
Anyway, there\'s one thing about Auntie Rosa that\'s a relief compared to the other family members.
The old bastard and Auntie Eva have this annoying urge to tease and mock people all the time,
 but even though she shares their blood, Auntie Rosa isn\'t like that at all.
She has the most common sense among all the siblings.
Like Uncle Hideyoshi, she\'s a kind aunt who\'ll always be on the kids\' side.
......However, possibly because she\'s more strict as a parent, she\'s not liberal with handing out spending money like Uncle Hideyoshi is.
Alright.
 Now we have the entire group of family members who are going to board the plane.
As though it had waited for us all to gather, an announcement rang out through the lobby.
"Our apologies for the wait.
 Boarding will now commence for flight 201 to Niijima.
 We ask that the passengers please form two lines in front of the counter, behind the white line."
"Rosa, you still haven\'t gone through boarding procedures, right? Hurry up."
"Oh no...!
 Maria, come on!"
"Uu!"
We had to go through a metal detector before going out on the runway.
Our small plane wasn\'t as massive as an international flight, but it was still a plane.
 A staff member holding a metal detector checked us all.
Once all of us cleared the check, we followed the staff member out onto the runway.
Come to think of it, everyone here is in the Ushiromiya family.
It\'s like this is a reserved charter flight or something.
Our group stopped in front of the entrance to the airplane.
{n}Then, our guide turned around and spoke, looking down at the passenger list as she did.
"Boarding will now commence.
 As I call out the names on the passenger list,
 please take your seats in order, starting from the front row on the right side and going right to left, then onto the next row.
 I will now begin reading the passenger list.
 Ushiromiya Hideyoshi‐sama!"
"Oh, I\'m first!
 Right here!
 ...By the way, do you have the candies, Eva?
 I\'ve been lookin\' all over for \'em, but I can\'t find \'em."
"Ushiromiya Eva‐sama."
"They\'re in my handbag.
 I\'ll get them once we\'re inside the plane."
I\'ve heard that candies are a good way to protect your ears from hurting due to variations in atmospheric pressure when landing or taking off.
 That\'s probably what they\'re talking about.
"...Hope I get a window seat!"
"Hahaha, don\'t worry.
 There aren\'t any other kinds of seats."
According to George‐aniki, there are apparently only two lines of seats.
Yep, it\'s a small plane alright...
 .........It isn\'t really going to shake...is it...?
"Ushiromiya George‐sama."
"Right here.
 Don\'t worry, Battler‐kun.
 It won\'t shake too much."
"Ushiromiya Battler‐sama."
"A‐Aniki, how much is "not too much"?!
 You can just swim if you fall from a boat, but if a plane crashes you\'re screwed, right?!
 We all get our own parachutes in our seats, don\'t we?
 Wait, we don\'t?!"
"Ushiromiya Rudolf‐sama."
"Come on, Battler, quit being a wuss and get in."
"Ow! Dad!
 Don\'t push me!
 We don\'t get parachutes!"
"Ushiromiya Kyrie‐sama."
"Alright, stop fooling around.
 Let\'s move along."
"Ow! Kyrie!
 Don\'t push me!
 This blockhead isn\'t moving forward!"
"Ushiromiya Maria‐sama."
"Uu!
 Forward, forward!"
"Ushiromiya Rosa‐sama."
"Maria!
 Keep quiet..."
"This is your pilot, Kawabata.
 We\'d like to thank you for taking New Tokyo Aviation\'s flight 201 today.
 We estimate that the flight to Niijima Airport will take about twenty minutes."
"We are receiving reports of atmospheric turbulence.
 There might be some shaking of the aircraft, so we ask that you do not unfasten your seat belts after takeoff."
"A‐Aniki, did that guy just say we needed to wear seatbelts?!
 In a jumbo jet, they let you undo them after takeoff!
 So it\'s gonna shake so much we can\'t take them off?!"
"Dammit, you tricked me, it is going to shake after all!
 Where are the parachutes?!
 I knew I should\'ve taken the boooooaaaaat!!"".........Should\'ve taken the boat...
......the boat......"
"Gonna faaalll!
 Gonna faaalll!
 Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!"
"Maria, that\'s enough!"
"......But what a surprise.
 I thought there was nothing that could scare Battler‐kun."
"This guy can\'t handle vehicles for some reason.
 Always yells about falling and sinking and stuff.
 You\'re a disgrace of a man, you are."
"......Urgh, shut up.
 That thing was seriously shaking way too much...
 I just got a little stressed, since it was my first time on a small plane like that..."
"You call that "a little stressed"?
 Heheheh, sounds like it\'d be fun to take an overseas vacation with you, Battler‐kun.
 Would you like to go to Egypt with your aunt?
 You\'d get to ride a plane for a full 14 hours!"
"Ahhahaha!
 There\'s a good plan.
 Battler‐kun, you should go let Eva nee‐san toughen you up some.
 But boy were you hilarious!
 Ahhahahaha!"
"Wahhahaha, now, now. Everyone\'s got their own strong and weak points.
 It\'s bad to laugh at \'em.
 Wahhahaha...!"
"D‐Dad, you\'re laughing too.
 Hey, Maria‐chan, you shouldn\'t laugh anymore."
"Shouldn\'t laugh anymore?
 Uu!"
Gyah, dammit!
 Is being scared of planes really such a big deal?
{n}Everyone obviously thinks I\'m a big oaf now...
 Tch!
We split up and took separate taxis from the airport to the harbor.
{n}From there on, we would be taking a boat to the island.
The islands are right next to each other, so it\'s not that far.
{n}It would be a leisurely thirty minutes by boat.
As we arrived at the pier where the boat to the island was anchored, we saw a silhouette waving its hand.
"George nii‐saaan!
 It\'s been so frickin\' long!!"
"Ah, Jessica‐chan, it\'s been a year since I saw you!
 You\'ve gotten taller again, haven\'t you?"
"Kyahaha, don\'t gimme that, it\'s embarrassing hearing that every year!"
"......H‐hey, Aniki, you\'ve gotta be kidding me.
 That\'s really Jessica?!"
"Wait a sec, George nii‐san...
 This massive beast...
is Battler?!"
We both stared each other down.
...She definitely didn\'t look this grown‐up in my memories, but I do remember her {c:86EF9C:crazy way of talking}.
"Yo, Jessica!
 What\'s this now!
 You\'re kidding me, you look like a woman now!
 What\'re these, boobs? Even you managed to get a chest!
 Ihihi, let me rub \'em, let me~!"
"Hey, screw you, I\'m a blushing flower of 18!
 Just like hair grows out, so\'ll other stuff!
 You think I got boobs just so you can go and rub \'em, loser?!
 And what about you, got anything to back up that ridiculous size?!
 Did you remember to grow any actual muscle?!"
"You\'d better believe it, I\'ll show you how much training I\'ve piled up since back then!!"
"Oh, cram it!!
 I\'ll beat you at your own game!"
This headstrong girl\'s name is Ushiromiya {p:0:朱志香}.
......She was born under the same unlucky star as me, sharing the same kind of weird name.
 You see, {p:0:朱志香} is pronounced "Jessica".
She\'s Dad\'s older brother\'s daughter.
That older brother happens to be the eldest son of the Ushiromiya family, so I guess that also technically makes Jessica a direct heir to the Ushiromiya family.
Since Jessica and I are the same age and had that type of boy‐girl rivalry between us,
 we\'ve always been used to fighting and joking around together whenever the relatives gathered.
Jessica grew more quickly, so she always had me beat in terms of size and physical strength.
So, when we scuffled as a contest of strength like this, it usually went Jessica\'s way.
So even though I clearly understand that I\'m bigger now, I still feel like I can\'t win against Jessica with my strength.
"Hnng! Ghhh......!!"
"............Woh...ah...!
 What the...what\'re you...getting all serious for...?!
 Owowow..."
"Hey hey hey, this is nothin\'!
 Jessica, you\'ve gotten weak."
"Sh‐shut up.
 I\'m a woman over here, believe it or not.
 No way I was always gonna be stronger than a man!"
"We~ll, that\'s certainly true!
 The meat I put on my arms all went to your chest, after a~ll.
 It looks like it\'d be a pretty even test of strength between my arms and your boobs, don\'t you thi~nk?!"
"I told you, my boobs aren\'t for you to feel up!!
 Besides, how \'bout you—your height says you\'re an adult, but what about your other places, huh?!"
"Stop it, idiot, nooo, I\'ll be ruuuuined for marriage, don\'t touch me in strange placeees!!"
"D‐don\'t say stuff people are gonna misinterpret!!"
Honestly, I was so surprised at how feminine Jessica had become that I had to seriously horse around to hide it.
......Well yeah, considering what a bossy brat she was six years ago, anyone would be surprised.
And I guess she\'s just as surprised.
{n}She definitely wasn\'t expecting she\'d lose to me in a test of strength.
After losing that easily, she must be shocked at how much I\'ve grown in the past six years.
.........Six years.
 Once again, I\'m being shown just what a huge gap of time that was.
"Crap...total defeat.
 It\'s like I\'m no match for you anymore."
"That\'s not true.
 Even Battler‐kun must have his weaknesses.
 Right, Maria‐chan?"
"Uu!
 Gonna faaall gonna faaall!!"
"Ghhk—Don\'t—Maria~, let\'s keep that a secret, okay?"
"Faaall?
 What the hell\'s that?"
"Heheh!
 Sorry, but you won\'t be seeing that weakness of mine now!
 After all, the nightmare plane trip is already over and done with!
 Only thing left is the nice, quiet splashing of the boat trip.
 I never thought I\'d become so fond of that piece‐a‐junk boat.
 Ihihihi!"
"Huh???
 George nii‐san, is there something wrong with his head?"
"You\'ll understand soon.
 Very soon."
At the time, I didn\'t understand what Aniki meant by that big smile...
"What have we here......oooh!
 Battler‐san, how big you\'ve grown...!"
Who\'s it this time?
 It\'s an old lady with an apron.
{n}.........Oh, oh yeah, that takes me back...I remember now!
"Remember her, Battler‐kun?
 You remember—she\'s Kumasawa‐san, one of the servants."
"I could never forget Kumasawa baa‐chan!
 I mean, you haven\'t aged a bit in these past six years.
 Wait, you haven\'t gotten younger, have you~?"
"Hoh‐hoh‐ho!
 Lately, my skin has been getting all smooth and silky!
 And look, hasn\'t my chest gotten even bigger as well?
 ...Want to give it a rub?"
"V‐very funny!
 My breast rubbing is strictly limited to bouncy girls!"
"Even I had some bouncy ones in my youth, you know~?
 Now, now, please feel free to have a go!"
"Gyah, gimme a break!
 It\'s chicks I\'m looking for, dammit!
 Not grannies!"
The jokes I\'d cracked about Jessica were being used against me.
 Come to think of it, she always was the type to tease people!
"Kumasawa‐san, stop that now.
 People with one foot in the coffin shouldn\'t jump around."
"To sport with the young is the best rejuvenation medicine.
 Hoh‐hoh‐ho!"
"It\'s rare for you to come pick us up, Kumasawa‐san.
 What curious turn of events is this?
 Normally whenever you\'re entrusted with something to do, your lumbago always kicks in.
 *snicker*."
"Hoh‐hoh‐ho, Eva‐sama, you are harsh as usual.
 I found myself with some urgent purchases to make, and while I was at it, I thought I would come welcome you all.
 Although, it does give a bad impression if the one waiting to greet you is a decrepit old woman.
 Hoh‐hoh‐ho...!"
Auntie Eva spoke sarcastically, but Kumasawa baa‐chan\'s years of experience were nothing to sneeze at.
 She was more than capable of smoothly and coolly letting that comment slide.
Well, I\'d rather not say it, but old Kumasawa baa‐chan may be past her prime as a servant.
She might act as though she\'s in good health, but between her headaches and the lumbago, her body is wearing out.
 To tell the truth, the very fact that she\'s still working is impressive.
...How old is she this year again?
{n}She must be pushing eighty by now.
{n}It\'s incredible that she\'s still able to act so brightly.
"You just seem to get more and more lively.
 Oh, that\'s right, here you are.
 It\'s the tea I was talking about before.
 Look, I bought some.
 Please do try it later on."
Auntie Rosa showed her the souvenir bag she\'d taken out of her suitcase.
To think that she had remembered the promise that she had apparently made last year and faithfully bought it.
 ...This sort of thoughtfulness was just like Auntie Rosa.
She wasn\'t the kind of person who would forget or break a promise.
As for Kumasama baa‐chan, she seemed deeply touched by the fact that not only had Auntie Rosa remembered that year‐old promise, she had brought that gift for a simple servant like her.
This woman is Kumasawa Chiyo‐san ({p:0:熊沢 チヨ}).
She\'s a senior servant who\'s been working for the Ushiromiya head house for many years.
{n}As you could expect from someone her age, she isn\'t that good at manual labor, but from kitchen work to cleaning and laundry, she\'s a kind of super servant who can handle just about anything.
It seems like her only flaw is a tendency to slack off.
I hear she tries to get away from heavy or troublesome work by playing up her chronic diseases.
......In Kumasawa baa‐chan\'s case, maybe we should call that a sort of lazy craftiness.
...Though it probably doesn\'t impress those paying her salary.
Ah well, even if she\'s pretty flaky when it comes to work, I could never dislike her.
I guess that\'s probably because of her cheerfulness and her constant smile.
"Hey, glad to see you\'re still in fine spirits!
 How\'s your back doin\' then?"
"Even with the medicine, it\'s not getting one whit better.
 According to the doctor, nothing can be done for this one.
 It\'s what\'s called an incurable disease, hoh‐hoh‐ho!"
"Blows me away how you\'ve just kept getting prettier, Jessica‐chan.
 Be glad you ended up like Natsuhi nee‐san."
"R‐really...?
 Personally, I don\'t think I look like her at all...
 I mean, I don\'t even want to be like my parents.
 \'Cause I got zero respect for \'em."
"Now, you shouldn\'t say such things.
 *giggle*, it\'s amazing how many people don\'t want to be like their parents in our family."
"Ah, that\'s me!"
"Hell no, don\'t you dare start taking after me.
 Your nose looking like mine already pisses me off."
"What are you talking about?
 It\'s ridiculous how completely alike you are—and like your father."
"Come on, you can\'t be serious...
 Just how am I like Dad?"
"You\'re his copy in arrogance and self‐importance.
 Father\'s blood is especially strong in you and Nii‐san.
 Wouldn\'t you say, Rosa?"
"Oh, absolutely.
 Krauss nii‐san and Rudolf nii‐san are almost unbelievably like Dad."
"Alright, alright already, why am I the only one under fire from the girls?
 Hideyoshi nii‐san, please help me out."
"My my, Rudolf‐kun, you\'re always so popular with the ladies.
 I\'m jealous!
 Wahahahaha!"
"Hoh‐hoh‐ho!
 As usual, you\'re popular enough to make me jealous.
 Well then, everyone, shall we head over to the boat?
 Come now, Maria‐san, let\'s get on the boat together, alright?"
"Get on the boat together.
 Uu!
 Everyone gets on together.
 Uu!"
"Hell yeah, this time around I\'m not gonna be scared.
 I\'m used to being shaken by the waves.
 With that piece‐a‐junk fishing boat, I\'m less afraid of the shaking than the engine breaking down and the boat drifting off."
"Oh yes, Battler‐kun, I forgot to tell you.
 ...That fishing boat was completely decrepit, so it was taken out of use a few years back.
 Now we get taken to the island in another boat."
"Ohhh, right.
 It\'s Battler\'s first time in the new boat!
 It\'s super comfy!
 And frickin\' fast!
 It can go at crazy high speeds!"
"Ohhh...
 That means less trip time, right?
 That sounds great!
 I mean, a boat might be better than an airplane, but if you\'re telling me we can spend even a little less time exposed to the danger of sinking, that\'s really just awesomely great~."
"...Uu.
 Is Battler gonna faaall gonna faaall again?"
"That\'s only on airplanes.
 Everything\'s fine now!"
"You know, it\'s apparently a modded high‐speed boat, the captain\'s pride and joy!
 Seems he\'s tinkered with it quite a lot—
he was going on about how he attached four high efficiency propellers to it, and now it can break 40 knots, or something like that.
 He bragged to me so much I ended up memorizing it."
"Me too; I remember since we\'re told about it every year.
 The captain said that since he lost a speed contest with a foreign fishing boat a long time ago, he became obsessed with modding.
 He told us how his opponent back then could go at over 30 knots, even though it was only in a fishing boat."
"To fulfill his thirst for a revenge match, he created an awesome whole new super high‐speed modded boat.
 I\'m sure you\'ll just love it, Battler."
...S‐super high‐speed modded boat...?
......My first thought was that this would be much better than some beat‐up boat that might sink at any time......
but for some reason, I\'m getting this feeling of foreboding...
 ......Nah.
"Hey, Battler, maybe you should just swim to the island."
"Battler‐kun, you shouldn\'t lean over the railing too much.
 You might fall."
"Uu‐uu!!
 Gonna faaall gonna faaall!!"
"Daaaaammiiiiit...so this is why you were all grinning before!"
The super high‐speed boat, said to have been modded to hell and back by its captain as a personal hobby, was definitely nothing like the battered old fishing boat from six years ago.
"Whooooooooa, it\'s shaking it\'s shaking it\'s shaking!!
 I\'m gonna fall gonna fall gonna fall!!"
"Uu‐uu‐uu!!
 Gonna fall gonna fall gonna fall!!"
"If I fall I\'ll be in the sea, I\'ll drown goddammit—where\'s the parachute—no, wait—where\'s the buoy?!
 Gimme a life jackeeeet!!"
"Waah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐ha!
 What the hell, Battler, what\'s that supposed to be...waah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐ha!"
"Jessica‐chan, Maria‐chan, it\'s not nice to tease.
 Battler‐kun, if you\'re scared, then just don\'t come out on the deck.
 I think that if you stay inside the boat, you\'ll be a bit less afraid."
"Heheh, that\'s a no‐thank‐you, Aniki!
 Shipwreck victims are always the ones inside the boat.
 The survivors are usually those on the deck during the accident.
 So I\'m staying right here!!"
"But, it\'s shakiiiiing!!
 I\'m falliiing!!
 Whooooaaaaaahhh!!"
"Shaking falliing!!
 Uu‐uu‐uu!!"
"Maria, I told you to behave yourself!
 ......But Battler‐kun, it looks like you really can\'t handle it...
 I\'ll go tell the captain to slow down for you."
"Whooooa, Auntie Rosa, thank yooooouuuuu!
 Even on the sea, exercise safe driving, reduce speeds, point and caaaall!!"
"*cackle*!
 Don\'t do that, Rosa.
 Ordeals are necessary for the young.
 Right, Battler‐kun?
 You can conquer this much, no problem at all, right?
 Otherwise, you won\'t be able to go to Egypt with your aunt!"
"Whooooa, Auntie Eva, you\'re meeeeeeeeaaaan!
 Ooh noooo, I\'m gonna faaaaaall!!
 Life jackeeeet, parachuuuute!!
 Whoooooooaaaaaaahh......!!!"
"N‐no, okay, turn it over and think that way!!
 What\'s the enemy aiming for?!
 He wants to make me afraid like this?!
 If that\'s what he\'s aiming for, too bad, like hell I\'ll be scaaaaaaaared!!
 But stooopp iiit, I\'m gonna faaaaaaall!!!"
...So, after I made a huge fool of myself for a while,
 Auntie Rosa had a talk with the boat captain, and he slowed down to a more manageable speed for me...
"............Hahh...
 This speed is a bit better...
 .........Earlier, I didn\'t even feel alive......"
The new speed, which I was capable of tolerating, was apparently extremely slow.
...But that just now was completely insane...
The whole boat was shaking!
{n}Sliding and leaping on the ocean\'s surface!
{n}It felt like I was riding on the back of a flying fish...
Jessica was still guffawing at me as I leaned against the railing, tired and disheartened.
"I lost in that strength contest earlier, but I\'m glad to know I\'ve got the edge where it really counts.
 But seriously, pfffahahahahah!"
"Dammit...go ahead and laugh.
 One of these days, I\'m gonna find your weakness and I\'ll get back at you...and then your boobs will be mine to squish......"
"Ahahaha, well, we\'ll see about that if you ever do find it, okay?!
 Waah‐hah‐hah‐ha!"
"Uu.
 Battler, all worn out."
"Yeah, Battler, all worn out...
 I want to die on land, not in the ocean or the sky..."
Maria was patting my back, so I patted her head in return.
...Her expression was blank, as usual, but I realized that she wanted to console me.
"Battler‐kun, the captain is throwing in drinks to make up for this.
 Have a drink and take a break, why don\'t you?
 To calm yourself down."
George‐aniki and Kumasawa baa‐chan brought us each an ice‐cold drink with drops of moisture on the can.
Judging from Kumasawa‐san\'s big grin, our parents inside the boat were probably all rolling around laughing at my moment of pure terror.
Dammit, I\'m so embarrassed that I can\'t bear to face any of them...
If I didn\'t change the subject somehow, I had the feeling I\'d be the butt of everyone\'s jokes for the whole trip, so I tried to think of something harmless to talk about.
"...Hey, Jessica.
 How are Uncle Krauss and Aunt Natsuhi doing?"
"My old man and my mom?
 Unfortunately, they\'re fine.
 Though every other word out of their mouths is "study, study", which pisses me off.
 I\'m so jealous, \'cause it doesn\'t look like Uncle Hideyoshi or Uncle Rudolf say those kinds of things."
"Hahaha, oh no.
 When I was slacking off during exams, I was always getting told "exams, exams".
 I thought it was annoying, but now I\'m grateful."
"Hah, I knew it, George‐aniki is magnanimous as ever...
 As for me, I have to look after myself.
 No one says a thing to me!
 Well, it\'s not like I\'d listen if they did, hihihi!"
"Battler‐san, have you still not returned to your birth home?"
"...Well, I kinda go back now and then.
 I still have lots of clothes and stuff left at the previous house."
"......Uu?
 Battler has two homes?"
"Uh,
 .........hmmm.
 ......Something like that."
"Why?
 Why do you have two homes?
 Uu?
 Uu?"
Only Maria, who couldn\'t really grasp the situation, voiced her naive question.
However, the others just shot nervous glances at me, choosing not to respond even though they knew the answer.
"Maria!
 Look, you can see the harbor now...!
 Look, over there!
 Can you see it?!"
"Uu!
 Saw the harbor, saw the harbor!"
Apparently, Jessica was trying to be nice by changing the subject.
......Ah, well.
 I\'d rather not talk about it if I can help it, but it\'s uncomfortable to have it treated like some kind of weird taboo.
......I don\'t mind that much myself anymore.
I am an Ushiromiya,
 but the truth is that, for the past six years, I\'ve been living with my grandparents on my late mother\'s side, and I\'ve even been using her family name.
When those grandparents passed away one after the other, I\'d basically had no choice except to go back and live with the old bastard.
Don\'t get me wrong. I didn\'t just run away from home or anything like that.
{n}The only one at fault here is my dad.
......I don\'t really blame Kyrie‐san.
{n}Being able to hold that old bastard\'s reins and ride him out is no mean feat.
...But as for the betrayal that the old bastard inflicted on my mom...
 ......Well, unfortunately, I still haven\'t fully gotten over that.
"*ahem*.
 We\'ll be getting there soon."
George‐aniki cleared his throat, trying to change the topic.
"......Please forgive my indiscretion.
 It seems this old woman has said too much already.
 If I have hurt your feelings—"
"Heheh!
 I don\'t mind it and no one\'s feelings are hurt.
 Don\'t worry, Kumasawa baa‐chan."
Kumasawa‐san seemed to regret speaking out of turn,
 but I was more concerned about being worried over for something like that, so I stood up and passed it off lightly.
After that, I had a sip of my drink and headed over to Maria and Jessica, who were gazing at the silhouette of the island.
"Uu!
 Battler, saw the island, saw the island!
 There there there!
 Uu‐uu‐uu!"
"Where is it...oh, I see it now.
 Even after six years, the island hasn\'t changed a bit."
The small island\'s silhouette in front of us had gotten pretty close.
This island\'s name is Rokkenjima.
{n}It\'s a small island about ten kilometers around, located in the Izu Archipelago.
Since they call this archipelago "the Izu Seven", lots of people think there are seven islands, but that\'s not true.
There are actually more than seven.
{n}Rokkenjima is one of the minor islands that don\'t get counted.
Even considering that, there are probably very few people who know about this island.
After all, only the people of the Ushiromiya family come to this island.
In other words, it has no ties whatsoever to outsiders or tourists.
{n}So, you\'ll never find this island\'s name in a travel brochure.
This is because all of Rokkenjima is an estate possessed by the Ushiromiya head house.
Only the Ushiromiya family lives there, and only people connected to the Ushiromiya family come and go there.
There\'s nothing there except a harbor and a mansion.
{n}The vast majority of the island is still just uncultivated forest.
Such a waste, when it could be made into a nice golf course.
{n}However, when you realize that the entire coastline is a private beach, it starts to sound pretty magnificent.
You might have realized it by now, but to put it simply,
 ......well, the Ushiromiya family is just rolling in dough.
The fortune possessed by the head house is apparently vast,
 and Dad and the others who make up the branch families have built up plenty of wealth for themselves, finding success in their respective businesses.
I\'ve been living a commoner\'s life at my grandparents\' home these six years, so I\'d completely forgotten,
 ...but the old bastard\'s house really is elegant, and everything about it is tuned to match the snobbish tastes of the annoyingly rich.
Come to think of it, I guess that means George‐aniki, Jessica, Maria, and I are all wealthy, high‐class gentlemen and ladies.
Needless to say, none of us feel that way at all.
I don\'t see myself as being rich, and George‐aniki, who takes self‐discipline very seriously, doesn\'t let himself get too comfortable.
Jessica is always complaining that she\'d rather move to the city than be rich,
 and Maria is still a kid who isn\'t even interested in money at all.
...I guess that attitude itself is snobbish.
{n}From the perspective of people in poverty who can\'t pay the bills, we\'re very lucky to even have the luxury of thinking this way.
This isn\'t the place to explain any further, so I won\'t.
Anyway, it\'s the same as not being able to choose the parents you\'re born from.
{n}I didn\'t ask to be born into a rich family.
{n}And I don\'t think it\'s something I should be hated for.
It can be pretty trying when people are prejudiced against you just because you\'re rich and refuse to judge you by your merits...
As I pondered these sentimental thoughts, Maria leaned over the railing and started shouting.
"............Uu.
 ......Gone."
"What\'s wrong, Maria?
 Did you drop something?"
"Uu‐uu!
 Gone, gone!
 Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!"
Maria kept yelling "gone, gone".
From her words alone, you would think she had perhaps dropped something, but she was actually pointing out over the ocean as she shouted.
"What\'s wrong?
 What\'s gone?
 I\'ll look for it too, if you want.
 What is it?
 ...............?"
If she\'d dropped something, she would probably have looked down at the floor, but Maria was pointing out over the ocean.
One would assume that she had seen something out over the ocean, but she kept saying that something was {i:gone}.
 .........Strange.
However, since my last memories of this place came from six years ago, I was able to spot it before Aniki, who comes here every year.
"............Huh...?
 ......If I remember correctly, wasn\'t there a {c:86EF9C:torii} or something on top of a small crag around here?
 ...That\'s right, it was definitely there.
 I remember it well, since it\'s like a landmark, the first thing to greet you as you get closer to the island."
"Wow, you\'re amazing, Battler.
 Even though it\'s been six years, you remembered."
"It was here, wasn\'t it...!
 I remember too.
 There used to be a shrine and a torii‐like thing standing all alone on that crag.
 ......And now that you mention it, they are gone, aren\'t they.
 They definitely were there last year, I think."
"Gone.
 Gone.
 Uu‐uu‐uu!"
"Maybe they were washed away by the waves or something?
 It was a small crag, it probably got brittle because of its exposure."
"I think so too.
 It actually disappeared during the summer.
 Apparently—"
"A huge lightning bolt fell one evening and smashed the shrine, or some such...
 ......The fishermen whisper that it must undoubtedly be an ominous sign, to have a thunderbolt fall upon our tutelary god.
 ...Lightning begone, lightning begone..."
Kumasawa‐san smiled impishly as if teasing us, rubbing her hands together.
However, Maria was apparently taking it seriously,
 and she stared fixedly over the ocean to where the crag enshrining the local guardian deity was supposed to be.
"............An ominous...sign.
 ............Uu."
"Enough, Kumasawa‐san.
 Maria isn\'t old enough to understand this kind of joke."
"It\'s alright, Maria‐chan.
 It\'s just a coincidence.
 Nothing scary\'s gonna happen."
George‐aniki put a hand on Maria\'s shoulder to calm her down, but Maria\'s sharp‐eyed expression didn\'t budge.
"............Ominous.
 ............Ominous."
Maria muttered that word over and over.
{n}Apparently, repeating a single word over and over is a habit that Maria\'s had for a long time.
However, since the word she was saying was quite literally ominous, it was a bit creepy.
"Hey now, Maria.
 Some disaster really will come if you say that word over and over, you know?"
I tapped Maria\'s other shoulder.
And then, Maria whipped her head around, stared into my face, and spoke unblinkingly.
"Uu.
 .........Disaster...coming."
"Huh?
 And just where is it coming from?"
I answered light‐heartedly, trying to break the tension in the air.
...And in reply, Maria held up a finger, raised her arm high, ...and pointed up to the heavens.
When I looked up, I saw that the sky was still just as cloudy, but it had grown a great deal more leaden than it had been that morning.
That\'s right—they were saying that a typhoon was approaching.
...We had planned to spend one night on the island, but if this storm doesn\'t pass quickly, I won\'t be able to make it to school on Monday.
{n}Well, I guess it makes for a pretty good excuse to be absent.
".....................Uu..."
...She apparently sensed something ominous in this cloudy sky.
{n}She\'s been muttering for a while now.
Girls at Maria\'s age tend to be very impressionable.
{n}She\'s just about the age when many girls start to get excited about sixth senses and whether they have any psychic potential and stuff.
...In a way, being sensitive about things like this isn\'t really out of the ordinary for a kid like her.
"It\'s alright, Maria‐chan.
 The weather might get worse around tonight, but tomorrow it\'ll clear up and become a pretty blue sky."
"Uu.
 Pretty blue sky.........
 .........Uu..."
"That\'s right, by tomorrow it\'ll be a pretty blue sky.
 There\'s no rain that doesn\'t end, and no clouds that never clear."
"Uu...
 .........Rain that doesn\'t end.
 ...Clouds that never clear.
 ..................Uu........."
"Sure, the typhoon\'s coming, but it\'ll be gone before you know it!
 It\'s alright, Maria."
"...............Uu.
 ...Uu!!
 Uu‐uu‐uu!!
 Uu‐uu‐uu!!"
Maria started yelling "uu‐uu".
{n}...It looked as though she was having a tantrum because no one could understand what she was trying to say.
What in the world is Maria trying so desperately to warn us about?
Unable to understand her, we could do nothing but feel a vague sense of foreboding...
......I\'ve heard that everyone can feel the supernatural, but that it weakens as you age.
That might mean that Maria, the youngest one of us all, still possessed some kind of sense that the rest of us had lost.
...I wonder if that sense is sending her a warning.
At that moment, Kumasawa‐san quietly opened her mouth.
".........Rumor has it...
that long ago, Rokkenjima was—"
"Kumasawa‐san.
 Let\'s not talk about that now."
Just as Kumasawa‐san was about to tell some kind of story, Jessica sharply interrupted her.
For Jessica, this was an extremely firm reaction.
I wanted to push her further, just out of simple curiosity,
 but judging by how Jessica was acting, it wasn\'t difficult to imagine that it would simply inflame Maria\'s unease further.
...If I did try to press her for the story, the odds were pretty good that it wouldn\'t be anything bright and cheery.
"......Hoh‐hoh‐ho, I do apologize about that...
 ...The wind here is hard to bear for the elderly, so if you would excuse me for now..."
Gossipers have no reason to hang around after they\'ve been told to stop chatting.
When Kumasawa‐san finally realized that she\'d overstepped her bounds, she went back inside the boat.
After she left, Uncle Hideyoshi came along to replace her.
Since he\'d shown up partway through, he completely failed to notice the complicated atmosphere that hung about the scene,
 so he refreshingly and unwittingly swept that atmosphere aside.
So, in the end, it was his unwittingness that brightened the mood.
"Looks like we\'re almost there!
 Alright, just a little more!
 Took forever at the speed we went today, didn\'t it?
 You all know whose fault that is!
 Wahhahahahaha!"
"Aww, Uncle Hideyoshi, gimme a break already~...hahaha~!"
"Ahaha, keep on twisting the knife.
 Seriously, \'cause of Battler, it\'s takin\' fore~ver!"
".........Uu."
Maria had probably come to the conclusion that no one was going to listen to her.
She hung her head, wearing a fretful face.
As she did, George‐aniki crouched down to meet her eyes and spoke to her kindly.
"Maria‐chan.
 There\'s nothing to be afraid of.
 Because we\'re all together.
 There\'s nothing to be afraid of if we\'re together.
 Go ahead and say it."
"............Uu.
 ...There\'s nothing to be afraid of...if we\'re together..."
"Yes.
 There\'s nothing to be afraid of if we\'re together."
"............Uu."
"Yeah, George‐aniki knows what he\'s talking about.
 If we\'re all together, there\'ll absolutely never be anything at all to be scared of.
 Right, Jessica?"
"Yeah, no doubt about that.
 George nii‐san always tells the truth, Maria."
"......Uu.
 George onii‐chan always true."
"Yes.
 I don\'t lie.
 So trust me.
 There\'s nothing to be afraid of if we\'re all together."
"Uu.
 ......George onii‐chan doesn\'t lie.
 I trust you.
 There\'s nothing to be afraid of if we\'re all together.
 .........Uu, not afraid!"
Maria jumped into George‐aniki\'s arms and hugged him tightly.
After Aniki patted her head, she jumped away again.
Her facial expression had returned so completely to normal that she looked like a totally different person from moments before.
{n}She was once again the ordinary Maria.
"Uu.
 There\'s nothing to be afraid of anymore, because we\'re all together.
 ...Uu‐uu."
"Yeah, that\'s it.
 ...You look all better now.
 You\'re strong, Maria, good girl!"
"......Uu!
 {c:86EF9C:I\'m} a good girl!"
"Hey now, what\'s goin\' on here?
 Maria‐chan didn\'t get seasick, did she?
 Hm?"
"Hahaha, well, something like that.
 We\'ll be arriving soon."
The harbor was already drawing near.The boat gave a big shudder.
Seems we\'ve docked at the harbor.
{n}The boat driver came out and jumped to the pier with the mooring rope.
A large man in a tuxedo was waiting there for us with a warm, smiling face.
......I didn\'t know him, but judging by his clothes, I guessed that he was a servant of the Ushiromiya head house.
"Welcome home, Milady.
 You were quite late, and I began to worry."
"Ah, thanks for caring!
 The boat had Battler scared shitless.
 So we had to slow down for him.
 Seriously, what a pain in the ass!"
"S‐shut up... I\'ll remember this when the shoe\'s on the other foot someday... ugghh."
At this rate, the word\'ll spread around the entire family, and I\'ll become the big conversation piece during dinner.
Even without this, everyone\'d be talking about me because of that six‐year gap...but now I\'ve provided them with an even juicier topic...!
Dammit, why does the Ushiromiya main family have to live on this isolated island!
In the meantime, the boat had finished its mooring.
{n}A small plank was lowered so that we could get down.
One by one, our parents came out of the boat.
"You must all be quite tired from your long trip.
 Madam, please, allow me to assist you."
"Thanks.
 It\'s been a while, Gohda‐san, how are you?"
"Thank you for your concern.
 It is always my pleasure to serve."
"Battler‐kun, isn\'t this your first time meeting Gohda‐san?
 If I\'m not mistaken, you weren\'t working here six years ago, right?"
"Indeed.
 So please, allow me to greet him for the first time.
 It is an honor to meet you at last, Battler‐sama."
"......I\'m pretty secure about my height, but you\'re huge.
 ...This is definitely our first meeting.
 If I\'d ever met a big guy like you, I\'d never forget it...!"
"It\'s a pleasure.
 I\'m Battler."
"Your return has been keenly anticipated, sir.
 I have been working for the Ushiromiya head house since the year before last; my name is Gohda ({p:0:郷田}), your servant."
"It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance.
 If there is ever anything you need, please feel free to rely on me."
"Gohda‐san, it\'s been some time."
"It has been too long, George‐sama.
 Please, allow me to assist you."
"As usual, you\'re a reception pro...
 If you ever need a job, just give me a holler, okay?
 I\'d hire you just like that!"
"You do me too much honor.
 Please allow me to assist you, Hideyoshi‐sama."
Gohda‐san then lent a hand to everyone as they disembarked, greeting them as they passed.
His speech and mannerisms had the refined polish of a professional.
He was very graceful, in contrast with his initially rough‐looking appearance.
His large size made him seem a bit scary at first, but he was much more polite than my first impression of him had led me to believe.
He claimed to have served on the island for two years, but he had doubtless worked at a similar job somewhere before.
After everybody disembarked, the mooring rope was untied, and the boat started to steer away from the harbor.
It was probably returning to its home port of Niijima.
The captain waved his hand in farewell.
{n}Maria conscientiously waved back.
"............Hmmm, I just realized why something\'s been feeling out of place to me.
 I can\'t hear the cries of the seagulls."
"Seagulls?
 The birds?"
I remember that whenever we came to this island, the seagulls always welcomed us with their lively "nyaa nyaa" cries.
And because of that, whenever I hear the cries of the seagulls in any other place, I get the feeling that I\'ve come to a family conference.
Except for the small part of the island where those of the Ushiromiya head house live, Rokkenjima had been left uncultivated, apparently transforming into a paradise for wild birds.
Seemingly, some cliff face or other had become home to a huge seagull colony, and so this island was always full of them.
Since those seagulls didn\'t come to greet us, I felt a bit lonely.
"What\'s wrong, Battler‐kun?"
"Oh, Auntie Rosa.
 ...Nah, it\'s nothing really—I was just saying I can\'t hear the seagulls, so it kinda feels a bit lonely."
"Oh, you\'re right.
 They\'re always so lively, but I can\'t see hide nor hair of one today."
"......Uu?
 Why no seagulls?"
"Hmmm, maybe it\'s because the seagulls are having a gathering somewhere too?
 Maria, did you want to see the seagulls?"
"Uu, wanted to."
"What happened for them all to disappear?
 Maybe Jessica made aaall of \'em into shish kebabs and ate \'em!"
"......Uu?!"
"The hell, don\'t say disturbing stuff like that!
 You\'ll get Maria all confused!!"
"Uu‐uu‐uu!
 Jessica onee‐chan made them into shish kebabs, made them into shish kebabs!
 Uu!!"
"I did not, I did not!
 Why the hell would I do something like that?!"
"That\'s right, that\'s ri~ght, Jessica made \'em into shish kebabs!
 Skin \'n meatballs, liver \'n onio~on!"
"Swim in meat dolls!
 Liver \'n oniooon!!
 Uu‐uu‐uu!
 Ahaha, ahaha!
 *giggle*giggle*!"
As I made fun of Jessica, Maria tagged along looking like she was having fun.
Ooh, she really knows how to join in with things!
{n}Alright then, starting today I\'ll make you my number one follower!
As I smiled at her, she beamed back overjoyed, I guess happy for this little bit of solidarity.
"That\'s not it, Maria‐chan.
 I\'ve heard that wild birds are attuned to changes in the weather and atmospheric pressure.
 And it looks like the weather will get worse around tonight.
 It\'s possible they hurried back to their nests."
"............Uu.
 Not kebabs?
 Jessica onee‐chan didn\'t make them into kebabs?"
"I did not, I did not!!
 I told you, I wouldn\'t do stuff like that!
 Alright, Battler, you admit right now that you lied!"
"Battler‐kun.
 Maria‐chan is a naive girl, so she takes even jokes seriously.
 You should choose your jokes more carefully."
...George‐aniki gently scolded me.
...Even though I outstripped Aniki in height, he still commanded respect as my elder.
 No choice but to obediently apologize.
"H‐hey,
 my bad, my bad...
 Maria, that just now was a joke.
 It\'s just today the seagulls are all quiet in their nests."
"......Battler lie?
 George onii‐chan true?"
{i:I was having fun, but you were actually just tricking me...?}
{n}Her pure eyes seemed to accuse me.
{n}......Maybe I went a little overboard with her after all.
"Yeeaah, that\'s right, that\'s right.
 What George‐aniki said is true.
 The weather is bad so they probably went home for today.
 It doesn\'t mean they\'re gone, does it?
 Right, Auntie?!"
"That\'s right.
 Tomorrow, when the weather gets better, I\'m sure they\'ll come back and let you hear their "myaa myaa" cries."
"Uu.
 I\'ll wait for the weather to get better so they come back.
 Wait for tomorrow.
 Wait for the weather to get better.
 Uu‐uu!"
Maria\'s mood lightened, and she started looking forward to tomorrow, when the seagulls would come back and fill the skies.
Still, George‐aniki really is amazing at taking care of kids.
...I think I remember Aniki taking good care of me as well when I was a brat six years ago.
......Aniki might have quite some talent for this kind of thing.
"George‐kun, you\'re so amazing at taking care of kids.
 I think you could work in child‐care!"
"Yeah, it\'s like you were born to do that.
 To me, that seems more "you" than doing business in some company president office."
"Oh, no.
 Child‐care is a very respectable {i:job} of its own.
 It\'s not something you can do merely by liking children."
"You\'re truly modest, George‐kun.
 But Battler‐kun, you\'re quite good with children too, you know!
 Earlier, even if it was just for a time, Maria seemed to be having a lot of fun.
 Keep on playing with her like you did just now.
 Just choose the jokes carefully though, alright?
 *giggle*."
Auntie Rosa winked at me, giggling a little.
A real mother, I thought to myself, who\'s happy that Maria looks like she\'s having fun.
"Come {i:on}, Rosa.
 And you brats too, what the hell\'re you doing, get a move on!"
"Alright, alright, we\'re coming."
The old bastard was beckoning us to hurry up.
{n}We\'d better get moving.
It\'s not like it\'d be too late to have the same discussion after we got our luggage in our rooms.
"Well then, everyone, I shall lead you towards the guesthouse where you will be staying.
 Please, this way."
Gohda‐san called to everyone and started leading us.
{n}Kumasawa‐san brought up the rear.
A serpentine, twisting path led through a dim forest.
{n}It ran a bit uphill.
I\'d guess the path was made twisting so that the slope wouldn\'t be felt too much,
 but personally, I\'d have been happier if they\'d been man enough to make some stairs in a straight line.
......No doubt they made the path twisting on purpose, to put on airs of distance and importance...
Before long, we saw garden‐style stone steps.
...Ahhh, now, I remember how it goes from here.
{n}Go up these, and...
At the top of the stone steps, a beautiful guesthouse came into view.
Its façade was lovely, of course, but even more than that,
 ......we couldn\'t help but have our hearts stolen away by the splendor of that beautiful rose garden that spread before it.
"Haah~!
 It\'s as beautiful as ever this year...
 A real delight for the eyes..."
As they reached the top of the stone steps, the people welcomed in by the rose garden voiced their appreciation one after another.
"Aren\'t the flowers less lively this year?
 It must be because the summer wasn\'t warm enough."
"I also believe that is so.
 When one compares with last year\'s blooming, it is a pity that this year\'s is somewhat inferior."
Even so, it was a delightful rose garden.
{n}I remember that huge amounts of roses used to greet me every year, even over six years ago.
...This rose garden was the first thing that greeted the people who came to Rokkenjima.
 Even our parents, who came every year, couldn\'t help but let their wonder slip out.
And moreover, it even looked like a "powered‐up" version of the garden from six years ago that was in my memories.
"This place is always so amazing.
 It would be so wonderful to have a rose garden like this in my own home."
"Give it up—who do you think would take care of it?
 Roses are a real pain, with bugs and diseases to worry about."
"Yes, they are.
 In fact, I hear that Kyrie nee‐san attends to her "rose" every day, and makes sure that it doesn\'t get nibbled at without her knowing it."
"Huh?
 I haven\'t heard anything like that, what\'s this?"
"Yes, I do.
 Though, with him, it\'s the rose that goes off after the insects, so it\'s really more like some nasty carnivorous plant."
"...Oh, so that\'s what you mean.
 C\'mon, Rosa, can\'t you give that a rest just for today?
 I\'ve put that sort of thing completely behind me."
"I wonder.
 After all, you are a womanizer on an almost genetic level...!"
"No need to worry, Rosa‐san.
 If a rose gives me too much trouble, I just chop it off at the root."
"Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho...such frightening talk this is."
"Guys who\'re popular with the ladies are always forced to live with danger at their side.
 I sure hope I turn out a bit prettier in my next life!"
"Hideyoshi nii‐san, as I keep telling you, it isn\'t like that at all.
 ...And Kyrie...stop it, you\'re freaking me out.
 You\'re making my rose wither."
"Hey, Maria‐chan, look over here.
 These roses are especially magnificent."
"...Roses are magificent.
 ...Uu!"
"Hmmm~~, smells pretty sweet.
 Look, this matches my elegance pe~rfectly."
"Hey, cut it out!
 Maria\'s gonna imitate you and get hurt by the thorns!"
She yelled at me as I leaned in with an exaggerated gesture to smell the rose\'s scent.
...I thought she was overreacting, but when I turned around, I saw Maria imitating my every movement, and thereby putting a broad smile on George‐aniki\'s face.
"Hey now, Maria‐chan, be careful.
 Rose thorns can hurt."
"......Uu?
 ............George onii‐chan.
 This one rose is strange.
 Uu."
"Strange?
 What\'s wrong?"
Maria pointed to a single rose.
{n}I immediately understood why she found it odd.
In the midst of all these magnificent roses, just one single rose was withering.
There wasn\'t any particular reason.
{n}Some roses flourish, and others wither.
That\'s all there was to it, but Maria seemed very concerned about there being only one unhealthy rose in a group of healthy ones.
...She must be feeling somehow like it\'s been left out.
"So, you feel sad for this rose because it\'s the only one that isn\'t healthy...?"
"......Uu.
 The others are all healthy, but this one\'s sad."
"Well, they all bloom and wither on their own.
 I\'ll bet the only reason that one withered now is because it bloomed earlier than any of the other roses."
"Yeah, that\'s right.
 It probably just bloomed all over the place, fulfilled its duty and went to rest.
 You shouldn\'t get so worked up about it."
".........Uu."
It seemed that Maria\'s pure, sensitive nature was making her feel some emotional pain for the rose that withered alone.
Even though she understood the logic of it, it still felt lonely to her.
"Okay, Maria‐chan,
 why don\'t you look after this rose until we leave, then?"
"Uu?"
George‐aniki straightened up and felt around in his pocket.
{n}He then took out the wrapping from the candy he had eaten on the plane.
He twisted it into a thin string, and gently tied it to the rose as a sort of marker.
"Heeey, that\'s pretty cute!"
"Let\'s mark it with this.
 Later on, you can come and give it some water.
 I\'m sure Mr. Rose will be happy."
"......Uu!
 Come to give it water!"
"I think you should give Mr. Rose here a name.
 I\'m sure that\'ll make it happy, and you\'ll get to know it a little better."
"Name...?
 Name...
 ......Uu...uu..."
Though she still wore her usual sullen face, Maria crossed her arms and began to consider this intently.
At the very least, she appeared to have been completely pulled out of her slump.
 Nice going, Aniki.
"George nii‐san has always been really understanding.
 Can\'t help but respect him."
"Yeah.
 I guess that\'s just his gift.
 We\'ve gotta learn some lessons from him!"
"Was this garden as fancy as this when you were a kid?"
"It was only after I left the house that it became this grand.
 Though I was more fond of the previous rustic garden.
 Nii‐san fiddled with it too much, with his slightly questionable taste.
 It was much better the way it was before."
"Eva, you\'ve gotta think positive!
 No matter how it might\'ve looked, its beauty now is something to be admired.
 You\'ll be able to relax a lot better if you look at it that way."
"I didn\'t mean it like that...
 I was just saying that I would have liked you to have seen the old, more wonderful garden as well."
"Now then, everyone, if you please.
 I shall be guiding you to the rooms now."
Gohda‐san called to everyone to ask if we were ready,
 but our hearts had been completely stolen away by the rose garden after a year of absence, and we didn\'t lend him an ear.
Since we weren\'t a travel group, it wasn\'t like we had a strict schedule to follow.
Besides, for our parents, this was their fond old birth home they had returned to, so they felt no obligation to be pressured by anyone.
Understanding the situation, Gohda‐san continued to wait, with a wide smile, for our parents to lose interest in the roses and tell him to guide us to the rooms...
"My...!
 Heeey!
 If it isn\'t Kanon‐kun!
 It\'s been so long, how are you doin\'?!"
Uncle Hideyoshi suddenly shouted.
In the direction he was waving,
 .........there was a slender boy.
Meeting him right after a huge man like Gohda probably emphasized his small stature.
The boy was in the middle of transporting piled‐up gardening tools and the like in a wheelbarrow.
When he realized he was being called to stop, he set down the wheelbarrow, took his hat off and bowed his head.
"..................
 .........Good afternoon."
...I figured he was probably younger than me.
{n}I realized by the general atmosphere surrounding him that he was a servant too.
Though he did greet Uncle Hideyoshi back, he himself seemed like he might be unsociable.
It was a greeting that lacked feeling.
When Gohda‐san noticed that our interest had shifted towards him, he went to the boy\'s side and introduced him to us.
"Battler‐sama, I shall introduce you.
 He is one of the servants who serve the Ushiromiya head house.
 ...Kanon‐san, greet our guest."
"..................I\'m pleased to meet you.
 I am the servant............
Kanon ({p:0:嘉音})."
Yep, my first impression wasn\'t wrong—he gave the feeling that he was unsociable, or maybe a bit of a poor speaker.
In contrast with Gohda‐san, who was extraordinarily polished as a servant,
 it was impossible not to feel the immaturity you\'d expect of someone his age.
When Gohda‐san urged him in a whisper to give a bit more of an introduction, the boy named Kanon only cast his eyes downwards.
"Kanon‐san.
 Could you perhaps give them a little more as a greeting...?"
"............I can\'t.
 ............Because we...
...are furniture."
It seemed that he wasn\'t refusing to greet us out of spite,
 but rather, he gave the impression that he didn\'t know what else to add to his greeting, and so could do nothing other than stay silent.
"Ah, uh, Kanon‐kun\'s a man of few words.
 He might not be that sociable, but deep down he\'s really a good person!
 Don\'t get him wrong...!"
"You\'ve been working here for three years, was it?
 So yeah, you\'ve been here a year longer than Gohda‐san, right, Kanon‐kun?"
Even though it\'s not like he made a super bad impression, Jessica hurriedly backed him up.
...I see, apparently him being unsociable works against him all the time.
"Cool, nice to meet you.
 I\'m Battler!
 I\'m 18, how old are you?"
"..........................."
A silence, as if evaluating whether it was a question that must be answered or not.
{n}...But here again, Jessica plowed ahead.
"Um, uhh...!
 If I remember correctly, he\'s two years younger than us so...16, right?"
"............Yes, ...that is correct."
It looked like if given a choice, he would have preferred not to tell us his age.
Him not wanting to tell his age was probably because he thought he would be looked down upon for it.
...I remember that when I was around his age, I hated being asked how old I was by adults.
...I see, 16, huh?
{n}That\'s gotta be a delicate time.
{n}...In that case, I asked something I shouldn\'t have.
"Heh heh~, I\'m glad you\'re about our age!
 Just be cool and call me Battler!
 And I\'ll call you Kanon!"
".........Thank you very much.
 But just the sentiment is sufficient, ...Battler‐sama."
Jessica looked flustered for some reason.
{n}She seemed to think that my impression of Kanon was worsening because of his rejection.
Well, I doubt a girl like Jessica understands his fretful male heart.
As his elder—even by just two years—who would lead him into adolescence, I took it upon myself to understand that.
"Kanon‐san, could you perhaps be a little more courteous?
 A smiling face is also the duty of a servant."
"...............I apologize.
 ...I shall make an effort."
"Hoh‐hoh‐ho...
 Gohda‐san, Kanon‐kun is trying his best, isn\'t he?"
It seemed as though he was often warned about his discourtesy.
{n}And apparently he hadn\'t improved a bit.
Gohda‐san kept his business‐smile, but let a small sigh of resignation escape.
"......Well then, I still have work to do.
 .........If you\'ll excuse me."
It looked like Kanon himself was uncomfortable with remaining silent here any longer.
After another perfunctory bow, he turned on his heels and started pushing the wheelbarrow again.
Just then, suddenly, the wheelbarrow wobbled and fell, scattering the load.
I guess the wheelbarrow with its single wheel caught on a pebble and lost its balance.
"What have you done...now now, quickly clean it up...!"
Gohda‐san urged him along in a low voice, as if to remind him that it is a servant\'s shame to present a clumsy appearance in front of guests.
Showing that he understood quite well without being told, Kanon‐kun wordlessly reloaded the wheelbarrow with the fallen objects.
He seemed to be fine with the light‐looking gardening tools, shovels and such, but he looked like he was having trouble getting his arms around and lifting up some sacks of fertilizer.
"Are you alright? You\'re so careless.
 Here."
"Milady, you will dirty your garments.
 Please, leave it to him."
With an elegant gesture, Gohda‐san took the shovel that Jessica had picked up.
At his back was the figure of Kanon‐kun having trouble with the sacks of fertilizer.
"......Uu.
 You\'ll dirty your garments?"
"Don\'t worry, the ones I\'m wearing aren\'t that elegant."
"Besides, I hate guys who make the waitress pick up the fork they dropped at a restaurant."
I lifted up the other bags that had fallen.
{n}Of course, they weren\'t light, but for me it was a piece of cake.
Kanon‐kun turned his surprised eyes towards me.
{n}It was the face of one who would never have expected to receive help from a guest.
"............B‐Battler‐sama...
 That\'s not necessary... I\'ll take care of everything, so..."
"Don\'t you worry!
 I may not look it, but I\'ve got it where it counts!
 Heheh!"
Kanon‐kun looked like he hadn\'t yet gone through his growth spurt, and was stuck with a sorta weak body.
I guess this kind of weight is a bit much for him.
"It\'s quite heavy, isn\'t it.
 It\'s natural that it would be difficult for you.
 Kanon‐kun, don\'t worry about it."
"OK, my time to shine.
 This makes up for the boat part from before, right?"
"Ha!
 As if your antics earlier could be written off just like that!
 Ah‐hah‐hah‐ha!
 I\'ll tell you all about it later, Kanon‐kun—Battler is a laugh and a half!"
"Gonna faaall gonna faaall!!
 Uu‐uu‐uu!!!"
Banter made the job seem quick, and before I knew it, all the stuff had been piled back into the wheelbarrow.
"............For letting you see such unsightliness, I beg your forgiveness."
"Very well, enough now.
 Please, go."
Letting such a disgraceful thing be seen by the guests who were supposed to be made welcome...must have been hideously embarrassing as a servant.
Pressed by Gohda to hurry up and exit, Kanon‐kun left.
"You\'re too harsh on him, Gohda‐san.
 Wouldn\'t it have been better if you\'d helped him, instead of being a bully?"
"...You are quite correct.
 I deeply, deeply implore your forgiveness."
Without even a twitch in his smile, Gohda‐san apologized elegantly.
"Kanon‐kun has a ton a things he\'s good at too.
 It\'s just that bein\' young works against him all the time.
 It\'s a cryin\' shame."
"It\'s a prickly age.
 You be nice to him.
 Keeping a tight lip is just what you want in a servant.
 Right, Kumasawa‐san?"
"Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho, Rudolf‐sama, you truly are harsh!
 There is no servant as silent as I, of course!"
Everyone smiled wryly at that shameless lie.
{n}Even she herself didn\'t believe that, not in her wildest dreams.
{n}She said that to loosen us all up.
Yeah, that\'s the kind of character Kumasawa baa‐chan used to be.
The mood that had stiffened a little was cleared up in a twinkling, thanks to Kumasawa‐san\'s cheerful smile.
"I\'d like to put down the luggage soon.
 Gohda‐san, how are we to split up for our rooms?"
"It shall be the same as last year.
 I shall guide you.
 Please, this way."
We headed towards the trim and elegant guesthouse.
{n}This was going to be our temporary quarters for a night.
".........................................."
Kanon watched over a hedge as the guests all entered the guesthouse.
Then, he let his eyes fall on those heavy sacks of fertilizer, piled up in the wheelbarrow.
In his mind, he kept going over his previous mistake.
{n}Battler, big and strong, had picked up the sacks in front of him, the sacks he couldn\'t lift himself, as if they were feathers.
It was extremely difficult for an outside observer to guess what emotions that favor had stirred up in Kanon.
But as far as you could tell by watching him hang his head from behind, there was something that he just couldn\'t let go.
...Muttered words escaped his lips.
{n}But those words he murmured were so soft that they didn\'t reach even his own ears.
"...............Even I...
........................"
Kanon hung his head, slightly biting his lower lip...
"I remember the rose garden, but...
I don\'t remember this guesthouse at all.
 Was it built, like, recently?"
"Toraian" (Visitor\'s Retreat) was written on a gatepost‐like thing, but since everyone called it the guesthouse, I followed their lead.
The brand‐new Western‐style guesthouse that stood overlooking the rose garden had a magnificent design carefully done in harmony with the garden.
"Correct!
 It was built just the year before last.
 Since then, we\'ve been having them let us sleep over here."
"Hehe, yeah, \'cause people seem to like this place more than that junky old mansion we\'ve had forever.
 I wish my room was over here!"
"Uu!
 I want one too!
 Want one too!"
...I guess you could call my house upper‐class as well, but I was reminded again how completely ordinary it was compared to the head house.
It showed a shocking display of wealth that they would build this kind of awesome guesthouse for guests who come over like once a year.
"Eva‐sama, Hideyoshi‐sama.
 Please, do make use of this room.
 Rudolf‐sama, Kyrie‐sama, please make use of this room here."
"Ah yes, I do appreciate how pretty and elegant this place is.
 Western style truly is wonderful."
"I can handle the Western style for a few days, but any longer than that and you need the good old Japanese style!
 Japanese people just relax best on tatami mats."
"...Haha, they\'ve been fighting over making our new house Japanese‐style or Western‐style.
 Mother still holds a grudge about Father having started the construction as Japanese‐style, and they bicker all the time about it."
"Your parents get along so well, George nii‐san... I\'m jealous as hell.
 Mine are so frosty.
 And yet they\'re right with each other when it comes to my grades."
All the rooms seemed to be two‐person.
{n}I was grateful, because now I wasn\'t gonna be forced to share the same room with the old bastard for some bullshit reason like "being family".
Besides, I figure those two wouldn\'t be able to enjoy themselves with someone like me around, ihihi.
"What\'s that creepy smile all about?
 You\'re thinking about something dirty, aren\'t you."
"Ihihihi~!
 Something diiirrrty? Of coouurse no~t!
 Please...enjoy your staaay~!"
"Ow, owowowow!
 That hurts, you old bastard!"
Once again, Dad pulled my ears from behind.
"Cut the crap.
 I\'m getting a stomachache, and I\'m not in the mood for this.
 You\'re the guest of honor this time around.
 You play as nice as possible with Dad and Aniki and the rest."
"......At the very least, pay attention to what you say in front of Dad, got it?
 \'Cause wisecracks go over like a lead balloon with him.
 ......Jessica‐chan, what\'s the mood of our family head been like lately?"
"...Hmm......
same as last year, I guess.
 ......Considering they keep saying he\'s got three months left, he\'s as lively,
 grumpy,
 and irritable as ever."
"Meaning, he\'s in his usual bad mood again this year.
 ......And the only one who\'s able to take care of him is Genji‐san?"
"It seems that the Master will only open his heart to Genji‐san.
 Lately, us small people cannot even get an audience..."
"He\'s shut himself up in his study again, probably doing nothing but that weird black magic of his.
 What he does for a hobby is his own damn business, but when he starts stinking up the place, it really gets on my nerves.
 ...He can just stay in that study and never come out again for all I care.
 Heheheh!"
"You shouldn\'t talk like that about the elderly.
 We\'re all indebted to him, since he rebuilt the Ushiromiya family, and a little gratitude wouldn\'t hurt."
"Hm...well...
 ......Sorry."
After being rebuked by George‐aniki, Jessica had no choice but to take back her thoughtless remark.
The Ushiromiya family was wealthy beyond belief, but that, of course, meant that all its members were eccentric people, completely at odds with the rest of society.
The Head of the family, standing at its peak—in other words, our Grandfather—seemed to be a particularly eccentric and terrifying person, even for our family.
Dad had said he was getting a stomachache earlier, but I guess that was what all the adults who came here today were actually feeling.
No doubt they were jealous of us, the grandchildren, just playing and laughing without a care.
From the stories Dad told me, the head of the family was a violent man who rained blows on his sons with his own fists and even beat his daughters mercilessly with a wooden sword.
If he was such a staunch traditionalist with his kids, why wasn\'t he the same with their names?
Because of that, even us grandkids have to suffer.
......Well, I have absolutely no trouble believing the terrifying image they paint of him.
I don\'t have many memories of meeting him over the years, but I remember his face was full of menacing thunder‐clouds, always making the people around him shrink away with a sharp look.
I remember that the room\'s atmosphere got so tense whenever he was around, you couldn\'t even breathe.
What my dad said right now about me being the guest of honor now carries a little more oomph for me.
".........Six years ago I was in grade school, but I\'m a high‐schooler now, there\'s no getting away from it.
 If I don\'t show him respect, things\'ll probably get serious.
 ...Ooo, scary."
"He does look frightening, but he\'s not completely terrifying.
 He\'s definitely never unfair.
 He\'s just not a pretty talker, that\'s all."
"But George nii‐san, you\'ve been the family darling since like forever because of your awesome grades, right?
 Grandfather treats us completely different!"
"Like me, I\'ve gotten slapped with a wooden sword.
 On my ass, my ass!
 On my maidenly naked ass!"
"Well, you\'re the heiress of the head house, Jessica‐chan.
 Grandfather is giving you special attention.
 You have to realize that his strictness shows how much he\'s expecting of you."
"Oh, come on.
 ...Seriously, I could just turn the succession over to you, George nii‐san.
 It\'s a bit of a heavy burden for me to carry."
I think I already said it before, but Jessica is the daughter who will inherit the head house.
{n}The pressure on her shoulders must be different from us cousins of the branch families.
".........Uu?
 Jessica onee‐chan, heavy?
 If I hold it, will it get lighter?"
"Hm?
 Ahahahaha, thanks.
 It\'s alright, it\'s not gonna get pushed on you, Maria‐chan."
"......I\'m gonna bear that cross until my grave.
 ...Don\'t worry."
While grateful for Maria\'s innocent consideration, it seemed that Jessica could not easily rid herself of the anxiety for the future that remained visible on her face.
...I guess I\'m no different.
 Any high‐schooler with exams looming ahead is bound to have an anxiety for the future that they can\'t hide.
"Maria, come here.
 You\'ll be in this room with Mom."
"Battler‐kun, apparently you are with me in this room here."
"Oh?
 This i~s a surprise!
 It\'s bigger than our parents\' room, wo~w!"
"I figured us cousins are probably all going to gather in one place anyway.
 So I went and told them to make it a biggish room."
"Uu!
 I like here best too!
 Here is better than being together with Mama!
 Uu‐uu!"
"Okay, you like it here better too, Maria!
 Alright, this room is George\'s and mine, but we\'ll give you special permission to come in!
 Keep it a secret from your mom, alright?"
"Uu!
 Secret!"
Her mother, Auntie Rosa, was right behind her, but Maria still answered, striking the air with her fists clenched tight.
After our parents put the luggage in the rooms, they gathered again in the corridor.
"So, brats, what\'re you gonna do?
 Are you cousins just gonna stay here and chat?"
It seemed they were heading to the mansion to announce their arrival.
...Normally, we would have had to follow them and greet everyone together,
 but if that had been the case, Dad would just have said "You guys come too!" and been done with it.
He\'s telling us that it\'s alright if we don\'t come... So what\'ll we do?
"It\'s gonna be time for lunch soon anyway.
 Better let the kids unwind here.
 Besides, if worst comes to worst, this might be the last chance they get to play outdoors."
"Uu!
 I\'ll go too!"
"Maria, you house‐sit for Mama, okay?
 You behave yourself and wait here."
"......Uu."
Now that Maria had been told to house‐sit, we couldn\'t just leave her behind.
George‐aniki realized that immediately, and gave a clear reply for all of us.
"Well, we\'ll accept your offer and house‐sit.
 We have lots of stories to tell each other, after a year."
"That would be best.
 And Battler‐kun has six years\' worth to tell, after all!"
"Yeah, yeah.
 I\'ll take care of the house like a good little boy."
"Kumasawa‐san, I\'m gonna stay here too!
 We\'ll leave the rest to the adults and us kids\'ll break rank, heheheh!"
"That would be for the best, hoh‐hoh‐ho.
 I\'ll report it to Madam..."
"Then, everyone, I will be guiding you to the mansion.
 Please, this way."
"...The other kids aside, George is an adult now. Wouldn\'t it be better if he came with us?"
"If we make him come, poor George\'ll be the only one left out.
 Interactin\' with his cousins is also important.
 Well then, see ya, guys!"
The adults left one after the other.
Like the time he had guided us from the harbor, Gohda‐san went ahead, with Kumasawa‐san at the rear.
As we gathered in the cousins\' room assigned to us, George‐aniki asked us to excuse him for a second.
 He rushed over to Kumasawa‐san, who was following behind the disappearing adults, and seemed to be asking her something.
He soon finished his business and came back.
"What\'s up, Aniki?"
"Ah, nothing.
 I just wanted to ask something."
"Uu!
 Ask me too!
 Ask me tooo!"
"......Hm~?
 Hmhuhuhuhu.
 What could it be that George nii‐san asks Kumasawa‐san and doesn\'t ask me, I wonder~?
 Ah, I don\'t have a clue~!"
"No, you misunderstand...!
 I\'m not sure what you\'re misunderstanding but...!"
Aniki was getting pretty tongue‐tied.
It\'s like he has something to hide, and Jessica has the dirt on him.
...Whatever it is, something only Jessica knows and I don\'t is no fun at all!
"Hey, Maria, it\'s not fair that we\'re the only ones out of the loop, is it no~w?!
 We wanna hear what they\'re talking about, don\'t we~?!"
"Uu!
 Battler and me want to know too!
 Battler and me want to know too!"
""Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!!""
I fooled around while "uu‐uu"ing together with Maria.
"No, I\'m telling you...it\'s no big deal, ahahaha..."
"Li~ar!
 You suck at lying, now confess!
 Maria, you tickle his right side, I\'ll tickle his left!"
"Uu!
 Me on the right side, Battler on the left!
 Uu!"
"Wait a second!!
 Wait you two...!!
 Ahahaha, stop,
 ahahahahahaha!!"
George‐aniki rolled around on the bed in an effort to get away, and Maria and I played around chasing him.
There\'s something in the back of my mind telling me I\'m a high‐schooler now and not a damn kitten, but in spite of that, I missed this kind of fun.
A warm kind of fun.
"Haahahahaha, what George nii‐san was asking Kumasawa‐san, see...
 Hmm~?
 Well, you know how it is.
 It\'s been a year since he last came to the head house.
 Apparently he\'s really dying to say hi to any servants that might have joined or quit in the meantime, see?"
"......Uu?
 Say hi, I\'ll say hi too!"
"What the hell, that\'s not anything to feel guilty about, Aniki.
 ......Hmm~~m?
 That\'s not it, is it??
 Maria, don\'t be fooled, Aniki\'s still hiding somethi~ng!
 Resume interrogation!!
 Uworyaaa!!"
"S‐stop it, seriously!
 Aahahahahaha!
 Maria‐chan, you too, stop already!!"
"Aahahahahaha, aahahahahaha!
 *giggle*giggle*!!"
"They\'re probably busy with cleaning or lunch arrangements.
 It\'s alright, we\'ll go and greet them properly afterwards.
 Basically, you wanted Shannon out there to greet you, not that Gohda getting in the way, right?!
 Heeheheh!"
"Shannon?
 ......Shannon.
 ......Aaaaaaaaahh...
 I remember, that girl!
 She\'s still a servant now?
 How is she?!"
"By the way, Natsuhi nee‐san.
 How\'s your headache been lately?
 It seemed to be pretty serious for a time."
"...I have been much better lately.
 Thank you for your concern."
"Oh, right, here.
 A present for you, Natsuhi nee‐san."
"......Thank you once again.
 I\'m always receiving gifts from you.
 ...Is this black tea?"
"It\'s herb tea with peppermint and lemon balm.
 It\'s a blend from a famous store and is supposed to be good for headaches.
 I thought it might help you too."
Rosa was always a conscientious woman.
...Probably because she was the youngest of four, and by quite some distance,
 she managed to grow up without harboring the venomosity of her siblings.
Her consideration made Natsuhi soften her expression for just a moment,
 but it wasn\'t enough to undo the many years of anxiety that had curdled her expression into one of bland indifference...
"Oh yes, you always were saying you get those headaches.
 Pull yourself together.
 Jessica‐chan will have her exams this year, won\'t she?
 Isn\'t that a turning point in her life?
 How can she count on her mother like that?
 Besides, Natsuhi nee‐san, you\'re three years younger than me.
 Can\'t you pull yourself together?"
"............
 .........I apologize.
 I was born with this discomfort."
Eva sometimes fails to choose her words carefully, but even though she hid it with a smile, her comments aimed at Natsuhi contained shards of obvious malice.
Of course, that didn\'t escape Natsuhi.
She frantically contained her urge to grimace, and pretended to ignore Eva.
"Our Battler‐kun will have his exams this year too, right?
 Rudolf‐san, shouldn\'t you be a little concerned too?
 For the sake of your own son, get serious to the point of getting headaches like Natsuhi nee‐san."
"If I say anything, he automatically goes against it.
 So what should I say—maybe the opposite, that it\'s okay for him to mess around?
 That\'s probably the only thing he\'d obediently listen to."
"In your family, Hideyoshi nii‐san, didn\'t George do really well on his exams?
 Please, teach me the secret to controlling children."
"Hmm, well...
 It\'s probably because I convinced him why he should study!
 Study isn\'t worth anything on its own."
"That\'s right, the real point of studyin\' is to train yourself in the art of researchin\' what you don\'t know!
 If you can\'t do that, you can\'t be useful to society!
 I\'m not talkin\' about math or writin\'.
 You need to learn how to learn!"
"...That\'s splendid.
 It would be nice if our Jessica could understand that, though.
 I don\'t mean this too seriously, but as it is, as an heiress of the Ushiromiya family, she\'s—"
"Do you really have to force her into becoming the successor?
 Women have to find their own happiness.
 Parents shouldn\'t be deciding that for their children, right?"
"Hold your horses, Eva.
 Each family has its way to raise their children.
 You shouldn\'t be pushy."
"I\'m sorry.
 Natsuhi nee‐san, don\'t take it the wrong way."
"..........................."
Though the light shining in through the window was quite warm despite the cloudy weather, there was a dark mood about the room,
 ...which probably caused headaches for other people besides Natsuhi.
As if to brush away that mood, Kyrie brightly made a suggestion to all present.
"Still, this black tea has a really lovely aroma.
 Let\'s drink it at once.
 I believe that in Japan, you can\'t buy something like Leopold\'s black tea anywhere but Ginza, right?"
"Kyrie nee‐san, how knowledgeable of you.
 It really was worth buying."
Kyrie and Rosa stood up from their seats and made as if to prepare the black tea.
{n}Natsuhi forestalled them.
"......Thank you both.
 Let us save that for later.
 One of our people will soon be coming to bring some tea, so please relax."
"Leave it for later, you two.
 Let them treat us to a "welcome drink" at least."
Rudolf gave a subtle signal with his eyes for them to sit down again.
{n}...Kyrie and Rosa understood instantly and obediently returned to their seats.
The guests had already been greeted, so it was time for some tea to be prepared for them.
...That tea was late, and having the guests talk about making some themselves was an embarrassment for the host.
Natsuhi bit her lower lip, frustrated with the ineptitude of the servants who were taking too long to bring the tea.
...Seeing her face, Eva, without hesitation, started to giggle.
......Of course, Shannon had no way of knowing what was taking place in the parlor.
As she came in pushing a dish cart piled with tea cups,
 Natsuhi gave her a pained look for no apparent reason, and Shannon couldn\'t help but flinch without knowing what she had done wrong.
"......E‐excuse me.
 I shall prepare some tea for you."
"Oh, Shannon‐chan, it\'s been a while!
 You keep getting prettier every time I see you!"
".........Oh,
 ...um,
 .........thanks—"
"Leave the chatting for after you\'ve set the table.
 The tea will get cold."
"......I, ...I apologize, Madam."
She apologized like a small frightened animal, and, bumping against the serving cart, made a jarring racket as she dropped several tea spoons.
Her clumsiness made Natsuhi\'s expression even harsher, which made Shannon in turn quail even more.
"It\'s alright, Natsuhi nee‐san.
 What does a single greeting matter?
 We\'ve already been made to wait for so long, the tea must be quite cold anyway.
 Heheheh."
"It, ...it\'s alright...
 It\'s not cold yet, so—"
".........Shannon, finish setting the table, quickly."
"I, I\'m sorry, Madam......"
It was obvious that Natsuhi was getting irritated.
...The ineptitude that delayed the tea, the clumsiness of the servant—everything pointed to the incompetence of Natsuhi\'s everyday guidance, making her lose face.
As the person in charge of matters of the Ushiromiya head house, allowing that clumsiness to be exposed today of all days was surely nothing less than total humiliation.
"Lay off, Natsuhi nee‐san.
 Don\'t you think it\'s a little harsh to bully Shannon‐chan when she\'s trying her best?"
"I\'m not bullying anyone...!"
"What a nice smell.
 May I ask you the brand of this tea?"
"............Umm...
......I\'m, ...I\'m terribly sorry...
 I\'ll find out for you later..."
Kyrie had tried to be nice to her, wanting to cut through the tense mood.
...However, instead, Shannon had shown a disgraceful display, darkening Natsuhi\'s face and the room\'s mood.
By this point, Eva\'s giggles were loud enough to be heard by everyone in the room.
"Whaat\'s thiis?
 Shannon‐chan, don\'t you even know what you\'re pouring us?
 Come now, you mustn\'t serve something so suspicious to guests.
 We\'ll need a silver spoon at the very least before we can drink this."
".........I, ...I\'m sorry......
 I\'ll go get one immediately—"
"Shannon‐chan?
 Do you know what silver spoons are used for?
 Or why they have to be silver?
 Do you know why?"
"...............no...
.........umm......"
Eva\'s eyes played over Shannon, who was setting the table, as a catty smile floated onto her face.
...Taken on its own, the expression on Eva\'s face may have been charming, in an impish sort of way.
However, the words being spun from her lips held within them the keenness of a razor.
Shannon tried with all her might to avoid Eva\'s gaze, which continued to focus on her.
Grasping that Shannon was hard‐pressed for an answer, Rosa promptly gave some timely help.
"They say that silver dims if it is touched by poison.
 ...*giggle*, you\'ve learned something, right, Shannon‐chan?"
The tea was being treated as undrinkable unless it could first be tested for poison.
In Natsuhi\'s eyes, this was an insult to both the tea...and herself for serving it.
Rudolf, laughing flippantly, patted Eva\'s shoulder.
"Haha, you don\'t need any silver cutlery.
 With just one lick of your poisonous tongue, even a silver plate would go pitch black."
"Wahahahaha!
 I get to hear that poison‐tongue every day, so I must be poison‐proof by now!
 Eva, I don\'t mind you doing it to me, but you\'ve gotta tone it down a smidgen for the poor souls without resistance!
 Wahahahaha!"
"My, how cruel.
 I only gave Shannon‐chan a bit of information about tea, didn\'t I?
 *giggle*."
Everyone followed the lead set by Hideyoshi\'s horselaugh and smiled, though sourly.
There remained a single exception to this in Natsuhi, but even so, for the time being, the conversation inside the parlor could now be mistaken for a lively and friendly chat.
As Shannon finally finished setting the tea table and made to leave, Kyrie apologized to her in a low voice for not being able to help.
...Shannon gave a light bow and made a hasty retreat......
Shannon cast her eyes downwards, pushing the cart down the corridor...
The pitiful air around her made it obvious that she had borne the brunt of some bullying.
"......Don\'t be sad.
 You didn\'t do anything wrong, Nee‐san."
"...............You were watching."
"That is my duty."
"........................"
"Madam and Eva‐sama can go to hell.
 ......But the even worse coward is that guy."
Kanon glared hatefully in the opposite direction of the parlor.
The preparations for the tea had been delayed by a little bit of trouble in the kitchen.
That trouble had not been Shannon\'s fault.
{n}The truth is that it had been Gohda\'s mistake.
In the first place, there was no way that a showoff like Gohda would ever hand over a flamboyant job like carting the tea to the guests.
He had needed to make the tea all over again, which had made him late.
So, realizing that he wouldn\'t be earning any brownie points, he had pushed the task of setting the table on Shannon, who happened to be passing by.
......One could truthfully call it being shrewd, and one could unquestionably call it cowardice.
"......It\'s alright, Kanon‐kun, thank you.
 ...I really don\'t mind..."
"................................."
Kanon\'s silence vividly showed that Shannon\'s words weren\'t coming from her heart.
"............Thank you.
 Even if you\'re the only one who understands, I still feel a bit better, I think."
"......You bottle things up too much, Nee‐san.
 ......You should be less hard on yourself for once."
"Yeah.
 ......Thanks."
Suddenly, they both felt someone\'s presence and whirled around.
An elderly man stood there.
{n}It was Genji, the head servant.
"..................What are you doing here?
 ...Shannon, hurry back to the kitchen."
"Y‐yes.
 ......If you\'ll excuse me......"
"................................."
Shannon humbly obeyed and promptly made to push the cart and leave.
However, Kanon appealed to Genji in silence, bearing something in his eyes that he could not express in words.
"...............What is it?
 Did something happen...?"
"...Sha‐
......Shannon didn\'t do anything wrong,
 but those—"
"Stop it, Kanon‐kun..."
"......If you\'ll excuse me.
 I\'ll return to work immediately.
 Kanon‐kun, you too, go back to your post.
 ......Please."
"............If you say so, Nee‐san."
"..................
 ...If there is nothing, then go."
"......Yes.
 ......If you\'ll excuse me."
From the shadows in the hallway, an old woman wearing an apron watched over them. It was Kumasawa...
......How heartrending, Shannon‐san, Kanon‐san...
There\'s no reason for those two to be picked on.
 ...But, it cannot be denied that they are disliked by Gohda‐san...
Before Gohda‐san was taken in by the Ushiromiya head house, I heard he worked for a fabulous hotel somewhere.
I do think the manner of work he learned there was quite something.
It\'s just that...Gohda‐san is the newest servant here.
...He must have a lot of pride accumulated from his previous posts.
Because Shannon‐san and Kanon‐kun are his seniors here at the mansion, and yet are inexperienced and have gone through much less in life than he has, he picks on them at every chance he gets...
And also, ...although it\'s terrible, they are hated by Madam Natsuhi too...
Of course, in terms of experience, Madam has been in the family much longer.
However.........I must feel some sympathy for Madam as well in this case.
...The Master is a truly cruel person...
Why could he not have realized that his trifling whim would pass such an inferiority complex onto Madam...
......Naturally, deep inside, even Madam fully acknowledges that there\'s no reason to treat those two so harshly...
...However, the heart has reasons that reason knows not...
Ahh, how heartrending...
I cannot do anything but watch over them from the shadows......The four of us cousins were shooting the breeze over all kinds of topics.
After all, there are both girls and guys here, plus, we\'ve got people over a wide spread of ages: adult, high school, and elementary school.
All each of us had to do was talk about ourselves, and it would be of great interest to the other three.
"I think I\'m finally getting used to all this.
 I mean, Jessica and Maria, you\'ve both grown more than I could\'ve imagined over the past six years.
 So, to be honest, I was feeling a bit uncomfortable, but talking like this, I guess that on the inside, nothing\'s really changed since back then."
"Right back at you.
 Even after six years, you haven\'t changed a bit.
 Although your body\'s gotten gigantic, you\'re still a kid inside."
"Uu!
 I\'m a kid too!
 I\'m a kid too!"
"Well, you aren\'t gonna be a kid forever, are you, Maria?
 I mean, you\'re gonna grow from being a kid to a cute young lady, aren\'tcha?
 And when that happens, that flat‐as‐a‐board chest\'ll be on Jessica\'s level, you kno~w?"
"When that happens, let me rub it, OK? Promise!!"
"Uu!
 Let you rub it!
 Promise!
 Uu!"
"N‐no, Maria‐chan!
 You can\'t make that kind of promise, that\'s bad, bad, bad!"
"Uu?
 I promised, so let him rub it!
 I keep my promises!
 Always keep them, uu!!"
"...Mariaa, you\'re a really earnest, good girl...
 The guy you marry\'s gonna be really lucky."
"Just a—Don\'t try to smooth over the topic with the promise intact!
 Maria, that promise never happened!
 Never!"
"Uu.
 Promise cancelled?
 Uu......"
"I realize now, it really didn\'t feel like a proper gathering of cousins without Battler‐kun in our group, did it?
 These six years have been kinda lonely."
"...That\'s true.
 We weren\'t able to goof off like this.
 Still, we did have some pretty constructive conversations, don\'tcha think?
 Stuff about preparing for our future, exam‐taking, or finding jobs."
"Oo~ooh, I\'m sorrryyy!
 Now that I\'m here, there\'s just this stu~pid babbling!"
"But, I\'m having fun this year.
 Uu‐uu!"
"That\'s true.
 I agree, this year\'s the most fun."
Maria\'s sincere words probably spoke for everyone.
When George‐aniki stroked Maria\'s head, she giggled like a happy kitten...
"......Pardon me.
 Your meal is prepared."
A timid knocking sound and an equally timid young woman\'s voice came through the door.
Jessica answered brightly.
"Shannon, come in!
 You remember Battler, don\'tcha?!"
Jessica stood up from the bed and opened the door.
There stood a servant girl who was definitely about our age.
"I‐it\'s been quite some time since we last met, Battler‐sama.
 It\'s nice to see you after six years... I\'m Shannon."
Noting my presence and trembling a little, she bowed deeply.
"...Woww...!
 Jessica had me surprised, but Shannon‐chan, you\'ve shocked me just as much...
 You\'ve turned into a total beauty too, haven\'t you~?!"
"Y‐......your words are too good for me......"
"Se~riously, the food on this island must be reeeally nutritional, no~?
 What are you eating, where are you training, to get boobs that big?!!
 Guess I\'ll have to feel \'em a bit and see whether yours or Jessica\'s are bigger, oka~ay?!"
With both hands poised and saliva dribbling from my mouth, I closed in!
......For the sake of my honor and justice,
 I\'d like to point out that I don\'t suffer from some strange disease that makes my lymph nodes itch until I scratch my neck open and which can only be prevented by rubbing breasts.
It\'s just my Battler‐style way of communicating.
When a boy closes in on a girl like this, nine times out of ten they get slapped or clobbered, right?
This is a Battler‐sama original communication technique, aiming for a gag like that to break the ice!
.........W‐well, that means I really do get to touch them on that one‐in‐ten chance though, right...?
Ihihyahyahya, I\'d never ask for that much thouuuugh~!!
By now, my hands were less than a centimeter away from Shannon‐chan\'s chest, but......the counterstrike had yet to come.
She understood what was going on, and she was blushing and had her head lowered in embarrassment,
 but she was just standing there with both hands politely joined in front of her, not even trying to resist or cover her breasts.
...Whoaaaaah, I wasn\'t planning on this!!
P‐pl‐please, hit me right now—at this rate I\'m seriously gonna touch themmm!
...Which is why I was glad that Jessica chose that time to drive her elbow into the back of my head...
"Guaaaah, ooooowww, Jessicaaaaaa, thank youuu~!!"
"Wh‐wh‐why the hell are you thanking me?!
 ???"
"No, no, my bad, Shannon‐chan.
 Looks like I got a little too absorbed in your hypnotic chest...
 No, more to the point, when someone gets that close, they\'ve clearly got criminal intentions!
 Seriously, you\'ve gotta resist!"
".........B‐but...
......you are...an exalted guest, Battler‐sama......"
"Now look here, a crime\'s a crime whether I\'m a guest or not!
 Ten centimeters around a girl\'s chest is like an Air Defense Identification Range.
 If someone trespasses within two centimeters, that\'s already an invasion of airspace and you launch a slap to the face on high‐alert!"
"............I, I couldn\'t do such a thing...!
 We are.........that is, furniture, and..."
Of course she didn\'t want her breasts touched, but...if a guest so desired, she intended to sacrifice her own needs in an effort to accommodate them.
...A girl like this needs some urgent protection...!
"...I‐in these days, to think that there\'s a dedicated and virtuous girl like this...
 It makes my head spin...
 ......But, no!
 No, no, nooo!!"
"I come at you with a perverted face!
 You smack me down!!
 "No~oo, pervert!"
 You gotta complete the joke or it doesn\'t work! Please, it\'s a polite request, smack me!
 Like this, smack!
 Smaaa~ck!!"
"I............I cannot comply with polite requests.
 Because I\'m furniture.
 ......But,
 ............I will comply with it if it\'s an order.
 ...Because that is my duty."
"Ahaha, then I\'ll make it an order.
 From now on, if Battler‐kun tries to touch your breasts, you are to counterattack with a slap.
 Alright?"
"......Y‐yes.
 As you command.
 That is what I will do from now on.
 Battler‐sama, I hope you can keep this in mind..."
So Shannon‐chan declared, while bowing elegantly to me.
Her facial expression was radiant.
{n}I gave her a thumbs‐up to signal "you got it".
"Six years ago, you might\'ve been mistaken for a servant\'s daughter who just came in to lend a hand sometimes,
 ......but now you\'re a full‐fledged adult servant.
 How many years has it been?"
"Well,
 I\'ve had the pleasure of serving this household for about ten years."
She\'s {p:0:紗音}.
 ......The kanji for her name are read as "Shannon".
{n}This is another far‐from‐typical name for a Japanese person.
Being a kid back in those days, I had taken in her name without paying it much attention,
 but for her to be called something like that is pretty unusual given that she isn\'t even a member of the Ushiromiya family.
...Maybe it\'s like a servant\'s "professional name" or something.
...If so, I can kind of understand why that Kanon‐kun\'s name sounds the way it does, too.
She\'s a long‐term servant who\'s served here since she was six.
Since her body had changed radically, she didn\'t match my memories, but we used to know each other six years ago.
It looked like she was just as shy as she had been in the past, but I got the sense that she had become imbued with the charm befitting a girl her age.
Especially her breasts, her breasts.
"That kid we met earlier, Kanon‐kun, is her little brother."
"...He\'s not exactly my little brother...
 Still, he loves me like a big sister.
 ...He didn\'t cause you any trouble, did he?"
"Haha!
 He\'s the same as always.
 It\'s such a shame that he doesn\'t act just a bit more sociable."
"...It seems Kanon‐kun has caused trouble... I apologize......"
"He didn\'t cause any trouble at all!
 As a fellow man, I understand how moody you can get at that age.
 It\'s no surprise that he\'s unsociable!"
"Uu!
 I get called that all the time too!
 Get called unsociable!
 Like Kanon!
 Uu!"
"*giggle*......Maria‐sama, you are not unsociable at all."
"Uu?
 It was nice to be like him...
 Uu."
"Umm, you said the meal was ready, right?"
"Ah, ......yes!
 My apologies!
 ...The preparations for your meal have been carried out, so I shall be guiding you all to the mansion."
Shannon bowed again formally and returned to her "duty mode".
We realized that if we made her stick around for any more light conversation,
 it would actually make it harder for her to do her job, so we got up off our butts to avoid interfering with her work any further.
"Shall we go to the mansion, then?
 You\'re all probably starting to get hungry as well, right?"
"Sure am.
 I always look forward to meals when Gohda‐san\'s here cooking.
 That guy, seems he was a chef at this famous hotel, so he\'s super good at it!"
"Oh‐hoh!
 I\'m looking forward to tha~t!!
 Let\'s go Maria!
 We\'re gonna stuff ourselves like pigs!!"
"Uu!
 Stuff ourselves like pigs!"
"No, no!
 You can\'t just take everything Battler‐kun says seriously, OK?
 Because it\'s all jokes.
 Come on, let\'s go."
Under Shannon‐chan\'s guidance, we headed towards the mansion.
Met once again by the magnificent rose garden, we continued onward as it came into view: .........the imposing mansion of the Ushiromiya main family.
It had apparently been built shortly after the war, so you could feel the dignity of almost a half‐century hanging about it.
On the surface, the building was gorgeous, but being as old as it was, it was seemingly lacking in modern amenities like air conditioning.
According to Jessica, midwinter was especially tough, what with all the drafts.
...Well, it\'s not like they couldn\'t just take the {c:86ef9c:kotatsu} out.
As we entered the entrance hall, an aged servant greeted us.
{n}Now him I remembered.
As the most senior member of the staff, Genji‐san ({p:0:源次}) served as the head of the servants.
"............Battler‐sama, we have not met in a long while."
As our eyes met, he saluted us with a composed voice.
He didn\'t give quite as refined a bow as Gohda\'s,
 but it was a bow that had feeling, even if it wasn\'t polished to the same degree.
"Genji‐san, it\'s been absolutely ages!
 You look well."
"Thank you, I have been quite well...
 ......And you, Battler‐sama, I see have become a splendid young man yourself.
 .........I would even say you have grown to somewhat resemble the Master during his youth."
"I\'m looking like Grandfather?
 I guess that means Grandfather was pretty popular when he was young, ihihi!"
".........From here on, I shall take Shannon\'s place and accompany you.
 Please, come this way."
Shannon‐chan bowed deeply and saw us off.
Leaving the entrance hall, we headed to the dining hall under Genji‐san\'s guidance.
Genji‐san, just like Kumasawa‐san, stood in stark contrast to us young people who had grown beyond recognition over the last six years.
His figure was exactly the same as in my memories of six years ago.
{n}It seemed like time had stopped since the last we met.
Genji‐san was a silent and diligent person.
{n}He was like Grandfather\'s close aide or caregiver,
 ......in fact, you could even go so far as to say he was Grandfather\'s right‐hand man.
Actually, it seems that he was by Grandfather\'s side more than my late Grandmother was.
According to Jessica, Grandfather trusts him more than any of his blood relatives.
But I wonder how long he\'s served.
{n}I\'ve never asked for details, but I think I heard he\'s been here since the beginning, when this mansion was constructed.
...That is to say, he\'s dedicated half of his life to serving here.
 ...No wonder Grandfather trusts him.
As we cut through the open‐ceilinged hall behind Genji‐san,
......I found something I had no memory of from six years ago.
It was an awfully big portrait hung right in front of the stairs that rose to the second floor.
Without thinking, I stopped walking, under its spell...
{n}Since I\'d suddenly stopped, Maria, who was following behind me, ran into my back.
"Uu?"
"......Aah, sorry.
 ...Hey, Jessica.
 Did that picture use to be there?"
I pointed at the large and conspicuous portrait hanging in the hall.
{n}Everyone else stopped too.
"...Ahh...right.
 When you last came here, that hadn\'t been hung yet, had it?
 When was it again..."
"I think,
 ......if my memory doesn\'t fail me, it was around the year before last."
"............You are correct.
 In April of the year before last, the Master had this painting put on display, which he had instructed an artist to paint for him some time prior."
"Grandfather did that?
 So, he went out of his way to have it drawn..."
The portrait depicted a woman in an elegant dress, who gave off a sense of refinement, and who seemed to suit the Western style of this mansion.
.........I couldn\'t have guessed her age, but the sharpness and obvious strength of will in her eyes gave me the impression of youth.
It was a different feeling than the composed mood of middle‐aged women that are often in famous pictures.
If this woman had normal black hair, I might have thought it was a portrait of my long‐deceased grandmother in her prime.
However, the woman in the portrait had beautiful golden hair, and didn\'t look Japanese at all.
"So.
 ......Who is she then, this woman?"
As though trying to show off her knowledge, Maria answered that simple question with authority.
"Uu!
 I know.
 {f:5:Beatrice}!"
"Bea......what?"
"......{f:5:Beatrice}.
 She\'s the witch.
 Didn\'t you ever hear about her, long ago?"
"The witch?
 ...You mean...
.........of this island?"
...I think I already said this, but Rokkenjima is a small island that\'s only about ten kilometers around.
However, considering that only the Ushiromiya family lives here, that\'s quite large.
So, only a harbor and the site around the mansion were set up to be lived in;
 beyond that, the island remained as untouched as it was when it was still uninhabited.
To understand just how dangerous a vast and empty forest with no lamplight, phones or people passing through it at all actually is,
 you need to shift your urban assumptions a little.
You see, if by any chance you fell down a hole in the depths of the forest and sprained your ankle...
cry or scream, no one would come save you.
If it then got dark, the forest, where there are no streetlights, would become enshrouded in complete darkness.
Also, since there obviously aren\'t any guideposts here, it\'s easy to get lost and lose your sense of direction in the dark forest.
Nowadays, most people see a forest as a peaceful place,
 but to the people of bygone eras, before the light of civilization drove out the night, forests were like oceans on land, geographically separating one culture from another.
Just as fishermen who go out into the ocean occasionally have their lives put in danger despite their technical knowledge...
...technical knowledge was also demanded of hunters who went out into the forest,
 and their lives were occasionally put in danger just the same.
...If a child were to go play in that dangerous forest, something terrible might happen.
Some parent must have had that thought.
 ...Maybe my Grandmother, or possibly, the man himself, my grandfather might have said it.
Or maybe it was a story handed down on this island from long, long ago.
{i:.........There\'s a terrible witch in the forest, so you must not go in.}
Thus, Rokkenjima\'s ghost story was born.
{n}That is the legend of the witch of Rokkenjima.
So, when we say "witch" on this island, we\'re referring to the master of the vast and savage forest.
Which reminds me, when I was little and stayed at this mansion, during the eerie nights where the wind and rain struck the windows,
 stories like "the witch of the forest is roaming around in search of a sacrifice" would scare the heck out of me...
{f:5:Beatrice},
 ...huh.
.........As I searched my memory prompted by Aniki, I did vaguely remember being told that was her name, when I was very small.
"...Riiight.
 Still, I completely forgot that the witch of that legend had an elegant name like {f:5:Beatrice}.
 ......Goddamn, don\'t tell me Grandfather went out of his way to have her depicted in this painting just because us grandchildren refused to believe him?"
"......It\'s the witch from Grandfather\'s delusions.
 ...Ever since he had this picture hung up, he\'s been losing the distinction between fantasy and reality."
"......To us, it\'s no more than the witch from his imagination, but to Grandfather, she\'s a being who "exists" on this island.
 ......‘Exists’.
 That\'s why he says he had that picture painted—so that we\'d understand."
".........Hmpf, creeps the hell outta me."
"........................Milady.
 ...To the Master, this is an important portrait.
 ......I must request strongly that you not say such a thing in front of him."
".........I know that.
 You couldn\'t get me to say it even if you begged me."
Jessica turned away, after glaring a second at the portrait.
"...Let\'s go.
 We\'re making everyone wait in the dining hall."
"Uu!
 Hungry!"
......Only a small portion of this island is controlled by the Ushiromiya family.
If all of the wild remainder...was the witch {f:5:Beatrice}\'s domain...
......then one could say that she was the being who actually ruled over Rokkenjima.
That unsettling ominous feeling I had felt on the boat trip, when I learned that the shrine had been struck by lightning, revived within me a bit.
At that time, Kumasawa‐san had tried to tell an ominous story about Rokkenjima and had been stopped by Jessica.
.........I didn\'t know what she had tried to tell us about this island.
But, there was one thing I did know.
{n}...Rokkenjima\'s ruler was not the Ushiromiya family.
It was the witch, {f:5:Beatrice}.
{n}Yes.
 ......Because this was the witch\'s island.
"Battlerrr!
 Uu, slooww!"
When I looked around, everyone was already heading towards the dining hall.
{n}I hurriedly chased after them...
We walked up to the huge double doors that led to the dining hall.
Genji‐san knocked.
"......I have brought the children.
 If you will excuse me..."
The door was opened and we were invited inside.
The dining hall, which screamed "filthy rich", featured a super‐long table which was obviously designed with no other purpose than to make the guests conscious of their rank,
 and our parents were already seated at it in accordance with that ordering.
"You\'re late, brats.
 Hurry up and take your seats."
The old bastard pressed us to sit.
Only the places where we would sit were empty at the long table, which only made us feel our tardiness all the more.
The seat at the very head of the table, which you might call the seat of honor, was for the most highly ranked, and reserved for Grandfather.
It was still empty.
{n}...He was probably planning to come in last to make himself look important.
The seating order, as you faced the seat of honor, went from left to right in rows of two, with the ranking being lower the further you were from it.
So, on the left‐hand side of the row closest to the seat of honor was the second‐ranked seat, belonging to the eldest of the adult siblings—Uncle Krauss.
.........It looked like he hadn\'t arrived yet either, so that seat was empty.
And then opposite him, on the right‐hand side of the first row, sat the eldest daughter of the family, Auntie Eva, ranked at number three.
The left‐hand side of the second row was for number four.
{n}There sat the old bastard, Rudolf, as the third of the siblings.
Opposite him sat number five, the youngest sibling, Auntie Rosa.
Going like this, you might think that the next ones to come would be their husbands and wives, but...
guess again, because the left‐hand seat in the following third row, meaning rank number six, was actually Jessica\'s seat.
Opposite her was George‐aniki.
Then, the seat next to Jessica was me,
 and opposite me was Maria.
And next to me, on the left‐hand side of the fifth row, all the way down at number ten, finally came Aunt Natsuhi.
...Opposite her was Uncle Hideyoshi,
 and next to Aunt Natsuhi, in the sixth and final row on the left‐hand side, was Kyrie‐san.
The seat opposite to Kyrie‐san had been laid out like the others, but was empty.
According to this ranking system, that spot was the seat where Auntie Rosa\'s husband should be sitting.
......He hasn\'t come, as far as I know, yet the table had been laid for his seat.
These kind of ranking orders usually permit the spouse a corresponding status, but the Ushiromiya family had an original kind of ranking.
......Maybe it\'s a leftover of male chauvinism.
{n}Under the notion that a mother\'s womb is only a temporary house for the child and she contributes no genes, the children of direct descent would have the highest ranking, followed by the grandkids.
Meaning that the spouses, with no blood ties, would be considered the last in line.
......It\'s terrible, but according to that ranking order, Grandmother, if she was still alive,
 would be in a position even lower than mine.
In youth, obey your father; after marriage, your husband; after aging, your children.
A leftover of the times when they used to say, "Women: no home in three worlds".
Long ago, when I was still incapable of figuring all this out,
 I\'d thought it was so great that we could all chat with the adult siblings sitting in their group and us cousins in ours.
 However, now that I can reexamine the seating order after growing up a bit, it stirs up some very complicated feelings in me...
Aunt Natsuhi, married to the eldest son of the family, responsible for managing the household, and number two for all practical intents and purposes, sat to my right,
 ...which meant that she was two steps lower than me in the ranking order.
...It was difficult to guess what was going through her head.
{n}That\'s why I made a small apologetic gesture before sitting down.
"How nice to see you, Battler‐kun.
 You\'ve grown quite tall, haven\'t you?"
"Huh, ah, yeah!
 Normal life—you know, food, meals, eating—then suddenly I was this tall."
"Boys do grow fast, don\'t they?
 How tall are you?"
"I guess about 180 cm?
 No, wait, you missed your moment, you\'re supposed to jump in with "Did you do anything besides eat?!""
"Huh?
 ......Ahh, *giggle*, I\'m sorry."
After a moment, she gave a small laugh, but it seemed she couldn\'t quite figure out what she was supposed to be laughing at.
This woman is Aunt Natsuhi ({p:0:夏妃}).
She\'s the wife of the eldest son of the family, meaning she is my dad\'s older brother\'s wife.
Is it easier to get it if I call her Jessica\'s mother?
...It feels bad to say it like this, but—not that I hated her—but I didn\'t particularly like her.
She never got into our kids\' circle, and my only impression of her was as someone who always talked about complicated stuff with my parents while having a crabby expression on her face.
...The fact is, that having barely ever exchanged words, I hesitated a lot even just now about how to approach her.
...Aaand it was pretty much a flop.
The silverware had been tidily set up on the table, but the meal itself hadn\'t been brought in.
As a rule, the meal doesn\'t start until the man at the head of the table has taken his seat.
{n}So, as long as Grandfather—the highest ranked—didn\'t come, lunch would be indefinitely on hold.
 Not even the appetizers would come.
In other words, this silence in the dining hall was the sound of our parents as they withstood their hunger and waited, on tenterhooks, for Grandfather to come.
Except—the Grandfather I remembered always showed up at the right time when we ate together like this.
...He wouldn\'t ever have been so late as to have everyone else waiting on him.
"Grandfather\'s pretty late.
 ......As far as I can remember, he was always strict about staying on time."
"Well, maybe six years ago, yeah.
 ...But not lately.
 Seriously, he\'s off in his own little world now—he doesn\'t even show up at family meals.
 ...I figured he\'d at least stick around for today\'s meal, though."
"...That said, if he doesn\'t turn up, I\'ll be a hell of a lot more relaxed and happier to boot."
"...Jessica!"
After being scolded by her mother, Jessica faced the other way, sticking her tongue out.
......No way around it.
{n}Nothing to do but wait for the host to arrive.
When I glanced at the clock, I saw that it was almost twenty minutes past twelve...
The aged master of the Ushiromiya head house, Ushiromiya Kinzo ({p:0:金蔵}).
{n}He was there in his study.
The clock showed noon, but he didn\'t even attempt to get up.
With reading glasses on his face, he stacked up old‐fashioned books with elaborately designed bindings one on top of another beside him, immersing himself in their reading.
It definitely didn\'t look like it was for his leisure; on the contrary, he exuded impatience, crisis, as though every minute, every second were precious.
The sealed room was dense with dancing dust particles, and the air stagnated with a mix of smells of various elixirs, each giving off its own suspicious stench.
...They were somehow sweet, and heavy.
For anyone with a good nose, the first thing they\'d do after entering would be to open a window and ventilate the room.
The knocking against the study door had been going on for a while.
A voice calling "Father" sometimes mingled with the knocks.
As Kinzo heaved a deep sigh, he snapped shut the old book he had in his hands, and slammed it on the table.
Then, he yelled at Krauss who was continuing to knock on the door.
"Silence!!
 Will you not stop that noise, fool!!!
 Who taught you that doors shall be opened unto you if you knock?!
 They crucified that imbecile!!
 Do you wish the same upon yourself?!!"
"......Father.
 Today is the day of the family conference—it comes just once a year.
 Everyone has gathered downstairs.
 Please come out."
Krauss called out to his father through the door.
{n}...Kinzo always shut himself up in the study and hated letting even his family into the room.
For that reason, Krauss had no choice but to call out thus from the corridor...
"Molest me not!!
 Everyone? Who is "everyone"?! You refer to the fools trying to drag me out of here?!!"
"Then kill them all!
 Chop them up, make them into firewood, feed them to the witch\'s hearth!!
 Put a pot in that hearth and boil wormwood!
 And if still there remain imbeciles foolish enough to dare try to lure me out of here, force them to drink that broth of the Apocalypse!
 Preserve the remainder in liquor!"
"Aah, Genji, where are you?!
 Call for Genji!!
 Have my demonic absinthe prepared!
 The whispering of the green fairy reaches me no longer!!
 Aah, where is Genji, call for GenjiiIii!!!"
...Before the door, Krauss, Nanjo, and Genji kept waiting for the master of the house, who would not come out.
"Hmph...
 ......Looks like he hates me to his core.
 My voice doesn\'t reach him anymore."
Krauss shrugged as though saying "It\'s no use", and smiled bitterly.
...He himself hadn\'t believed for a moment that his father would answer his calls.
{n}However, as it was the duty of the eldest son, he had formally made the request.
"......Kinzo‐san.
 Your sons, daughters, and grandchildren have come to see you, you know...
 How about you show your face, just a little...?"
"Shut up, be silent!!!
 You dare admonish me, Nanjo?!!
 I do not call for you, I said to call for Genji!!
 Now hurry, call for him this instant!
 Time is short—the apostles are already readying their trumpets—why do you not understand this, you foolish sheep!!"
Kinzo slammed the old, heavy book on the table over and over.
{n}The racket obviously indicated his highest displeasure.
Kinzo put his spectacles down and flew up from his chair.
He spread his arms wide open, as if to sing to a packed opera house, as if appealing to someone, and yelled.
"Why?!
 Why is there always something in my way?!
 I would throw it all away, I would offer up everything, and there is only one thing I ask in repayment!!"
"Ohh, {f:5:Beatrice}, if I could see your smile but one more time, I would plunder the smiles of the Earth and offer them all up to you!!
 Oooh, commanders of the locust legions, reap the smiles of the Earth, *coughcough*, *haaack* *kofkof*!!!
 Ahh, all is filthy, all is irksome!!"
"Why must I suffer this impediment on this most precious of days?!?!
 *haaack*kofkofkof*!!
 *cough*cough*!!!
 Call for GenjiiIii!!!
 *haaack*kofkof*!!"
"......I have no idea what he\'s yelling.
 I guess he\'s finally gone nuts."
"Krauss‐san...
 Isn\'t that a bit harsh, to your birth father..."
"My dad is already dead.
 ......All that\'s here is a phantom of what he once was.
 At any rate, as long as he lacks the will to leave that room, there\'s nothing we can do."
".....................Kinzo‐san."
Choking coughs continued to pour from the study...
"I\'m going back downstairs.
 ......It would be a waste to let that lunch Gohda\'s so proud of get any colder.
 It\'s one of the few things the others have to look forward to here.
 ...Hmph."
Krauss spun on his heels.
He looked at his wristwatch, mumbling and acting as though he had wasted time doing something he knew would be in vain.
"Genji‐san.
 ......Father is calling for you.
 Keep him company."
".........Certainly."
"Doctor Nanjo.
 Let\'s go eat.
 ......If we stay here any longer, even our sense of taste will go insane from this sweet smell."
Without waiting for Nanjo, Krauss went downstairs.
Genji urged Nanjo to go and eat.
...Nanjo looked first to Krauss\'s back as he disappeared down the stairs, then to the study door, and he let out a deep sigh.
"......Sorry, Genji‐san.
 Please."
"Yes, ......please leave it to me."
"If possible, don\'t give him alcohol.
 ......It\'s too powerful a habit."
"Is Genji not here yet?!!!
 Who dares keep Genji from coming?!!
 Ahh, where is Genji, call for Genji!!!"
"Now,
 ......please leave it to me."
"...Mm.
 .........Sorry."
Nanjo gave a small duck of his head and descended the stairs...
Genji saw him off, and knocked at the study door.
"..........My lord.
 It is Genji."
"Genji!!
 Why must you make me wait so long?!!
 There is no one there, I trust?!"
"Yes.
 I am alone."
Kinzo returned to his seat in the study and pressed an old‐fashioned switch on the table.
...After a small delay, the heavy sound of the door unlocking could be heard.
Kinzo believed that his family might try to break into his study.
Perhaps someone once opened the window for some air and scattered some important documents or something,
 and that had made him extremely upset.
...Now, Kinzo had placed a secure lock in his room,
 making it so that without his permission nobody could enter, and locking himself in the dungeon he himself created.
Genji, who he trusted the most, was relatively free to enter the room, but even that was not absolute.
If Kinzo was in a bad mood, even he wouldn\'t be able to enter.
.........Anyone else would be limited to holding a conversation through the door, not even seeing his face.
And most of the time, they wouldn\'t even get a real conversation.
However, that didn\'t pose any particular problem for the family.
That was because they had no reason to go out of their way to interfere with the retirement of the cantankerous and aged head; the fact that he was completely immersed in his odd research and always locked up in his hideaway was something of a benefit.
......They made the most of his refusal to leave the study, entrusting him to the hands of the servants, while they themselves kept their distance.
"Genji, my usual.
 I\'m busy."
"......Yes."
Genji headed to a corner of the study.
{n}There, suspicious‐looking bottles boasting venomous colors were on display.
...They were actually liquor, but considering that they were placed in this shady‐looking room, you could almost suspect that they might be ghastly poisons.
The inside of the study was filled with the mountainous library of outlandish books that Kinzo had amassed.
They were bizarre old books, some banned, and each and every one of them either forbidden, cursed, or sealed.
Of course, if one were to actually call them old books, Kinzo would fly into a rage and say something like this:
{i:"Call them...}
{i:grimoires!"}
There were candles which had melted in a suspicious‐looking fashion and taken on peculiar forms, and all manner of other strange objects, probably having something to do with black magic.
The constellations covering the celestial globe would have caused anyone who knew the night sky well to raise an eyebrow.
The illustrations inscribed in old books, haphazardly left open, ranged from the religious and mystical...
to the demonic and grotesque, as well as bizarre diagrams of various magic circles.
And above all, the sweet, poisonous smell that filled the room,
 which to those entering for the first time would surely be a profound assault on their sense of sight, smell, and all their other senses, making them lose their grip on reality...
Inside that study, Genji, with his well trained hand, prepared Kinzo\'s usual drink.
If you didn\'t know that the ghastly dark green liquid that filled the complexly designed bottle was liquor, you certainly wouldn\'t want to put it in your mouth.
......He poured a small quantity of the spirit into the glass,
 placed a cube of sugar in a strangely shaped spoon, and then poured water from a pitcher over it.
Strangely, when the colorless water was poured into it, the dark green liquid turned a cloudy white.
...It created the strange visual illusion that the water had caused a chemical reaction, which made it all the more difficult to perceive the concoction as liquor.
To this, he added an original flavoring that Kinzo liked, and fine‐tuned the taste.
...There was no recipe.
 Its success was measured only by Kinzo\'s mood swing when he drank it, and he had learned how to make it only after many decades.
Genji placed the glass on a tray, and made his way over to Kinzo.
{n}Kinzo was now gazing out the window.
".........As you asked, my lord."
"Thank you..."
Kinzo had regained his composure—so much so that he was now unrecognizable as the man who had been shouting, screaming and yelling just moments before.
In that man\'s back dwelt a dignity and intelligence made plain simply by how he tilted his glass and gazed down at the scenery beyond the window.
Genji, in order to allow Kinzo to set down his glass any time,
 motionlessly waited behind and to his left, as though he were a living sideboard.
 As he did, Kinzo stuck out just the glass, his gaze still directed at the world outside the window.
There was just a mouthful remaining.
It was not a gesture intended to set it upon the tray, as Genji expected, but was a motion to hand the glass over to Genji.
"......Drink it.
 ...My friend."
".....................That is more than I deserve."
"No need for ceremony between us.
 ......Drink it.
 Friend."
"...............Thank you."
Genji respectfully received the glass and inclined it a little to taste its contents.
Then, he downed it in one gulp.
"I attempted to imitate your concoction, but no matter how I try, I cannot replicate the taste.
 ......The way you make it is pure relish."
".........Thank you very much.
 It is the fruit of your guidance, my lord."
"Hmph..."
Kinzo smiled at his loyal subject who refused to put aside rank even when asked to.
However, he was not making fun of him; it was relaxed, like a smile at a close friend\'s unriddable bad habit.
".........We have grown old, you and I.
 I forgot my age a long time ago."
"That I was permitted to live the life I have until today has all been thanks to you, my lord."
Kinzo gave a thin smile, as if to say he didn\'t need compliments.
".........You have served me exceedingly well these years.
 ......My sons call me eccentric.
 The servants that were once many, all of them, retired in their growing fear of me.
 ......Only you, even now, serve me."
"...That is more than I deserve."
".........I doubt I have much time left to live.
 ......My sons are vultures, lazily waiting for my inheritance to fall into their hands."
"........................"
"That fool Krauss squanders money like water, throws away two gold coins to obtain one.
 With that, he deludes himself into saying he earned money!!
 Eva is a slave to money, thinking of me as a hen or whatnot!!
 As if when I die, she\'ll even use my carcass to make broth!!"
"That dunce Rudolf just wants to fool around with women!!
 Rosa bore the baby of a nobody!!
 Jessica is incompetent and illiterate!!
 George has none of what it takes to be a man!
 Battler is a fool who threw away the honor of the Ushiromiya family!!
 And Maria is obscene to the eye!!"
"Why, why is the Ushiromiya blood so incompetent?!!
 Is there anyone worthy to inherit the glory I built?!
 Ahh, of course, I know, this is {f:5:Beatrice}\'s curse, I know it!!
 ...Aah, Golden Witch, is this supposed to be your revenge against me?"
"Hate me if you wish!
 Run away if you wish!!
 I won\'t let you go, I won\'t let you go won\'t let you go won\'t let you go!!
 You are mine!!
 You cannot be anywhere but in my arms!
 You are my entire life!"
"You\'ll continue to whisper for all eternity in my bird cage to me, only to me!!
 {f:5:Beatrice}......
 Why...won\'t you give me back your smile...
 OOOoooooh, OOOooOOOoooh...!!
 {f:5:BeatriceeEeEEeeEee}!!
 OOOoooOOOOoohh......"
After howling, Kinzo choked once again.
{n}Genji set the tray and the glass down and patted his master\'s back...
Genji\'s facial expression did not change.
{n}.........It was always like this.
"............*cough*...
 Hmhm.
 ............Thank you, my friend."
"........................"
After his almost deranged outburst of the past few minutes settled down, Kinzo regained his composure once more.
...The way his attitude changed was like seeing two different people, a wild Kinzo and a composed Kinzo, living together inside one body.
"And so,
 ......I have decided.
 .....................I cannot stand spending the insipid remainder of my life procrastinating like this.
 If I have any final coins left to gamble, then I choose to abandon them all to the whims of the Demons\' Roulette."
"......The power of magic is always determined by the risk staked upon it.
 Like visiting a shrine at the Hour of the Ox in ancient Japanese sorcery, to nail a curse doll to a tree.
 The magic power dwells in incurring the risk that it will be seen before seven days pass.
 The more dangerous the risk, the stronger the magic power will be."
"All the various miracles that appear in myth can be called crystals of astonishing magic power, obtained through miraculously low probabilities and astronomical risks!"
"That Moses parted the sea was no miracle of God\'s—
it was that utterly desperate risk, weighed upon the scales of oppression, of being cornered by soldiers on the Red Sea\'s shores, which gave birth to miraculous magic power!
 Even if the same thing occurs again, on the same scope, the sea will no doubt not part."
"That is because Moses managed to spectacularly draw out the single miracle carved in the roulette of those in power, which has more pockets than {c:86EF9C:asougi (10⁵⁶) and nayuta (10⁶⁰)} multiplied together."
"The power to triumph over astronomical odds!!
 Yes, magical power is, in other words, having the luck to grasp miracles!!
 To obtain great magical power, one must bear a risk that is hopelessly great!!
 Those who possess no magic would call this not a bet, but pure desperation!"
"However, those who truly do possess magical power can grasp hold of that miracle and make the enigma come into being!!
 And if that power exists within me!
 I will seize that miracle, I will be able to make the wish I devoted my life towards come true!!"
Kinzo looked up to the sky outside the window.
{n}He spread his arms as if appealing to someone up in the skies.
"And if...!!!
 If I were to have what it takes to obtain that miracle...!!
 .........Oooh...
{f:5:Beatrice}...
{f:5:Beatrice}...
 Show me your lovely smile once more..."
"No matter how much time passes, your face does not vanish...
 I just want to see your smile...that is all...!
 I\'ll return everything you granted me!
 I\'ll return all the glory I\'ve gained since that day!
 I don\'t need fortune, prestige, gold!!
 I\'ll return everything you granted me!!"
"I just want to see your smile!!
 I beg of you, {f:5:Beatrice}!!
 OOOoooooOooh...oOoOOoh...ooh...!!"
......His nonsensical yells segued into a scream, ...and then into a wail.
Kinzo crumpled onto the floor, and clawed at it with both hands.
Genji had no choice but to wordlessly watch over his master\'s lament...
"Well, ladies and gentlemen.
 ......The head of the family is not in his best shape.
 He considers it a great shame that he will not be able to partake in lunch with you all, you having assembled especially for this long‐awaited yearly meeting."
"......Gohda, let the lunch begin."
"Certainly. Well then, ladies and gentlemen, we shall begin today\'s luncheon."
"......Doctor Nanjo, is Father\'s condition that bad?
 Surely he could have at least showed his face?"
"Rather than his physical condition, it\'s his mood...
 And for that, there is no medicine I can prescribe."
"Oh, come on, for God\'s sake, "mood", again?
 We come to hear how he\'s doing, making time in our schedules in this damn busy season of autumn.
 That\'s just—"
"Hmph...then you got what you wanted, Rudolf.
 You managed to {i:hear how he\'s doing}.
 ......Or do you want to take my place, and try to persuade our ill‐humored father to come join us?"
"............Are you kidding?"
Rudolf shrugged.
Apparently, even though Rudolf seemed to resent the way his father did whatever he pleased, he\'d rather avoid seeing his face if he could help it.
"Does it seem like his mood will improve before dinner?
 Krauss nii‐san?"
"I have no idea.
 You can try to ask Father directly.
 ...Although, I think his mood will improve faster if we don\'t bother him."
"The only one who can bring Grandfather\'s temper under control is Genji‐san.
 Pretty damn pathetic when you have to have a servant to deal with your own parent\'s bad mood."
"Jessica.
 Don\'t speak out of turn."
She\'d planned for her complaint to be heard only by her cousins, but it had reached even Krauss\'s ears.
Scolded, Jessica scowled and turned away, sulking.
"......His condition can\'t be that bad, can it, with that kinda temper?
 I mean, if they were saying he\'s not feeling well that\'d be one thing, but if it\'s his mood that\'s bad, at least it\'s proof he\'s got some fight in him."
"Well, Grandfather does have especially strong willpower.
 ...But, it doesn\'t mean that his body will always follow that.
 Since last year, they keep saying that he has three months left."
"...If the initial diagnosis was correct, Grandfather has been prolonging his life by willpower alone.
 ......We have to be concerned for him."
Lunch started with the family head\'s seat still empty.
...The man who should have been sitting there was already old,
 and the brilliant glory which had rebuilt the Ushiromiya family in a single lifetime was slowly being forgotten.
Nobody seemed to feel uncomfortable when the meal began with that seat still empty...The Ushiromiya family conference was held once every year.
{n}It took place on the first weekend of October.
If a normal family were to use a pretentious name like "family conference",
 you\'d expect it to be nothing more than a reunion of rarely seen relatives who greet each other surrounded by buckets of sushi.
However, in the Ushiromiya family, where the sons and siblings are lent great fortunes,
 and only those that achieve success in business are considered adults, it literally was a conference.
How much of the fortune was invested? What kind of business was conducted? How much was earned?
As a result, how much of the fortune borrowed from the main family could be repaid?
{n}Or, alternatively, how much would be borrowed for future business ventures?
{n}What lessons had they learned, and what could they learn from their mistakes?
It seems that topics like these had been discussed very seriously in the past.
My dad called it a bed of nails.
Apparently, it used to be a very serious family meeting, where one would commonly be showered with harsh and angry voices, and even get slapped in the face despite being well past the age for it.
However, that was all a thing of the past.
By now, everyone had achieved success in their own independent business ventures,
 and it was on the road to becoming a normal yearly get‐together.
Even so, being asked by Grandfather about the current state of play was an extremely stress‐inducing event,
 and while to us grandchildren it was nothing more than a simple meeting, to our parents it was still a real stomachache.
The absence of the man responsible for all this, whatever the reason behind it, must surely have made today\'s lunch even more delicious.
The phrase "when the cat is away, the mice will play" comes to mind.
Well then, let me introduce Jessica\'s father, whose face I haven\'t seen for six years.
The man sitting to my dad\'s left is his older brother and the father of Jessica,
 Uncle {p:0:蔵臼}.
......This name sure is easy to read.
 Krauss ({p:0:蔵臼}).
...After so many weird names, it warps your sense of what\'s normal, and you start to think,
 "hey, what\'s wrong with Krauss,
 sounds pretty cool actually"...
Just like with Aunt Natsuhi, I don\'t have many memories of speaking with Uncle Krauss.
He had never been one to talk to children, and I felt like he was always talking with the adults, just like Aunt Natsuhi.
From the way my dad talked about him, it seems that he used to be a pretty spiteful and unreasonable person.
If what Dad said is true, he used to be very domineering as the oldest sibling,
 and was hated by Auntie Eva, Auntie Rosa, and the rest of the family.
......Odd, considering they\'re all having fun chatting together.
Well, I guess even if their relationship was bad when they were children, sometimes when people grow up and go their separate ways, their relationship changes.
That\'s probably what this is.
After all, they all have children of about the same age.
Since they share similar family environments, they probably all profit by exchanging opinions.
Maybe because of that, the parents\' circle has been deep in conversation for a while now about the exams Jessica and I are going to be taking.
Jessica, in order to escape the discussion of exams with the old bastard sitting on her left,
 was purposefully facing to the right, firing off topic after topic so as not to give him an opening.
Moving on, let\'s look at the end opposite from Uncle Krauss and the others.
In the very last seat at the table, an old gentleman with a sturdy physique sat facing Kyrie‐san.
 This was my first time meeting him.
I had only just been introduced to him, but it seems that he\'s Grandfather\'s personal doctor, a man called Nanjo ({p:0:南條}).
Apparently he used to own a huge clinic on the nearby Niijima island, but he turned it over to his son and then began living a life of leisure in his old age.
He\'s known Grandfather since the very beginning when the mansion was first constructed on this island, and they have a history going back several decades.
I thought he might be Grandfather\'s companion in his suspicious hobbies, but, surprisingly, it seems that he\'s Grandfather\'s chess partner.
......I see, that kind of hobby does seem very like our grandfather, with his love of Western style.
You could probably also call him the only person able to enter Rokkenjima who is neither a family member nor a servant.
From listening in on his conversation with the womenfolk seated near him, he gave the impression of a calm old gentleman.
......Considering he\'s managed to put up with our short‐tempered grandfather for so long, I\'m sure his big heart is nothing to laugh at.
...Still, even if he is his doctor, having someone from outside the Ushiromiya family attending the family conference is a little odd.
From that fact, I imagine that Grandfather\'s condition has grown much worse,
 and it may even be one of the major topics of discussion at the family conference...
George‐aniki was just saying it, too.
{n}For the past year, Grandfather has been continually pronounced as having very little time left to live.
...It\'s awful to talk about, but Grandfather is an extremely rich man.
{n}At the time of his death, his wealth will suddenly be released, along with our parents\' stomach acid, surely leading to some serious ulcers.
With this kind of thing, the greater the number of ways it must be split, the more trouble will be caused splitting it.
...This kind of talk would probably also be included in the family conference.
{n}...Oh well, it\'s not like it has anything to do with us children.
......Finally, even though he\'s absent, let me introduce our Grandfather.
The person who should be sitting in that seat of honor is Ushiromiya Kinzo ({p:0:金蔵}).
...It really sucks.
 He gave everyone else in the family these weird names, but he himself uses one which is conservative as all hell.
If only his name were written with those same characters for "gold" and "vault", but he let us call him "Goldsmith" or something,
 that\'d be totally awesome!
As you can probably gather from all the talk about him, he\'s a frightening person with an extremely short temper.
...Because I\'m just his grandkid, and haven\'t met him since I was in elementary school six years ago,
 I don\'t remember ever having been beaten by him, but it seems that our parents were raised with an iron fist.
That earlier conversation between my dad and Uncle Krauss,
 about who should go try to convince Grandfather to come out, seems oddly funny if you take this into account.
In order to tell Grandfather\'s story, you have to take yourself all the way back to before the {ruby:1926–1989:Showa} era, to recount the tale of the Ushiromiya family.
Until the {ruby:1868–1912:Meiji} and {ruby:1912–1926:Taisho} eras, the Ushiromiya family was great and prosperous.
They owned several spinning mills, and were very wealthy people who merely had to fall about laughing while the money rolled in.
Incidentally, Grandfather, as a member of a branch family, originally had nothing to do with the main family.
Distantly separated from the head\'s inheritance, he apparently had very little involvement with the head house.
However, during the Great Kanto Earthquake in 1923, the mansion owned by the Ushiromiya main family in Odawara was flattened.
The spinning mills in Tokyo were all burned down in a huge fire,
 and the Ushiromiya family lost most of its wealth and family members in an instant.
It then became a matter of who would become the heir to the main family, and as it turned out, none were left except for Kinzo, who was as far removed from the main family line as they come.
Kinzo himself later said that it was such good luck, it was as though fate itself had been turned upside‐down.
With that, Grandfather\'s ordinary life did a 180.
{n}He was entrusted with reviving the wealth that the dying Ushiromiya family had almost completely lost.
Of course, just because you suddenly dump a task on someone doesn\'t mean they can do squat to accomplish it.
{n}I doubt the people around him were expecting much.
But this is where Grandfather began to display his extraordinary talent and good luck.
Grandfather used all of the family funds, and everything from the hair on his head to his toenails, as collateral to borrow a massive amount of money,
 created a gigantic supply of funds, and immediately started a business.
It was like tumbling down a hill on a bike without any brakes.
And then, jumping onto a neighboring bike, and then another one!
 Just like some crazy street performance.
 Probably, anyone would have thought that Grandfather had no business ability.
But with an unbelievable amount of good luck and miracles, with coincidences piling up and every chance taken advantage of,
 before anyone knew it, he had forged powerful connections with the Allied forces.
At that time, MacArthur and the GHQ were in charge of Japan.
Grandfather, in a twinkle of the eye, began succeeding in business under the protection of the occupying forces, quickly becoming very rich.
At this point, it was no longer luck but information that won the day.
He must have made some seriously thick connections with the occupying forces.
......Grandfather knew about the emergency demands that would be made for the Korean War, before they happened.
No, more than that, he must have foreseen these special procurements and started penetrating those markets from the very beginning.
History textbooks say that all of Japan made a large profit off the emergency demands for the Korean War, but that wasn\'t the case in reality.
Only a very limited number of the super‐rich played the money game and made an easy profit.
Most of the citizens remained poor.
{n}......In other words, Grandfather was an extremely lucky member of this group of winners.
This all happened...during the year {ruby:Showa 25:1950}, I think?
{n}And since the year of the Great Kanto Earthquake was {ruby:Taisho 12:1923}...
......that means Grandfather was able to revive the near‐dead Ushiromiya family, to a level even higher than it had been before, in the span of only twenty to thirty years.
With that, you\'d think that he would revive the main family in Odawara,
 but for some reason, he went and did something as crazy as buying an entire small island in the Izu Archipelago.
Buying an entire island is not something that you can ordinarily do today.
However, Grandfather was clever.
{n}He contacted the GHQ and applied for the establishment of a marine resource base.
He acquired this island as a business property, and then reneged on it and claimed it as his own plot of land.
After the war there were prevention measures against food shortages, and, furthermore, he had the sponsorship of the GHQ, which meant that nobody could oppose him.
It seems that Tokyo provided the land for next to no money at the time.
Tokyo later made repeated complaints for the land to be returned, but not much could be done due to the involvement of the GHQ, even though they\'d been pushed into it.
No doubt he\'d bribed everyone there was to bribe.
{n}In the end, the city gave up in frustration.
Grandfather, with considerable skill and blessed with good luck, managed to weather the stormy seas of that period,
 obtaining a vast fortune and his own island.
Of course, it wasn\'t all luck.
{n}He was skilled with English, and this was cultivated by his Western obsession.
{n}It was by using that as a weapon that he was able to make inroads into the GHQ.
A mansion was immediately built on the island.
 That would be this mansion.
Grandfather, who had always loved the West, made this once uninhabited island, Rokkenjima, a canvas upon which he could realize his dreams to his heart\'s content.
The Western mansion that he had always imagined, overflowing with emotion; the beautiful garden where various roses had been planted.
And a private beach where nobody other than himself would ever be permitted to leave a footprint.
......To have this much would be every man\'s dream.
After that, making good use of his huge fortune,
 he became a large stock holder in the extremely stable iron and steel industry, and was able to live an easy and comfortable life just using the dividends.
Well, he\'s just that incredible.
This kind of person normally gets portrayed after the fact as having the ability to foresee and predict the future or something,
 but Grandfather denies all of that,
 repeatedly saying that he was simply blessed with extraordinary luck...
......Anyway, even a lord like that, with all of his dreams made real,
 can\'t help but grow increasingly odd when locked up alone on an island.
Everyone knows he\'s been obsessed with the West for a very long time,
 ...but none of our parents really knows when his bizarre black magic hobby began.
Perhaps his love of black magic began way back when he became fascinated with the West,
 or, possibly, his miraculous stretch of good luck which allowed him to revive the family caused him to feel a mysterious power in himself.
...At some point, Grandfather began to make the research of black magic his life\'s work,
 filling his study up with suspicious books, chemicals, and magical items as he became increasingly bizarre.
These being the few remaining years of a person successful in life, those around him "warmly" watched over him, feeling the time was his to spend as he pleased...or so I hear, but...
.........No way in hell that\'s true.
 They probably were just driven away, thinking "that\'s disturbing, I don\'t want to get involved".
Well, ...that war‐torn period was a time for big gambles, with both opportunities and risks.
I\'d like to see Grandfather do so well if he\'d been born in this time period.
He would\'ve had no opportunities, and would probably have advanced like a chess piece from mandatory education to college at a leisurely pace,
 never becoming more than an average company employee.
If that had happened, he\'d probably be sitting here with the rest of us, regaling us with tales of his shitty boss.
No, no—not here, in the dining hall of a mansion—we might have been around a table at some bar.
If that were the case, I\'m sure that this would have been a more comfortable family conference.
Alright, that\'s enough talk about the old geezer who won\'t pop off.
{n}More importantly, let\'s talk about this incre~dible lunch!!
"I was already sold by the sashimi salad!
 Gohda‐san is one hell of a chef!
 Plus, these fish were caught in the oceans near here, weren\'t they?
 The sashimi you get at the supermarket don\'t even come close!"
"Hey, quit it, Battler.
 Your upbringing will be exposed."
Everyone let out a big laugh.
Damn it, you say that even though you love those cheap pubs.
"Hahahaha.
 My job occasionally leads me to eat at some quite interesting places, but even compared to those, this is an excellent dish.
 I imagine you could have become reasonably well‐known in that field, Gohda‐san."
"I don\'t know too much about it, but...
at the famous hotel where he used to work, employee politics got pretty complicated and everyone split into factions.
 In the middle of all that, he was apparently forced to retire.
 And, it just so happened that Mom had job offers for a servant out at the same time."
As Gohda cleared away the empty plates, he began to recount his own eventful past, never losing his smile.
"......The world is a difficult place.
 However, it is thanks to this that I was given a chance to display my skills as a chef once again, this time for the Ushiromiya family."
"Although I also enjoy the smiles of a larger number of people,
 it is also extremely entertaining to be able to perform delicate work in order to please solely the limited number of people I have pledged to serve.
 All of this is thanks to the opportunity given to me by Madam."
Gohda‐san respectfully bowed his head towards Aunt Natsuhi.
"That is because among all of the applicants, you were the most talented.
 The decision was not based on personal feelings, but purely objective, so there is no need to thank me."
...Oh man, why does Aunt Natsuhi always have to speak so frankly.
If only she spoke more gently, she might give off a different impression.
Shannon‐chan and Kumasawa‐san entered from the hallway with a serving cart.
"......Please excuse us."
"Now then, let us move on to today\'s dessert."
Gohda‐san and the others laid out the beautifully adorned dessert.
I guess it\'s true when they say you have another stomach for desserts...
I\'d thought that being fed all that delicious food had totally filled me up,
 but as soon as I laid eyes on the dessert, my stomach started yelling "More!"
I don\'t know much about desserts, but this looked really good.
A white pudding‐like substance was garnished with two shades of red sauce,
 and elegant rose petals adorned the dish.
When you dine on such magnificent food as this, first it is distributed in front of everybody, and then the chef takes a moment to extol the virtues of his creation.
 Until he has finished, as a rule, you don\'t touch the food.
However, Maria, who had no experience with these ceremonious rules, got excited by this beautiful and delicious‐looking dessert and jumped into the fray as soon as it was placed before her.
Auntie Rosa scolded her, calling it bad manners, but George responded by saying "Now, now, it\'s alright."
"Uu?!
 This one\'s sour!
 This one\'s sour!
 Battler, the wrong one is this one!
 Uu!"
Maria exclaimed as she sampled the two colored sauces.
"What, there\'s a right one and a wrong one?! Alright, I\'ll give it a go~!
 Mmmmm?!"
Apparently the two sauces were one sweet and one sour.
{n}Despite it being bad manners, I also stuck my little finger in and licked it.
Whoa, one of them was sour enough to make you pucker up.
{n}If it were yellow, I\'d have suspected lemon, but I couldn\'t guess what kind of sourness would be red.
I decided to ask Shannon, who was putting away the serving cart behind us.
"Shannon‐chan, what kind of sauce is this sour stuff?"
"......Umm......
............err...
......u..."
Shannon‐chan hesitated to speak.
Maybe she was just setting the table and doesn\'t really know.
{n}She\'s hesitating a bit much for that, though.
{n}......Did I ask something wrong?
Or did they use something that we\'d be better off not knowing about?
While Aunt Natsuhi acted as though she had a headache, Kumasawa‐san, who was setting the other side of the table, began to laugh with a "hoh‐hoh‐ho".
"What do you think we made it out of?
 Hoh‐hoh‐ho, it\'ll shock you..."
"Huh? ...I, I don\'t have a clue.
 And, Kumasawa baa‐san, that laugh creeps me the hell out.
 So, what is it?!"
"......Don\'t tell anyone, alright?
 Let me borrow your ears."
Kumasawa‐san leaned across from the other side of the table.
 She\'d asked to borrow my ears, so I leaned forward too.
 Their interest caught, Jessica, George‐aniki, and, of course, Maria, also put their ears closer.
"Uu.
 What?
 Whaat?
 Tell mee!
 Tell mee!"
"The sour part is, well...
 ......Actually, it\'s squeezed juice from a mackerel, hoh‐hoh‐ho!"
"""WHAT, mackerel?!?!"""
"Don\'t be ridiculous," we all thought, horrified.
{n}Only Maria accepted it, nodding with an "uh‐huh".
"Uu?
 Mackerels are sour.
 If you squeeze them, this comes out!"
""...ha, wahahahahaha...!""
When Maria started clamoring that mackerel were sour, the adults were unable to contain their laughter.
"You\'ve got it wrong, that\'s vinegared mackerel!"
Auntie Rosa said to Maria in a small voice while turning red.
Ahhhh, now I remember it perfectly.
{n}Kumasawa‐san was always this kind of a character, wasn\'t she?
{n}I think I remember her tricking me about all kinds of things when I was young as well!
Amongst all of them, the most painful must have been that one!
{n}That flimsy black stuff you get in Chinese food!
 Kikurage mushrooms!
{n}She told me it was penguin meat and I went all around school like a smartass telling everyone, didn\'t I?!
"Kumasawa baa‐chan, you sure haven\'t changed...!
 You know Maria\'s gonna believe now, right?"
"Hoh‐hoh‐ho, it\'s just a joke!
 Gohda‐san will tell you what the sauce is in just a moment!"
Gohda‐san looked a little put out from having his masterpiece laughed at in such a strange way,
 but after clearing his throat once, he introduced the dessert to us.
"Well then, allow me to describe tonight\'s dessert.
 Based on the rose garden that everyone seemed to enjoy so much today, I finished this panna cotta in a rose garden style.
 The rose petals scattered across were selected just now from that rose garden."
"For the sauces, I have prepared two different reds for you, strawberry and rose hip.
 Please enjoy the strawberry\'s sweetness and the rose hip\'s sourness in turn.
 Finally, the rose petals are merely decoration, so please set them aside before eating.
 With that said, please, enjoy."
......Hahhh... ...Man, I almost want to applaud before I\'ve even eaten it.
It\'s like when you take medicine, you know, how it seems to work better when you\'ve read the instructions.
Thanks to Gohda‐san elaborating on the details of this dessert, I feel like he\'s knocked it up another notch.
Seriously, should you call him meticulous or just talented?
The dessert was probably planned from the beginning, but he took a cue from our stopping in front of the rose garden earlier today,
 and displayed an incredibly timely awareness of the season by just adding a few rose petals from that garden.
This combination of sweet and sour was also exquisite.
{n}If it was just sweet, you\'d just get used to it and become bored halfway through.
But by bringing in the sour sauce at that point, you get a really vivid taste.
 And then, once you return to the sweet sauce, all of the sourness in your mouth is replaced with an enjoyable sweetness again.
I\'m sure everyone else felt the same way.
Every time Gohda‐san passed by one of the seats, someone praised the taste and his creation.
"How is it, Madam?"
"Splendid, as always.
 It is a worthy treat for our guests."
"I am most grateful for your words.
 ......Madam, did you know?
 I have heard that rose hip has the ability to cure headaches.
 I thought that you especially would appreciate it, so I had it specially prepared."
"...Is that so?
 Thank you."
"See, didn\'t I tell you, Natsuhi nee‐san?
 Rose hip works on headaches."
"So it seems.
 ...I can only hope it has some effect."
"Haahh!
 Gohda‐san, I love ya!
 Hey, later, whisper me how much compensation you\'re gettin\' for this, won\'t ya?!
 If you\'re sworn to silence, you can stick up some fingers instead, let me know your price!"
"Havin\' your talent monopolized by this small island is sacrilege to humanity\'s cookin\' culture!
 Wouldn\'t you be willin\' to display your talent to all the customers at my company?"
"Hahaha, Hideyoshi‐san.
 Are you trying to recruit our Gohda?
 How troubling.
 We had better make some improvements to his salary, or he\'ll get snatched away."
"*giggle* Yes, you really should.
 If you don\'t, he\'ll be lured away and you\'ll be stuck with three meals a day of Kumasawa‐style mackerel cooking, won\'t you?"
"Hoh‐hoh‐ho, that is indeed harsh.
 It seems someone\'s holding a grudge."
"""Wahahahahaha!!!"""
Everyone let out a huge laugh.
According to Jessica, Kumasawa‐san\'s "mackerel jokes" were a type of running gag,
 and our parents had long since gotten used to it.
Kumasawa‐san often claimed that mackerel contained precious nutrients that could do things such as prevent aging and make people smarter.
...It seemed that while it couldn\'t stop the outward signs of aging, it helped prevent aging on the inside.
Since she was still healthy enough to tell these kinds of jokes at her age, that benefit must be the real thing.
"Hoh‐hoh‐ho...
 Well then, if you\'ll excuse me.
 Prepare yourself for tonight\'s dinner!
 I\'ll be cooking plenty of mackerel dishes for you to eat, so look forward to it!"
"Wahahaha, we sure will.
 I want to treat myself to some vinegared mackerel tonight!"
"That sounds wonderful.
 I wonder if any delicious Japanese sake will be included."
"Oh, it certainly will!
 How about some of our famous Rokkenjima mackerel liquor..."
"""Wahahahahaha!!!"""
Kumasawa‐san, together with Shannon‐chan, bowed and pushed the serving cart away.
Amusingly, Gohda‐san, who looked just as though his stock had been stolen from him, explained very seriously that tonight\'s dinner would actually be calf steak.
"......Umm...
.........Kumasawa‐san, ...thank you for doing that back there..."
As she pushed the serving cart, Shannon bowed her head very deeply.
"Hoh‐hoh‐ho, I haven\'t done a~nything that requires thanks."
Kumasawa played dumb, but it was no accident that she had thrown Shannon a lifeline.
Back when Battler had asked for the details of the dessert, Shannon had unfortunately hesitated.
There may have been several ways to dodge the question, but all of them should have been delivered deftly.
Shannon, who hesitated when hard pressed for a response, was always suffering because of this small weakness.
If only Shannon, like Gohda, had a little of the craftiness needed to skillfully shake off a mistake, her days would be a little more comfortable.
...This weakness was especially unfortunate considering how flawlessly she could handle her work.
Of course, there were those who well understood Shannon\'s meek nature and her inability to remember to gloss over her mistakes.
...Which is why Kumasawa came to her aid without hesitation.
"I just heard from Genji‐san that there\'s been a change to the afternoon shifts.
 I believe you were given a break until this evening.
 Hoh‐hoh‐ho, I am jealous."
"Huh, ...ah, I\'m sorry—I haven\'t checked the list of shifts yet."
"Ah, yes.
 I was thinking I might start cooking some mackerel in the oven.
 If you don\'t mind, I would be happy if you would help out a bit before your break."
"Ah, yes...!
 I would be delighted to help."
To Shannon, Kumasawa was like a mother among the servants.
The dining hall needed to be cleaned up, so we were chased out.
{n}Instead, tea would be served in the parlor.
It seemed that they would be preparing the black tea that Auntie Rosa had bought for Aunt Natsuhi.
Maria insisted that she also wanted to drink the black tea, but was rejected by the old bastard, who told her and the rest of us kids to go play outside.
"Battler‐kun, why don\'t we all go for a walk outside?"
"Go look at the roses or something.
 But keep a close eye on the weather.
 The sky\'s still clear, but the weather report kept on talkin\' about rain."
"Uu!
 I want the beach, want the beach!!"
"Ah, isn\'t that a wonderful idea!
 Playing on a sandy beach isn\'t something that you get to do often, is it?"
"I guess not.
 Alright, let\'s all go to the sandy beach then!"
"Uu! Let\'s go, let\'s go!"
"Maria, be careful not to get your clothes wet.
 Your shoes, too."
"Uu!
 Won\'t get wet!"
"*giggle*, so obedient and cu~te.
 Battler‐kun, make sure you keep an eye out for Maria‐chan, okay?"
"Sure thing, leave it to me!"
"Ohh? You\'re pretty cute and obedient too when Kyrie asks you something, huh?
 ...Why don\'t you try listening to me obediently for a change?"
"Heh!
 Hell no!
 Let\'s go everyone, c\'mon!"
The children flew out of the parlor.
They were replaced by Genji, who pushed a serving cart in and prepared the black tea.
The parlor was filled with a sublime aroma which entertained everyone while they waited to appease their thirst...
"Hahahahaha...
 Rudolf, you and your family all seem to get along so well with each other.
 Good for you."
"Oh, please—you have us beat on that front."
"So true.
 Jessica‐chan really has grown into an innocent little thing, hasn\'t she?
 It\'s all the fruit of your training, isn\'t it, Natsuhi nee‐san?"
".........Thank you."
Natsuhi answered coldly.
...With that, the conversation halted, and the parlor became silent.
Possibly because he couldn\'t stand it anymore, Hideyoshi broke the silence while performing an exaggerated gesture.
"Still, they sure do grow fast.
 ...I thought they\'d be kids forever, but they\'ve been gettin\' huge right before my eyes, and before I knew it, they\'ve joined the ranks of us adults.
 Battler‐kun, for one, is beyond recognition!"
"His body has gotten much bigger, but he is still a child.
 Well, my husband is still a child as well."
"...I wonder where the border between child and adult is.
 I still don\'t feel as though I\'ve grown up."
"Hmph, isn\'t that pitiful.
 That\'s not something the mother of a child should say."
"That\'s right.
 We\'re not children anymore.
 We are all adults.
 So I would like it if we could all hold an intellectual discussion without becoming emotional."
When Eva smiled with sharp sarcasm, everything seemed to get more tense.
...It felt like the smell of the tea that had been prepared so carefully just flew out the window.
"We have always strived to hold intellectual discussions.
 ......Your sarcasm is ill‐placed sometimes.
 You\'ve never changed in that respect."
"...‘Always strived’, is it?
 My, my.
 I wish I could wrap those words up and send them to this room a few decades ago.
 Right, Rosa?"
".................."
Rosa smiled with a vague expression.
{n}...Whether she agreed or disagreed, she knew that she would earn the displeasure of either her brother or her sister.
It was a bit of worldly wisdom she had needed to learn as the youngest sibling.
"Quit it, Aneki.
 We should enter into the main topic while the brats aren\'t around, right?
 Let us make that our intellectual discussion."
As Rudolf glanced over the faces of all present, some let out a slight sigh and some let a small look of resignation cross their face.
......This was the unavoidable...
true agenda.
"Last year, his life expectancy was estimated at about three months.
 Which means he\'s already at minus nine.
 The Grim Reaper could come flying through the window in a blind panic at any moment."
".........The family head is still in good health.
 Raising such an inappropriate topic while the sun is still bright...I must question whether you are in your right mind, Rudolf‐san."
"Still, Natsuhi‐san.
 ...If we don\'t discuss this until somethin\' happens, it\'ll be too late.
 He\'s still healthy now, so we\'ve gotta figure out something while we still have some time left over.
 It\'s a kind of financial etiquette."
"It seems as though everyone is concerned about Father.
 ...Doctor Nanjo.
 Could we hear the details from you?
 It seems as though they are also hoping for that."
".....................*cough*."
Nanjo, standing by the window and staring out at the rose garden, let out a single cough when he realized that he was being called.
"......Doctor Nanjo.
 ...How is Father\'s condition?"
"Well, first...
 My estimate last year that he had only three months to live still appears to be making its presence felt, so allow me to start by correcting it."
"No need to explain.
 You\'re saying that measuring remaining life is only a prediction, not a promise, right?"
"...That is correct.
 Because of that, I can offer no definitive answer to the question you all so often ask me, of when he will pass away.
 A human\'s life is supported by their body and their mind.
 ...If the body is weak, the situation becomes more dangerous, but if the mind is strong enough to compensate for that weakness, it is possible to maintain a state of remission."
"So you\'re saying that even if his body is weak, his mind is still firm and spirited."
".........Kyrie, sorry, but please stay quiet for a while."
"......Sorry."
"That is correct.
 Kinzo‐san\'s body has been ravaged by disease.
 With him continuing to partake of that kind of strong liquor on top of all that, I really must think..."
"So booze is the reason he\'s teetering on the edge.
 And booze is also the reason he\'s hanging on.
 Sounds like Dad, the heavy drinker."
"Well then, Doctor, I know you can\'t give anything more than a prediction...
......but what do you think about Father\'s chances of living until this day next year...?"
"That is quite the rude question to ask about the head."
Natsuhi jumped on Eva, unable to hide her astonished expression.
In response, Eva returned a defiant look, but Hideyoshi noticed and tried to smooth things over with a forced smile.
"Ah, Natsuhi‐san, forgive her!
 Eva, try and choose your words a bit more carefully, okay?"
"I\'m sorry.
 I was just so concerned over Father\'s condition.
 *giggle*."
"............Is that so?
 I hadn\'t realized."
"Doctor Nanjo, please tell us.
 For the sake of the beautiful family love of a daughter worried about her father\'s lifespan."
Krauss laughed sarcastically, and Eva, smiling sweetly, returned an identical chuckle.
"...You ask whether he will still be healthy next year,
 ......but it is a very difficult question for me as a doctor.
 While I do think this remission will last for a while yet,
 if he suffers some kind of fit, there may be nothing we can do."
"......After all, Rokkenjima is a solitary island.
 It is not as though an ambulance can come rushing in to save him.
 Normally, I would want to have him hospitalized in a large hospital on the mainland, but..."
"Father stated that he does not want his noble research interrupted.
 ......It seems he holds a grudge over the way we tried to force him out last year.
 Apparently, he strongly suspects that he\'ll be shut away in some hospital if he goes outside.
 And that\'s how things are now."
"Has Doctor Nanjo been examining him?"
"Father trusts Doctor Nanjo.
 ...It seems he can be examined when in a good mood."
"......I can examine his condition, but if I try to recommend medicine or hospitalization, he refuses to listen.
 ......I\'ve really only been able to look."
"It\'s true that there are people that hate doctors...
 Still, what a hassle!"
Nanjo sighed deeply.
{n}The purpose of an examination was to determine what medical treatment was appropriate.
Receiving an examination and then not following the advice given made the whole thing pointless...
"Then, in summary,
 his expected life is still three months,
 and there\'s no way to guess how long he will continue to live while still on the verge of death."
".........Rudolf‐san.
 Couldn\'t you be more discreet with your words?"
"Ah, sorry.
 I\'ve always talked this way.
 Cut me a break."
"I understand Doctor Nanjo\'s opinion.
 ......What do you think, Krauss nii‐san?"
"......Hmph.
 To be perfectly honest, I have to disagree with Doctor Nanjo.
 I find it truly difficult to think of Father as a person so sick that he has only three months to live.
 His yell is as healthy as ever, and I still get the chills at the thought of his fists raining down on me.
 ......Pushing the task of caring for Dad solely on the shoulders of the eldest son is far from fair."
"Hahhaha.
 In the next world, be born after me."
".........Alright, let\'s return to our discussion.
 In that case, according to the impartial and neutral doctor\'s opinion, it wouldn\'t be odd for him to go any time.
 Sorry, Aniki, but I\'d rather trust the opinion of a specialist.
 With that, I believe the discussion of Dad\'s fortune is no longer a premature topic."
"Father\'s personal funds probably reach into the tens of billions of yen, right?
 But, it\'s not as though all of that is neatly gathered as ready cash.
 It\'s not as simple as neatly cutting a birthday cake with a knife."
"...Interesting metaphor, Aneki.
 That\'s right, sometimes strawberries or chocolates are placed on top of the cake, making it hard to cleanly divide it into equal parts.
 Taking that into consideration, I think it\'s important to first discuss how best to stick the knife in, don\'t you...?"
"I truly don\'t understand you all. Even while the head is still alive, you\'re discussing the matter in loud voices as though he were already dead."
"Come now, don\'t you see how important this is?
 After all, when the time comes, the inheritance of his fortune must be carried out immediately, right?
 Moreover, the wealth of the glorious Ushiromiya house is vast.
 Don\'t you understand that a careful discussion is necessary beforehand?
 There\'s a huge difference between the assets of this family and your old one."
"......How rude.
 The family I was born to has nothing to do with this."
As Natsuhi resentfully responded in a low voice, the already dark atmosphere grew even more hostile...
"Give it a rest, Eva...
 Natsuhi‐san, forgive us!
 Pardon her rudeness."
Hideyoshi tried to smooth things over by glancing at both with a forced smile, but it only resulted in making the hostility between Eva and Natsuhi even more intense...
"............It seems that I will just be in the way if I stay any longer.
 Please excuse me."
Nanjo rose from his seat and exited the parlor.
......This may well have been a normal act of courtesy expected of an outsider, but even so, his back was watched by several glances envious of his ability to escape.
After the doctor had exited and his footsteps had disappeared into the distance, Krauss recrossed his legs.
"So let me see if I understand your point of view correctly.
 ......Father\'s remaining life is short.
 You want to quickly enter into a practical conference concerning the distribution of the inheritance.
 ......Why are you so eager, I wonder?"
"Certainly, as you say, estimating and distributing the Ushiromiya family\'s wealth is no simple task.
 In that case, shouldn\'t we carefully and deliberately calculate?
 It seems to me that you are all impatient to split up the cake tonight.
 That\'s true, isn\'t it, Rosa?
 Is something making you impatient?"
"...............It\'s not that we\'re impatient.
 ...But a decision between the siblings is essential.
 It doesn\'t matter when,
 but if Father\'s condition is worsening, and the day is drawing near,
 discussing the matter beforehand...isn\'t what I would call impatience..."
Rosa sneaked a glance at Eva and Rudolf.
{n}...As the youngest daughter in the family, being cross‐examined by the eldest was harsh.
".........Hoh.
 Is that your true opinion?
 I didn\'t expect that the most honest and pure‐hearted of the siblings would say something like that.
 I wonder if those two told you to say that...?"
"........................"
"Quit it, Aniki.
 Rosa is a sibling just like the rest of us.
 She has a fair right to Dad\'s inheritance.
 It\'s obvious she would be interested, right?
 ...After all, Dad will definitely die, and that\'s not something that\'ll happen in the distant future."
"......On the contrary, Aniki, you are far too relaxed.
 It seems almost as though you would like nothing better than to turn the discussion away from the distribution of the inheritance."
".........What do you mean by that?
 Are you trying to accuse my husband of something?"
"Calm down, Natsuhi‐san.
 Listen to what we have to say..."
"Nii‐san, I hear these are very good times nowadays.
 That\'s right, since last year the yen has just been going up and up thanks to the unprecedented boom in prosperity.
 It seems that it\'s no longer a dream that the dollar will reach 100 yen."
"Also, the ruling party says that it will establish a health resort maintenance law by next year.
 At this moment, resort development companies across Japan are running about trying to gather as much capital as they can."
"......You know your stuff.
 Soon, Japan will see an unprecedented boom.
 Just like when Father revived the Ushiromiya family—another case like the Korean war demands."
"......The people of Japan have worked at a frenzied pace, realized vast economic growth, and become the most prosperous people in the world; they are enjoying the height of their prosperity.
 Private spending has increased, and institutions that can profit from that can make easy money in this era."
"The people\'s needs are no longer merely the essential three electrical appliances.
 Places to ski, to golf, public pools.
 Resort hotels and theme parks!"
"Have you gone to Delsney Land, which opened just a few years ago?
 What an excellent theme park that is!
 In that place, even an adult can be a kid and have fun with his family."
"The old era, where the only virtue was to selflessly devote yourself to your country while failing to consider your family, is ending.
 Now, as the most prosperous people in the world, we can finally accept that."
"Krauss nii‐san, your foresight is somethin\' else.
 ...When I heard this several years ago, I thought it was ridiculous.
 ......But see, when I heard about the G5 nations\' Plaza Accord, that changed."
"The yen\'s gettin\' stronger and stronger, and the price of land will skyrocket soon, I bet.
 The day that Japan becomes the economic center of the world isn\'t far off.
 ......You have a very forward looking view.
 There\'s no mistakin\' that at least."
"I feel the same as Hideyoshi nii‐san.
 Aniki, you can read into the next decade of history.
 That keen sense surely came from Dad.
 It\'s incredible."
"......However, unlike Dad, there have been cases where the timing of your predictions has been mistaken, haven\'t there?"
"Nii‐san, believing that Japan will definitely face an economic boom, you have been launching resort projects everywhere, and almost all of them continue to fail.
 ...While I\'m sure that the era you predicted is arriving, it seems that you misread the timing of that boom."
"......You were too early.
 And then you hurriedly tried to sell everything off, and as a result opened the wound even further.
 ...If your nose was really so reliable and you predicted the coming of a boom, then there should be no reason for you to sell off your property.
 Isn\'t this proof that you don\'t trust your own ability?"
"......How rude!
 Are you trying to insult my husband?"
Natsuhi\'s forehead creased as she rose from the sofa.
Eva, paying this no heed, stared at Krauss with a confident smile.
...Krauss, who also maintained his confident appearance, told Natsuhi to sit down.
"Please stop, Natsuhi.
 My little sister is incapable of speaking any other way and always has been.
 ...Calm yourself a little.
 Your headache will get worse."
"Proof that you have no talent is also right here.
 ............After all, Nii‐san, weren\'t you all excited about turning this island into a resort?
 Building a wonderful resort hotel, beautifully maintaining the garden.
 I\'m just an amateur and don\'t pretend to understand, but you must have used a significant amount of money, right?"
"What are you trying to say?!
 My husband\'s business has nothing to do with you!"
"Actually, that\'s not true, Natsuhi‐san.
 Rokkenjima is not Aniki\'s.
 It is Dad\'s.
 The hotel that was constructed is Aniki\'s, of course.
 If you like, you can charge us lodging fees tonight.
 Right, Rosa?"
"...............Well, hmm.
 ...If what I have on hand will suffice."
"If I can make it into a resort, this island\'s financial worth will rise.
 It is true that expenses have piled up, but we can hope to have a large harvest in the future.
 When that happens, it should prove to be beneficial to all of you as well."
"I understand that.
 If the value of this island rises, that will increase our shares when we distribute the inheritance.
 Of course, we won\'t ask you to physically divide the island and the mansion into four equal parts.
 We\'re quite happy to settle this with whatever you calculate its financial worth to be."
"If you understand that much, what about my business makes you so dissatisfied?"
"We aren\'t dissatisfied, we\'re uneasy.
 In the first place, Aniki,
 when do you plan to open that hotel?
 Keep this up, and every square inch of it will be covered in our grubby hand prints!"
"That\'s right.
 It\'s an important tool for your business, isn\'t it?
 I understand that you can\'t keep it locked up until the moment you open it for business.
 Buildings go bad if you don\'t use them and air them out every once in a while."
"Even so, it\'s a bit extravagant for a guesthouse that we only use once a year.
 Wouldn\'t you say, Rosa?"
"..................That\'s right.
 If it\'s that wonderful, I\'m sure that it will become quite popular once you open it."
"Oh...
.........the hotel you mentioned earlier was referring to the guesthouse, I see..."
"Hell of a building, isn\'t it?
 Just as Rosa said, I\'m sure it would become popular if he were to open it."
The lodging they had been guided to had not been constructed with the intent of building a guesthouse.
...It was originally constructed as a resort hotel.
{n}However, even though it had been completed two years ago, there was absolutely no schedule for it to be opened...
"Nii‐san, it\'s just like all of your enterprises.
 Your attention and planning are both fabulous.
 Then, it always becomes unable to maintain itself partway, and ends without being able to collect any profit."
"It was brilliant of you to spot that it was a waste to use this island only as a place to live.
 I think that turning it into a resort which could use things like marine sports, fishing, or honeymoons to attract customers was a pretty good plan."
"If I were the oldest son, I\'m sure I too would have racked my brains over what kind of profit I could get out of this island."
"But, two full years have passed since you finished building, right?
 After two years, you still don\'t know when you\'ll be able to open it?
 Where is the managing company you entrusted it to?"
"......Impertinence!
 That is not my husband\'s fault!
 There has just been some trouble with the company that my husband contracted with—no matter how you look at it, we are victims here!"
"That\'s the thing, though...
 This company that Krauss nii‐san hired...
I haven\'t heard many good rumors about it, y\'know?"
"Let\'s not beat around the bush.
 ......The project disintegrated mid‐way due to nonpayment, embezzlement, and other troubles—did you think the rumors wouldn\'t reach our ears?
 I\'ve been collecting evidence."
"I don\'t know what kind of evidence you found, but it\'s all baseless!
 As new members in the sightseeing business, it is necessary to lay the groundwork with various people.
 It is also important to discuss how trustworthy the other party is.
 This is nothing more than taking some time to meet that end!"
"......I\'ll accept that, in my rashness, the hotel was completed too early.
 However, we are not paying maintenance costs.
 It\'s a slow and vital strategic arrangement."
"Yeah, I bet.
 More like you want to sell it but can\'t.
 There\'s no reason for anyone to buy such an extravagant hotel on an isolated island with nothing on it and no established sightseeing routes.
 Besides, what\'s happening with the loans you gathered for this project?"
"It might not be costing you maintenance, but the borrowed money you can\'t return is just goin\' up and up.
 ......Sorry, Krauss nii‐san.
 I investigated the development plan for this island a little.
 ...I gotta be honest, I\'ve not heard anythin\' good either."
"Hideyoshi‐san.
 I\'m sure that only looking at the current financial condition could lead you to that impression.
 However, that is a prior investment.
 I have no choice but to admit that my prediction was mistaken, and that up until now, several liabilities have been created."
"However, the times have finally caught up with me.
 I will soon regain everything that I have lost up to this point.
 No, actually, all of the investments I have made until now will finally return to my possession.
 That\'s right, just like throwing away a small fry which then becomes a salmon, they will come back even bigger than before."
"Sure, I\'m with you on that.
 Startin\' soon, the resort business will probably see an unprecedented boom...
 Though who knows whether it\'ll be enough to bury all of your liabilities..."
".........But I gotta ask, Krauss nii‐san.
 After all the crushing defeats you\'ve suffered so far, who in the world supplied you with the funds?
 That\'s a heck of a sum we\'re talkin\'.
 Enough to cover your massive debt, right?"
"......What are you trying to say, Hideyoshi‐san?"
"Ahh, Natsuhi‐san, please, don\'t get mad!
 We\'ve done our research, see.
 ...We looked into it, tryin\' to see who could\'ve loaned Krauss nii‐san, who\'s lost all his battles thus far, enough to support his recent massively gutsy investments."
"...And the result—
no one.
 There is no backer.
 The iron rule of the money roulette is to bet against the unfortunate.
 And Aniki, you are a well known unfortunate in this neighborhood."
"Surely this era seems set to welcome an economic boom, but when we asked who, with respect to Aniki\'s failures,
 would find him worthy of funding,
 there was no one."
"So you see...
 Where did you raise that money from?
 ...That\'s what we started to question next."
".........Hoh.
 Isn\'t this an interesting story.
 And?"
"D‐dear!
 How long do you plan to ignore these abusive remarks!!"
"Sit down, Natsuhi‐san.
 .........Let me be blunt.
 Aniki, you have been diverting Dad\'s private funds for your own business.
 There is almost no doubt.
 If we made some mistake, please, feel free to explain it for us."
"Rudolf, this isn\'t diverting funds.
 This is embezzlement, isn\'t it?
 It\'s a genuine crime that can be criminally prosecuted."
"Th‐this is rudeness in the extreme!!
 How can you even face the successor to the Ushiromiya head house and level these wild accusations!!"
"They aren\'t wild, they\'re right on the money, aren\'t they?
 He wants to make his business succeed so that he can recover his losses, but his debt is actually growing!
 All he wants is to get himself out of the hole he\'s dug, by making an even bigger gamble than before.
 If he had funds close at hand, it\'s only logical that he\'d try to use them!"
"Let me say it clearly, Nii‐san—what you are doing is embezzlement.
 You are betraying our father.
 I imagine that we will leave you to the mercy of the courts after this is all over.
 Do you think those people will kindly agree to address you as "successor to the Ushiromiya head house"?"
"O‐of all the things...sa‐saying that he\'s betraying the head is not something I can overlook!!
 You no longer have the right to darken the doors of the glorious Ushiromiya house!!
 Leave this place immediately!!
 Go on!!
 Get out!!"
Natsuhi, who had already reached the limits of her anger, shouted at Eva in a rage.
She then pointed alternately at Eva and the hallway, indicating that she should leave.
Eva took out a folding fan and fanned herself with it, glaring maliciously at Natsuhi as though silently daring her to repeat what she\'d said.
However, her mouth was still smiling, curved in the shape of a crescent moon.
...In that unpleasant silence, Rosa gulped.
"Hey, ...Natsuhi nee‐san?
 Who do you think you are speaking to?"
"I am speaking to the extremely impolite sister of my husband!!
 As the person in charge of family affairs, I cannot overlook any more of this!!"
"In charge of family affaaairs?
 Huhuhu,
 hahahaha,
 ahhahahahaha!!"
"Shut up,
 you sorry excuse for a wife!"
Eva folded the fan with a snap and rose powerfully.
Compared to the elegance and playful behavior she had shown until just now, she was unimaginably aggressive.
"How foolish. {i:You} leave!!
 You would tell me—Ushiromiya Eva!—
me, Eva, the third‐ranked in the Ushiromiya family hierarchy, who is granted the left shoulder of the head, to {i:leave}?!"
"Learn your place!!
 And then look in a mirror at your shabby figure!!
 Where on your clothes is the wing?
 Where are you permitted to wear the One‐winged Eagle?"
"Your only purpose was to birth a successor to the Ushiromiya family!!
 Know your place, bitch!!"
While Eva\'s face grimaced unattractively, her words pierced Natsuhi\'s heart like claws, and painfully twisted in.
"..............................!!!"
......There were a hundred ways Natsuhi wanted to respond.
{n}However, her anger and sorrow crushed her throat, and not one of them managed to make it to her mouth.
...The anger which had lost any place to go became a single hot tear which slowly dripped down...
"Whaaat?
 If you have something to say, please, say it now.
 Come on."
Eva faced her with a provocative gaze.
......However, Natsuhi\'s fist was shaking; she trembled all over, unable to do anything...
Krauss quietly broke that powder‐keg tension.
"Natsuhi.
 Leave your seat.
 You should cool off your head."
"Wh—!!"
Natsuhi, resenting the fact that her husband had not come to her aid, shifted the focus of her attack.
"D‐...don\'t you understand what they\'re saying about you?!
 These people are baselessly calling you a traitor to Father!!"
"We protect the glory of the Ushiromiya family,
 we put forth effort day in day out, striving to be paragons of nobility in order to take over that glory from Father, and this inexcusable rambling tramples it all underfoot!!!"
"And you―why don\'t you talk back to them?!
 I\'m talking back because you won\'t, but you have just been relying completely on me...!!
 And now you are telling me to go cool my head?!
 It\'s {i:always} me!!"
"I am always thinking so seriously about this family\'s affairs, and you\'ve just taken that and...!!
 UuuUUUuuu, uuuuuuuuuhuhughh!!!"
Natsuhi could no longer hide her tears.
{n}She flew from the room in that state.
After that, all that remained was a somewhat embarrassed mood about the parlor...
When the sound of footsteps grew distant and silence returned, Krauss shrugged his shoulders slightly.
"......I apologize for my wife.
 She has always been bad at controlling her emotions.
 I too have a hard time with her."
"If you\'ve got someone like that running things, you must be on edge constantly as well!
 *giggle*giggle*...!"
"Uuuuu...
 UuuuuUUUuuUUughhu!!!"
"......Ma‐......Madam......"
"It\'s nothing...!
 Leave me be...!!"
Natsuhi flew into her room...and bent over the bed, wailing.
Those heartwrenching sobs reached Kumasawa in the hallway...
......How heartrending, Madam Natsuhi...
There is a deep enmity between her and Eva‐sama.
...Explaining their relationship is very draining for a woman such as myself...
The Ushiromiya family holds its bloodline in high regard, but if a daughter marries into another family, they would normally be removed from the family hierarchy.
......So, under normal circumstances, Eva‐sama should have been removed when she married Hideyoshi‐sama.
However,
 ...and this was not anyone\'s fault.
Madam definitely bore no guilt.
There\'s no way to say it other than calling it a whim of God.
...Krauss‐sama and Natsuhi‐sama were not blessed with children for some time.
And of course, this was the patriarchal Ushiromiya family.
A wife was just a tool to create an heir.
......If that wife could not fulfill her only duty, she would not be treated as human.
It is painful to remember how much the Master tortured Madam during that time...
During that time, Eva‐sama and Hideyoshi‐sama\'s wedding was discussed.
......Eva‐sama was sly.
...Taking advantage of Madam\'s inability to become pregnant, she gained the favor of the Master.
She inspired him to allow her to marry and give birth to a successor herself, making sure to avoid transferring her name out of the Ushiromiya register.
There was a vast difference in the Ushiromiya hierarchy between Madam, who married into the Ushiromiya family and was treated like an outsider, and Eva‐sama, who was related to the family by blood and whose husband took on the Ushiromiya name.
And beyond that, Eva‐sama was the first to give birth, and what\'s more, to a boy...
Perhaps you can now understand how much weaker Madam\'s position was compared to Eva‐sama\'s...
...I\'m sure Madam is tormented by the thought that if only she had gotten pregnant earlier, the Master wouldn\'t have accepted Eva‐sama\'s request to keep her last name after marriage, and Eva‐sama wouldn\'t have been permitted to act as arrogantly as she had today...
However...that was not Madam\'s fault......
All of the blame lies with God\'s whims, and the stork that delivered Jessica‐san late......
Even so, Madam won\'t allow herself to see things this way...
......She probably can\'t help but cry bitter tears at her inability to carry out the duties expected of a wife...
Ahh, how heartrending...
I cannot do anything but watch over her from the shadows......We crossed the hall again on our way to the entrance.
As we did, we once again saw that witch\'s portrait.
However, the word "saw" is probably not the best word to describe that experience.
{n}......It was more like our eyes were drawn to it.
That woman\'s eyes, with their sage‐like glamour, definitely had the power to make those who looked at her stand rooted to the spot.
"............So this is the witch, {f:5:Beatrice}.
 ......Wonder if it\'s true."
"Uu?
 Battler doesn\'t believe...?"
Back when he had asked what this picture was, the first person to tell him it was {f:5:Beatrice} had been Maria.
Therefore, when Battler showed signs of doubt, Maria must have felt that Battler didn\'t have faith in her.
...Of course, that\'s not what Battler meant.
Maria ran up to the portrait and began banging on a plate below it.
Maybe the title of the portrait was written there.
Maria, trying to prove that she wasn\'t lying, obstinately continued to hit the plate.
"Ahh―sorry about that,
 it\'s not like I doubt anything you said, Maria."
"Uu!
 Battler believes!
 Uu!"
When he patted Maria\'s head and apologized, she seemed to accept it, sticking out her chest and proudly "uu‐uu"ing.
"...............Let\'s see here.
 "My beloved witch, {f:5:Beatrice}".
 .........Behold the sweetfish river...
...wait.........what\'s with this weird, long epitaph?"
The plate did have the title of the portrait written on it, but it was much too big to contain only that.
Beneath the title, what looked like a long epitaph was also written.
As I skimmed over it, I was taken aback by the array of unnerving words that jumped out at me.
"Incredible, isn\'t it?
 Grandfather had that written.
 ...Pretty deep, huh?"
"Uu!
 I know!
 It\'s the place where the gold is hidden!"
"......Wait, is it that story about the Ushiromiya family\'s hidden gold?
 There\'s another thing that takes me back...
 ......Wait, Aniki, ...is that for real?"
"Grandfather had this written, but he refuses to say anything about this picture or the epitaph.
 .........Even so, amongst the family, it is often whispered that it points to the location of Grandfather\'s hidden gold,
 and that he will relinquish the family headship and the gold to the person who solves the riddle."
"Uu!
 I heard that too, I heard that too!
 Lots and lots of gold!"
"...Well, who knows, really.
 Ten tons of gold bars.
 Sounds a bit too fishy to me."
"Still, if you read this all the way through, it almost seems real."
.........I think I already explained Grandfather\'s upbringing,
 but let me also mention the Ushiromiya family\'s "Legend of the Gold".
Grandfather succeeded the Ushiromiya family after it had been almost totally destroyed in the Great Kanto Earthquake,
 and by successfully riding the stormy seas after the war, managed to accumulate great wealth.
...That much of the story everyone knows.
{n}However, this is where the strange part of the story begins.
...Part of it is closely tied to Grandfather\'s black magic hobby, so its credibility is extremely low, but......
......Well, wait until the end before you doubt or make fun of it.
After the war, Grandfather successfully predicted what the future would hold, his big gamble paid off, and he accumulated a vast store of wealth,
 ......but there is a mysterious legend about how he gained the funds in the first place.
Grandfather came from a branch family and had no connections in the business world or the financial world.
 Even though he later built connections with the occupying forces, in the beginning he was supposedly a nameless person who had not yet gained anyone\'s trust.
Money can only be gathered based on trust.
{n}There\'s no way anyone would lend money to an untrustworthy person.
......How did Grandfather, whose trustworthiness was zero, manage to obtain the large amount of funds in the first place?
......It is said that, when asked that question, Grandfather answered like this:
{i:One fateful day, I encountered the Golden Witch }{f:7:Beatrice}{i:.}
He then went on and on about how he continued to research alchemy and techniques for summoning demons in order to become a great mage.
...And the entity summoned as the result of the demon‐calling ritual was the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}.
He then said that he made a contract where, in exchange for his own soul, he would receive fortune and honor.
The witch then granted Grandfather ten tons of gold.
Grandfather used this gold as collateral to prepare a vast quantity of funds,
 and then used that to multiply his wealth by several times and revive the Ushiromiya family...
It seems that this story is so old that our parents had already been told it when they were still children.
So, our parents, when they were little,
 explored this island in various ways, believing that the gold that Grandfather had received from the witch might be hidden somewhere.
However, since there was the danger of them getting lost in the abandoned forest,
 Grandmother or someone began to spread the story that the witch lived in the forest and approaching it was too dangerous...
"......I remember that old story.
 When we were little, our parents told us about it and we went all over the island searching for treasure.
 .........Didn\'t we get lost in the forest and start crying until some of the servants found us? Our parents were so mad at us.
 ...That takes me back."
"We sure were idiots, weren\'t we?
 I mean, come on, Grandfather used that to build up the funds that he finally bought this island with, right?
 That means he must have had the gold before coming here.
 There\'s no way it\'d be here on the island."
"......That\'s not necessarily so.
 Maybe the gold was hidden on the island from the beginning and he bought the whole island just to make sure it was all his.
 There was a whole ten tons of it, right?
 It seems more realistic that he would try to secure the place where it was hidden rather than try to move it all."
"This epitaph was written two years ago.
 And since Grandfather had it written himself...
 ......I see, this does make the Legend of the Gold more believable."
"Ten tons of gold, bestowed upon Grandfather by a witch, that it\'s said he used to revive the Ushiromiya family.
 ......It\'s sleeping somewhere even now, and Grandfather may be planning to turn it over to whoever can solve his riddle."
".........Hahh, I guess that sounds like Grandfather\'s style or something......
 Ihihi!
 If it\'s true, that\'s one hell of an opportunity."
The epitaph carved into the plate was very mysterious, something like a poem or a song.
Its sentences were incredibly disturbing, filled with the signs of Grandfather\'s black magic hobby, and truly in bad taste,
 but it could definitely be viewed as a puzzle which, if solved, could lead to the place where the gold was hidden.
"I can\'t even imagine if that\'s what he intended or not.
 ......All I can say is, this shady epitaph was displayed here so that everyone in the family could see it."
"And that, even while hinting at the existence of the gold, he still refuses to touch upon the subject of its hiding place.
 .........That caused our parents\' imaginations to run wild, and call it a battle of wits from Grandfather..."
"...Bet it\'s my dad who\'s taking this nonsense at face value, his greed exposed to the world.
 Even though he laughs at Grandfather\'s black magic hobby, he\'ll still believe this story about the hidden gold.
 He\'s all talk."
"......Well, it\'s certainly not a realistic story.
 At that time, when Grandfather was still nameless without any connections, there\'s no way anyone would have just lent him a massive quantity of gold bars for free.
 ......Although, it\'s not unthinkable to suggest that\'s exactly why Grandfather called his sponsor a witch."
"Yeah, but, it\'s ten tons, ten tons!
 If you traded that for money, how much would that come to?
 Anyway, it\'d have to be a ridiculous amount, right?!"
".........It would be a ridiculous amount.
 They say that the total amount of gold mined by humankind since the dawn of history is at most 100,000 tons.
 That one ten‐thousandth of all of the gold humankind has obtained throughout history should belong to just one person is just insane."
"...And that it should all be in one place, and that there should be a "witch" who could just lend it to Grandfather as if it was nothing.
 ......That would be no ordinary person."
"As for me, I think that that number "ten tons" sounds totally fake.
 In the first place, has anyone other than Grandfather ever even seen it?
 And even if some generous witch lent him some actual gold, couldn\'t that "ten" be right but actually be mistaken from ten kilos?
 Even ten kilos would be a pretty incredible sum, right?"
"Uu.
 ...Ten kilos of gold is how much?"
Maria, who couldn\'t keep up and felt like she was being spoken to in riddles, finally found a place where she could ask us a question.
A question which I also wanted to ask right then.
Whether I hear ten kilos or ten tons, I know that it\'s an incredible amount, but I couldn\'t put a number on exactly how incredible.
George‐aniki folded his arms and tried to remember the market price of gold.
".........Well.
 Gold is affected by speculation, and its price can also change depending on its purity and the trustworthiness of the foundry.
 You would also need to pay a commission to turn it into money.
 Still, it is definitely a precious metal, and some people estimate that if gold mining continues at its current rate, within half a century, we will have mined all of it."
"............Just guessing haphazardly,
 ......for one kilo, I think maybe a price of 2 million yen."
"Whoa...
 .........I know I just plucked that ten kilos figure out of thin air...
 ...But even that would be worth 20 million yen!"
"Uu?
 I weigh 28 kg."
".........Which means that if we had Maria‐chan\'s weight in gold,
 we could estimate its worth at over 50 million yen."
"That\'s just mind‐boggling...
 How much would ten tons be then?
 It\'s 20 million for ten kilos, times a thousand, so......umm.
 .........That\'s it!
 20 billion yen?!
 What the hell!"
How much is 20 billion yen actually worth?
 ......We would have to measure it by putting it in terms we could understand.
I mean, they say that wages over a lifetime are 200 million yen.
...You grow up and work like crazy, sacrificing your life for your company, and as you approach old age are finally freed.
{n}And all that together, including the retirement money, comes out at 200 million yen.
...In other words, that is the cash equivalent of a human\'s life—
no, you could even call it the price of a life.
...We were talking about a sum so enormous that it would require a hundred of those lives.
......Assuming you work for 40 years from age 20 to age 60,
 ......then it\'s equal to 4000 years of work wages.
It\'s a sum of money you could finally accumulate after working every day starting from the Jomon period.
"...Uu.
 Is 20 billion yen huge...?"
"Yeah, it\'s huge.
 Maria, you could buy more of that shortcake you love than you could eat in a lifetime."
"......However, while I could imagine 20 billion yen in cash,
 I don\'t think it\'s very plausible for it to all be in one place as gold bars."
"Just as I said, gold is extremely heavy, and it is not very convenient as a method for storing all your accumulated fortune.
 If it was all in highly valued stocks and bonds, or really expensive precious gems, it wouldn\'t be unthinkable."
"...You often hear of people who, in the chaotic period of the war, traded their wealth for precious gems so that they could carry it around with them.
 ......But you don\'t usually hear stories of people exchanging their wealth for gold."
"Of course it\'s heavy, but internationally it\'s the most trusted and stable—doesn\'t that mean something?
 With bonds, for example, if the country is destroyed they\'re just scraps of paper."
"You can also look at it that way.
 ...But even one ten‐kilo ingot is pretty heavy to carry around.
 Have you ever heard this?
 Even if you can carry a 50‐kilogram person on your back, you can\'t carry a 50‐kilogram bag over your shoulder.
 With that many gold bars, the amount of labor and risk for one person would be hard to calculate."
"So what you\'re saying is, if we were talking 20 billion yen in banknotes lying around, that\'d be one thing,
 but given that it\'s supposedly 20 billion yen in gold piled up, it doesn\'t really ring true."
"That\'s right.
 ...Although the Legend of the Gold does have a pretty interesting ring to it, even just the part about the ten tons of gold is a little bit of a stretch..."
"If you think about it logically like that, it sounds obviously fake.
 Haha, kind of brings you back down to reality."
"That said, it is Grandfather we\'re talking about, after all.
 He may have announced his financing from some kind rich person in an exaggerated metaphorical way, as ten tons of gold received from a witch.
 Even the number "ten tons" feels pretty symbolic."
"You mean like his gratitude for the money he borrowed was worth ten tons of gold, or something?"
"Hehehe, maybe some rich man\'s leisured wife generously granted it to Grandfather.
 And maybe then he started calling this lady a witch?"
Hmm, Jessica\'s example isn\'t bad.
...If someone was generous enough to lend a huge sum of money to Grandfather when his trustworthiness was still zero,
 she would certainly be someone worthy of being called a witch.
......Furthermore, Grandfather later used that money to build a vast amount of wealth.
...With such an incredible ability to judge people,
 again, she might well be fittingly called a witch.
Also, since she went to the trouble of lending all that money, she might also have enthusiastically guided how it was spent.
Come to think of it, the idea to get involved with the occupying forces and profit from the Korean War demands might have come from the witch as well.
With all that considered, saying that he "received wealth and honor from a witch"...
might actually be a fair description.
"I see.
 ............So, in other words, this witch granted the funds necessary to revive the Ushiromiya family, and Grandfather owed her big time.
 ...If that\'s the case, and Grandfather had that huge painting drawn and displayed out of feelings of gratitude...yeah, that might not be that strange a story."
"Hey, what if this person looked like an old witch‐like granny?
 And then Grandfather idealized her appearance and turned her into this beauty when he had the painting drawn.
 Hahahahaha, I\'ll bet if we ever did meet this person, she wouldn\'t be nearly this pretty!"
"Hahahaha, that\'s possible.
 The name {f:5:Beatrice} sounds pretty Western, and if you think about how everyone in our family has Western‐style names,
 maybe even the name {f:5:Beatrice} is the result of Grandfather trying to rearrange some Japanese person\'s name to make it sound Western."
"I get it, I get it.
 That means that this pretty girl doesn\'t exist outside the picture.
 Guess that means I won\'t be able to rub those el~egant breasts, ihihi!
 In the first place, isn\'t a witch a little weird?
 Like you could find something like that anywhere on earth."
As I laughed and made fun of the witch in an attempt to differentiate myself from the kid I was six years ago who was afraid of the witch of the forest, Maria tugged on my sleeve.
...The strength with which she did so displayed a little annoyance.
"Hmm?
 What is it, Maria?"
"Uu!
 Uu!!
 {f:5:Beatrice} exiiiists!"
Maria stared up at me.
{n}...She had on her usual sour look, but I could tell she was angry because of the color of her eyes.
"Witches exist!
 Witches exist!
 Uu‐uu‐uu!!!"
"Well sure, they do exist...if you turn the TV on and watch anime or something."
"Exiiist!!
 Witches exiiist!!
 Uu‐uu‐uu!!!"
I started to feel pressured, not knowing why Maria was jumping on me like this.
Then, Jessica tapped me on the shoulder and told me in a small voice.
"...Dumbass, don\'t go smashing a kid\'s dream.
 Maria really believes that things like witches and {f:5:Beatrice} exist."
"Come to think of it, Maria‐chan, in social studies at your school, when you were asked to write what you wanted to be when you grew up, you wrote "a witch", didn\'t you?"
Maria nodded seriously.
{n}Tears started to run from the corners of her eyes.
.........I see. To a girl who wants to become a witch in the future,
 this "{f:5:Beatrice}" is proof that witches do exist in this world,
 and is also someone who she admires and strives to be like.
"Exiiist!
 Exiiist!
 Witches exiiist!!
 But Battler doesn\'t believe!
 Uu‐uu‐uu!!!"
"It\'s alright. They exist, witches.
 Onii‐chan believes it."
George‐aniki kneeled down and held Maria\'s head.
{n}...Watching this, Jessica poked me in the side.
...So that\'s what it is.
It\'s basically like, I just dropped the bomb that Santa Claus doesn\'t exist,
 in front of a child who believes in him, on Christmas Eve.
...I\'m not the kind of guy who likes to shatter kids\' dreams.
".........Uhh, I\'m sorry.
 I wasn\'t trying to make fun of your dreams. I apologize.
 Of course {f:5:Beatrice} exists.
 Even now she\'s living in the forest, and comes every night to the mansion to peek in and see what everyone\'s doing."
"......That\'s why you shouldn\'t go into the forest.
 And at night, you mustn\'t stay up staring into the dark forest.
 ......You might be seen by the witch of the forest, {f:5:Beatrice}.
 ............After all, Grandmother said so."
"...Uu......
 Really?
 ...Battler really believes?"
"Yep, I believe.
 Sorry for doubting it.
 ...C\'mon, let\'s make up, okay?"
I stuck out my hand and Maria grabbed it with her tiny hand, and we made up.
Maria didn\'t grumble any more than that, so George‐aniki and Jessica were relieved.
"......Oh.
 This is where all of you were?
 I was sure you had just left to go to the beach..."
Shannon‐chan, carrying a basket, was surprised to find us all gathered in front of the portrait.
"Ah, Shannon.
 Well, this is the first time Battler has seen {f:5:Beatrice}\'s portrait.
 He was just fascinated by it."
"Yes, she does that, doesn\'t she?
 ...{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama is truly beautiful.
 I am sure that she captivated the Master."
"Ahahahaha.
 In addition to the patron theory, there\'s also a theory that she was Grandfather\'s first love.
 ...Either way, although it\'s been several decades since he met her, even now she holds a special place in his heart.
 ...Which must mean that he is still captivated by her even today."
"Sheesh.
 That must have made Grandmother pretty jealous, right?"
"I don\'t know everything, but yeah, that did happen, actually.
 Apparently Grandmother believed that he was cheating on her with some blonde‐haired woman."
"......Uu?
 Good smell!
 Good smell coming from Shannon!"
Maria, sniffing, approached the basket Shannon‐chan was holding with interest.
Now that you mention it, I do notice a fragrant scent with the essence of vanilla.
"Ah, I apologize.
 I was told by Kumasawa‐san to bring them to you all."
"What is it, I wonder?
 ......Ooh, excellent!
 Cookies."
"Uu!
 Want to eat cookies!
 Want to eat cookies!
 Uu!"
"Certainly, you may eat as many as you would like.
 ...But, umm..."
Unsure whether it was really acceptable to serve cookies in a place like this in front of the portrait,
 Shannon‐chan sent us a glance which seemed to ask what we wanted to do.
...Well, thinking about it, yeah, that would be bad manners.
"Maria, why don\'t we eat someplace else?
 Let\'s put the cookies in a bento and have a picnic."
"Uu!
 Have a picnic, have a picnic!!
 If we can eat cookies, let\'s go!"
"Yeah, let\'s go get some fresh air.
 We shouldn\'t pick at food right in front of the witch."
"Oh, right, didn\'t we say that we wanted to go down to the beach in the first place?
 Let\'s go, let\'s go."
"Shannon‐chan.
 Sorry, but could I ask you to get us a blanket to sit on and some flasks of tea."
"Right...!
 Certainly."
Shannon‐chan received her instructions and gracefully bowed before retracing her steps.
We headed for the beach on our own.
Everyone headed for the entrance in a group.
...Feeling as though that witch was staring down at our backs, I turned around once more.
"...Uu.
 ......Battler, you still don\'t believe...?"
"Oh, no, I believe.
 ......That way is more fantastical!
 The Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice} gave Grandfather ten tons of gold!"
"And that gold might be sleeping around somewhere.
 Plus, they\'re saying Grandfather wrote that strange epitaph as though challenging us to find it if we can.
 I think that kind of romantic story is way better."
"20 billion yen\'s worth of goollld!
 Hehe, even if we split it up between the four of us, that\'s still a ridiculous amount of money!"
"5 billion yen for each of us...
 ...Incredible!
 With that kind of money, any business would prosper.
 No, wait, we could live our whole lives fabulously without ever working at all."
"Uu‐uu!
 Not 5 billion yen, cookies, cookies!!"
"Wahahaha, Maria would take cookies over money.
 Still, 5 billion yen, that\'s like a dream!"
"Ridiculous.
 ......Is it truly possible that you all believe in Father\'s Legend of the Gold?"
"............The story about a witch who gave him the gold and so forth, we obviously don\'t believe.
 However, there\'s no mistake about the gold."
"Multiple sources have confirmed the fact that Father was in possession of gold bars from an unknown source.
 We heard that, before the Marusoo company president died, Father showed him a large amount of gold somewhere.
 Father stated clearly to him that there were ten tons\' worth."
"That\'s just the nonsense of a senile old man.
 Along with Father, he was just fabricating a story.
 You can\'t take it seriously."
"If that gold didn\'t exist, he wouldn\'t have been able to gather so much funding...!
 Before the president died, he was a person whose sincere personality gathered a lot of respect from many in the business world.
 He wouldn\'t have become a partner to such a fraud...!"
"Aniki.
 The president of Marusoo definitely saw it.
 Ten tons of it, clearly with his own eyes.
 Even more, Dad let the president take one ingot at random and have it examined."
"......The results of the examination showed that the ten‐kilogram ingot had a purity of {ruby:99.99%:four nines}.
 He said that the Ushiromiya family crest, the One‐winged Eagle, was carved into it."
"Almost instantly, the Ushiromiya Legend of the Gold spread amongst the fixers of the business world.
 Gold from an unknown foundry has a poor rate of conversion into money.
 Thinking that it was a chance for decisive profits, they accepted it as collateral, and as a result Father was able to receive a giant loan..."
"This is the most ridiculous nonsense I\'ve ever heard.
 ...How old are you people?
 Are you still taking that fairy tale you heard as a kid at face value?"
"Where is the proof that this "ten tons of gold" even exists?
 Isn\'t it just the lies of Father and those who were closest to him?"
"......Of course it\'s just a story.
 But still, Aniki.
 The amount of money that Dad raised required a suitable quantity of collateral.
 Even if the gold was just a rumor, that he must have shown them a treasure of comparable worth is an unmistakable truth, don\'t you think?"
"It was just a fiction of gold created by our penniless father.
 He made it seem that non‐existent gold actually existed and fooled his sponsors.
 It was probably the gamble of a lifetime."
"......Fortunately, his use of those funds proved successful.
 If the Korean war demands hadn\'t come and the Ushiromiya family had not been restored, Father would probably have been hounded after as the crook of the century."
"In that case, are you saying that the gold never existed, ...and that Father made it all up?"
"Of course.
 Therefore, after he had become sufficiently successful, the fiction of the gold was nothing but an inconvenience.
 So Father made up that absurd story about the witch and black magic and made the whole thing seem less believable."
"In other words, he revealed that the gold was a complete fiction.
 If he says that he received the gold from a witch, no one would believe that it exists at all, right?"
"He may even have said it for all of your sakes.
 Nevertheless, some stupid offspring wanting to divide up this non‐existent gold with the rest of the inheritance have appeared.
 ......Rosa, don\'t tell me that even you believe this kind of a fabrication...?"
".....................I can\'t prove whether or not Father really has the gold."
"......However, as one of father\'s four children, I just want to claim my rightful share."
"Hoh...
 It seems even Rosa has learned to assert herself.
 Alright, maybe this is what you all want to say:
 that I am trying to keep all of the gold to myself..."
"Nii‐san, the fact is that you\'ve obtained a massive amount of funding.
 If we rule out the possibility that you have been embezzling Father\'s personal funds,
 ......then there\'s only one possibility left, right?"
"......Aniki, maybe you have already found the ten tons of gold bars.
 It sure looks that way to us."
"Ridiculous.
 Something like that never existed in the first place."
"Then explain yourself.
 Embezzlement of Father\'s assets; Father\'s hidden gold.
 How could you have gathered so much funding if you didn\'t use one of these?"
"I also have many friends in the political world and the financial world.
 I have done nothing more than gain their assistance.
 ......And as for that, I have no responsibility to explain it to you.
 You understand, don\'t you?
 There are some topics that can\'t be talked about."
"......If that\'s the story you insist on, then fine.
 But Aniki. Dad doesn\'t have long.
 Nobody can ensure that he will live to see this day next year."
"When Dad dies, the inheritance will be passed on immediately.
 We will all set up impartial lawyers and accountants to inspect the state of Dad\'s finances."
"If, at that time, the fact that our brother has unjustly interfered with Father\'s money comes to light...
 ......You understand, right?"
"I don\'t have a clue what you\'re talking about.
 You\'re starting to make me feel as indignant as my wife was."
"...Father\'s gold is definitely one of Father\'s assets!
 I understand it\'s money you can\'t reveal openly.
 Even so, the four siblings should have an equal right to it."
"In short, we will also have your financial situation investigated to determine whether or not you are hoarding the gold."
"You have a good opportunity right now.
 Prove the existence of this backup from friends and acquaintances that you mentioned.
 That way you will be spotless.
 And we can sportingly apologize for foolishly doubting you.
 Right, Rosa?"
"......That\'s right.
 Krauss nii‐san, you are the one who\'s avoiding the topic.
 If you were guiltless, you could just prove that you were in the right, yet you aren\'t even trying to respond."
"However, Aniki, we still have to consider your position here.
 As Dad\'s representative, you\'re probably bearing a larger share of the burden than we are.
 It wouldn\'t be fair for the rest of us, who have been living terribly relaxed lives until now, to complain without taking that into account."
"............Hoh.
 I am spoken ill of one moment and flattered the next; it is quite tiring.
 Please get to the point."
"In short, ......randomly investigating nit‐picky aspects of Father\'s wealth seems a pretty darn boorish way to do it.
 As you said, Krauss nii‐san, you\'ve probably got movements of money that are difficult to explain.
 We understand that, and that\'s why we\'ve come to consult with you.
 ...A mutually beneficial consultation."
"Consultation?
 Hoh."
"......When the inheritance is distributed, you will be rewarded for your years of hard work taking care of Dad by an agreement that is generous in your favor."
"Don\'t misunderstand us.
 It\'s not like we\'re saying that we will abandon our rights.
 It\'s just that when we claim what we deserve,
 it wouldn\'t be bad if there was a generous understanding of your position—that\'s what we mean."
"In other words, if you\'ll accept our conditions,
 at the time of the division of the inheritance, we won\'t mind leavin\' the investigation of Father\'s financial status to you, Krauss nii‐san."
All of the siblings from Eva downward suspected that Krauss was trying to steal their father\'s wealth.
In that situation, letting Krauss report on the state of their father\'s wealth by himself was extremely contradictory and a huge concession.
If, as they claimed, Krauss was actually embezzling money, Krauss would be able to hide that fact.
Besides that, it would also be possible for him to control the distribution of the inheritance in a manner favorable to himself.
Krauss, also realizing that this sounded too good to be true, couldn\'t help but feel doubt.
He had to worry about what they would ask in return for such a compromise...
"......Hoh.
 After mistrusting me completely, you now say that you\'re willing to restore your confidence in me as the eldest sibling?
 And what are you asking for?"
"Just what we deserve as siblings.
 ......You aren\'t the kind of person who would steal Dad\'s property.
 However, there is no patron financing you.
 ...Considering all that, there is a certain explanation that would satisfy the rest of us."
"......Nii‐san, you found the ten tons of gold,
 and used that as collateral to gather some funding.
 ...Yes, just like Father did in the past, right?"
"If that\'s the case, there won\'t be any funny bits in Father\'s finances.
 You\'ve always been a good son, lookin\' after Father.
 Why would we mistrust a person like that?"
".........You\'re being so roundabout I can barely understand you.
 Say it more clearly and specifically."
"Our first condition:
 Aniki, you must admit that you have found Dad\'s gold."
"...Are you asking me to admit that I possess gold that does not exist?"
"Our second condition:
 recognize our rights to a share of the gold, and pay it to us."
"How foolish.
 With the nonexistent 20 billion yen of gold, that would be 5 billion yen per person. Are you telling me to pay a total of 15 billion yen?
 ......Preposterous!"
"Keep listening until the end!
 We know that much money can\'t just appear out of nowhere.
 We\'re not askin\' you to make an impossible deal!
 Of course, regardin\' the portions of the gold, we plan to reward you sufficiently for your hard work until now in our calculations."
"Our third condition:
 the portion of the gold to the one bearing the title of successor to the Ushiromiya main family will be 50%. The remainder will be split fairly between all the siblings.
 Of course, this also includes you, Krauss nii‐san."
"Of the 20 billion, 12.5 billion will go to Aniki,
 2.5 billion will go to Eva nee‐san,
 2.5 billion will go to me,
 and 2.5 will go to Rosa."
"............A distribution that makes me so grateful I could cry.
 So you\'re saying, for the sake of the gold that doesn\'t exist, I must pay you 7.5 billion."
"What\'s wrong?
 Nii‐san, your share is five times the size of ours.
 That\'s such a good condition, I\'d be jumping for joy.
 Heheheheh..."
"Our fourth condition:
 the dividends will be paid out along with the distribution of the inheritance at the time of Dad\'s death.
 However, as a deposit, 10% of our portions will be paid to us promptly.
 The payment must be made before March of next year."
"......What do you think, Krauss nii‐san? This is an ideal chance for you to restore the trust you need to run Father\'s assets, isn\'t it?!
 Of course, it might be impossible to get a whole 7.5 billion before Father dies.
 However, you can\'t say that you couldn\'t manage a deposit of 750 mil, right?"
"Paying 700 million in half a year might be slightly bothersome,
 but someone like you, who has many friends in the political and business spheres, should be able to manage it."
"Normally, I\'d hope to receive the 7.5 billion right now, all at once.
 But out of concern for your position, if you\'ll just show your sincerity by delivering 10 percent for the time being,
 it\'s alright to let the remaining 90 percent carry over until the distribution of the inheritance.
 ...Right?
 Surely even you can offer a mere ten percent to show your sincerity?"
"............So the right to investigate the status of Father\'s assets is being sold to me for 750 million.
 .........Heh, heheheh.
 Isn\'t that great?
 You all sure have grown.
 I never thought you all would become capable of offering a deal to me."
"Nii‐san, if you accept these, the rest of us siblings will leave the investigation of Father\'s assets to you.
 However, the results of that investigation will be subject to appeal."
"...It\'s only natural, right?
 We\'d be sad if you adjusted our portions downwards by 7.5 billion."
"As a general rule, we wouldn\'t complain.
 As long as you do it neatly, it\'s fine.
 ...As long as you don\'t do anything significantly obvious, we don\'t plan to aggravate anything.
 We want the inheritance quickly as much as you do.
 We don\'t want it to get all drawn out and led astray."
"......In the case of an appeal, who would do the second investigation?"
"...............That can be you as well.
 This will probably be the first and last opportunity for us siblings to discuss this.
 ...I trust you not to let it come to that."
"Heheh, *cackle*cackle*!
 Rosa, you really can talk sometimes."
That Krauss was not trusted whatsover as the oldest sibling was by now so obvious that it requires no explanation.
The formerly tyrannical oldest brother would always abuse his privileges and infringe upon the other siblings\' shares.
...In response to that, the other three, now adults, were for the first time striking back at him by working together...
"I\'m sorry, but there are further conditions.
 Our fifth condition:
 this decision must take precedence over Father\'s will.
 .........Later on, we don\'t want some will to appear and make this decision completely useless."
".........I see that you\'re very cautious.
 ...Then let me ask, if the gold really were found, what would you do?"
"As long as you\'ve settled this matter with the corresponding payment,
 then whether the gold
 "really"
 appears or not makes no difference to us.
 ...You can think of our share as an advance payment."
"*giggle*, gives you something to live for!
 You plan to turn this island into a resort, right?
 During construction, you might stumble upon the gold by chance."
Eva let out a high‐pitched laugh.
{n}Krauss watched without even flinching.
"......Let me add a seventh condition before I accept.
 In the situation that any sibling other than myself finds the gold, they will immediately turn it over to me."
"Yes, yes, of course, we\'ll guarantee you that.
 *giggle*!"
Insignificant details.
 The others, who were forcing Krauss to pay money for some nonexistent gold,
 would of course not ensure Krauss\'s portion if they actually found the gold.
From the beginning, this deal had been nothing more than a threat directed at Krauss.
While the truth might be different, the probability that Krauss was embezzling his father\'s assets was extremely high.
When at last Kinzo faced death and it came time for the inheritance to be distributed, surely some unpleasant facts would come to light.
That situation would likely be a fatal wound to Krauss.
They had latched onto that weak point, and were threatening their brother under the veil of compromise, trying to wring out a huge sum of money.
......However, they had let one thing slip their minds.
{n}The three of them had forgotten that their oldest sibling, who they couldn\'t defeat unless they banded together, was a very nimble thinker when it came to being crafty.
Krauss relaxedly let out a gloating laugh as he spoke to Eva, who could not hide her smile, so certain she was of her victory.
"Hahaha.
 This all sounds marvellous to me.
 ......I had been feeling a deep pain in my heart at my estrangement from the rest of you.
 If by accepting these conditions, I could make our sibling relationship friendly once again, I would be quite pleased."
"I will gladly take you up on your offer.
 ......Be happy, Rosa.
 We have a deal."
"........................"
Rosa\'s expression dimmed.
 ......When her brother started talking like this, the conversation would never change for the better.
...Eva was also sensitive enough to realize this.
{n}Therefore, even though Krauss had obediently accepted the deal, she was unable to wipe away her feeling of insecurity.
"...My, how obedient.
 That\'s not like you, Nii‐san."
"That\'s harsh.
 You think I have an ulterior motive?
 Of course I don\'t.
 I\'m just like all of you."
— I\'m just like all of you.
{n}It felt as though only that part was emphasized.
The color of Rudolf\'s face darkened.
{i:"I have a plan, just like all of you"}.
{n}...That\'s what it sounded like to him.
That gave him a sense of urgency.
 Trying to bring this near‐finished discussion to a conclusion, he rushed to wrap it up.
"......Then we are good.
 ...So, Aniki.
 Would you mind signing here?
 This is a written contract containing the discussion we have been having.
 There\'s one for each person.
 Everyone will sign for the same contents."
Rudolf took four written contracts out of his breast pocket that had the details of their deal written on them.
"Of course, we\'ll also add the seventh condition that you proposed, straight away.
 Don\'t worry."
"Aniki, will you use a pen?"
Rudolf took a fountain pen out of his breast pocket and offered it to Krauss.
Krauss made as if to accept it, but then, with a small laugh, drew back his hand without taking it and spoke.
"............Actually,
 in order to make sure this agreement is definitely effective, I would like to propose a single amendment."
When Krauss said that one sentence...
{n}...all of the siblings felt at the same time as though something annoying was creeping up their backs.
"......Th‐that won\'t do.
 We\'ve already decided, haven\'t we?
 Be quiet and sign it."
"Eva, why are you so impatient?
 Of course I will sign.
 I\'ll promise you all your share of the gold, 7.5 billion yen.
 I also promise that, when Father\'s inheritance is distributed, I will cleanly and neatly liquidate it."
".........However, there is just one point on which I must ask you to compromise."
"............What are you talking about.
 What point don\'t you like...?"
"The part about promptly paying ten percent of each portion, 750 million yen.
 As you pointed out, my financial situation is not prosperous.
 While I am guaranteed to definitely collect on various future investments,
 at this time I have no choice but to admit that I am very poor."
"In short, I have absolutely no money that I can move around right now.
 ......I am incompetent, and my business skills and senses are dull.
 An "unfortunate" such as me, to use your words, has no power to move 750 million in just half a year."
"Th‐that can\'t be true.
 Are you trying to deceive us with offhand remarks?"
"At the time of the division of the inheritance, I will liquidate everything at once.
 Remove the condition that I must pay you ten percent in advance.
 ...That is all you have to do to get me to sign."
"......Krauss nii‐san, that ten percent is nothin\' more than a number to measure your sincerity, isn\'t it?
 Strictly speakin\', we shouldn\'t even be making you a deal in the first place.
 We\'re doin\' you a big favor by offerin\' to let things slide for just ten percent in good faith money."
"We explained all that to you, so don\'t you think rejectin\' that part damages our trusting relationship a little...?"
Hideyoshi had a humble expression on his face and had his hands clasped together,
 but his eyes were not calm at all.
......Krauss had already seen through the shadow in the depths of those eyes.
".........Hmph.
 Why are you all so hurried?
 ...Or are you possibly afraid of something?
 .........Rosa, won\'t you tell at least me?
 ...Secretly, without telling the rest of the siblings."
"...............It, it\'s not like I......"
"Quit it, Aniki.
 All we\'re asking is whether you\'re going to sign or not.
 Just forget about making any strange deals or anything suspicious."
"......Hoh?
 So I have no margin for negotiation.
 ...Do you claim that my position is so weak that we are not in an even relationship...?"
Shivers began to crawl up Rudolf\'s back...
Ever since he was a child, he had never been able to overcome the height of the wall that separated him from his older brother,
 and now again he began to feel himself getting sucked in by it, and the long shadow it cast...
"Shouldn\'t deals be made on an even footing?
 To me, this deal is something to restore the long lost trust of my younger brother and sisters, and deepen the love between us siblings.
 It has been a cancer in my heart, that I wished to resolve quickly."
"I am very happy that I am able to resolve it today.
 .........But you too would be very happy to see this deal quickly concluded, wouldn\'t you...?"
Krauss stared at each of the siblings.
{n}...They avoided his gaze with animal‐like instinct.
Only Hideyoshi was slow avoiding it.
{n}...So he was caught in Krauss\'s gaze.
"Hideyoshi nii‐san.
 I hear that your company has been going extremely well recently, hasn\'t it?
 You didn\'t hit any problems getting it listed as a stock, and both its performance and stock prices are constantly growing.
 I am truly jealous."
"......M‐my husband\'s situation surely has nothing to do with this."
"However, it is unfortunate that you have neglected your stockholders.
 It\'s also horrible that you were unable to solidify your base when you became stock‐listed.
 ......Before you realized it, some bad‐natured fellows had bought up a considerable amount of your company\'s stock, hadn\'t they?"
".........H‐
......how could you know something like that..."
"The same way as you.
 If you can collect evidence proving that no one would offer a loan to me, then I can collect evidence on you.
 Hahaha, is it really that strange of a thing?"
Krauss grinned broadly.
{n}...In contrast, Hideyoshi\'s face was turning obviously pale......
Hideyoshi\'s company was a fast‐food‐chain operating company that he had started from nothing.
Through Hideyoshi\'s management efforts, performance of the business repeatedly rose and magnified, and ultimately it succeeded in becoming a stock‐listed company.
The greatest advantage of being in the stock‐holding system is that, by selling stock certificates, a large amount of financing can be gained.
That amount is far greater than the actual profits from the business.
{n}This made it an extremely effective way to gather the massive funds needed to grow his company even further.
However, in exchange for financing the company, the stockholders have certain rights.
Namely, the right to observe and guide the company that they have financed, in order to raise its profits above their investment.
......That right is guaranteed to all stockholders, and they sometimes even use it to reorganize ineffectual management.
It is the "right" to prevent the money they have spent financing the company from going to waste, by watching the management of the company.
However, if they use this right forcibly, they can eject the former management and take over the company.
...Because the general body of all stockholders has the power to dismiss the management and nominate new management.
That right is exercised on a majority decision by the stockholders.
{n}And people who hold more stock get to cast more votes.
In other words, if some person or group holds a majority of the stock, they can freely chase out the old management and make the president anyone they would like.
If they want, it is even possible for them to make themselves president.
Many companies, in order to prevent their stock from being bought up by malicious people and their position from being threatened,
 take some kind of defensive measures, such as having their own employees or people close to them buy a lot of stock certificates, in order to prevent a hostile group from securing the majority.
However, since Hideyoshi\'s company had only recently become stock‐listed, they hadn\'t had the time to strengthen those defensive measures.
No, maybe Hideyoshi himself was so engrossed in the management of his company that he hadn\'t realized the dangers of being stock‐listed.
It\'s hard to say whether he should be viewed as a kind‐hearted and skilled manager immersed in management, or a foolish manager who had his feet swept out from under him...
...But in any case, there were people out there who would not let him get away with that naivety unscathed.
They rapidly bought up Hideyoshi\'s company\'s stock and instantly gained a significant amount of power.
They then sent anonymous documents to the stockholders and began to capture the majority.
The documents read: "The current management continues to make pointless investments and is ignoring the needs of the stockholders.
 Let us force the current management to retire, cut the current wasted investments, and let this company be born again as one that gives more back to the stockholders."
It is very difficult to make the actual state of a company\'s management known.
...They maliciously twisted the figures Hideyoshi had produced from a tiny amount of sleep and a constant concern for his company, and made him lose the trust of his stockholders.
Their efforts had almost collected a majority of the stock in the company.
...At that point, even Hideyoshi noticed and started to buy back the stock, but the stockholders, who realized that the company was undergoing an acquisition maneuver,
 demanded a ridiculous price for the shares that Hideyoshi was trying to buy back.
They continually tortured Hideyoshi, who had no leeway in the negotiation of the price.
One of the certainties of capitalism is that value will rise when both parties vie for the same thing.
And one of the certainties of democracy is that the majority controls everything.
So in the end, whoever manages to buy up the most stock wins.
...So whoever has the most money wins.
If Hideyoshi could obtain a large sum of money at this critical time, he would be able to avoid losing all of that which he had built up...
{a:c:
THEREFORE,
 MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE,{n}
HE WANTED A LOT OF MONEY RIGHT NOW...!}
He couldn\'t wait for the division of Kinzo\'s inheritance, which may not happen for some time.
"And you, Rudolf, you\'ve been in a lot of trouble lately, haven\'t you?
 They say it\'s scary overseas, but it seems that\'s really true.
 American trials are settled quite emotionally.
 They won\'t give a generous judgment to a foreigner.
 ......Weren\'t you advised by your lawyer that making a settlement with the other party would be more economical in the end?"
"............What is he talking about...?"
"......Ah, it\'s just troubles at work.
 It\'s no big deal.
 It\'ll be settled with money..."
Kyrie quickly recognized what Rudolf\'s complicated expression meant.
......Her husband had gotten wrapped up in some kind of trouble without her knowledge, and had been suffering alone.
"That\'s right.
 In this world, anything can be settled with money.
 After all, it can even buy back the broken bonds between siblings!
 America is very fussy about the violation of rights.
 But with money, anything can be settled.
 Long live capitalism."
"...Although, rumors abound that the settlement money may reach several million dollars...?"
Rudolf had been building a large amount of wealth with a certain type of niche market.
...However, a niche is a niche.
 It\'s definitely not a sunny job.
An American corporate giant was trying to accuse Rudolf\'s company of violating their rights.
For various reasons, it was thought that winning the trial was extremely unlikely, and Rudolf was being pressed to surrender outright.
...But even so, there was a way to resolve it with money.
{n}If he could only pay that money, though it might be painful, he could still pick himself back up.
...But if he didn\'t pay, he\'d lose everything.
{a:c:
THEREFORE,
 MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE,{n}
HE WANTED A LOT OF MONEY RIGHT NOW...!}
".........Rosa, you\'re a good and noble little sister.
 You wouldn\'t even touch a dangerous money game.
 ...However, your softhearted nature was your ruin, wasn\'t it...?
 I wouldn\'t think one should agree to become a co‐signer so lightly."
"Nn...
...umm...
...th‐that has nothing to do with you, Krauss nii‐san!!"
Rosa uncharacteristically lay bare her emotions and yelled.
{n}...Because she had thought she had kept it a secret.
{n}As Krauss watched, he let slip a muffled laugh...
......There was nothing to fear.
 Every one of them,
{a:c:
 MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE,{n}
WANTED A LOT OF MONEY RIGHT NOW...!}
In other words, the situation had been reversed.
Because only Krauss, who they were threatening, had no urgent need for a large sum of money.
Compared to that, the three who were threatening him wanted money quickly, no matter what the cost.
So the longer Krauss postponed this deal, the greater the advantage to him.
Krauss was very sly.
{n}He had known of their Achilles\' heel from the beginning.
{n}Even so, he had not been certain.
Therefore, he had hidden that until the very end, and, upon closely and completely examining their attitude, he had struck back.
"If I could, I would love to raise some money for my darling brother and sisters in their time of need.
 ...But unfortunately, I have nothing on hand."
"......If you have any sponsors in mind that can raise a whole 750 million, I suggest you try there first."
Krauss\'s elated words were horribly blunt.
{n}The other siblings could do nothing more than listen, grinding their teeth.
.........If they could think of a sponsor that convenient, they wouldn\'t have kept up this charade.
 They had entered this huge battle specifically because they had exhausted all other options.
"......If you\'re still set on relying on your older brother,
 I could use my influence to find you sponsors.
 .........Oh wait, you already said that I have no influence.
 Well then, I can\'t do anything, can I?
 ......Hehheheheheheheh!"
Krauss\'s low, gloating laugh began to fill the parlor.
The younger siblings who had, until now, been driving the oldest brother into a corner, could do nothing more than grimace and grind their teeth...
"............E‐Eva......"
"......Don\'t make me laugh...
 As if I would put myself in your debt...!
 Don\'t make me laugh...
don\'t make me laugh......!"
"..................If...
...if we relied on you, how would you help us..."
"I told you, didn\'t I?
 All I can do is find other sponsors for you.
 Of course, I will do my utmost to negotiate so that you can borrow the interest as well.
 Hehheheheh, gahahahahahahahaha!!"
"......Damn you......
taking advantage of us............"
".........Baby.
 Please calm down."
"I am calm. I\'m extremely cool......
 ...............You bastard...!"
Kyrie grabbed her husband\'s hand.
But that action made him feel even more pitiful, so Rudolf shook it off.
...Krauss laughed as though seeing that made him extremely happy.
"If only we truly could find Father\'s hidden gold, at a time like this.
 Then I could split it up into 2.5 billion yen portions for you right away.
 How sad, how sad, how very sad!
 How extremely totally truly hopelessly sad!"
"............Tonight, let us drink together as brothers and sisters, and discuss the whereabouts of Father\'s hidden gold,
 ......solve the riddle of {f:5:Beatrice}\'s epitaph together, why don\'t we?"
"With four friendly siblings all together, there is surely no puzzle that can\'t be solved.
 ...Hahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!"
"..................Hmph.
 How interesting.
 And what are the conditions that they attached?"
"......Certainly.
 Whether or not Krauss‐sama actually discovered the gold, he would pay Eva‐sama, Rudolf‐sama and Rosa‐sama a total of 7.5 billion yen for their shares.
 However, ten percent of that would be paid before March."
"Fu, hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐ha...
 Krauss, you dunce.
 That he would have his feet swept out from under him by his younger siblings...
 Truly amusing."
"......But it seems they couldn\'t seal the deal?"
".........Yes.
 Krauss‐sama exposed that Eva‐sama and the younger siblings all had an urgent need to get money."
"Hmph.
 So if he\'s given something that simple, he can see through it, then.
 He can\'t even manage incompetence.
 .........What are they doing now?"
"......That conversation has been put on hold for the time being.
 Now, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama\'s epitaph is being discussed."
"So, they are trying to solve the riddle and find out where my gold is hidden?"
"...............Yes."
Kinzo set down his glasses and snorted.
".........Will the miracle be fulfilled first,
 or will those fools expose the gold first?
 ...What a sight to behold."
"......If those fools solve my puzzle, at that time I will be completely defeated.
 They can suck my corpse down to the last fragment of bone.
 The magnitude of the fools\' greed imbues my great magic with its miraculous potential."
"......But if!!
 If the fulfillment of the miracle comes first...
 If it comes first!
 {f:5:Beatrice} will be resurrected again!!
 That smile which I have been chasing half my life will be restored...!"
"Oooooohhh, {f:5:Beatrice}!!
 The sacred night when the miracle is wagered will come, and the devils\' game will begin...!
 I will definitely win, and will definitely remain alive!!"
"You can have the lives of the others!
 I don\'t need wealth or honor or assets or gold or anything!
 I only want to see your smile one more time!!
 *coughcoughcough*!!"
Kinzo choked, apparently in great pain.
Kanon got closer and tried to pat his master\'s back, but Kinzo signaled that he didn\'t need to.
"............Do you know why I went to the trouble of exposing the hidden location of the gold so that everyone could see it?"
"......No."
"It is because magical power is determined by risk.
 The greater the number of people who try to discover {f:5:Beatrice}\'s gold,
 the greater the danger of that happening, then assuming that the bet is successful despite those long odds, the magical power will bring about an even grander miracle."
".........In other words, magic is a game.
 It is not true that the most superior person will become the winner.
 The winner becomes superior because he is granted magic.
 Do you understand?
 Just as the miracle of life is granted precisely because of a victory against divine odds of several hundred million to one.
 ..................Is this a little difficult for you to understand?"
".........My apologies."
"That\'s fine.
 ......It all comes down to this.
 To the one that solves the mystery of {f:5:Beatrice}\'s epitaph, I will give all of that which I have built up.
 Wealth, honor, gold, and succession to the Ushiromiya family headship—everything that I have established!"
"The right to tackle the riddle is not limited to my children.
 Even if it were you who succeeded in solving it, that would make you qualified to gain everything."
".........Yes.
 However,
 ......I couldn\'t possibly understand such a difficult riddle."
"Of course.
 I made it difficult.
 ...But you must also challenge it.
 That will become the seed with which the miracle of my magic will be summoned.
 If everyone challenges it, and everyone fails, that will be that."
"However, if the miracles are gathered and the magical power is born, it will happen then!
 {f:5:Beatrice} will revive.
 Therefore you too must challenge it.
 All must challenge it.
 And in doing so, they must give strength to my magic!!
 Do you understand?!"
"............Yes.
 ...I will try."
For a long while, Kinzo repeatedly muttered to himself, agitated and grabbing onto his head.
Kanon stayed where he was, alert and unmoving, until he was given the next order from his master.
...Kinzo finally realized this.
"That is all, leave me now.
 ......There is a bag of sweets on the liquor cabinet.
 You can take some with you as a reward."
"......I\'m fine.
 After all,
 .........I am furniture."
"............Hmm.
 ......So furniture doesn\'t eat sweets?
 ...Indeed.
 In that case, leave me."
"As you ask.
 ......Please excuse me."
Kanon bowed and left the study.
{n}As the door was closed, a heavy locking noise resounded.
But that was not the sound of Kanon locking the door.
{n}It was the door locking automatically.
No one could enter without Kinzo\'s permission, and once they left, they could not enter again.
......It was a mechanism that Kinzo, unable to trust his blood relatives, had created to lock himself up in his own study and isolate himself from the outside world.
......The only ones he could trust now were not the sons who shared his blood, but those servants who called themselves furniture...
"..................Doctor Nanjo, is something the matter?"
"...Ah, Genji‐san.
 Oh, it\'s just that I had no place in there anymore."
With a bitter laugh, Nanjo turned to face the door to the parlor.
...It seemed that because of that motion, Genji understood what Nanjo wanted to say.
For the most part, Genji also understood the family\'s situation.
...It must have made him want to frown, knowing that right now in the parlor, the master he served was being discussed so disrespectfully.
But it would have been very difficult to gather that from his indifferent expression.
".........Still,
 ...it isn\'t clear to me.
 ...Why did Kinzo‐san have something so provocative written, I wonder."
Nanjo looked at the portrait of {f:5:Beatrice}.
{n}......No, he actually directed his gaze beneath the portrait, at the plate with the epitaph.
"...............I fail to understand the Master\'s thoughts.
 I sense that they run very deep."
"......For as long as I can remember, whenever Kinzo‐san played chess, he would always make moves based on some far‐sighted reading of the board.
 Yes, sometimes even moves that were incomprehensible.
 ......For an average person like me, it is impossible to see through to whatever it is he\'s planning..."
"I personally suspect this may be some kind of will from the Master.
 .........He most likely intends to entrust his assets and the family headship to whoever manages to comprehend it."
"......Hoping that the danger of some outsider like myself solving it...
would force the four siblings to work together to solve the riddle.
 It could be something like that, then.
 Kinzo‐san may rudely disparage his children, but he might also be hoping that the siblings repair their relationship."
"........................"
If, as Nanjo said, this epitaph had been written to repair the relationship between the siblings, how heartwarming that would be.
...However, Nanjo and Genji both knew this was the one thing that could never be the case.
Here were the two who held the longest relationship with Kinzo, more trusted than his blood relatives,
 and even they could not guess at Kinzo\'s true motive...
"......The Master is always saying that the right to challenge the riddle is granted to everyone, whether they are a member of the family or not.
 ......How about you, Doctor Nanjo?"
"No, no......It\'s a little too hard to understand for this senile old man."
"......Actually, I wrote this epitaph down in my notebook at one point in time.
 Night after night, I would try to solve it before going to sleep, but...
...hahaha, it truly is hard.
 I believe it shall continue providing me enjoyment for the rest of my days.
 What about you, Genji‐san?"
".........I am nothing more than furniture that serves the Master.
 Gold and assets are useless to me."
"My, my, you are a humble person.
 ...That\'s probably why Kinzo‐san trusts you so much."
"If so, I am honored..."
As Nanjo lightly laughed in response, he once again looked at the epitaph.
"......Behold the sweetfish river, running through my beloved home of old.
 You who seek the Golden Land, follow its path downstream in search of the key..."
That which is written on the epitaph of the portrait of my beloved witch {f:5:Beatrice} is as follows:
{e:070:Behold the sweetfish river, running through my beloved home of old.
{n}You who seek the Golden Land, follow its path downstream in search of the key.
{n}{n}As you travel down it, you will see a village.
{n}In that village, look for the shore the two speak of.
{n}There the key to the Golden Land sleeps.
{n}{n}You who laid hand upon the key must journey as follows to the Golden Land.}
{e:070:On the first twilight, sacrifice the six chosen by the key.
{n}On the second twilight, those who remain shall tear apart the two who are close.
{n}On the third twilight, those who remain shall praise my noble name.
{n}On the fourth twilight, gouge the head and kill.
{n}On the fifth twilight, gouge the chest and kill.
{n}On the sixth twilight, gouge the stomach and kill.
{n}On the seventh twilight, gouge the knee and kill.
{n}On the eighth twilight, gouge the leg and kill.
{n}On the ninth twilight, the witch revives, and none shall be left alive.
{n}On the tenth twilight, the journey ends, and you shall reach the Home of the Gold.}
{e:070:The witch shall praise the wise, and bestow four treasures.
{n}{n}One shall be all of the Golden Land\'s gold.
{n}One resurrects all the dead people\'s souls.
{n}One even revives all the love they possessed.
{n}And one for the witch to eternally rest.
{n}{n}Rest in peace, my beloved witch, {f:5:Beatrice}.}"So...on the tenth twilight, the journey shall end,
 and you shall reach the Golden Land.
 You really are diligent, Maria.
 You did a good job taking notes on all of this."
"Uu!
 I forget a lot so I write things down!
 Write things down like Mama said!"
There was a notebook inside the handbag Maria was always carrying around,
 and {f:5:Beatrice}\'s epitaph was copied onto it.
Thanks to that,
 we were all able to challenge the puzzle of the epitaph while here on this beach.
For Jessica and the others,
 this was a puzzle that they had already tried to solve several times,
 and had already gotten bored with.
But it was a first for me,
 and I was so excited that I couldn\'t stop.
 It really tickled my male sense of romance!
"Let\'s start with the first line.
 Behold the sweetfish river, running through my beloved home of old.
 Where was Grandfather\'s old home again?"
"I heard that, before the war, the Ushiromiya family had a mansion near Odawara.
 So, that said, you\'d want to know about a sweetfish river that flows through Odawara, right?"
"Yeah, because that river\'s the starting point.
 And then it\'s got, you who seek the Golden Land, follow its path downstream in search of the key.
 What rivers are in Odawara?
 It\'s got to be one with sweetfish swimming in it."
"For sweetfish in Odawara, it\'d be the Hayakawa.
 It\'s famous for its mountain stream fishing."
"Uu.
 I haaate fish."
"Ihihi, Maria, you\'ll understand when you get o~lder!
 You\'ll be all, licklickli~ck, salty roasted sweetfish!
 Yummy~!
 Even though we just ate, I\'m getting hungry again."
"......Umm, shall I bring you some biscuits?"
"Huh?
 Oh, sorry—that\'s not what I meant, don\'t mind me!"
Shannon‐chan, who didn\'t have any afternoon chores for a while, was faithfully keeping us company.
I would have thought that, as a servant, accompanying us would force her to take care of us and tire her out, but it seemed that it wasn\'t so in her case.
...To the contrary, it seemed she was having fun joining in on the conversation with people of a similar age.
When I asked, she told me she was a live‐in worker.
{n}So normally, the only person close in age to her was Jessica.
I get it, that must be pretty wearisome.
"Alright, so I get that the sweetfish‐filled river near Odawara is the Hayakawa.
 In that case, we have to go down it!
 Don\'t you find anything if you head down the Hayakawa?"
"Ummm,
 ............if you follow it downstream, you\'ll arrive in the ocean."
"Of course, you\'d reach the mouth of the river!
 And then the third line of the epitaph was "As you travel down it, you will see a village."
 By the way, since long ago, the mouths of rivers have generally been key points for transportation, and large cities tend to be built there.
 That\'d be the next checkpoint."
"Hmmmmmm.
 That\'s a pretty good theory.
 Just like you imagined, in ancient times, there was a very prosperous old city there.
 That\'s where Odawara Castle is."
"Ah, I think I might have gone to Odawara Castle on a field trip once.
 It really was a wonderful castle."
"Yeah, I went to Odawara Castle too.
 Even though I live in a Western‐style house, it sure is true that Japanese people feel calmer with Japanese style!"
"Uu.
 I think castles are boorring.
 Theme parks are better.
 Uu!"
"I see, I see. Alright, alright!
 If we find the gold, the great Battler‐sama will generously reserve a whole theme park for a day and let you play a~ll you want!"
".........Still, Odawara Castle.
 The hidden gold of Odawara Castle...
 Oho?!
 Kind of has the right ring to it, don\'t you think?!"
"Hahahahaha!
 Well, we figured out that much when we tried this two years ago.
 The village down the river where the sweetfish swim in Odawara.
 We figured that it was probably somewhere near Odawara Castle."
"The problem is the next line.
 Alright, let\'s see where your strange reasoning can take you."
Jessica grinned broadly.
{n}It was like she was saying that, if the puzzle could be solved so easily, she would have found it long ago.
...Damn it,
 I\'ll definitely find it and keep it all for myself!
"The fourth line.
 ...In that village, look for the shore the two speak of.
 .........I don\'t know what it means by "the two", but anyway, the shore.
 .........What does it mean by the shore?!
 Hmmmm...
is there any place near there with {ruby:shore:{p:0:岸}} in its name?"
"Ummm,
 ......I have heard that there is a place called {ruby:Sogakishi:{p:0:曽我岸}} in Odawara."
"Huh?!
 Wow,
 you sure know a lot!"
"So~, what does that mean?
 Shannon‐chan, are you also after the gold, and trying to solve the riddle~?
 That makes us rivals!"
"It, it\'s not like I\'m interested in gold...
 It\'s just that...George‐sama told me about it before..."
"That\'s because we reached the same conclusion two years ago.
 We even went and laid out a map and looked it up!"
"It was about five kilometers to the north of Odawara Castle.
 There certainly was a place called Sogakishi there."
"......But after that, we get stuck.
 The fifth line doesn\'t say where the key is hidden in that place.
 Maria‐chan, could you read it for us?"
"...Uu.
 ......There the key to the...
Golden Land...
sleeps."
"Uu!
 I read it!"
"Sogakishi is probably large, and there wasn\'t ever any house built there by the Ushiromiya family.
 With no hint to where the key is hidden in that huge area, we pretty much have to throw in the towel."
"You\'re right.
 ...And without the key, we can\'t advance to the next line.
 George‐aniki, what kind of place is Sogakishi?"
"I\'m not sure...
 I\'ve never been there, so I don\'t really know, but according to the map, it\'s in the mountains.
 I\'m pretty sure it was at the base of Mount Asama."
"......Hmmmm.
 Something doesn\'t sit right with me here.
 Aren\'t puzzles for the hiding place of treasure meant to be a bit more exact than this?
 I get the feeling we\'re barking up the wrong tree with Sogakishi."
"I dunno about that, Sogakishi looks suspicious to me!
 There might be some house there that we just don\'t know about, that Grandfather lived in when he was a kid.
 I mean, the first line did go on about his beloved home of old."
"...Shannon, Grandfather has you pouring drinks and stuff for him a lot, right?
 Haven\'t you ever been made to listen to stories from his past?"
"......The Master almost never speaks of his past.
 ...However, I\'ve heard him speak of the Great Kanto Earthquake that almost destroyed the Ushiromiya family as though it had nothing to do with him,
 so he may have been living far away from the Kanto area."
"The Ushiromiya main family may have been living in Odawara, but the branch families probably weren\'t limited to that.
 Grandfather often called himself a branch of a branch family, and the least connected to the succession,
 after all."
"So, in other words!
 The beloved home of old might not even be Odawara at all..."
"I\'ve never even asked about Grandfather\'s old home.
 And he probably wouldn\'t give it away if I did."
"If the so‐called beloved home of old isn\'t referring to the Ushiromiya family\'s roots, then the Odawara theory is wrong from the beginning.
 Of course, this doesn\'t remove all possibility that it was Sogakishi.
 For example, he could have lived in Odawara when he was very young, but then moved far away later."
"Uu...
 I don\'t get what you\'re talking about.
 Uu."
Maria had been completely left out of the conversation, and she now sat puffing out her cheeks in boredom.
"Well, basically,
 if we can\'t decide where the start is for our golden game of Chutes and Ladders, we can\'t even begin to play."
"...............But wait...?
 In the first five lines the thing we\'re searching for is a key, right?
 You can enter a door even without a key, just by busting right through it.
 Can\'t we just throw away the first five lines and start figuring out the rest?"
"Ooh...
 I hadn\'t thought of that."
"Oh well, we\'re just killing time anyway.
 Let\'s hear the rest of your reasoning!"
"......But in the next part it quickly becomes disturbing..."
Shannon‐chan frowned slightly.
After looking back at Maria\'s notebook to recall what was written there,
 ...alright, I agree.
"On the first twilight, sacrifice the six chosen by the key...
 It sure does get horrible quickly."
"On the second twilight, it says to tear apart the two who are close.
 Does that mean to make them break off their romance?
 Or literally tear them apart?
 I don\'t know, but either way, it\'s pretty disgusting."
"Even if we ignore the meaning of that second line, on the first twilight it\'s six people,
 and on the fourth through eighth twilights it\'s five people,
 so at least eleven people must become sacrifices."
"Uu.
 Sacrifices to revive {f:5:Beatrice}!"
"...I see, sacrifices to bring back the witch...
 I guess you can take it that way.
 As a result, the witch revives on the ninth twilight......
 ...This last part is glorious."
"............On the ninth twilight, the witch revives, and none shall be left alive.
 ......So everyone dies in the end anyway."
"And then it\'s got the goal finally being reached on the tenth twilight that follows.
 Not sure how anyone "shall reach the Golden Land" if everyone\'s dead."
"...It seems to allow for different interpretations as to whether or not the traveler who holds the key would be included in the "none shall be left alive" part."
"But there\'s something pretty interesting written at the end.
 The lines about how, after reaching the goal,
 four treasures will be given by the witch.
 One shall be all the gold.
 The problem is the next one.
 It says she\'ll resurrect all the dead people\'s souls, right?
 Doesn\'t it seem like this refers to everyone that died in the earlier lines?"
".........If you put it like that, the next one, the part about even reviving the love they possessed,
 might be referring to the pair torn apart on the second twilight."
"That\'s right.
 And the fourth one refers to the ninth twilight.
 The fourth treasure is putting the witch, revived on the ninth twilight, back to sleep again."
"...If we interpret it favorably,
 it\'s hectic with people dying and being broken up, but it\'s all made well in the end.
 The awakened witch once again sleeps, and all that\'s left is plenty of gold."
"The witch must have her hands full with all this killing, reviving, breaking up, and reuniting people."
"Not to mention waking up and sleeping.
 Hahahahaha."
"Oh well, just when the tale of the hidden gold was getting interesting, as soon as the witch\'s story is tied in, it quickly gets pretty shady."
"No kidding, ahahahahahaha!"
I laughed along with Jessica.
{n}After all, a witch was just ridiculous.
...Of course, once we started laughing like that, Maria, who believed in witches, got angry.
"Uu!
 Witches are awesome!
 They can do anything with magic!
 Even kill.
 Even bring back to life.
 Even give love, even take it."
"Can fly in the sky, can become invisible, can even make gold and bread out of nothing!
 Uu!
 Uu!!
 Uu‐uu‐uu!!"
"Erk, oh no...
 My bad...it\'s just a joke!"
Jessica apologized, sticking out her tongue, but Maria didn\'t accept it.
She grabbed her notebook back out of my hands, and, opening to the other pages, tried to prove that witches existed.
Those pages had colored illustrations of witches drawn on them,
 and conveyed the fantastical image Maria had of witches well.
They were not depicted as the normal sinister crooked‐nosed hags flying around on brooms,
 but as dreamlike people with mysterious powers, who could do anything and wore beautiful dresses—
just what you would expect from an imaginative young girl.
Dancing through the sky, crossing a rainbow,
 dancing around all night with magical teacups and teapots that would never get empty no matter how much you poured out of them.
With a flourish of their wands, the stars in the sky would become candy and pour down,
 and flowers that produced sweets would bud by the roadside.
......To Maria, witches were the sole thing that could give form to the magical dreams that so captivated her.
The last thing enriching her reality, which revealed more and more of its bland nature to her with every inch she grew.
That was why Maria believed in witches.
She didn\'t want that dream to be insulted.
{n}And for that very reason, nor did she want the epitaph, which affirmed the existence of witches, to be insulted.
Because the witch {f:5:Beatrice} {i:is} Maria\'s dream...
"To Maria‐chan, this is not something that points to the hiding place of the gold,
 but magic to revive the witch."
So, it was the single bridge...
between Maria and the witch.
Maria was very angry and clung onto George‐aniki.
Jessica and I scratched our heads and apologized.
...It might not be possible to smooth things over again like the time she got mad in front of the portrait.
Maria didn\'t want to be easily consoled.
{n}As Jessica and I hung our heads, wondering what we could do, Shannon‐chan timidly opened her mouth in our place.
"Umm,
 .........Maria‐sama, did you know...?
 There is a ghost story about {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama that has been passed down amongst the servants."
"......Uu?"
"Ah, ahh, yeah, that\'s right!
 Shannon, tell us about it.
 I don\'t really know, but it\'s apparently pretty famous amongst the servants."
"What\'s this?
 A ghost story?"
"Yes.
 It seems it\'s a story from before we were born.
 I\'ve also heard it from my mother."
"......Yes.
 It has been passed down since the mansion was built on this island.
 ......The servants of that time whispered that the mansion had two masters, one of the day and one of the night."
The tale that Shannon told...
was just like a typical campfire ghost story.
If there was a forest with a witch living inside it,
 ...then, inevitably, the witch was going to pay the mansion a visit.
At some point, this ghost story naturally sprouted up between the servants.
"Doors and windows they were sure they\'d shut or locked would be open when they came around to double‐check.
 Lights they\'d definitely turned off would be on,
 and lights they\'d definitely turned on would be off.
 Things would disappear from where they had been placed,
 and things would appear when no one had any memory of putting them there."
"......When any of these things happened, the old servants would say that the witch had visited the mansion, invisible, and had played pranks."
"Uu!
 See, she exists!
 {f:5:Beatrice} exists!!"
"Yeah, she exists.
 I remember often being unable to find my bag before heading to school..."
Maria puffed out her chest with an "uu‐uu" as though this was the final proof that the witch existed.
If I said it out loud, Maria would probably be hurt again, so I didn\'t, but...
...I mean, you hear that kind of story everywhere.
Depending on the place, it might be blamed on fairies or something.
{n}It\'s just that, on this island, they call it the witch.
Of course, you would expect that walking around a vast, elegant mansion at night would be a little unsettling.
It\'s an island devoid of people.
 Since the mansion is so drafty, walking around on the night of a thunderstorm would certainly be eerie.
"In addition, some servants have also seen will‐o\'‐the‐wisps and glittering butterflies dancing around.
 ......Kanon‐kun also said he saw something like that when he went patrolling one night."
"And recently, the servants have been talking about strange footsteps inside the mansion near midnight.
 We have whispered together that {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama from the portrait sometimes makes herself invisible and walks through the mansion."
"...It happened a long time ago,
 but I have also heard those kinds of footsteps while patrolling at night."
"......Whew.
 That\'s scary..."
"Ah, ...but,
 there\'s nothing to be afraid of, you know?
 {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama is another ruler of this mansion separate from the Master.
 So, she won\'t do anything bad, as long as you respect her and don\'t act oddly afraid."
"However, she\'s fearsome if you don\'t respect her, right?"
"...Yes.
 I heard that someone who quit just before I began working, after falling down the stairs and receiving a large injury to their back,
 had been speaking badly of {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.
 Because of that, there was a rumor between the servants that {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama\'s anger had been brought down upon this person..."
"Uu...
 Anger will definitely be brought down on Battler and Jessica...
 Uu..."
"I, I, I\'m sorry!
 I don\'t want her anger brought down upon me!
 I apologize, Maria.
 Of course, I also apologize to the witch.
 I\'m sorry, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, please forgive an outsider\'s nonsense."
"I\'ll apologize as well.
 I\'m sorry, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.
 .........Will the witch be able to forgive us now?"
"...Uu.
 Don\'t know.
 Witches are fickle, so they forgive when they forgive, and don\'t when they don\'t.
 Uu!"
"That\'s no good...
 Maria‐chan, isn\'t there some kind of charm that could prevent Battler‐kun and Jessica‐chan from having {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama\'s anger brought down upon them?
 Maybe something to ward off magic?"
By relying on Maria, who was proud of knowing the most about witches, George was trying to revive her self‐esteem.
......I was once again forced to admire his ability to comfort children.
After crossing her arms and pondering seriously as to whether there was some charm capable of protecting Jessica and myself from the witch\'s wrath,
 Maria began flipping through the pages of her handbook.
I had thought it was just a simple scribbled diary,
 ......but it turned out that there were also many pages that looked like they had come from a book on black magic.
She was intently comparing several such pages, onto which had been copied what looked like magic circles.
.........It looks like that black magic hobby wasn\'t limited to Grandfather alone.
Perhaps she had finished her research;
 she vigorously closed the notebook with a snap, threw it into her handbag, and began fishing through that bag\'s contents.
It seemed that various jumbled up things were in there.
For a while, she continued to take out various pieces of junk—although they were probably important magical items to her—
and repeatedly throw them back in, saying they were wrong.
She looked a little humorous, almost like Santa Claus deliberating over which present to give.
Finally, it seemed that she had excavated what she was looking for.
With a face unimaginably brighter than the difficult expression she had worn until now, she stuck "them" out to Jessica and me.
"Uu!"
As I reached out to grab it, I noticed that it was a very cheap‐looking charm.
It looked like a bracelet made from a plastic rosary,
 with a scorpion‐motif medal attached.
I mean, you often find cheap accessories that correspond to the constellations.
It felt like a gift that you might win in the crane game at an arcade.
 It really looked like something like that.
There were two.
 Probably one for me and one for Jessica.
......However, considering the odd fact that there were two of them, they looked like cheap manufactured goods,
 and it was quite hard to think of them as magical items.
"You\'re giving these to me and Battler?"
"Uu!
 With these charms, even {f:5:Beatrice} is no problem!
 Because the scorpion has the power to block magic!"
"Huh, really?
 Didn\'t think scorpions could do that."
"Uu, Battler doesn\'t believe!
 Uu‐uu‐uu!"
I had inflamed Maria again because I said too much...
Maria took out her notebook again, and turned and pointed to page after page,
 going on and on about how the scorpion had holy power, and had been drawn on magic‐repelling magic circles since ancient times.
"......Ah, I\'ve heard about that from some of the other young servants.
 Something about how the scorpion is drawn as a magic‐repelling symbol in sorcery..."
"Huh, really...!"
"Uu!
 The scorpion protects against bad magic and disasters.
 And emerald brings peace to the heart.
 So it has double the effect!
 Uu!"
"It\'s true.
 The scorpion is wrapping around an emerald, protecting it.
 I see, that seems very useful."
I really wanted to make fun of this worthless‐looking charm,
 but as I watched Maria explaining the charm with all of her heart, and realized that she had prepared them out of consideration for us,
 it felt as though, even if it were just a prize from a game center, it would still be beneficial.
Material quality isn\'t what\'s important about charms.
 It\'s the strength of the feelings behind them.
{n}I\'d like to think I have enough respect for myself not to make fun of those.
"Okay, thank you.
 I apologized to {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, but, even in the worst case where I\'m cursed, I\'ll be safe now thanks to your charm.
 Right, Jessica?"
"Yeah, that\'s right!
 Thank you, Maria."
"Uu!
 Wear it on your arm when you want a peaceful heart.
 If you put it in your wallet, your money won\'t go down!
 If you hang it from a doorknob, bad things can\'t get in!
 A really useful charm!"
"What an incredible effect.
 If it is a charm that Maria‐sama can recommend with confidence, I am sure it will be reliable."
As Shannon‐chan tapped her hands together lightly, Maria stuck out her chest.
She was completely cheered up again.
If it would keep her in this good of a mood, it would probably be worth it to let Maria lead the discussion for a while longer.
When you think about it, she hadn\'t shared in our excitement when we talked about the gold\'s hidden location, so I think she had gotten a little bored.
While eating the cookies Kumasawa‐san had baked, Jessica and I asked Maria this and that about black magic.
Maria happily chatted away in response to our questions.
For each one, George‐aniki and Shannon‐chan would act surprised and agree with everything she said.
The color of the clouds in the sky grew progressively heavier, but the cousins really enjoyed communicating freely after one year of separation...
"......Hm.
 Did I just feel a drop on my forehead?"
"Huh?
 You might have."
As George‐aniki rubbed his forehead, he looked up at the sky.
Considering the color of the sky and the dampness of the air, raindrops could easily have started falling down at any moment.
It also seemed like the wind had gotten a little stronger.
"Uu?
 I didn\'t feel a drop.
 I\'m the only one.
 Uu!"
"Calm down, neither did I.
 Anyway, I\'m sure that it\'ll rain so much tonight that everyone will get the same amount of raindrops."
"That\'s right.
 Maybe we should head back soon...?"
Shannon‐chan looked down at her watch.
{n}It may already be well into the evening.
"Time to get back to work already?"
"Yes.
 ...I enjoyed this time I spent together with you all.
 Thank you very much."
"Tell Kumasawa‐san thanks for the cookies.
 Alright everyone, help out with the cleanup."
Shannon‐chan declined our help, saying that this was a servant\'s job,
 but picking up a dropped fork before the waitress has to is like my purpose in life.
We folded up the blanket, gathered up the trash, and helped clean everything up.
"Uu!
 The trash is getting awayyy!
 Uu‐uu!!"
"Oh no it isn\'t, I\'ll grab it before you!"
"Uu!!
 I\'m going to get it!
 Uu‐uu‐uu!"
"Mariaa!
 Don\'t get your shoes wet, you\'ll get in trouble!"
To Maria, chasing after some trash that the strong winds had sent flying was just like an extension of our playtime.
By the time we finished cleaning up, the wind had started blowing very strongly.
It looked like a good chance to head back.
"You all really helped me out.
 Thank you very much."
"...It really looks like you\'re out of time.
 It\'s alright if you head back first."
George‐aniki perceived from her hurried appearance that very little of her free time was left.
"Genji‐san is very rigorous about time.
 If you aren\'t at the right place at the right time, he can be very strict."
"We\'ll see you later.
 Do your best with your work."
"Ye‐yes!
 ......Then if you will excuse me."
After making a respectful bow, Shannon‐chan hurried off in the direction of the rose garden.
"Okay, let\'s head back to the guesthouse.
 We can watch TV or something and relax a little."
"Uu!
 Watch TV!
 Watch TV, uu!"
"Then it\'s decided.
 Let\'s all head back and watch TV together."
Even Maria, who was still not tired of playing, agreed when she thought about watching TV.
We headed up the gentle stairs and returned to the rose garden.
The wind had become very strong, and roses shook throughout the garden like ripples on water.
This might be our last chance to see these beautiful roses.
{n}Tonight\'s typhoon is sure to ruin them...
"These roses might be done in by tonight\'s winds."
"Yeah.
 I\'d say they were lucky, though.
 After all, they got to welcome all of you before the typhoon."
"A flower will always lose its petals at some point.
 However, because of that, we can admire them even more when they are in bloom."
"That\'s right.
 ...Maria, burn this image into your eyes.
 At this moment, they are the best roses of the year."
"Uu.
 Burned into eyes."
Right then, Maria suddenly clapped her hands.
{n}It looked like she had remembered something.
"......My rose...
 The typhoon will send it flying.
 ......Uu!"
"Oh, you mean that unhealthy rose George‐aniki marked with a ribbon?"
It seemed that Maria remembered where the rose was.
She ran at full speed.
 The rest of us followed her.
"............Uu?
 Uu."
"Where was that again...?
 I\'m sure it was somewhere around here."
We searched everywhere around that area, but, after all, it was only a single flower amongst all of these roses.
Even though we knew it was somewhere close by, it wasn\'t proving easy to find.
The winds that made up the front lines of the typhoon were making the roses throughout the garden undulate.
 It was almost like it was teasing us by making the location of Maria\'s rose impossible to find...
"Maybe it wasn\'t here...
 Let\'s try spreading out a bit in our search."
"Sounds good.
 Let\'s go for strength in numbers."
".........Hm?
 What\'s up, Maria?"
As we made to split up and search, Maria tugged on my jacket with an unhappy face.
......It felt like her intention was to stop us from going to another place.
"What is it, what happened?"
"......Uu.
 My rose is here.
 It\'s here...!"
"But it\'s actually not, is it...?
 Maybe it was on the other side of the flower bed.
 If we all look, we\'ll find it fast, right?"
"Uu!!
 It\'s here!
 My rose is here!!
 Look for it!
 Look—for—it!!
 Uuu!!"
Maria stomped her feet in irritation.
......She was pointing at the spot, saying it was definitely there, yet it actually wasn\'t.
And yet, if we went to go search elsewhere, she got mad.
...We were at a loss for what to do.
For a while, we would have to stay with Maria,
 and pretend to search through this rose thicket.
"......Uu.
 Uu...!
 Not here.
 ......Not here!
 Not here!
 Uuu!!"
Maybe she\'s saying that it should be here but isn\'t.
{n}Maria became increasingly ill‐tempered...
"...Oh man,
 Maria is really losing her temper."
"Maria sometimes starts to really care about really pointless things.
 If she gets what she wants, that\'s alright, but..."
"You can\'t find something that isn\'t there...
 That\'s not good..."
Just as we were starting to despair for a way out of the situation,
 Maria shouted out loudly.
"Mamaa!!
 Uu‐uu!!"
In the direction she was waving her hand, Auntie Rosa\'s figure was visible.
Maybe she wanted to look at the garden one more time before the typhoon came,
 or maybe she had some business at the guesthouse.
Auntie Rosa was coming from the mansion.
{n}She quickly noticed her daughter\'s voice and came over.
"Oh my, what happened, everyone?
 Are you looking for something?"
"Look for iiit!
 Mama, you look for my rose too!
 Uu‐uu‐uu!!"
"Your rose?"
"We found an unhealthy rose around here and marked it."
"We tied a candy wrapper or something around it, tight.
 ...But Maria, if I remember correctly, it was growing right in front and really stood out, didn\'t it?
 Unless it grew legs and ran off somewhere, it must\'ve been somewhere else.
 Aren\'t you just remembering it wrong?"
"Uu!!
 It is here!!
 It—is—here!!
 Battler doesn\'t believe!
 Uu‐uu!!"
"For the umpteenth time, will you please stop that "uu‐uu" nonsense?!
 Mama will look for it, so stay quiet!!"
I was a little surprised to see Auntie Rosa, who I had only ever seen as gentle, get angry.
Auntie Rosa began searching as well, so we went along with her for the time being,
 but we were already more than sure that it wasn\'t around here.
...And so, Auntie Rosa also realized, very quickly, that it wasn\'t here.
"The rose isn\'t here.
 Did you mistake this place for somewhere else?
 There are so many roses around—"
"Uu!!
 Uuuu!!!
 That\'s wrong!!
 It is here!!
 Mama doesn\'t believe!
 Uu‐uu‐uu!!!"
"I do believe you, that\'s why I\'m searching!
 But it isn\'t here!"
"Uu‐uu!!
 But it is here!!
 It is here but it isn\'t!!
 Uu‐uu‐uu!!"
"Then someone must have ripped it out!
 Just stop whining like that!!"
"Uu‐uu‐uu!!
 Who ripped out my rose, who?!!
 Give it back, give it back!!
 Uu‐uu!!
 Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!!"
"How should I know!!
 Stop it, stop that whining!!"
Auntie Rosa slapped Maria\'s left cheek with her palm.
{n}For that instant, Maria was shocked into silence.
Of course, it was only for an instant.
{n}When Maria realized that her wish was being rejected before it could be fulfilled, she started yelling with an increasingly louder voice.
"Uu‐uu!!
 Uu‐uu‐uu!!
 My rose!
 My rose!!
 Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!!"
"Didn\'t I tell you to stop that weird habit!!
 That\'s why all of the kids in your class make fun of you!!
 Cut it out!!"
Once again, her palm slapped Maria\'s cheek.
This time she didn\'t go silent.
{n}She choked as she started crying, and began to bawl in an increasingly louder voice...
Auntie Rosa was clearly irritated, and lifted her hand once more to try and shut her daughter up...
"A‐Auntie Rosa...
 Now, now...she\'s just a little kid...there\'s no reason to get so serious...ihihi."
I attempted to intervene with a forced smile and my hands clasped together,
 ...but the deadly serious look I was thrown by Auntie Rosa taught me quickly that I shouldn\'t butt in.
"I\'m sorry, would you all return to your room for a little while?
 Your auntie needs to have a little talk with Maria."
"Uu‐uu‐uu!!
 Nobody believes in my rose!!
 Even though it was here!!
 Uu‐uu!!
 Look for it!!
 Look—for—it!!
 Here, it was here!!
 Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!!"
"But it\'s not here!!
 Then you must be confusing it with somewhere else, mustn\'t you?!"
"Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!
 It is here!!
 It is definitely here!!
 Uu‐uu‐uu!!"
"Then it has disappeared!!
 Give it up!!"
"Why?!
 Why did my rose disappear?
 Why, why?!
 Uu‐uu‐uu!!!"
"I don\'t know that!!
 So stop saying "uu‐uu"!!"
Auntie Rosa once again raised her hand and, overrun by emotions, slapped Maria\'s cheek.
{n}It was so strong, it knocked Maria over.
"H‐hey...Auntie Rosa,
 even if she is your daughter, you shouldn\'t be violent like that..."
I stepped between them to protect Maria, who was still on the ground, crying "uu‐uu".
......I know that problems between parent and child are none of my business as an outsider.
{n}But I wasn\'t brought up to just silently observe something like this...
"Don\'t you think it\'s weird, Battler‐kun?
 Do you have any girls at your school that mutter "uu‐uu"?"
"Well, I am in high school...
 But for an elementary schooler, I think saying "uu‐uu" is pretty cute..."
"Cute?
 Saying "uu‐uu" is cute?
 Cute?!"
It seemed that my reckless words had brought Auntie Rosa\'s wrath down upon me.
{n}She grabbed my collar with a terrifying expression...
"Don\'t say such nonsense!!
 Do you know how old Maria is?
 She\'s nine years old!
 She\'s a fourth grader, you know?!
 She\'s not a kindergartner!
 And even so, she still says "uu‐uu" during class!!"
"Do you understand?!
 This kid, do you know what they say about her when they bully her?!
 Thanks to this weird habit, she still hasn\'t made even a single friend!
 Don\'t turn your eyes from reality and recklessly call Maria cute!!
 Think much, much more seriously about this kid\'s future!!!"
"Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!!
 Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!!"
"I told you, stop saying "uu‐uu"!!!
 Didn\'t I tell you to stop it!!"
Auntie Rosa struck Maria\'s quivering head from which an increasingly unsatisfied voice was rising.
I tried to stop her, but she thrust me away...
My back collided with George‐aniki.
"......A long time ago, Auntie Rosa also thought of it as nothing more than one of Maria‐chan\'s baby words...
but she is now midway through elementary school, so the fact that it hasn\'t been fixed has bothered her a lot recently..."
"It\'s not like it matters what kind of words she uses..."
"You can\'t become a proper member of society like that.
 ...So, even though it\'s not a pleasant scene to watch,
 ......this is a problem between mother and child."
".........Well,
 my mom\'s always giving me hell about how I speak, too."
If you look at it that way, maybe an outsider shouldn\'t interfere with this, even though it\'s painful to watch...
"Battler‐kun, didn\'t you ever have any bad habits as a kid that you couldn\'t fix and got you in trouble?"
"......Well, one or two.
 On Parents\' Day, I got a huge telling‐off in front of everyone, and it was so embarrassing, I couldn\'t stand it."
"Well then, you can understand Maria‐chan\'s feelings right now.
 ......I\'m sure she doesn\'t want us to be here now.
 ......Do you understand as well, Jessica‐chan?"
"............I don\'t think anyone likes to be seen when they\'re being punished."
"Let\'s go.
 Let\'s return to the guesthouse.
 Then, after Maria‐chan comes back,
 let\'s welcome her as if nothing happened.
 ...That\'s...probably for the best, isn\'t it?"
We thought that George‐aniki\'s point was probably correct,
 ...and if we could use that correct‐sounding reason to justify our retreat from this painful scene, that was probably enough for us.
Jessica and I nodded at George‐aniki, and we all left.
We called towards Maria that we were going to head to the guesthouse,
 but since it didn\'t seem to reach her ears, we felt guilty and shameless even saying it...
"In that case, look by yourself as much as you want!
 Mama doesn\'t care!!"
"Uu!!!
 Look for it!
 I\'ll look for it by myself!!
 Look for it even if Mama doesn\'t care!
 Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!"
"Have it your way!!"
After blasting her with those last few words, Rosa spun on her heels and quickly returned to the mansion.
Maria probably viewed that as a cold, hurtful gesture.
But from Rosa\'s perspective, that was not her intention.
...It was because the hand which she had so emotionally struck Maria\'s cheek with was still numb.
...It was because, if she stayed there screaming, she might again be taken over by her emotions, and continue slapping her daughter\'s cheek over and over.
After Rosa left, only Maria was left in the rose garden, all alone.
The wind began to blow stronger and stronger, and every once in a while, a raindrop would fall on her forehead.
...However, Maria couldn\'t leave that place.
{n}Not until she found that poor, withering rose.
It had definitely been there.
 ......And yet,
 it wasn\'t there.
{n}Even though she knew the place, and even though this was it,
 it wasn\'t there.
Maria, while bitterly staring at the place it was supposed to be, thought frantically.
Maybe the angle I\'m looking from is wrong.
{n}Maybe the height I\'m looking from is wrong.
......While gazing at a single point,
 Maria repeatedly changed her position and continued to stare.
The wind was getting increasingly stronger......
But Maria kept on looking for that rose in front of the flower bed...
.........Kinzo noticed the sound of the raindrops beating on the window.
{n}It had finally started to rain.
{n}It had begun later than the weather report had predicted.
Kinzo, as if being summoned by the sound of the rain, approached the window.
{n}The sound of the rain is a sound of silence.
That sound feels quieter than any silence,
 and makes humans remember that, in the end, they are alone from when they are born to when they die.
"......You\'re late, {f:5:Beatrice}."
Were those words directed at the rainy sky...?
{n}No one could be seen in the direction of Kinzo\'s gaze.
"......So, shall we begin?
 Our banquet of miracles.
 ......In this very moment, this island has been cut off from the world.
 Now there are none who can interrupt my ritual."
"There are many fitting sacrifices for you.
 Four of my children.
 Three of their companions.
 Four of my grandchildren.
 Me and my guests and my servants!
 You may eat up as many as you please."
"The key of fate will select the sacrifices in accordance with the Demons\' Roulette.
 If that roulette chooses me, even I will become your sacrifice.
 ......However, because of that...
because I will bet on that madness,
 ......I will definitely create a grand miracle."
"...Come, devour as much as you wish...!!
 I will overcome that roulette.
 Yes, I\'ll put everything on the line.
 First, I will return the headship of the Ushiromiya family.
 Take it!!"
As Kinzo violently opened the window, he ripped the golden ring from his finger, and forcefully threw it away.
......At that moment, thunder resounded, giving the illusion that the lightning had accepted the ring.
"And.........when you are resurrected,
 it will be me who stands there.
 I will live until the end and watch over you as you awaken."
".........Now come, {f:5:Beatrice}...
 Welcome to my banquet...!
 In exchange for all that I have created, show me a miracle one final time.
 ......Oooooohh,
 ...{f:5:BeatriceeEee}............"A news ticker popped up on top of the TV program we were watching.
{n}The disaster report told how municipalities all over were continually sending out rain, flood, and wave warnings.
Of course, the harshly beating raindrops on the window were much more convincing.
"......This rain\'s incredible.
 Still, when it\'s raining this hard, it feels like it\'s going to stop soon."
"You wish!
 They said the typhoon\'s moving slow, so it could be like this all day tomorrow.
 And even a little weather\'d be enough to stop the boats."
"It looks like we won\'t be able to head out on Sunday after all.
 ...I\'m glad I was cautious and didn\'t make any appointments for Monday with the outside world."
"I guess this means...ihihi...it looks like we\'ll be skipping school Monday~.
 Living on an island\'s starting to look pretty good!
 ......Come to think of it, Jessica, you have to take a boat to school every day, right?
 What do you do when the boats are closed down?
 Do you stay home when it rains and show up late when the wind\'s blowing, like King Kamehameha?"
"If the boats don\'t come, I stay home.
 Still, it\'s not as good as it sounds.
 Most of the time, I get ordered to do private study, and they\'re super anal about checking it, so it\'s not like I can take it easy."
"During the rainy season, when the weather stays bad for a long time,
 you must be forced to miss a bunch of days in a row?"
"Yep, that happens.
 But then, every single day, I\'ll get a call from my homeroom teacher, sourly instructing me on what to study and what to turn in."
"She can\'t slack off as easily as you\'re thinking, Battler‐kun.
 She has to follow the rules for people that travel to school by boat and get a good amount of studying done."
"It\'d actually be easier to just go to school.
 In my own room, I get distracted and can\'t concentrate.
 Plus, being made to do nothing but workbooks for several days straight is really mentally stressful."
"......When I\'m ready for college, I really just wanna go some place with dorms and say goodbye and good riddance to this pain‐in‐the‐ass island."
"Huh...
 So, by the way, what do you do when the weather\'s good in the morning, but then gets so bad on your way home that the boats are closed?
 Do you spend the night at school?"
"That actually happens a lot.
 So they have some lodgings there for people who can\'t get back to the island.
 I stay over there.
 Sometimes, when it gets really bad, I can\'t get back home for a few days at a time."
"If you look at it from the perspective of those people who have to go to school every day on a train packed to over 200% capacity,
 it\'s easy to irresponsibly think that going to school on a boat seems pretty interesting and fun.
 But it\'s actually hard work in a lot of ways."
"Inconsiderate tourists say that kind of thing all the time.
 I\'ve had enough of island life.
 I want to finish high school quick and leave this island behind."
"There must\'ve been a full boarding school you could\'ve gone to.
 Why\'d you go and choose the school on Niijima?"
"That\'s what I wanted from the very beginning!!
 It\'s Mom, she\'s always going on about how I need to learn manners and discipline as the successor to the head."
"...In the end, I got stuck with a high school close to home.
 Man, I hate this island.
 I just want to go live in a city.
 A city where it doesn\'t matter if rain or even spears fall from the sky, \'cause as long as you stick some casual clothes and sandals on,
 you can still get to a shop in less than five minutes..."
"Hahahaha.
 Hold out just a bit more.
 It\'s only a little longer until you graduate high school, right?"
"I can\'t wait a little longer.
 Aaaaaah..."
Jessica stretched out and reclined on the sofa.
Maybe because now was a bad time slot, there weren\'t any interesting programs on,
 and we had nothing to do but languidly kill time until we were called for dinner.
In the end, Maria had not returned to the cousins\' room.
She had probably been brought back to the mansion by Auntie Rosa.
It had to be pretty boring for Maria, all by herself while the adults are having a confusing conversation.
......We thought we might head over to the mansion to see her, but after all, there was this lousy weather,
 and there wasn\'t much time until dinner, so we stayed where we were.
At that time, we heard the sound of a humble knock.
{n}Jessica answered.
"Hello~!"
".........The preparations for dinner are complete.
 Please come to the mansion."
It was Kanon‐kun\'s voice.
 He went to all the trouble of coming from the mansion in this rain just to call us over?
Couldn\'t he have just called us on the telephone?
{n}......Oh well, maybe sometimes part of a servant\'s duty is to go against common sense.
"Just when I was getting hungry.
 Let\'s go."
George‐aniki turned off the television and stood up.
"My stomach\'s been growling for a~ges!
 Main family dinners were always fancy as hell, every time!
 And didn\'t Gohda‐san say it was calf steak or something?
 Oohh, I can\'t wai~t!!"
"They get even more fabulous on the day of the family conference.
 Even I\'m looking forward to it!
 Let\'s go, let\'s go."
As we left the room, Kanon‐kun bowed silently and respectfully.
"Alright, let\'s go.
 Is the rain nasty out there?"
"......Yes.
 Please take care not to get your garments wet."
After seeing the three of us out, Kanon‐kun peered into the empty room.
".........Is Maria‐sama not with you...?"
"Nope?
 Isn\'t she with Auntie Rosa?"
Rosa, lying on a sofa in the empty parlor, had fallen asleep at some point.
...She was bearing a burden on her shoulders that the children could never even imagine.
Therefore, when she let herself relax, that exhaustion quickly led her into the world of sleep.
Realizing this, Genji brought a blanket over to her.
{n}When he tried to spread it over her, her eyes snapped open as though she had received an electric shock.
"..................ah...!
.........
 ......Oh, it\'s you, Genji‐san......thank you."
When she realized that the thing that had touched her was just a blanket, and that Genji had been considerately giving it to her, she let out a sigh of relief.
"......Did I wake you?
 My sincere apologies."
"No, it\'s okay.
 I hadn\'t planned on sleeping in the first place.
 ...What time is it now?"
Asked for the time, Genji checked a pocket watch that he took out of his chest pocket.
".........It is slightly after six o\'clock."
Rosa gave her head a little shake as she realized that, even though it had felt like she had slept for a long time, not much time had actually passed.
...Even though she didn\'t feel rested at all, the drowsiness that wrapped around her felt very deep.
"Thank you, I\'ll be fine without the blanket...
 I mustn\'t sleep at such a strange time.
 My sense of time has been completely thrown off.
 ..................The rain...
has finally come down, I see."
Rosa finally realized that the peaceful sound that had put her to sleep was actually the rain that had started falling.
"The wind is blowing hard, too.
 ...Perhaps the typhoon is finally upon us?"
"......That is what they are saying on television.
 The typhoon is moving slowly, and they expect it to be like this all throughout tomorrow."
"I see...
 .........That wonderful rose garden, that must have been my last chance to see it."
From the window, what she could see of the rose garden was completely blurred by the wind and the rain.
"...Maria...
 ......That\'s right, where\'s Maria?!"
"............I have not seen her.
 I would think she has returned to the guesthouse."
Rosa knew her daughter\'s nature well.
{n}And a chill ran up her back.
Maria was stupidly straightforward, to the point that "stupidly" could be repeated seven times,
 ......and if she was ordered to find something that didn\'t exist, she would look forever and ever.
......Even if rain was pouring down...!!
"......No.
 The cousins left earlier, so Maria was alone...!
 Unless someone told her to stop, she would stay there even if spears fell down from the skies!
 Without even opening an umbrella!!
 .........Aaaah, what have I done, losing control of my emotions!!"
As her mother, she had known about Maria\'s foolish straightforwardness better than anyone, yet she had once again lost control of her emotions, and done such a horrible thing...!!
"Mariaaaaaaa!!"
Rosa pushed Genji away and ran down the hallway.
The outside really looked like a typhoon, and was pouring down magnificently.
Maybe because of some figure of the terrain, the winds were not as strong as a typhoon, so an umbrella wouldn\'t be torn out of one\'s hands.
Even so, it was enough to call it a storm.
{n}There was no time to admire the roses being soaked by the rain.
"Anyway, I\'m getting pretty worried about Maria.
 .........You don\'t think she\'s still rebelliously searching for that rose alone, do you?"
"...I wonder.
 Surely not with this much rain...
...is what I\'d like to think, but Maria‐chan is sometimes really stubborn and foolishly simple."
We hadn\'t worried much, thinking that Auntie Rosa had taken her back to the mansion.
...However, it was concerning that Kanon‐kun had thought that Maria was here when he came from the mansion to call us.
".........I did not see her in the mansion, so I had assumed that she was here.
 Since Rosa‐sama was taking a nap..."
"You didn\'t see her on your way over here?"
".........My apologies.
 I opened my umbrella and ran as fast as I could, so I did not pay much attention."
If he had cut through the rose garden on the shortest line between the mansion and the guesthouse, then he would have missed the place where Maria had been looking for her rose by a little.
And it was raining this hard, too.
{n}There was a good chance that Kanon‐kun had failed to notice her.
"Enough debating around here, it\'d be faster to just check it out directly.
 ......Aniki, you up for a little race?"
"So you think that you can beat me now that you\'ve had six years to grow?
 Alright, let\'s find out.
 ............Let\'s go!!"
George‐aniki and I flew out into the rain.
{n}Jessica and Kanon‐kun followed us.
"Mariaaaa!!
 If you\'re there, answer me!!
 Mariaaaaa!!"
"It\'s Auntie Rosa.
 Auntie!!"
When George‐aniki called back, Auntie Rosa flew at him in what almost amounted to a tackle.
"Where\'s Maria?!
 Isn\'t she with you?!"
"No, we haven\'t seen Maria‐chan since then."
"............Mariaaaaa!!!"
............Six years ago, Maria had been three years old.
{n}She had been a cute and pure kid who would just accept whatever anyone said.
...But six years had passed since then!
{n}She was nine now, and experiencing the good and bad parts of life should have taught her something.
......And yet, she\'s still just as innocent and pure as she used to be...?!
"Mariaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!"
As I circled the rose bed, something white unexpectedly turned to face me.
......It was a white umbrella.
Maria, holding a white umbrella, was crouching, still searching for that rose...
"............Uu."
Her face, which had turned bright red from her crying her eyes out, was dirtied with water and mud. It was a truly pitiful sight.
"You idiot,
 ......are you still looking?!"
"......Uu......
 Can\'t find it...
 My rose...
 ...Can\'t find it......
 ...Uu......"
Maria had probably been here since the rain had started pouring down.
{n}It looked like her shoulders were freezing.
She looked tired to the bone, but fortunately, since she was holding an umbrella, she was not completely soaked.
...It was probably an umbrella from the handbag that Maria was always walking around with.
.........Thank goodness.
 Seriously, thank goodness.
"Battler‐kun!
 Thank goodness, you found her!"
"Mariaaaaaaaaa!!
 I\'m sorry, I\'m so sorry...!!"
Auntie Rosa threw her own umbrella away and hugged Maria.
"......Uu.........
 It\'s not here.
 ...My rose isn\'t here...
 ......Uu......"
"Mama will look for it with you later...
 Okay?
 So just let it go for today.
 ......Okay?"
"............Uu...
 Let it go for today........."
It looked like Maria still wasn\'t able to accept it, but she no longer had enough energy left to resist.
Jessica and Kanon‐kun caught up with us.
"......I\'ll have a towel ready in the mansion immediately."
"Maria......
 Were you here the whole time......?"
"I\'m sorry......
 I\'m sorry for being such a bad mother........."
"......Auntie Rosa, why don\'t we head back to the mansion for the time being.
 Maria‐chan will catch a cold like this."
".........You\'re right.
 Maria, let\'s go.
 If we don\'t get you cleaned up, Grandfather will get mad at you."
"Uu...
 I\'m hungry."
"It\'s already time to eat.
 You did a good job searching.
 Once the weather gets better, we\'ll all go search together."
We couldn\'t stay in the rain forever.
{n}We took Maria with us as we headed back to the mansion.
Maria apparently wasn\'t as weak as I had thought.
When she remembered that dinner was calf steak, she started chanting "I\'m hungry, hungry, uu‐uu!", and returned to her usual healthy self.
......Auntie Rosa didn\'t chide Maria on her "uu‐uu".
"So that\'s it.
 You had an umbrella.
 You sure are good at packing the right stuff."
"......Uu.
 I didn\'t bring an umbrella.
 Uu."
"What? Then how did you get that white umbrella you\'re holding?"
"Uu!
 Borrowed it!"
It seemed that some caring person had brought her an umbrella.
{n}A normal girl would look for shelter once it started raining, but there was no way Maria\'s stubbornness would be broken by something like that.
...So maybe that person gave up recommending that she find shelter, and at least brought an umbrella for her.
"Really?
 I will have to thank them.
 Who was it?"
"Uu!
 {f:5:Beatrice}~!"
The name that Maria mentioned very happily was that of the island\'s witch.
Rosa took a deep breath and asked again, trying to avoid hurting Maria\'s feelings now that she was happy.
"Really? That\'s nice.
 So, who was it...?
 The person who brought you that umbrella?"
"Uu.
 {f:5:Bea}—
{f:5:trice}~!
 Uu‐uu!"
Maria, who quickly picked up that her mother didn\'t believe her, made an angry face once again.
So Rosa stopped pursuing the subject.
{n}It looked like it would be faster to ask the person who had lent Maria the umbrella during dinner rather than ask Maria herself...
"Father.
 Please at least join us for dinner.
 It won\'t be a family conference like this."
Along with a dull pounding on the door, the sound of Krauss\'s entreaty could be heard.
However, that voice seemed to harbor a sense of resignation, that its sound would not reach its intended ears.
".........Kinzo‐san.
 Won\'t you at least go out for dinner?
 Haven\'t all of your children gathered here to see your face?"
"Silence, Nanjo.
 ............So the bishop won\'t work.
 ..................One move short......"
Apparently, Kinzo was completely focused on the final battle of his long‐lasting chess match with Nanjo.
His brow wrinkled, he continued to glare at the game board through his spectacles; Krauss\'s voice didn\'t reach his ears.
"............Kinzo‐san.
 I am also hungry.
 Won\'t you go down and eat?"
"In that case, you can go by yourself.
 Let me consider this next move for a little longer.
 ...We are going to finish it tonight."
"............Otherwise, it looks like this match will never in eternity be settled."
Nanjo stood from his seat, hoping this would prompt Kinzo to do the same, but Kinzo\'s eyes never left the chessboard.
He knew well that Kinzo always displayed a blind concentration when it came to chess,
 but he had never seen Kinzo as focused as he was now.
...He was acting almost as though—just as he had said—if the game wasn\'t finished tonight, there would never be another chance for them to continue their contest...
Further attempts to persistently call him would surely not reach his heart.
Nanjo gave up and headed to the door that Krauss was still banging on...
The door to the study opened.
Krauss took a step back—surely Kinzo hadn\'t actually come out?!
But it was Nanjo who stood at the door; Krauss breathed a sigh of relief...
"......Doctor Nanjo.
 Is Father..."
"...............I am sorry I couldn\'t be of service...
 ...Kinzo‐san\'s world is nothing but this room now."
Nanjo shook his head with a completely defeated expression.
{n}Krauss raised his fist once more and banged on the door, shouting.
"......Father, can you hear me?!
 We are heading down now, but any time you feel like it, please join us.
 All of your children are waiting for you...!"
The voice was very loud, and the door was being noisily pounded on.
{n}There was no way that it wouldn\'t reach Kinzo\'s ears.
............It was reaching him.
{n}However, he was ignoring it anyway.
However, unlike the time he was being called down for lunch, he did not get into a rage.
{n}......Kinzo was now simply calm at heart, ...and it was almost as though he had attained peace by turning himself over to fate.
"......I am not interested in dinner, nor in my sons\' faces.
 ............I will only leave here when {f:5:Beatrice} is resurrected or when I am chosen as a sacrifice for the key...
 The Demons\' Roulette has already started spinning.
 What meaning does dinner have at this point........."
As though the painfully loud banging on the door had completely failed to enter his hearing,
{n}Kinzo, in a state of total peace, silently thought about his next chess move...
Just as always, Kinzo was the only one missing from the dining hall.
{n}Krauss, wearing a bitter smile, returned with Nanjo.
"Just as always, Father is not feeling well.
 He truly regrets missing this once‐a‐year opportunity to sit together with his gathered relatives."
Eva and Rudolf snickered.
Judging by Kinzo\'s character, he didn\'t regret it at all,
 ...and none of his relatives regretted that he hadn\'t appeared either.
"Then why don\'t we start dinner.
 Gohda, get it started."
"Certainly.
 Well then, ladies and gentlemen, we shall begin."
Upon finally being told to begin the family conference dinner, his highlight scene for the whole year, Gohda nodded, grinning broadly.
"......Umm, I was wondering, who was it that lent Maria an umbrella?"
When Rosa timidly cut through the silence of the dining hall, everyone there turned their attention to her at once.
"...Umbrella?
 What\'s this about?"
"Umm......
 It started raining while Maria was in the rose garden a short while back...
 It seems she borrowed a white umbrella from someone, and I wanted to thank them..."
"It wasn\'t one of us.
 After you went out, Rosa, we changed rooms and continued our "friendly" chat the whole rest of the time."
"Haha, ...that\'s right.
 Even after that, us siblings kept on with our friendly chat."
The word friendly fell awkwardly from Hideyoshi\'s lips,
 so that even those that hadn\'t been there realized that it hadn\'t been a pleasant conversation.
"At the very least, it certainly couldn\'t have been me, Eva, Rudolf, or even Hideyoshi‐san or Kyrie‐san."
"We were together the whole time, even after Natsuhi nee‐san and Rosa‐san left.
 The whole time until the meal started."
"Nii‐san went up to the study with Genji‐san to call Father.
 At that time, the rest of us went straight to the dining hall.
 So it wasn\'t one of us.
 ...For a consideration like lending an umbrella, wouldn\'t it be one of the servants?"
"So, Gohda‐san?"
"......I have been in the kitchen the whole time preparing.
 My sincere apologies..."
Gohda looked slightly disappointed about missing this chance to show off.
At that time, Shannon and Kumasawa appeared, pushing a serving cart loaded with hors d\'oeuvres.
"Then perhaps it was Kumasawa‐san or Shannon‐chan?"
"...I\'m sorry?
 Ha‐have I made some mistake...?"
Shannon shrunk, mistakenly thinking that she was being accused of making some error, having come in partway.
"No, you haven\'t.
 When Maria‐chan was alone in the rose garden, it started to rain.
 Someone gave her an umbrella.
 Auntie Rosa said that she wanted to thank that person."
"......Uu.
 ......{f:5:Beatrice}..."
Maria, her mouth a thin line, said the witch\'s name in a small voice.
Auntie Rosa explained the situation one more time.
{n}As she did, Kumasawa‐san cackled.
"Hoh‐hoh‐ho.
 It wasn\'t us.
 Shannon‐san and I were preparing the rooms together, so we did not go outside."
"...Yes.
 ......I apologize for not being able to help......"
"Preparing the rooms?
 What do you mean by that...?"
"..................Because of this rain,
 I thought that it would be difficult for all of the guests to return to the guesthouse,
 so I ordered the servants to prepare the guest rooms inside the mansion."
"...Reeally? How thoughtful!
 That\'s right, it would be rude to chase us outside in all this rain, wouldn\'t it?"
"Could you give it a rest..."
"Yes.
 We received the order from Madam, and I, Kumasawa‐san, and Kanon‐kun were preparing the rooms.
 ...Then it became time for dinner, and since we had received an order from Genji‐sama to go to the guesthouse and call the children,
 Kanon‐kun left on our behalf."
"Yes.
 In that case, did Kanon‐san find Maria on the way to the guesthouse and hand her the umbrella?"
"......Uu.
 That\'s—not—it!!"
The person who had actually received the umbrella denied it.
{n}Rosa was troubled.
All she wanted to do was give a word of thanks to the person who had lent the umbrella, but she couldn\'t find them.
And she had thought that asking like this with everyone gathered for dinner would work immediately...
"...Then, Natsuhi nee‐san?"
"I\'m sorry.
 After my "friendly" conversation with everyone, my headache was so bad that I have been resting in my room.
 Therefore, I did not go outside."
".........Then who?
 George‐kun and the kids?
 ......That can\'t be right."
"No, it wasn\'t us.
 We were watching television in the guesthouse the whole time."
"Actually, we thought that Maria had just gone back to the mansion with you..."
"Then Kanon‐kun came, and he asked whether Maria was with us. That was when we first realized that she wasn\'t in the mansion.
 In the first place, if it were me, before lending her an umbrella, I\'d have grabbed her hand and pulled her under a roof."
Rosa was completely baffled.
{n}One by one, the relatives and the servants were claiming that it wasn\'t them.
{n}...Even though it really wasn\'t something anyone would need to hide.
With that, by process of elimination, the number of people it could have been wasn\'t large.
"Of course, it wasn\'t me.
 Right after it began raining, I visited Kinzo‐san\'s room, and have been playing chess with him until just now."
"......Which means that it also wasn\'t Grandfather."
"Wait a sec...
 Isn\'t this starting to get a bit weird?
 Who\'s left?"
"Then, ...who?
 ...Genji‐san?
 Huh?"
"Um, wait a second, don\'t get me wrong.
 It\'s not like I\'m searching for some culprit or anything.
 All I want to do is, as a mother, thank that person who gave Maria an umbrella in the middle of the rain......!"
...Giving an umbrella to a girl loitering in the rain was something to be praised, not hidden.
...Despite that, no one raised their hand.
......Why?
Everyone started whispering about how strange this had gotten...
"......Calm down, Rosa.
 Why don\'t we just ask the person who borrowed the umbrella?"
An idea that everyone would agree makes sense.
{n}They were all scratching their heads at why she didn\'t just ask Maria, who had been given the umbrella.
However, Rosa bit her lower lip.
{n}After all, she already knew how Maria would answer if asked.
"Of course!
 Rudolf‐kun here\'s got it right.
 Maria‐chan, tell your uncle!
 Who lent you the umbrella?"
"{f:5:Beatrice}!"
The dining hall was wrapped in silence for an instant, but that soon broke and it was wrapped in laughter.
"Hahahaha.
 I see, {f:5:Beatrice}, the witch of the forest, felt pity and lent her an umbrella.
 What a nice story.
 Rosa, there you go."
"......nn...
.........nnnn."
Rosa didn\'t seem satisfied.
{n}...She just wanted to say thanks for the umbrella; why did everything have to be so clouded in smoke...
"Uu!
 Just like Uncle Krauss said.
 {f:5:Beatrice} lent it to me!
 Uu‐uu!"
"Hahahahaha...
 Isn\'t that wonderful.
 Oh, innocence, such an enviable thing.
 Don\'t you all agree?
 Hahahaha..."
Krauss was laughing with a face that was clearly mocking her,
 but Maria, apparently feeling that her claim was being believed, was overjoyed.
"......What\'s going on?
 Don\'t tell me a witch really appeared and lent her an umbrella?"
Jessica asked me in a small voice that wouldn\'t carry over to Maria, who was sitting across from me.
"Has Maria ever been the type to joke?"
If we had heard that kind of story pop out of that old bastard\'s mouth, we\'d have just taken it as another joke.
......However, coming from Maria\'s mouth, it became somewhat inexplicable, strangely unsettling...
"No way.
 She\'s always been frank and serious.
 Hasn\'t she always just swallowed up jokes that were supposed to be obvious lies?
 I\'ve never even heard of her cracking a joke."
Auntie Rosa probably knew that better than anyone.
{n}It appeared that because of this weird situation, she had no idea what was going on anymore.
"So, if Maria says that she borrowed an umbrella from {f:5:Beatrice}, that definitely was {f:5:Beatrice}?"
".........We\'re talking about Maria here, so I can\'t imagine it was some kind of metaphor or joke.
 ...It might be best to take what she says at face value."
"Then what\'s going on?
 Are you saying that Genji‐san or someone put on that fancy dress from the portrait and gave Maria the umbrella?"
"...I have no idea...
 Actually, that\'s what I want to know."
Jessica shrugged jokingly, but her expression wasn\'t completely joking.
Once the hors d\'oeuvres were set out and Gohda showed off his vast store of knowledge, the meal began.
A couple casual chats broke out here and there, but they seemed somehow distant; it was a quiet dinner, granting no respite from the intrusive sound of rain that was creeping into the dining hall.
Kumasawa and Shannon, pushing the serving cart, ran into Genji and Kanon on their way to the kitchen.
"...Genji‐san, were you the one who lent Maria‐sama an umbrella?"
".........Umbrella?
 What are you talking about?"
"Right.
 ......I heard that when it started raining, Maria‐sama was alone in the rose garden.
 ...And it seems that she borrowed an umbrella from someone there,
 but we don\'t know who it was."
"......It wasn\'t me.
 After all, I thought that Maria‐sama was in the guesthouse.
 When Battler‐sama first found her, she was already holding a white umbrella."
"My apologies, but it was not me either..."
".........Then, you don\'t think it was...
...the Master,
 possibly?"
Everyone in both the dining hall and the place where they were standing now had stated that it wasn\'t them.
...Which meant that only Kinzo was left, but...
"Maybe he went walking down the corridor for some reason, when, by coincidence, he saw Maria‐sama in the rose garden without even an umbrella..."
"...............The Master...
does not particularly like Maria‐sama."
"I agree.
 ............I can\'t imagine that, just for Maria‐sama, he would trouble himself to go all the way down the stairs to carry an umbrella to her directly."
"Oh, my......how troublesome.
 So that means that the one who lent Maria‐sama an umbrella really was {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama?
 Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho..."
Kumasawa laughed, just like the relatives in the dining hall had laughed it off.
{n}......She couldn\'t think of any other way to break through the smoke veiling the current situation.
Just then, the crisp sound of hands clapping twice rang through the hallway.
They all turned around at once to see that it was Gohda, who was coming out of the dining hall.
"Chop‐chop, everyone.
 When serving a dinner, it is essential to make sure the dishes are served with the proper timing.
 Please immediately see to setting out the soup.
 Genji‐san, the women are in the middle of an important job, so please don\'t get in their way."
"........................"
Kanon glared at Gohda for being rude to Genji, a person Kanon respected.
Genji, realizing this, patted Kanon once on the shoulder as if to warn him.
Kanon reluctantly turned away, and returned his expression to normal.
"......Obey Gohda\'s order.
 Let us now hurry to prepare the dinner table."
"Come on, we have no time.
 Don\'t just dawdle around!
 Hurry...!"
Gohda grabbed the serving cart from Shannon and drove it past her, heading towards the kitchen at pace.
"...Then please allow us to return to the kitchen.
 ...After all, Gohda‐san\'s patience is very short, ...hoh‐hoh‐ho."
"Ple‐please excuse me as well..."
Kumasawa and Shannon left.
{n}Only Genji and Kanon remained.
{n}Through the window, the darkness of the rainy night could be seen, along with the occasional thunderbolt.
"............Genji‐sama.
 Has {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama really...
......returned?"
"...........................I don\'t know."
"......Should we inform the Master?"
"There\'s no need.
 .........If she has truly returned, she will eventually appear before the Master of her own accord.
 .........Furthermore, she is a fickle person.
 It would be pointless to report to the Master only to find that she does not appear..."
"..................I wonder if this means that the Master\'s ritual has already begun."
"...Probably.
 However, that has nothing to do with furniture like us.
 ......We must return the favor that we received from the Master...until our final moments."
".........Yes.
 ...As furniture, that is our...
............duty."
The thunder crashed once more.
Except for that instant when the lightning lit up the sky, all that could be seen out of the window was the darkness of night.
Just as humans rule when the sun is up, the time when the sun is down is ruled by those that are not human.
The darkness of night that now surrounded Rokkenjima was ruled not by the Ushiromiya family, but by another master.
Did this master take pity on Maria when she was alone and pummeled by the rain in the rose garden, and lend her an umbrella...?
Kanon looked at the rose garden\'s lights, dimly visible beyond the window.
{n}The dim lights were not enough to illuminate the surrounding area.
Looking at those lights felt like making eye contact with the witch, and Kanon forcibly averted his gaze.
...If he didn\'t, it felt like his eyes would be absorbed by that light......
Perhaps the weather was also a factor.
{n}You often hear stories about how things like atmospheric pressure can influence people\'s moods and physical health.
For some time now, everyone had been making periodic attempts to clear the gloomy atmosphere,
 but any conversation was quickly cut off, and in the end the dining hall was simply buried by the sound of the rain.
Dessert was some kind of chocolate cake accompanied by pear sherbet.
Gohda‐san enthusiastically explained the recipe as if delivering the coup de grace, but I quickly forgot the details.
The guest of honor, Grandfather, was absent; the weather was horrible; and the person who had lent Maria the umbrella was still a mystery.
When dinner ended, no one felt even one bit refreshed.
...It was too late now, but I realized painfully that taste wasn\'t the only important part of a meal. The whole atmosphere was also critical.
Gohda‐san, the supposed conductor of this performance called dinner, did his best to enliven the place,
 dropping little jokes left and right, but it seemed they didn\'t quite get there.
After taking orders for after‐dinner coffee, tea, and orange juice, he left for the kitchen.
As soon as he disappeared, Uncle Krauss spoke.
"......My, my.
 How truly irksome that this dinner, which Gohda worked so hard to create, has been so poorly received."
".........Yes, seriously.
 It feels like nothing would taste good today. It\'s just that kind of mood."
"Hoh.
 I would love to hear why you feel that way.
 Sometime later, allow me, as your older brother, to help cheer you up."
Auntie Eva grimaced slightly.
{n}...I had already heard that she was not on good terms with Uncle Krauss, but now I could clearly feel it.
When I looked around, I noticed that my dad and Auntie Rosa were also grimacing.
Anyhow, it looked like there was something besides the weather that was troubling all of them...
"......Auntie Eva and my dad,
 ...they both look like they\'re in a bad mood."
"Really?
 I don\'t think so."
I asked Aunt Natsuhi, who was sitting on my right, ...but it looked like she was also in a bad mood.
She snapped back as though she was absolutely not interested.
"Well, our adult conversation got a little complicated.
 It\'s not somethin\' kids like you need to worry about, Battler‐kun.
 Hahahahaha,
 right? Natsuhi‐san? Kyrie‐san?"
Uncle Hideyoshi laughed as he spoke, but without his usual brightness,
 so I could vaguely imagine just how complicated their adult conversation had actually become.
On top of that, even Aunt Natsuhi and Kyrie‐san, the people he had directed his comment to, ignored him as though they hadn\'t heard anything.
...I didn\'t know what kind of conversation they had been having while we kids were away,
 but it reminded me of how Dad had said he had stomach cramps when we had arrived at the mansion.
The family conference might have been a playful reunion to us kids, but it was definitely different for the adults...
After Uncle Hideyoshi was ignored by the other adults, an awkward silence fell over the room; Kyrie‐san spoke up.
"......We were talking about how the kids\' careers would turn out.
 What will you do in the future, Battler‐kun?
 Just drift on to college?
 Wouldn\'t that be a little disheartening as a starting line for the long race of life?"
"Hey! Wait a sec...
 Kyrie‐san, if you start talking about something like that in the middle of a meal, it won\'t digest well and we\'ll all get constipated, ri~ght?"
"Wahahaha...!
 That\'s right, that\'s right! We were talking about Battler‐kun and Jessica‐chan\'s careers!
 You can\'t take the future too seriously!
 Wahahaha..."
Hideyoshi heartily agreed as if they really had been talking about that, but they probably hadn\'t.
Kyrie‐san had obviously been trying to avoid talking about something.
{n}However, if Kyrie‐san had determined that this was the best course of action for now, then she was probably right.
Taking this into account, I decided to cast aside my suspicions as to the cause behind Auntie Eva and Dad\'s bad moods...
At long last, the serving cart returned, filled with coffee and tea.
Kumasawa‐san and Shannon‐chan served it to everyone.
{n}Gohda‐san then explained that, with this, tonight\'s dinner was over.
If I had been able to eat in a more cheerful mood, it might have been the best dinner of my life.
It was a shame that this greatest of dinners couldn\'t have been had under the greatest of conditions.
"Uu!
 George onii‐chan, is dinner over now?
 Over?"
"Yes.
 We\'re all done now."
"That\'s not ladylike.
 Stay in your seat, and calmly drink up."
"...Uu."
Maria looked like she was really excited about the occasionally crashing thunder.
{n}Maybe she wanted to quickly finish eating and run over to the window.
{n}She had been fidgeting for a while, waiting for the meal to end.
......Some people are afraid of thunder, while others find it interesting, and Maria was apparently one of the latter.
So, when she heard from George‐aniki that dinner was over, a huge smile broke across her face.
She then stood from her seat, took out her handbag—which she had set under her seat, never having left it even while she was eating—and began fishing around inside of it.
No one seemed particularly concerned with this behavior...
".........What\'s...
that?
 Where did you get it?"
George was the first to notice it.
{n}As he spoke, Battler also noticed.
When they looked, they noticed that Maria was now holding a beautiful Western‐style envelope.
On the front of the envelope, the Ushiromiya family crest—the One‐winged Eagle—was done in gold leaf.
Furthermore, it was sealed with dark red wax, imbuing a level of class upon it that made it clear that this was not something that Maria should be carrying around for fun.
"......Maria‐chan, what is that?"
It seemed that Natsuhi had also noticed the strangeness of the envelope that Maria was holding.
{n}Because her voice sounded too serious to be admonishing a small child, the other relatives around her finally noticed.
"What\'s up, Natsuhi nee‐san?"
"............What is...
that?"
"Maria...
where did you pick that up...?"
"That envelope has...
...Kinzo‐san\'s......"
As Nanjo muttered that, even us kids could understand why everyone seemed to be frozen solid.
The envelope that Maria held was one of the Ushiromiya family head\'s custom‐made envelopes for private use.
......In other words, it could only mean one thing.
{n}This envelope contained a message from Kinzo.
"Hoh.........
 ...What is an envelope like that doing here...?"
"......It, ......it looks like something interesting has jumped out at us."
".........J‐just let me have a peek...!"
"Uu!!
 No, I\'m reading it!
 I was told to read it to everyone!!"
Uncle Hideyoshi tried to snatch the envelope out from Maria\'s hands, but she protected it as though hugging it, and didn\'t let go.
"Hideyoshi nii‐san, you shouldn\'t take something from a child by brute force.
 .........Maria‐chan, where did you get this envelope?"
"Uu!
 Got it from {f:5:Beatrice} when she gave me the umbrella.
 She told me to read it to everyone after the meal was over!
 I\'m the witch\'s mes—
 mess—
 "messenger"!
 Uu!"
"Messenger...?
 Ihihihi, the witch of the island sure likes to mess around."
Battler tried to joke about it, but no one went along with him.
"..................I, I wonder what\'s written inside of it. Maria‐chan...?"
"Uu.
 Reading!
 Uu!"
Maria casually opened the envelope.
...It was sealed only with wax, so she just had to remove the sealing wax to open it.
...That sealing wax fell onto the desk.
{n}Hideyoshi hastily picked it up and stared fixedly at it.
He then set it in the center of the table, where Natsuhi, Kyrie, and Nanjo glared at it.
Imprinted there in the sealing wax was the One‐winged Eagle—which was the Ushiromiya family crest, and also Kinzo\'s personal crest.
"............This is the family head\'s personal crest..."
".........I know because I have received letters from Kinzo‐san before.
 Without a doubt, this is Kinzo‐san\'s wax seal."
"But, in this mansion, couldn\'t there be several identical seals?
 For example, if there was some kind of stamp for wax seals, couldn\'t someone other than Kinzo‐san have sealed it?"
"No, Kinzo‐san would always use a ring on his finger, his "Proof of the Ushiromiya Family Headship", when he sealed the wax.
 This shape and complex design is definitely Kinzo‐san\'s seal..."
"That is not necessarily so.
 Anyone in the family must have received a letter from Dad at least once.
 We can\'t eliminate the possibility that someone, using that wax as a model, created a fake seal to pass themselves off as Father."
"I agree with Aniki.
 No matter how the seal resembles Dad\'s, we can\'t prove that it is the real thing.
 Therefore, it doesn\'t prove that this envelope came from Dad."
"I feel the same way.
 I cannot approve of arbitrarily deciding that this is Father\'s letter only by the seal in the wax.
 Doctor Nanjo, would you mind refraining from speaking such vague words...?!"
"............I apologize...
 I said too much..."
One after another, all of the siblings, from Krauss on downwards, rejected Nanjo\'s statement, saying that the envelope that Maria was holding had not necessarily been sent by Kinzo.
They were afraid.
Kinzo\'s intentions were written in there,
 and they feared from the bottoms of their hearts that it might be some decidedly unfavorable announcement regarding the inheritance.
"...Maria...
 The person who gave you that envelope was the same person who lent you that umbrella, right...?"
"Uu!"
"I don\'t know what "uu" means!
 Is it true?!"
"Uu...
 ......Yes.
 Uu."
"So, in other words,
 ...the witch,
 {f:5:Beatrice}, gave you that envelope along with the umbrella...?"
"Uu!"
Maria nodded forcefully.
"...I, I agree with my husband.
 It\'s a dubious letter handed over by some suspicious person.
 It\'s not even worth reading."
"Oh, go on, what\'s the worst that could happen, right?"
Battler said it to Jessica in a small voice, pretending to stir things up, but Natsuhi heard him clearly and glared at him with threatening eyes.
"A‐and then,
 err,
 ...{f:5:Beatrice} told you to read it after the meal was over, right?"
"Uu!"
".........Why not, everyone.
 This isn\'t Grandfather\'s envelope, it\'s {f:5:Beatrice}\'s.
 Who cares who wrote it, why can\'t we just hear what\'s inside before passing judgment?"
"Th‐...that\'s right.
 Even if Father didn\'t necessarily write it, I\'m still concerned about its contents.
 ......Maria‐chan, I\'m sorry I tried to take it from you by force earlier!
 I apologize, so will you read it aloud in front of everyone?"
"............Maria.
 Read it."
"Uu."
As all of the relatives stared fiercely at Maria, she spread the letter open with a rustle...
"......Do you think it really is Dad\'s letter?"
"Impossible.
 Whenever Father has announced something to us in the past, if he didn\'t do it directly, he would always send Genji‐san, right?
 ......I can\'t believe that he would use such a joke‐like approach."
"That\'s right.
 Maria, a messenger?
 That\'s seriously not his style...
 Rosa, this must be Maria‐chan trying to surprise us with some kind of hidden talent, right...?"
"I..................M‐Maria\'s not a kid capable of something so clever."
"Reading.
 Uu."
The words came out of Maria\'s mouth, but for some reason it felt like her voice was different than usual.
Everyone went suddenly silent...
"Welcome to Rokkenjima, ladies and gentlemen of the Ushiromiya family.
 I am {f:5:Beatrice}, the alchemist for this family, under the employ of Kinzo‐sama."
".........How absurd...!"
"Quiet!"
"I have served him for many years in accordance with our contract, but today, Kinzo‐sama has announced the termination of that contract.
 Therefore, I ask that you acknowledge my resignation from the position of family alchemist as of today."
"......How foolish... What nonsense...!"
"I, I can\'t stand to listen to it...!"
"And now, there is one part of the contract that I must explain to you all.
 I, {f:5:Beatrice}, lent Kinzo‐sama a vast quantity of gold under certain terms.
 One of these terms specifies that all the gold is to be returned to me upon the termination of the contract.
 Furthermore, I am to receive everything of the Ushiromiya family as interest."
"R‐ridiculous!!"
"...I‐it\'s been ridiculous from the very beginning..."
"So it\'s basically one of those things, right?
 Just like one of those contracts with the devil you always hear about?
 And, the contract has expired, so she\'s come to collect the interest.
 Is she trying to grab some retirement money for her old age or something?
 What a cheeky witch."
"Battler‐kun, now is not the time to joke around..."
Battler made a face as if to ask, "If I can\'t make fun of this, what can I make fun of?"
At the same time, some of the adults\' faces were pale, while others looked completely shocked.
"After hearing this, you may feel as though Kinzo‐sama has been savagely ruthless.
 However, Kinzo‐sama did append a special clause to the contract so that you would have a chance to preserve your wealth and honor.
 If and only if that special clause is fulfilled, I will lose my rights to the gold and the interest for all eternity."
"......A special clause...?"
"Wh‐what is it...?!"
{e:070:Special Clause.
{f:5:Beatrice} has the right to collect the gold and accumulated interest upon the termination of the contract.
However, if someone is able to discover the hidden gold of this contract,
 {f:5:Beatrice} must abandon these rights for all time.}
{e:070:......The collection of the interest will proceed shortly, but if any one of you fulfills the terms of this special clause,
 I shall return everything, including the portion that has already been collected.
Furthermore, as the first step in this collection of Kinzo‐sama\'s debt, I have taken possession of the "Ushiromiya Family Head\'s Ring", which signifies the passage of the Ushiromiya family headship from one individual to another.
I ask that you confirm this for yourselves by examining the imprint on the wax seal.}
".........You want me to accept this as real...?!
 That Dad would relinquish his ring is unthinkable...!"
Krauss was staring at the sealing wax as though he was trying to burn a hole through it.
{n}Eva and Rudolf were doing the same over his shoulder!
"I, I did have the odd feeling that something was missing from Kinzo‐san\'s finger when we were playing chess........."
"Doctor Nanjo!
 Don\'t say something so careless just because of a vague memory!"
"We can\'t prove its authenticity here.
 The questions of whether Father really has handed over his ring, and whether this letter tells the truth, we can determine simply by asking him directly."
"Th‐that\'s right.
 It\'s just as Kyrie‐san says..."
".........Well now, I wonder.
 Will Kinzo‐san answer you...?
 After all, that person\'s thoughts are sometimes impossible to predict using common sense..."
"In any event, this does not leave the realm of nonsense...!
 In the first place, the fiction of the gold is itself a deception by Father.
 If you want to talk about nonexistent gold, leave me out of it!"
"But, you heard what the witch is saying, right?
 About how the headship and all of the assets would be handed over to the one who finds the gold?
 So, could this mean that {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama is Father\'s legal advisor, or maybe in charge of his funds...?"
"W‐we can\'t possibly trust the kind of strange person who would entrust such a suspicious paper to a child!"
"Aniki... Time for you to open up.
 Is it possible that someone you don\'t know is actually handling Dad\'s assets?!"
"N‐no, that\'s impossible!
 As the agent to the head, I have total knowledge of all Father\'s assets!
 There shouldn\'t be anyone who can manipulate them without me knowing it!"
"Then, there must be some assets that you do not have full knowledge of, mustn\'t there, Krauss nii‐san?"
"Absurd, there\'s no such thing!"
"..................Oh yes, there is.
 One asset of Father\'s that you know nothing about."
"There is no way that something like that exists!!"
"No, it does.
 ............That\'d be Father\'s, no, {f:5:Beatrice}\'s hidden gold!!"
"Let\'s put things in order.
 In short, Dad has some trusted confidante that not even Aniki knows about.
 Furthermore, this person has always been in charge of watching and managing the gold.
 It\'s possible that this person is a dilettante of a very rich family who provided his financing in the first place through a mock devil\'s contract."
".........Could it be that this confidante, this {f:5:Beatrice}‐san, is trying to test which of the sons and daughters is most fitting to be financed by her gold?"
What Kyrie said was something that all of the siblings wanted clarified.
Upon reflection, they realized that during the time Kinzo\'s strange epitaph had been displayed in the hall beneath the portrait of the witch,
 they had always whispered that the one who solved the puzzle would receive everything, ......yet no one had ever clearly stated it.
It was just something that everyone had hoped might be true.
{n}That had, right here, right now, been clearly expressed by {f:5:Beatrice}\'s letter!
It clearly specified that everything of the Ushiromiya family would be given to the one who found the gold.
"Kinzo‐sama has already publicly displayed the location of the hidden gold within the epitaph under my portrait.
 The rules apply equally to all who can read the epitaph.
 If you discover the gold, I shall return everything to you."
"Tonight, I ask that you enjoy your battle of wits with Kinzo‐sama to the fullest.
 I sincerely pray that this night will be both intellectual and elegant.
 {nobreak:—{f:5:Beatrice} the Golden}."
"......Father, I know you can hear me!
 Please respond!"
The door to Kinzo\'s study was being violently, violently beaten against over and over again like a percussion instrument.
The screams coming from the other side were Krauss\'s, Rudolf\'s, and sometimes Eva\'s voices.
It was the siblings, who were trying to intrude upon Kinzo\'s study to question him about the truth behind that mysterious letter.
Kinzo was eating.
An elegant tablecloth was set over the desk, and the fabulous dinner that had colored the table down in the dining hall was once again laid out.
Kinzo continued his meal in silence.
{n}...Shannon, taking away an empty plate, looked uncomfortably between the door being beaten on and Kinzo\'s face.
"...............Everyone is calling for you, but...
...what would you like me to do...?"
"...Leave it.
 God values silence, and so do I during dinner."
"............Should I silence them?"
"There\'s no need.
 It does not even reach my ears."
Kinzo coolly tasted his food.
Genji quietly lowered his head and took a single step back.
{n}...As he did, Kanon, who stood in reserve like a shadow behind and to the side of Genji, opened his mouth.
".........Maria‐sama seems to have received a letter from {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, so I assume they want to verify its authenticity."
"...Hahahaha...
 .........That daredevil, she has started already?"
"............Come, {f:5:Beatrice}.
 There\'s nothing lacking in the coins that have been wagered.
 Shall we enjoy this night to the fullest?
 ......I have no intention of losing.
 Your smile is mine for all eternity.
 If I could see it one more time, I wouldn\'t regret losing my wealth, my honor, or even my life."
".........Well then, the roulette has begun to spin.
 Which pocket will the ball fall into?
 Noir? Rouge?
 Or house takes all?
 Come, you may begin, {f:5:Beatrice}.
 I\'ll show you the power of miracles once more...!"The strange letter that the witch had entrusted Maria with had wiped all memories of dinner from our minds.
Maria had been repeatedly barraged with questions by Auntie Rosa and the other parents,
 and was now in the worst of tempers because no one would believe her.
 Even when we kids tried to talk to her, she would just ignore us.
Our parents were all stirred up over the gold, firing back and forth about the distribution of the assets, and completely forgetting that we children were even there.
...Even though I\'d already figured that they had been talking about this in the shadows,
 I never thought they\'d be this blunt about it, and at least to us kids it was a considerable shock.
...From what we could overhear, all of our parents wanted as much money as possible, as soon as possible.
Back and forth about Grandfather\'s inheritance.
{n}Back and forth about the distribution of the gold if it was found.
{n}About advance payments and cash.
......It was so despicable, I couldn\'t bear to watch, even though one of them was my dad.
...It looked like Jessica felt the same way.
We left our seats, although no one had asked us to leave, and went to hang out somewhere apart from the parents...
".........I see.
 Now I really understand why Grandfather didn\'t want to show his face during meals."
"I am so disillusioned with our parents now!
 The money, the inheritance!
 How could they act like that right out in the open!"
"Well I\'m already completely disillusioned with that old bastard.
 There\'s no way I could think any worse of him.
 Ihihi!"
"A‐and you think I\'m not?!
 But even so......that freakin\' shocked me.
 Shocked me to the bottom of my heart..."
Jessica looked down at the floor, irritated.
...She was always talking about how bad her parents were, but maybe she hadn\'t really felt that way deep inside.
I could realize that from the depths of Jessica\'s shock.
"......You are both minors and still being brought up by your parents, so you might not understand,
 ......but getting money is neither a simple nor a pretty thing.
 You are still minors, so I won\'t try to force you to understand right now.
 ......But still, I\'d like you to realize that your parents are just doing their best in their own way."
".........Oh great,
 George‐aniki\'s gotten all mature."
"I know that you\'re working hard as a full‐fledged member of society.
 ......But does that mean that when the conversation turns to money and assets and stuff, you\'re capable of turning into a shameless, greedy vulture, like our dads...?"
".....................If it would just be about me, then no, I wouldn\'t want to do that.
 However, when your family and your employees, your subordinates and their families are all counting on you, ...there are some times when you must fight."
".........I hate that kind of fight.
 That back and forth about Grandfather\'s inheritance, it just makes me wanna puke."
Jessica pretended to spit violently.
{n}...That harsh reaction made the depths of her pain very clear.
"...Let\'s stop talking about this.
 All of this about Grandfather\'s hidden gold, about property and inheritance, is our parents\' problem, not ours."
"I agree.
 ......At the very least, I think that being considerate and staying out of the parents\' way when they\'re talking is the duty of their children."
"......Hmph.
 ...Where\'s the fun in that..."
Everyone knows the phrase "Adults are filthy",
 ...but we had now seen that for ourselves, and that really did give us a shock.
George‐aniki was now pretty much an adult, and I had already been disillusioned with my dad in the first place, so the shock wasn\'t that big for us,
 ......but it looked like it was different for Jessica.
It looked like the shock that Jessica had received was even bigger than I had thought.
.........This girl, she was always talking badly about her parents, but it looked like she hadn\'t changed at all on the inside since long ago.
...Even now, she was still a pure‐hearted and delicate person who couldn\'t doubt others.
I\'m sure she respected her parents as much as anyone else does.
......And then her parents started joining in with all the other parents, right in front of us children,
 going "money money inheritance inheritance, my money!", so it was no surprise that the shock of hearing that was so big...
"...Jessica‐chan.
 Please don\'t start hating your mother and father.
 ......I won\'t ask you to understand them, but at least don\'t hate them."
"I get it, just leave me alone a bit...!!"
Six years ago, I would have further taunted the dejected Jessica,
 ......but even I have grown up over the past six years.
I realized that it would be better to leave Jessica as she was right now...
Jessica suddenly looked away sulkily and left the parlor.
...She probably wanted to be left alone for now.
{n}I could do nothing but wordlessly watch her back as she left...
"......Come to think of it, I wonder where Maria‐chan went."
"She\'s probably still huddled up on the floor in front of the portrait."
Maria, who truly looked up to witches, had expected that coming in direct contact with {f:5:Beatrice}, and receiving the letter as proof,
 would be an event that would surprise everyone and make them happy.
However, the adults had doubted its authenticity, had not taken Maria\'s story at face value, and had thoroughly bombarded her with questions.
...Even I didn\'t find it hard to imagine how much that must have hurt Maria.
We couldn\'t speak to either Maria or Jessica.
...In the end, George‐aniki and I just abandoned ourselves to the sound of the falling rain in the dark night...
"I wonder what\'s happening with that typhoon.
 ......Maybe there\'s some news."
George‐aniki walked over to the corner of the parlor where the television was.
He hadn\'t called me over, and I really couldn\'t have cared less where the typhoon was on the sea now.
 So I didn\'t go over to the television, but instead loitered around the window.
"......The wind hasn\'t picked up that much here, but I wonder if it\'s horrible over the sea.
 I did hear from the weather report that there was a severe storm warning."
"Ah, Kyrie‐san.
 ...How\'s it going with you adults, lots to talk about?"
It looked like she caught the sarcasm.
{n}Kyrie‐san shrugged.
"...That stomachache of a discussion could continue all night.
 It\'s very tiring."
"Well, all I can say is, I hope you enjoy playing vultures to Grandfather\'s property to your heart\'s content.
 ...It\'s disgusting."
"I\'ll agree with you on that.
 If I could just slip away like you, I would do it.
 ...Unfortunately, I can\'t.
 Even if I\'m not allowed to speak.
 It\'s not easy being a partner, you know?"
Kyrie‐san sighed, smiling bitterly.
Well, yeah.
{n}They probably won\'t let Kyrie‐san, who married into the family, speak.
Still, as Dad\'s partner, she has no choice but to stay by his side and support him.
......Being in the line of fire, she must be having to bear far greater mental pressure than me.
I wasn\'t going to apologize, but, realizing that I had spoken too harshly, I cut the sarcasm for the time being...
"So how does it look?
 Are they still stuck on the topic of the mysterious witch, {f:5:Beatrice}?"
"......More or less.
 They\'d been piling up secret agreements for some time, hoping for some kind of agreement between the four of them on the distribution of Grandfather\'s inheritance after his death."
"...And now some unknown fifth person has appeared to make things even more complicated, so there\'s no way that\'ll make for a peaceful conversation.
 One moment they\'re snarling at each other, the next they\'ll set up a common front.
 ......Natsuhi nee‐san\'s not the only one getting headaches."
On the one hand, they all wanted a larger portion than the other siblings, so they were all rivals,
 but on the other hand, they didn\'t want one yen to be snatched up by anyone other than the siblings, so they were also all allies.
I couldn\'t get her to tell me the details, but they were apparently arguing on and on about their ceasefire agreement and rules to prevent anyone from getting ahead,
 the situations under which their portions would be protected, and what legal measures would be taken in a worst case scenario.
......By this point, my emotions had shot straight past disgust, and now I perceived them as a force to be reckoned with...
"So, basically,
 {f:5:Beatrice} is like a saboteur sent by Grandfather.
 ...He probably wanted to scare the hell out of his children for just talking about the distribution of the inheritance without him.
 Ihihi!"
"Who is this {f:5:Beatrice}, I wonder?
 If she is who she says she is, then she\'s a mystery that no one knew about until today, and she also knows about the existence of Grandfather\'s hidden gold.
 Furthermore, she was even entrusted with the Head\'s Ring.
 ...She must truly have been trusted by him."
"Well, obviously I don\'t think she\'s a witch riding around on a broom.
 ......But she\'s surely a person mysterious enough to merit being called a witch."
"I just hope Maria‐chan will go into more detail about that.
 ......Even though she\'s just a little girl, everyone has been just chewing her up over this.
 They really scared her, and now we can\'t even ask her things she might have answered.
 I wonder if those people have ever even read "The North Wind and the Sun"."
"What is for certain is that Maria received a letter from a person who took the name {f:5:Beatrice}.
 ......Entrusting Maria with a letter and hiding away even now, when she could have just appeared and talked to us directly...she sure is shy for a mystery person.
 Hahahahaha..."
"......Hey, Battler‐kun.
 Do you think that someone called {f:5:Beatrice} actually exists?"
"Who knows?
 It\'s probably just a false name, right?
 Like she\'s Grandfather\'s representative, so she was permitted to take the name of the witch from his delusions?"
"No, that\'s not what I meant.
 Right now, there are a total of 18 people here on Rokkenjima.
 ......Do you think that there is a 19th person?"
Are there really a whole 18 people on this island?
{n}Wondering about that, I began counting on my fingers, and it really did come out to 18 people.
"Do I think that a 19th person exists, you say.
 ......What exactly do you mean?"
"Just what I said.
 ......It looks like the person who lent Maria that umbrella was not one of us 18.
 Therefore, isn\'t it reasonable to think that a 19th person exists, and that this was the person who lent Maria the umbrella?"
"............Well, ......yes, I suppose."
"Then, where exactly is this person now?
 At the very least, she must have been on this island when it started raining.
 And since that time, the weather has become progressively worse, so taking a boat out would be pretty much impossible.
 In that case, that person must still be on the island hiding from the rain somewhere.
 ......And without being spotted by any of us."
".........Certainly, all of us have been randomly prowling around all over the mansion and the guesthouse, but no one has bumped into a 19th person."
"...Even so, this island is huge.
 There might be other places to hide from the rain outside the mansion and the guesthouse."
At about this time, I began to realize what direction Kyrie‐san\'s doubts were taking us in.
Kyrie‐san was denying that a 19th person existed.
{n}......{f:5:Beatrice} was one of us 18.
...In other words, she thought that someone we knew well was using her name.
"If {f:5:Beatrice} really was as she described herself, this person would definitely be the most honored of guests.
 The most honored of confidants, trusted by Grandfather.
 ...There\'s no way that Grandfather wouldn\'t give that kind of person a warm reception.
 She would surely have been ushered into the mansion.
 However, we haven\'t seen anyone."
"Wait a second, isn\'t this line of reasoning a little too hasty?
 Yes, no one spotted them, but that doesn\'t mean that you can deny the possibility that a 19th person exists, right?"
"Maybe, for some reason, they landed on the island stealthily and have been hiding ever since.
 ......It\'s what they call the Devil\'s Proof.
 It\'s easy to prove that something exists.
 If this {f:5:Beatrice} appears in front of us all and says hi, then everything is resolved.
 But it\'s impossible to prove that there is no 19th person."
"......Yes.
 Battler‐kun, your way of reasoning isn\'t bad.
 In the current situation, there\'s not enough information to either accept that a 19th person exists or deny it.
 ......But if you flip over the chessboard and think of it that way, we can be nearly sure that the existence of a 19th person is impossible."
"Flip over the chessboard" was one of Kyrie‐san\'s favorite phrases.
{n}...I had also been influenced by those words, and used them myself from time to time.
When you get stuck trying to find a move in chess or shogi, by flipping the board over and looking at everything from your opponent\'s standpoint, you can often see a strategy that would give you the upper hand.
Derived from this, it means to think by putting yourself in your opponent\'s shoes.
"......Okay.
 Let\'s say that that a 19th person called {f:5:Beatrice} actually exists.
 That person must have managed, without being seen by anyone, to stealthily arrive on this island and remain hidden since then.
 They had some reason for this, yes?
 In that case, why did they then deliberately appear before Maria and hand her the letter?"
It really was a contradiction.
If they had some reason for hiding themselves,
 then they should have stayed hidden the whole time, but they had appeared openly in front of Maria.
"Well......
...wait, Maria even said it.
 Didn\'t she say that she had been made a messenger?
 Since Maria was the youngest and looked the most innocent..."
"Why would they need a messenger?
 If they just wanted a letter delivered to the family conference, they could have mailed it.
 If they mailed it to each of the four siblings, they would be unable to ignore it.
 There was no need for them to carry it themselves and secretly hand it over."
".....................That really...
......does sound pretty weird."
"In the first place, if {f:5:Beatrice} existed, and she wanted to make her presence known to everyone, then she could have just openly presented herself to all of us.
 Despite that, she chose the vague method of appearing through a little girl called Maria‐chan, and only gave us an indistinct impression of who she was.
 Contradiction.
 Let\'s go a little deeper, shall we?"
"............She appeared in front of Maria, trying to give us the impression that a 19th person existed, and yet,
 she still hasn\'t appeared before us and is hiding somewhere at this very moment.
 The contradiction between these.
 ......Keep it in mind, and flip over the chessboard."
"In other words, the question is: why would a person want to give the impression that {f:5:Beatrice} exists as a 19th person?"
"......If this person wanted to hide, then they wouldn\'t have made their presence known.
 And if they wanted to show themselves, they wouldn\'t have used the roundabout approach of entrusting someone with a letter.
 ......Which means...?"
"It\'s simple.
 {f:5:Beatrice} is one of the 18.
 That is why they are creating the illusion that there is someone outside of the 18.
 ...A powerful suggestion of a 19th person."
"The only person who could profit from this would not be some 19th person in hiding.
 It would be one of the original 18 people.
 ......Of course, this reasoning is full of holes.
 If you turn over even a few of its premises, it will simply fall apart.
 But I think it is almost certainly correct."
...This was quickly starting to sound pretty creepy.
Who had lent Maria the umbrella and handed her the letter?
{n}All of the 18 had been ruled out.
{n}And yet, {f:5:Beatrice} was hidden amongst those 18.
What was that person planning, hiding their true form and pretending to be {f:5:Beatrice}...?
"I also suspected that it might have been Maria‐chan playacting, but the contents of the message were extremely complicated, so it\'s hard to think that Maria‐chan prepared it herself.
 ......However, I can\'t deny the possibility that Maria‐chan is working together with someone."
"W‐wait a sec...Maria\'s a nine year old kid!
 What on Earth could you suspect her of planning, and with who?!
 And what about her serious, too honest, and obedient character?!"
"Yes, I also understand what kind of a person Maria‐chan is.
 ......But I think that\'s exactly why it\'s possible.
 That girl\'s a dreamer who looks up to and blindly accepts the existence of witches.
 So if a person appeared in front of her and said they were the witch {f:5:Beatrice}, Maria‐chan would be so happy that she would just swallow it up, I think."
".........So you\'re saying that if someone disguised themselves by wearing that fancy dress from the portrait, tricking Maria wouldn\'t be that hard?"
"Of course, with that reasoning, all of us women would become the primary suspects.
 ......Anyway, who did Maria‐chan encounter...
 Asking her the details of that would be our best and closest key to solving this riddle."
"...But that key has been obstinately closed up inside her heart.
 Everyone denied the existence of the witch without listening to her, and barraged her with too many questions about who {f:5:Beatrice} actually was.
 ......Maria‐chan probably won\'t open her heart to the adults now."
In the dim hall, in front of the portrait of {f:5:Beatrice}, ......Maria was sobbing.
"......Uu...
 Uu.
 ...No one believes I met you!
 ......Uu......
uu......
 I showed them the letter you gave me, but they still don\'t believe...!
 .........Uu......u...
u...
...hic...
hic!"
"Anyway, Maria‐chan\'s holding the key.
 The key to whether {f:5:Beatrice} is one of the 18 people or a 19th person."
"...Maria is stubborn, you know?
 That girl, when she gets angry, it\'s pretty hard to make her feel better."
"Battler‐kun, I think there\'s a higher probability of a kid like you cheering her up than an adult like me.
 ...After she feels better, try asking her."
"......I know you don\'t care about all this back and forth on the distribution of the inheritance,
 but don\'t you think this classic Western mansion mystery situation is exciting?
 Who in the world is this person who gave Maria‐chan the letter?
 ......It makes my intellectual curiosity tingle."
"Even while being made to sit through those boring money talks, you can call this exciting? You really are tough...
 Adults are something else."
I shrugged, exasperated.
{n}...But I had realized.
She had noticed the dejection I was feeling because I had overheard our parents\' turbulent discussion,
 and was probably trying to turn my mood around.
...She had at least managed to make me feel good enough to hurl abuse.
......She wasn\'t my real mother, so I never felt like calling her Mom.
...But it did make me think "she\'s a real adult".
"Hey, brats, so this is where you were?
 Kyrie, you really took your time fixing your makeup, didn\'t you?
 From now on, I\'ll start wearing it too."
"I\'m sorry.
 A woman\'s makeup takes a long time.
 ............So?
 How has the discussion been without me?"
"Hehehe, I\'m sure everything was all peaceful and harmonious."
Kyrie‐san poked the weak spot under my arm with her elbow.
"...We decided to take a break to cool our heads a little.
 It looks like it\'ll last all night.
 I could cry."
His way of talking hadn\'t changed, but he couldn\'t completely hide his fatigue.
...I couldn\'t say I was sympathetic, but he looked pitiful compared to his normal, energetic self.
"Still, that rain\'s just awful.
 I really don\'t want to go back to the guesthouse.
 It looks like Natsuhi nee‐san made preparations for us to spend the night here in the mansion.
 What\'ll we do?"
"......We don\'t need to think about that until you\'re done, right?
 If you run out of enough energy to head back to our room, then we can let them take care of us."
"You\'re right.
 We can think about it later.
 ......What about you, Battler?"
"If I stayed, I\'d just get in the way.
 I\'ll be nice and go back over there."
".........OK.
 Will you go back soon?"
"I dunno.
 It\'d be lonely to head back by myself.
 I\'ll head back with the rest of the kids as a group."
"Yeah.
 That\'d be good.
 ...............So, Battler.
 You won\'t just be going to sleep that easily, right?"
"Yeah, I\'ll probably be up talking with the cousins.
 It feels like we might be up all night.
 Is there a problem with that?"
"......OK.
 If, when the adults\' discussion is over, you are still awake, I want to have a little talk as a family."
"...A what?
 That doesn\'t sound like you."
Apparently, Kyrie‐san was thinking the same thing.
{n}"What are you talking about?",
 she asked him in a small voice.
...It looked like Kyrie‐san didn\'t have a clue what Dad was talking about either.
"......I want to talk to you about it as well.
 ......I\'ll tell you later, so don\'t ask now.
 Please."
".....................?"
I don\'t think there\'s anyone who ignores their family as much as this old bastard.
...And this was the guy that was asking us to have a talk as a family.
{n}......Both Kyrie‐san and I couldn\'t help but get wide‐eyed.
"Don\'t make that scared looking face.
 I\'m the one that should be scared.
 ............I mean, ......"
At that point, he swallowed his words for an instant.
...I don\'t remember Dad being the kind of person to artificially drum up suspense.
"...You\'re freaking me out, Dad.
 You\'ve got your family all here right now.
 Quit beating around the bush and spit it out."
"..................I\'m probably...
......gonna get...
murdered tonight."
There was a huge crash of thunder.
{n}It must have been really close.
Dad\'s expression, brightly illuminated by the lightning, was burned into my eyes.
......Dad\'s face, which always looked so sure of itself and which always wore a taunting expression,
 ......was, for some reason that I couldn\'t explain, strangely frail.
 ............It was so worn out that he looked like a different person.
"Wh‐what...?!
 ...What are you talking about, that doesn\'t sound like you!"
"*giggle*.
 I agree.
 What happened? You look so timid all of a sudden.
 It\'s not like you."
".........I\'m going to go fix my makeup.
 Don\'t follow me."
Dad turned away, weakly.
...After that, only Kyrie‐san and I were left, still wide‐eyed.
"What the hell was that.........?
 He\'s gonna get {i:murdered} tonight?"
"You don\'t think that mysterious letter scared him?
 Hasn\'t he been watching too many serial murder movies?"
"..................Hmmm."
Kyrie‐san didn\'t answer my lighthearted words, and continued to stare at my dad\'s disappearing back...
"......Battler‐kun, when you told Rudolf‐san to talk about it, he left without telling us anything.
 Even though he said that he had something to say to everyone, he didn\'t answer you.
 Why?
 ......Flip over the chessboard.
 ............And when you do?"
"There\'s the contradiction that he said he wanted to talk but then couldn\'t.
 ...What, can you see anything by looking from Dad\'s perspective?"
"......*giggle*.
 Yes, I can see something.
 He wants to talk about something.
 However, he doesn\'t have the courage to bring it up.
 So he actually means "In that case, chase after me, talk to me, and question it out of me".
 He also means the opposite when he says "Don\'t follow me".
 He actually means "Follow me and force me to answer."
 ......Honestly, what a spoiled little child."
"Whaaaa?!
 Are you sure that theory\'s OK?!
 Th‐that\'s ridiculous."
"Heheheh, can great detectives deduce the emotions and feelings between men and women?
 They can\'t, right?
 Figuring out the feelings of the opposite sex is an even more advanced art than exposing the tricks in difficult crime cases.
 If you ask me, romance novels have much deeper mysteries than masterpiece mystery novels."
"I, ...I see.
 Is that how it is......"
"I\'ll be with that spoiled little child.
 ......He normally loves to act tough, but tonight he\'s completely tired out from that heated discussion.
 He probably wants someone to lean on at the moment.
 And responding to that need is the duty of his partner."
"Hahh.
 Sounds passionate.
 Then I\'ll leave the old bastard in your hands."
"Yes, leave it to me."
As Kyrie‐san departed, I called out to her.
"......Huh?
 What?"
"Um, I wanted to say thanks.
 Thanks to you, my gloomy mood has cleared up a lot."
"That\'s good.
 Communication is important."
After answering with a wink, Kyrie‐san followed after Dad...
Natsuhi could be found in the dimly lit hallway.
{n}Now and then, the thunder would crash, but this had no effect on Natsuhi\'s expression.
......Her expression was completely worn out.
The discussion that had just taken place between the relatives in the dining hall was repeating itself inside Natsuhi\'s mind...
{f:5:Beatrice} had proclaimed that in addition to the gold, the headship and all of the assets of the Ushiromiya family would be given to the person who could solve the riddle.
...In other words, she planned to undermine the absolute guarantee that Krauss, as the oldest brother, had to succeed the family head.
Originally, the other siblings had absolutely no chance to succeed the head.
To them, this "proposal" by {f:5:Beatrice} was extremely desirable.
It was obvious that they would accept {f:5:Beatrice}\'s proposal.
...Even without playing clumsy detective games, she knew that this so called 19th person, {f:5:Beatrice}, couldn\'t exist.
This was a message employing a fictional character called {f:5:Beatrice} as a messenger; it may as well have been written in Kinzo\'s own handwriting.
The proof was that Kinzo remained stubbornly neutral as to that letter\'s authenticity.
......He was completely ignoring these reckless claims that he shouldn\'t be able to ignore: that he had given up the Head\'s Ring.
............In short, Kinzo had wordlessly admitted that the letter held his own message.
Most likely, one of the servants had given Maria the letter.
Kinzo had probably worked out an elaborate plan where the dress from the portrait would be prepared,
 ......and someone, probably Shannon, would be made to wear it and deliver the letter and the umbrella.
By doing that, he could make it seem like the witch from the portrait actually existed.
...No, if anything, that is why you could be certain that Kinzo was behind all of this.
In that case, ......it was just as if Kinzo had butted in on the siblings\' private discussion.
And, by announcing that he would give everything to the person who could solve the riddle, Kinzo had weakened Krauss\'s overwhelming advantage.
.........Now it was certain.
{n}Kinzo had listened in on the siblings\' discussion in the parlor earlier that day.
So he had known how Krauss had staved off the attack by the other three,
 and to make the scales of the battle go back into balance, he had sent out this strange letter which benefited the other three.
Eva and Rudolf had dragged Rosa in, who had a weak position among the siblings because of her age,
 and they were trying once again to overwhelm Krauss three‐on‐one, and push through their crazy reasoning.
......And so, they had resumed what had once been a nearly decided conflict, and were repeatedly pressing Krauss to pay them a large amount of money...
Talk about the advance payment, which had been denied once already, was being brought up again under the terms that all of the siblings would guarantee Krauss the succession to the family head.
Of course, even without the story about the hidden gold, the Ushiromiya family\'s store of wealth was vast.
Just that store was worth more than enough by itself.
{n}Even if the hidden gold was buried forever along with Kinzo\'s death, there would be more than enough to satisfy.
Therefore, even if they had no interest in the gold itself,
 there would be the lifelong fear that, on the off‐chance that someone found the gold, that person would be granted the position of family head.
And this kind of Achilles\' heel would definitely be taken advantage of by someone sooner or later.
The only person with this fatal weakness was the successor to the head, Krauss.
{n}......The other siblings had found,
 ...no, they had been told, by Kinzo, about something that only Krauss could lose, and they had thoroughly taken advantage of that.
...Natsuhi, as Krauss\'s only ally in his painful position, and as his wife, had believed she was fighting alongside him.
She kept trying to point out to him that the existence of the gold itself was a farce and that there was no need for him to compromise.
Krauss had always told Natsuhi.
 He had told all of the siblings.
{n}He had always, always said that the hidden gold was nothing more than a fiction created by Kinzo.
Therefore, Natsuhi had believed that as his wife, and on that foundation had supported her husband.
Yet her words would not reach him.
...Even though she was fighting so hard and lending all of her strength, he continued to fight by himself, and was trying to compromise with the other three siblings...
Wondering why she could not be of use to him, Natsuhi felt sorrow, shame, and then anger.
It had happened when everyone decided to take a short break to cool their heads.
Natsuhi had flared up against Krauss.
Enraged, she had asked why she could not be useful to him.
......He had told her that he wanted to talk about something, and had invited her into one of his private rooms, which she was normally not allowed to enter.
That room had been sealed with a heavy‐looking padlock, and just looking at it had given her an uncomfortable feeling...
"There\'s no reason for you to worry about what those three or even this suspicious person who calls themselves {f:5:Beatrice} says!!
 After all, the gold is just a ruse created by Father.
 There\'s no way something like that could be found!!
 It is set in stone that you will be the successor to the family.
 What are you afraid of?!"
Krauss removed the padlock on the door.
{n}He then motioned for Natsuhi to enter.
"Enter."
"Wha‐......what is this?"
"There\'s something I want to show you.
 ......I have never shown it to you before."
Natsuhi timidly opened the door with a dubious expression on her face...
It was pitch black.
She searched for a switch to turn on the lights, but since this was her first time in the room, she didn\'t know where it was.
Krauss entered behind her, pushing her in, and closed the door before making any attempt to turn on the lights; the two were swallowed up by the darkness.
Only the sound of Krauss locking the door rang out through the dark.
"Wh‐what are you doing...?
 The, the lights..."
"I am turning it on now.
 Wait."
True to his word, Krauss pushed a switch on the wall, and a flickering light turned on and lit up the room.
"...........................Wh‐
what is......?"
Natsuhi had her breath taken away.
The room had no windows, and at a glance, it appeared to be empty.
In the middle of the room, a small, round table had been set,
 and the lights brightened only that table, as if it were the leading part in a play.
Laid out on top of the table was a red tablecloth of elaborate design, covered with dust,
 ......and on top of that, "something" about the size of a grown man\'s arm had been set down.
......That something took Natsuhi\'s breath away.
"It\'s a gold ingot of incredible purity.
 Without this, no one would have believed in the Legend of the Gold."
It was an ingot of solid gold.
Even in the faint light, it sparkled with a noble and dignified gold glint...
"This is not a proper ingot.
 I don\'t even know whether it was cast inside or outside the country."
It takes a high level of skill to make the purest of solid gold ingots.
{n}And in order to verify that purity, it is standard to have the original foundry and the name of the bank that guaranteed it imprinted on the gold.
...However, this ingot did not have that kind of seal.
{n}.........This mysterious gold bar had come from an unknown foundry.
"Look here.
 ............There\'s nothing to be afraid of.
 It\'s just a bar of gold."
Natsuhi, following Krauss\'s words, timidly approached the ingot......
"Right there."
Krauss pointed at the surface of the ingot.
{n}...Natsuhi concentrated on that section...
".....................!!"
Right there was the thin imprint of the One‐winged Eagle crest!
 Natsuhi\'s breath was taken away once again.
"That\'s right.
 This is the legendary ingot that Dad said he received from the witch, that the president of Marusoo witnessed and was allowed to select at random to take back with him,
 that gained the trust of the fixers in the business world.
 I had to use all possible means to find it.
 ......Before the other siblings could."
".........How could............
 ......Then,
 .........the legend of Father\'s gold is........."
"It actually exists.
 ......The gold that Ushiromiya Kinzo received from {f:5:Beatrice} actually exists."
"How could...............!
 H‐......how could it really exist............"
Natsuhi was shocked......
Krauss had always said that Kinzo\'s gold was just a fabrication.
{n}So she had believed it as his wife.
However, the reality was different.
{n}He had held definite proof, and had been more certain than any of the other siblings that the Legend of the Gold was true.
Because of this, Krauss was deeply frightened at the possibility that someone other than himself would find the gold that he had failed to find, costing him everything.
......But to Natsuhi, this truth was more than enough to split open her heart.
She had thought that, as Krauss\'s wife, she should be his closest confidant, which was why she had been selflessly supporting him.
...And yet, he had hidden this fact from her until today.
 .........Why?
"......Ha‐
.........have I been...
.........so undeserving of your trust............?"
".........I didn\'t mean it like that.
 It was only that there was no need to mention it."
"Is,
 ......is that all a,
 ............a wife...
means to you............?!"
"Calm down...
 Becoming passionate easily is one of your bad habits."
"You\'re the one who\'s making me like that, aren\'t you!!!
 I have been supporting you as a wife ever since I married into this family...!
 For your sake, I threw away the family I was born into,
 I\'ve been offering up my heart and my body to serve you...!!"
"And in return,
 .........I get this.........?!!
 How could......
 ............How could you............!!"
Krauss grimaced, looking annoyed...
{n}His expression effectively communicated how much he disliked this part of Natsuhi...
"......I.........
 I don\'t think I can be of any use to you anymore............"
"Mm, and that is fine.
 .........I can resolve problems between the siblings by myself.
 I don\'t need your help."
"That\'s wrong!!
 This is the Ushiromiya family\'s problem!
 It\'s true that I am not permitted to have the family crest imprinted on my body!
 But I am still your wife!!"
"Even so, ......are you saying I\'m not qualified to help you...?!
 Are you.........?!!!"
".....................I deliberately chose not to involve you, out of consideration for you.
 Let\'s not talk any further; it will likely only worsen your headaches.
 Take a rest for today.
 The siblings will deal with the siblings\' problems.
 It has nothing to do with you.
 That is all."
A dull headache tormented Natsuhi...
{n}No matter what medicine she took, no matter what scents she burned, it wouldn\'t heal.
......On the other hand, by standing here alone in a dimly lit corridor, her head filled with the sound of the rain, she felt like the pain had softened a little...
.........I may have been Natsuhi,
 ...but I was not Ushiromiya Natsuhi.
Denigrated as being a sorry excuse for a wife, ...verbally abused for not even being able to take care of that,
 .........even so, I tried to properly perform the duties of a wife,
 ......but have been rejected even by my husband.
I did my best raising my daughter as though it was the last job left to me.
{n}...However, my anger and sadness, having no place to go, caused me to subconsciously strain that relationship too...
Because I have been excessively strict in Jessica\'s education, I am thoroughly disliked by her.
Jessica despises me for not being interested in anything but grades.
......There is no longer...
......anything I can do for the Ushiromiya family.........
No,
 ......that\'s no good.
Even so, I must help my husband dislodge the schemes of the other greedy siblings.
The head won\'t be around much longer.
 Eventually, Krauss will succeed the head.
{n}And the next successor will be Jessica.
.........Strictly speaking, the man who enters the family by marrying Jessica will become the next head, but it all comes to the same thing.
......I have to make Jessica an excellent successor who everyone will accept as worthy to take over the Ushiromiya family.
In the years to come, that greedy Ushiromiya Eva will surely be continually plotting to find some fault with the main family,
 so that if all goes as she plans, Jessica will be dragged down from the succession, with George in her place.
......It is regrettable, but George is a man, and even more, has matured as a person.
...If you compare him to Jessica, who is right in the middle of her rebellious period and whose grades are below average, you can see at a glance who is more fit to succeed the head.
So in order to secure Jessica\'s position, I need to turn her into an excellent person.
After doing that, .........I want to find her an excellent husband worthy of the excellent person she will have become.
.........A wonderful man who will truly accept Jessica, and stay with her through all of life\'s joys and sorrows.
Was that...............Natsuhi trying to entrust her daughter with fulfilling some desire of her own?
Natsuhi thought back to the days when she\'d had no choice but to marry into the Ushiromiya family, because of that unavoidable fate...
She had tried to block that from her memory.
.........She had consciously forgotten that, and had actively attended to the life she had been given as Ushiromiya Natsuhi...
And this was the new life she had built.
.........But, ...it felt like,
 ......just now, all of that had been casually rejected.
"..............................
 How should I think as I live my life?
 ...............I don\'t know."
Natsuhi helplessly rested her head against the glass of the window...
The glass, cooled by the raindrops beating against it, was somehow refreshing, and even though it had no emotions, ...right then it seemed to be the only thing that could understand Natsuhi...
Even if someone showed up there and saw her like this, Natsuhi had no intention of caring in the least.
.........But she found herself caring.
 .........Because it was her beloved daughter.
".........Oh,
 ......it\'s you, Mom.
 What the heck are you doing here?
 Thought you were a ghost..."
Just like always, her words were rough and not at all like a girl\'s.
...Instinctively, words of rebuke rose to Natsuhi\'s throat.
{n}.........However, they did so only weakly, and so she was able to prevent them from escaping her lips.
"........................Jessica.
 I\'m sorry, your mother has an awful headache.
 Please leave me be."
"..................Oh......"
Jessica was more than slightly disconcerted by this first ever sight of feebleness from her mother.
Until just now, she had been filled with contempt for all of the parents, including her mother.
...But now, not the slightest bit of that feeling remained.
......All of it had been wiped out by her mother\'s completely exhausted face.
In its place, the words that George had told her floated back up in her mind.
{n}The parents are doing their best in their own way.
...They are supporting their family, so they can\'t afford to keep everything pleasant, and have a heavy responsibility to fight.
......Couldn\'t her mother have been standing around in this dimly lit hallway because no one had tried to understand that...?
Jessica didn\'t like her mother.
{n}......So she had no instinct to give her mother words of kindness just because she looked a little frail...
Therefore, in order to give those words regardless, she had to clench both her fists, and wrench the words out from the depths of her heart.
"It, .........it looks like you really have your hands full with that discussion..."
".....................It has nothing to do with you.
 Please go somewhere else."
".........Is your headache bad?
 Should, should I go get some medicine...?"
"...............You don\'t have to trouble yourself.
 ...Please, leave me by myself."
Natsuhi was not being cold to her.
{n}...She just wanted to get her daughter far away from her, so that she could avoid subjecting her to her short temper.
......But there was no chance that her intentions would reach Jessica.
".....................o......okay."
Jessica hung her head, looking sad.
...Looking at that expression, Natsuhi realized that Jessica was trying to muster up the strength to be kind to her mother.
She gave her head a small shake to drive away her own unkind feelings...
"Then I\'ll......leave.
 ......I\'ll be with the other cousins so I don\'t get in the way of the adults.
 ............See you..."
".........Wait."
She called Jessica, about to make her desolate exit, to a stop.
"......What...?"
"............Thank you for being considerate.
 .........It isn\'t good of me to go to sleep and leave you alone."
"D‐don\'t talk like that, you\'ll bring bad luck..."
"...I apologize for worrying you.
 I\'m alright now.
 .........I will go."
Staying here any longer with such a feeble expression would actually make her daughter feel more uncomfortable.
...Thinking this, Natsuhi left Jessica with words of gratitude and made to depart.
......This time, it was Jessica who called out to her mother\'s back.
{n}Natsuhi stopped, turned around, and asked what she wanted.
But Jessica herself didn\'t know why she had stopped her mother,
 ...and for a while, she muttered to herself with a slightly forced smile as she hesitated over what to say.
She was poking around in her pocket when her hand touched something, and she took it out.
"Um, hey, Mom!
 I, uh, was given a charm today.
 What was it, a charm against magic?"
"Umm, err...... I\'m pretty sure that...you were supposed to hang it from your doorknob, was it?
 Ahahaha... I forget...
 There\'s no reason for me to have it, so......
I\'m giving it to you."
It was the scorpion charm that Maria had given her by the beach that day.
Although she had heard of its various effects from Maria, right now, Jessica\'s mind was blank, and it was all she could do to say even that much.
Thinking that her mother probably wouldn\'t accept the charm anyway, Jessica had immediately drawn back the hand offering it to her.
......So when Natsuhi came back and took hold of that hand, she was extremely surprised...
"......................What is this?
 Some kind of giveaway...?"
"W‐well, it\'s, I think it\'s something like that...
 I guess you can\'t expect any benefits from a charm that looks like a toy......"
But her mother took the scorpion charm from her grip.
"Thank you.
 I\'ll take good care of it.
 ............Sometime soon, in exchange, I\'ll give you a charm that was important to me when I was a child."
"...It, it\'s not like that\'s why I gave it to you.
 ......But, well,
 ......if you really say so..."
"Then I will rest for now.
 My headache is awful.
 .........Try not to stay up too late."
"Sure..."
Natsuhi put the charm in her pocket and turned away.
{n}......She then disappeared into the dark hall...
"...It looks like the weather will be like this all day tomorrow after all."
"Damn... It\'s hard to believe it was dry out earlier."
George‐aniki and I were killing time in front of the parlor television.
At that point, Jessica returned.
{n}Her face was still blank, but it looked like she had calmed down a little since she had left.
"......Is Maria still in front of the portrait?"
"Nope.
 She just came back, and she\'s sleeping over there on the sofa.
 It is getting pretty late for her."
Looking at the clock, it was a little past 10 p.m.
{n}...Even if we were going to stay up all night, it was about time to head back to our room.
"My mom did prepare a room for us in the mansion, but...
...what d\'you wanna do?"
"I think I\'d rather head back to the guesthouse.
 ......Judging by our parents\' appearance, I think it would be better if we weren\'t in the mansion."
"Second that.
 Feels like they\'re telling us kids to mind our own business and stay out of their way.
 Let\'s do that, like good little boys and girls."
After we discussed that, Auntie Rosa came into the parlor.
She was looking all over restlessly, probably trying to find Maria.
"Auntie Rosa, if you\'re looking for Maria, she\'s over there on the sofa."
"Thank you.
 My, she\'s out cold.
 ......We must move her to a bed."
"If you would like me to, I can carry her to a bed."
"Thank you, that would be wonderful.
 .........Will all of you return to the guesthouse?
 Or will you stay in the room Natsuhi nee‐san had prepared?"
"We were just talking about that.
 We just decided to head over to the guesthouse."
"Really.
 Then I wonder if you wouldn\'t mind taking Maria with you.
 ...I think it will be much more comforting for her if she\'s with all of her cousins."
It seemed that, in the shadow behind those words, there was some regret that the adults, herself included, had deeply hurt Maria\'s feelings...
"Leave it to us, Auntie.
 After all, we do have an expert at comforting Maria with us!"
"A‐are you talking about me?
 I couldn\'t do it by myself.
 We\'ll need everyone together."
"That\'s right.
 Battler, weren\'t you the one who hit it off with Maria when you were messing around earlier?"
As we said this, Auntie Rosa smiled, looking truly happy.
"Thank you, everyone.
 ......It looks like our meeting will last until very late.
 So, I\'m sorry for the burden, but I\'ll have to leave Maria in your hands."
"Hey, Maria, are you awake...?
 We\'re going back to the guesthouse~."
Maria muttered something indistinct as if answering, but then rolled over and fell back asleep.
......It looked like she was sleeping deeply.
"She\'s really out cold.
 It\'d be bad to wake her."
"Right, I\'ll carry her."
Maria\'s body was much lighter than it looked.
{n}George‐aniki picked her up and pulled her over his back.
It was raining hard outside, and Aniki couldn\'t hold an umbrella and carry Maria at the same time.
It looked like Auntie Rosa would come with us as far as the guesthouse to help out.
However, when she heard Uncle Krauss\'s voice call out to her, she had no choice but to return.
"......Oh dear.
 I have to go back."
".........Is everyone returning to the guesthouse?"
After we left the hall on the way to the entrance, the door to the servant room opened and Shannon‐chan stepped out.
"It has become very dark, so allow me to guide you."
"Perfect timing, Shannon‐chan.
 George‐kun is going to carry Maria there.
 Could you hold an umbrella for him?"
"Yes, certainly."
Shannon‐chan brought umbrellas for each of us and a flashlight to guide the way.
As we opened the front door, the downpour was quite terrific.
It looked like we wouldn\'t have any spare time to take a pleasant walk and enjoy the nighttime rose garden...
"Aniki, is she too heavy?
 Want me to carry her?"
"It\'s alright.
 I can at least carry Maria‐chan."
"......I\'m truly grateful.
 Please take care of Maria."
"Right, we understand.
 In that case, goodnight, Auntie."
"Then I will see them over there and return here."
"Yes, please..."
Auntie Rosa saw us off.
".........Maria.
 ......I\'m sorry for everything..."
Rosa\'s mumbling voice didn\'t reach the person in question, nor anyone else, but disappeared beneath the sound of the rain...
After cutting through the rainy rose garden, we arrived at the guesthouse.
"Ahh, if only I\'d applied for the position of Maria‐carrier!
 Then I\'d have gotten to rub Shannon‐chan\'s huge chest all over with my arm as she held the umbrella over me!"
"Th‐th‐th‐that\'s not on purpose, it\'s a misunderstanding...!"
"I, I thought that if I didn\'t, George‐sama would get all wet........."
"C\'mon, quit babbling and go in!"
After being nudged by Jessica, Shannon folded up her umbrella and went into the guesthouse.
"Has anyone gotten their clothes wet?
 I can bring some towels if you would like..."
"You don\'t need to worry about us that much.
 Thanks, Shannon‐chan."
"Oh, yes.
 We were saying earlier that we would play some cards, do you want to stay with us for a while?"
"Huh?
 Who had the night shift on today\'s schedule?"
"I believe there is a special schedule for the duration of the family conference.
 I think there were a few changes, so I will go and check......"
"Wait, if you have to go all the way back to the mansion to find out, you don\'t have to force yourself—"
"Ah, it\'s alright.
 I can find out from the servant room in the guesthouse.
 ......Please excuse me for a short while."
Shannon‐chan gave a quick bow and went into the guesthouse servant room.
The rest of us headed for the cousins\' room and put Maria in the bed for the time being.
Maria was sleeping very deeply, and there was absolutely no sign of her eyes opening...
We got some drinks out of the room\'s refrigerator, and spent some time playing cards while drinking...
"......Oh?
 Kanon‐kun?
 Even Genji‐sama is here.
 ...What is happening with tonight\'s shift...?"
"............Krauss‐sama has given an order.
 There have been modifications made to most of the schedule."
"......Indeed.
 Gohda has been changed to the night shift at the mansion.
 You and Kanon have the night shift in the guesthouse.
 Kumasawa‐san and I have been ordered to spend the night in the guesthouse...
 We just now had a phone call stating that you are to remain here as well."
"Huh...?
 Th‐that\'s quite a large modification...
 The shifts at the guesthouse and the mansion have been completely reversed, haven\'t they...?"
Originally, Shannon and Kanon had been given the night shift in the mansion, while the night shift in the guesthouse, where all of the relatives were staying, had been assigned to Gohda, who had an abundance of experience in entertaining.
Kumasawa had been scheduled to stay in the guesthouse, while Genji had been scheduled to stay in the mansion.
However, it seemed that Krauss had suddenly ordered that the schedule be modified.
......The shifts at the guesthouse and the mansion had all been reversed, and Genji was spending the night in the guesthouse.
"............It\'s probably because of {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama\'s letter."
"Probably? ......Why?"
".........When such a mysterious letter appeared, it was only natural that Krauss‐sama would suspect one of us.
 .........We serve directly under the Master, so Krauss‐sama probably wanted to keep us as far away from the family conference as possible."
Genji, Shannon, and Kanon were all permitted to wear the Ushiromiya family crest, the "One‐winged Eagle", as the servants who served directly under Kinzo.
Of course, since they were working for the Ushiromiya family, they had to obey anyone\'s orders, but their only boss was Kinzo.
Since only Kinzo held the right to employ them, even Krauss could not have them dismissed of his own accord.
Because of this, they were often viewed by Krauss and the others as Kinzo\'s underlings, and shunned.
And in reality, Kinzo would seldom let anyone other than them enter his study.
You could probably call this sudden shift change a clear expression of that sense of distrust.
Considering the time Kinzo had left to live, this would definitely be the last family conference before the problem of the inheritance would come up.
On top of that, the mysterious letter that claimed to be from {f:5:Beatrice} had dropped in out of the blue.
Krauss definitely wanted to keep Kinzo\'s loyal subjects away from the table of such a delicate and important discussion...
"......If you would excuse me, I will go rest.
 ...If anything happens, call me immediately."
"Our company tonight is...{i:special}."
""Yes, certainly, Genji‐sama.""
Genji nodded back, went behind a screen, took off his jacket, and slowly began to relax after a day\'s worth of tension...
".........The ones who just returned now, were they the children...?"
"Yes.
 The other relatives are having a conference in the mansion.
 It looked like it would drag on until much later..."
"......That would be comfortable.
 It\'s already this late, and there\'s this weather.
 Probably, the rest of the relatives will spend the night in their rooms in the mansion."
"Yes, probably...
 I\'m only saying this because Genji‐sama isn\'t around, but...
...I\'m a little happy I was sent to the guesthouse......I think..."
"Oh...?
 Why\'s that?
 Because you were able to distance yourself from the bullying of Madam and Eva‐sama?
 ...Or do you have another reason?"
"I, ......I don\'t have any...
...o‐other reasons...!"
".........I see.
 Then, let\'s do our best together with our midnight shift.
 I\'m counting on you, Nee‐san."
"Ah, ......umm.........
 Just now, I was asked to go to the children\'s room and play with them..."
Shannon hung her head apologetically, ...and made uncertain glances toward Kanon\'s eyes.
Kanon didn\'t try to meet her gaze, and spoke curtly as he sighed.
It looked like he didn\'t plan on indulging his "sister".
"............You can\'t.
 You were assigned the night shift.
 ...And besides that, it is not necessary for furniture like us to respond to an invitation to play.
 ...You understand, right?"
"Y‐...yes, I do understand.
 ..................nn."
Shannon dropped her shoulders slightly.
...She had already expected that Kanon, who considered rules to be very important, would probably say something like that, but even so, she was a little discouraged.
As Kanon turned the pages of a logbook, he spoke without facing Shannon.
"............In that case, you must be keeping the children waiting.
 You will have to apologize and tell them that you have the night shift and won\'t be able to stay with them.
 ......Off you go, then."
"Huh.........ah, yes!
 I\'ll just go apologize..."
Shannon hurriedly stood from her seat before her brother\'s mood could change, gave a quick bow, and flew out of the servant room...
As he watched her disappear, Kanon took a single deep breath...
Genji\'s voice came from beyond the screen.
"......Kanon.
 ......I will be here, so you should go too."
"Genji‐sama...
 ......Shannon was the only one called.
 It\'s not like I was invited..."
"That is only because you were not there at the time.
 If you had been, you would have been invited as well.
 ......It is good to play as a child from time to time."
".......................................
 ......No, that\'s not something that I need to do.
 ......A human child may have a need to play.
 ......But we......are furniture."
".....................Is that so."
".........Nee‐san is also...
furniture.
 .........Even if she pretends to be a person,
 ...it will only hurt her later.
 ...I understand that, so I try not to get too close to people."
Genji did not say anything after that.
......A few moments passed, and then he stood up, used a pot of hot water to make some hot chocolate from powder, and served it to Kanon as well.
"Holy crap, seriously?!?!
 I did not know that...!!"
"Keep it down, dumbass!
 You\'ll wake Maria up!"
Battler was so surprised that he yelled obnoxiously and scattered his cards everywhere.
His voice caused Maria to turn over once, but she soon fell back into a deep sleep...
Jessica gave him a jab, and he lowered his voice.
"No, but, yeah...now that you\'ve said that...they really did have that kind of atmosphere, didn\'t they...
 ......Haa, now I see, that George‐aniki..."
George could not be seen anywhere in the room.
{n}A short while ago, when Shannon had come into the room, George had suddenly said that he had forgotten something in the mansion and needed to go back and get it.
Shannon had said she would guide him, just like she had on the way to the guesthouse, and the two of them had departed together.
"......They\'ve been showing signs of it for a long time, you know?
 Asking what the other person liked, asking what their hobbies were.
 I always knew it was too much to just be a passing interest!"
"Come to think of it, I get the feeling that George‐aniki has always been overly nice to Shannon‐chan......
 Nowww I get it..."
"According to the weather report, it looks like it will be at its worst tonight.
 It also seems that it won\'t stop all tomorrow, but it should get a little better."
"...Really?
 Then, the boat may not arrive until the day after tomorrow......
 ...I\'m concerned that it might interfere with your work on Monday..."
"Hahaha, I already knew that the typhoon would be coming beforehand.
 Just in case, I made sure that I didn\'t have any plans for Monday, so it\'s alright.
 ...I may not look like it, but I really am the type who can plan ahead in his schedule."
George puffed out his chest, acting proud.
Compared to the normally composed appearance that George always had as the oldest cousin, he now looked amusingly like a little kid.
Shannon chuckled at this gap.
"It\'s no surprise that someone who will soon make his company prosperous is so well prepared."
"...Well, making a company prosperous really is a tough job.
 Money isn\'t the only thing that\'s important.
 I learned that well by studying from my father.
 Making a company prosperous is like having a castle and leading your subordinates."
"My father, true to his name of Hideyoshi, really loves reading about the great leaders of the {ruby:Warring States:Sengoku} period.
 Most of his philosophical speeches on business management start with one of them.
 ...Did you know?
 Takeda Shingen, who was feared as the leader of the strongest cavalry corps in the Sengoku period, started out with his troops in complete disarray, and didn\'t have the kind of strong leadership necessary to utilize them well."
"Is that true?
 That\'s a little unexpected."
"In order to unite his troops, Shingen utilized several strategies.
 For example, when a soldier succeeded well in battle, he would immediately honor them with a medal.
 Normally, that kind of thing was put off until after the war and they were all awarded at once."
"By doing that regularly on the field of battle,
 he immediately showed his appreciation for his troops\' military exploits, which motivated them in an extremely significant fashion.
 Furthermore, whenever one of his troops was brought down by an illness, he would be the first to rush up to them and care for them, things like that."
"...Takeda Shingen wasn\'t just the man who led the strongest calvary corps in the Sengoku period.
 He was the person who cared the most for his troops throughout the Sengoku period."
"......That must be why all of his troops followed him."
The truth was, Shannon had already heard this story several years ago.
{n}...But when George started to tie his father in with one of these stories, he would always be beaming, looking like he was having a great time.
So Shannon did not interrupt, but merely smiled, to encourage him to continue.
"Of course, in a capitalist world, money is power, and it is also the height of your castle wall.
 But you can\'t build up a castle or succeed in war by yourself.
 That kind of thing can only be created with the support of many subordinates, by borrowing their strength."
"......After understanding this, when I look at my father\'s back, I realize how immature I am,
 I see how much my father has cultivated his character by working hard, and understand well how he was able to build up all that he has until today."
"George‐sama, you truly look up to your father...
 I\'m jealous."
"A‐ah, sorry...that\'s not exactly the way I meant to say it."
"I, I am sorry... I also didn\'t mean it that way......"
The two of them awkwardly looked at their feet.
Shannon had no parents.
{n}She had been brought up in a welfare institute owned by Kinzo called the Gospel House.
Under the guidance of the honorary director, Kinzo, the Gospel House offered excellent students a chance to live a life of service.
If they were accepted, they would be able to leave the institute and work as servants for the Ushiromiya family.
...This was considered to be the highest honor for a student.
Servants from the Gospel ({ruby:Fukuin:{p:0:福音}}) House all took names with the character "{ruby:in/on/non:{p:0:音}}" in them while they served.
So "Shannon" ({p:0:紗音}) wasn\'t her real name.
{n}The same goes for "Kanon" ({p:0:嘉音}).
All of the students of the Gospel House were orphans.
{n}Or, failing that, people who had been disowned by their parents through some special circumstances.
......Because of this, the students had been taught to think of each other as their only family.
That\'s why it seemed so natural to Kanon to call Shannon his sister.
And while only Shannon and Kanon were working today in the mansion,
 there were other servants who worked in the shift rotation, named Manon ({p:0:眞音}) and Lenon ({p:0:恋音}), who also inherited the "{p:0:音}" character in their names.
...However, there were not many servants who stayed with the Ushiromiya family for long.
It was standard for them to quit after three years.
So you could probably say that Shannon, who had been working for over ten years, was a very rare exception to the rule.
Working as a servant for the Ushiromiya family was a heavy burden to bear, but the pay wasn\'t bad at all.
Working for a full three years would earn more than what was needed to enter mainstream society.
That was why, even though the students realized what a harsh task working for the Ushiromiya family was, they still hoped to be accepted.
But in Shannon\'s case, maybe the fact that she had managed to continue for more than ten years should not be viewed as her having more willpower than any of the other servants.
Maybe it was a lack of courage to say that she wanted to quit, that forced her to continue working for those ten years.
To Kinzo, who could not even trust his own blood relatives, those "excellent" servants sent from the Gospel House were the only ones he could trust.
Because of that, Kinzo would sometimes allow them to wear the family crest as servants under his direct control, and have them work close to him...
"......Err, ......um, you\'ve already been working here about ten years, was it?
 You must have saved up a lot of money by now, right?"
"I don\'t know, really...
 It\'s not like there\'s anything in particular I\'d like to buy...
 And just because you have a few million yen doesn\'t mean you have enough to live the rest of your life with..."
"So you haven\'t been working here trying to reach a target sum?"
".........N‐...no, I haven\'t.
 ......I have nowhere to go outside of this mansion.
 ......I have been getting along well with Milady and the other young servants, too...
 ......I am sometimes scolded by Madam, but, ......caring for the rose garden and cleaning the mansion is fun..."
"But that isn\'t {i:your} life,
 ......Sayo ({p:0:紗代})‐chan."
".........Umm..."
Shannon cast her eyes downwards when she heard her real name...
{n}She understood what George was trying to say and closed her mouth.
"Even after becoming an adult and a full‐fledged member of society, I\'ve been studying and I\'ve learned something.
 ......A human\'s life is not as monotonous or as short as we thought when we were kids."
That horrifying thought that everyone has in their student years.
......Will the rest of my life be like a monotonous, boring, sleep‐inducing after‐school class,
 where I endlessly, lazily while away the time, until finally, it ends, without anything interesting ever happening...
However, these thoughts only arise while a person is still an underage student.
Compared to a human\'s life, the time they spend as a student is nothing more than a blink of the eye—just the period before they break out of their shells, and cast off their immaturity.
The inside of the shell might be a hot, suffocating and boring world,
 but the world beyond that shell is vast and filled with limitless possibilities.
"So far, your life has been spent only within a shell called Shannon.
 Aren\'t you making the mistake of thinking that your life will always continue like this?"
"That is...... ...
 ....................."
Shannon couldn\'t deny those words.
...She hadn\'t been able to find any concrete issues with her way of life,
 and since she\'d never had any desire or goal to change herself in any particular way, she had continued her life idly.
...And if she were asked whether her life was already fulfilled,
 ...she wouldn\'t necessarily have been able to nod......
That may have been a truth she was deliberately averting her eyes from.
...As long as George did not realize that truth, she would have continued pretending not to notice, as her real life slipped away, neglected, bit by bit...
"......George‐sama.
 ............Is it wrong for me to...
......continue...living this way?"
"It\'s wrong.
 Ah, and by the way, didn\'t you break one of the rules just now?"
George immediately gave a strict answer, and then broke out into a mischievous smile.
Shannon already knew what she was being chided for, ...and it seemed that it embarrassed her, as she hung her head.
"Didn\'t you promise not to use "sama" when the two of us are alone...?"
".........I, ......I can\'t obey that as a promise.
 .........But, if it was an order, I would have to obey it...
 Because I\'m............furniture."
"Then it\'s an order."
"Err,
 ...............yes.
 ......Certainly,
 ...George‐san."
As Shannon hung her head, her face red, she said George\'s name again, this time using "san"...
"Yes, that\'s better, Sayo‐chan."
A smile rose to George\'s face praising Shannon\'s, no, Sayo\'s small act of bravery.
The way they talked with each other gave off the sense that their relationship had already been ongoing for some time...
For a long while, as if the weather raging around them didn\'t even enter their consciousness,
 the two of them talked about the many memories they\'d built during their relationship that no one else knew about.
Every once in a while, a flash of lightning would attempt to dampen the mood, but it could not sully these moments, which seemed to flush even the roses outside a deeper shade of red...
"...............Oh, ...oh yes.
 ...I have...something I wanted to show you."
"......Wh‐......what could it be?"
George, who had been speaking eloquently, suddenly started to stutter.
{n}From his manner, Shannon too understood something.
George timidly searched through his pocket for it.
{n}It got caught deep in his pocket somehow, and came out somewhat slowly and awkwardly, in the same manner as his speech.
It was a very small box.
 A small box covered in a deep blue velvet.
...Its characteristic shape was enough to make anyone realize what was resting inside.
Shannon had been preparing her heart a little, sure of what it must be.
But even so, when she actually saw it, she couldn\'t avoid blushing once more...
George opened the small box, took it out...and held it out for Shannon to take.
"I want you to accept this."
"I, .........I can\'t accept something so valuable...!"
"......You can\'t accept it...?"
"Tha‐...that\'s not...
 I meant...
 .........Something like that...
...is too...
......goo‐good...for me........."
"Sayo.
 This is not a request.
 ......It\'s an order, okay?
 Accept this ring.
 ...Okay?"
"Ha......u...
 I, ......I can\'t...
......disobey an order..."
"Yes, that\'s right.
 ...Good girl."
Shannon, not wanting to show her bright red face, timidly accepted the ring from George\'s hand while still staring at the ground...
That ring wasn\'t a simple accessory.
......It was a noble object, which since ancient times was meant to be offered to a special woman, with a special meaning.
...So, while George could order her to take it, he could not order anything beyond that.
Anything beyond that would depend, not on an order, but on Shannon\'s, no, Sayo\'s own will.
"So, from here on it\'s no longer an order.
 .........Sayo.
 I want you to answer me tomorrow, without using words.
 ...............Do you understand?"
"...Err, ............h‐...how........."
"I won\'t order you any more, so this isn\'t an order.
 ......But a ring is something you put on your finger.
 ......If you like it, you can just put it on any finger that you choose."
Shannon had only pretended not to know.
{n}She had already understood what he wanted her to do.
{n}...But she was standing at a huge crossroads of her life...
"......Look how late it\'s gotten.
 Let\'s call it a night."
George faced away from Shannon, seeming slightly uncomfortable.
"It might be possible for me to order you to put it onto a finger of your left hand.
 You, too, might be timid and dependent enough to actually obey that kind of an order.
 ......But I want you to do this very last part of your own will, ...Sayo.
 ...You understand, right?"
"............Y‐
.........yes."
"So, ...that\'s my order.
 .........I want you to think about it well tonight and show me your answer tomorrow."
"....................."
Shannon nodded back.
......Today was the culmination of their long relationship.
{n}...This moment had not come as any surprise to Shannon...
".........We should be getting back to the guesthouse soon.
 If we take any longer, we\'ll make everyone worry about us."
"......Ah,
 ......err...
 ...I\'m sorry, I...!
 Um, I just remembered something I had to do in the mansion, so,
 ...um,
 ......I have to go back to the mansion..."
"Something this late?
 .........Really?"
George stared into Shannon\'s face as he laughed mischievously.
{n}He had seen through that obvious lie of Shannon\'s.
......But, imagining how she felt, it wasn\'t as if he couldn\'t understand her embarrassment and why she might ask to be alone.
And so George, having understood Shannon\'s lie and all that was behind it, allowed her to leave.Shannon entered the entrance hall to the mansion with a tottering gait.
Her chest was filled almost to bursting point with a mixture of exaltation and uncertainty that she couldn\'t easily describe.
After stopping for a second in front of the servant room to take a deep breath and calm her heart, she opened the door.
Inside, Gohda, who had been ordered to take the midnight shift at the mansion tonight, was absorbed in an old worn‐out crossword puzzle magazine.
He looked up for an instant to see whether one of the family had come, but when he realized that it was a fellow servant, he returned to his puzzle as if nothing had happened.
"......Umm,
 ...I was told by Genji‐sama to help you."
"Ah, really... That will be useful.
 I was just about to go make the rounds to close up the mansion, but I was in two minds whether I should leave this place empty.
 After all, the meeting Krauss‐sama and the others are conducting appears as though it will continue for quite some time.
 They might order some tea at any time."
"That\'s true...
 Then, what shall we do...? Should I remain here while—"
"In that case, Shannon‐san, sorry, but would you please make the rounds around the mansion?
 I will stay here, awaiting the family\'s orders."
"Ye‐......yes..."
...Shannon felt a twinge of annoyance.
Despite the fact that she had come here to help out as a favor, she was being forced to do the job of the person actually on duty as though it were natural.
Furthermore, after one‐sidedly forcing that task on her, Gohda had once again gone back to his magazine and had become immersed in his crossword puzzle.
For the time being, as a sign of respect for her elder, Shannon bowed her head, and she left the room to make the rounds.
Getting a little angry had enabled her to bring the airy sensation she had been feeling until now under control a bit.
Besides, she couldn\'t show this kind of face to Genji and Kanon.
{n}Until her heart was able to calm down, she wanted a little time to herself, and maybe going around the mansion wasn\'t such a bad way to do that...
From the dining hall, she began to hear the tumultuous voices of the family\'s discussion.
Someone would speak at great length, and would then be opposed by someone else.
 That rebuttal would continue in a very long, drawn‐out fashion, until opposed by yet another person.
That kept on repeating.
{n}It was as though their displeasure was seeping out through their voices.
She had been told to go to the guesthouse, so it would be bad if she was discovered by Krauss.
Thinking that, Shannon quick‐footedly slipped by the entrance to the dining hall.
Then, inside the mansion controlled by darkness, she began to check that the house was all closed up, following a prearranged route.
She walked down the hall, checking that each window was closed.
On Rokkenjima, there were no humans other than the family, so in actuality, closing up wasn\'t that terribly meaningful of a task.
Until Natsuhi had scolded them that this attitude was careless, closing up had not been customary in the Ushiromiya family.
The metal fixtures on the completely chilled windows were freezing, and every time she went to check on them, one‐by‐one, it felt like the glow in her heart seemed to cool down.
".....................?"
Just then, she thought she saw something flickering across the hall.
......Flickering?
{n}Something like that shouldn\'t be visible beyond the darkness of the hall...
Although she thought it was probably her eyes playing tricks on her, she killed her breathing for a brief moment,
 and, grasping a curtain, she fearfully gazed into the center of the hall......
However, other than the occasional crack of thunder brightening the hallway, she was unable to glimpse any flicker again.
......It must have been her imagination after all.
{n}Maybe because she couldn\'t calm her heart, she saw something that didn\'t even exist.
Shannon resumed checking the windows...
{n}However, in the back of her mind, a certain unnerving possibility had been resurrected.
...It was that which had been passed down amongst the servants who served the Ushiromiya main family—that ghost story.
In which the mansion had different masters of the day and the night.
 ...In which the master of the night, {f:5:Beatrice}, would sometimes fly around the mansion in the form of sparkling butterflies.
......Come to think of it, hadn\'t Kanon‐kun said that he had once seen it for himself......?
He got sulky when I didn\'t believe him and told him he was just seeing things...
.........Could it possibly...really...............?
{n}The roar of the thunder gave no answer...Genji once again tightened his bow tie, and looked outside through a crack in the curtains.
Maybe the rain had died down a tiny bit since the previous night.
{n}...But it didn\'t look like the thick rain‐clouds were planning to let any trace of the morning sun get by.
The morning was dim, and far from refreshing.
".........As expected, it doesn\'t seem that it will stop today..."
"My apologies for keeping you waiting, Genji‐sama."
Kanon finished checking his appearance, and exited the washroom.
{n}In a normal schedule, it was rare for anyone to have to suffer going straight from a midnight shift to a morning shift.
It was a special system, for just the two days of the family conference.
But then, as long as the typhoon didn\'t leave today, the relatives\' stay on this island would last until tomorrow.
Kanon thought that it was best to be prepared for the special schedule to be extended one more day.
The two of them left the guesthouse, opening their umbrellas.
{n}The rose garden had been devastated by the wind and rain last night.
Even though they had spent several days making it beautiful to welcome the guests, it had only taken one stormy night to ruin it.
Kanon sighed.
The two headed for the mansion.
{n}They were supposed to meet up with Gohda and prepare breakfast.
Gohda was such a perfectionist that he would undoubtedly have been up for some time already, and now be in the middle of preparing a breakfast both exquisite and as elegant as glasswork.
They reached the overhang by the entrance to the mansion, and folded up their umbrellas.
Genji took from his pocket a bundle of several keys, and used it to unlock the front door.
There was nothing on Rokkenjima outside the Ushiromiya family mansion, so there never used to be a custom of locking up.
However, Natsuhi had ordered that it be part of their duties to lock up the mansion from around midnight to early morning.
And unlocking in the early morning was to be done by the servants who had the morning shift.
Since Gohda would begin the preparations for breakfast as soon as he woke up, this task was to be undertaken by Genji and Kanon.
Silence had fallen in the mansion, giving the impression that the mansion itself was still asleep.
".........Well then, let us begin the morning chores."
"Yes."
The two of them split up and began opening the curtains throughout the mansion.
...If the curtains remained closed, the inside of the mansion would be unable to shake off its gloom, as if it hadn\'t yet managed to escape the previous night.
Kanon, following a well versed procedure, went around the mansion opening one window after another without having to retrace his steps once.
Even with this horrible weather, by opening the curtains, it began to feel just a little bit like morning.
While doing that, he passed in front of the kitchen.
...Even though he hadn\'t yet smelled anything, his empty stomach started aching in anticipation of the scent of Gohda\'s much bragged‐about cooking.
".........Good morning.
 ..................?"
He tried to greet Gohda, who he had thought would be preparing the meal inside the kitchen, but Gohda was nowhere to be seen.
The kitchen was darkly lit, and never mind the curtains, the ventilation fan wasn\'t even spinning.
It was still cold in the room, without a hint of a flame, and of course no preparations for breakfast were taking place.
...Although it must not be allowed to happen, maybe Gohda had overslept.
Servants are humans too.
{n}They can sometimes fail to wake up or something, and be late as a result.
...In the rare case of that happening, it was the virtue of a servant to casually smooth the situation over so as not to cause an unsightly scene,
 and to make sure that their masters never even notice that such a mistake happened in the first place.
Kanon took up the receiver of the phone fitted to the wall, and dialed the extension number for the room where the servants slept.
"........................?"
......He couldn\'t hear that characteristic sound of a dial tone.
Kanon tried picking up the receiver again, but even so, he couldn\'t hear the usual dial tone.
He tried dialing again, but it had no apparent effect.
......Could it be that the lightning last night had caused a mechanical fault and broken the internal telephone lines?
The equipment in this mansion was all worn out.
{n}Kanon fully understood that even the smallest thing could have caused it to break down.
Kanon gave up trying to wake him with the phone, and dashed off to the room where the servants slept.
...How long had she slept until? How long had it been since she had awoken and started lazily staring up at the ceiling?
......That vague sense of awakening was Natsuhi\'s usual morning experience.
Her sleep was always light, and she wouldn\'t even have been able to sleep at all without medicine.
{n}...To Natsuhi, sleeping was definitely not a happy thing.
When she looked outside, she saw that it was still pouring.
{n}If she hadn\'t sensed a tiny amount of light, she might have mistakenly thought that it was still last night.
...She herself was one of the hosts, so she mustn\'t wake up later than her guests.
Urging herself on, she raised up her body, which still hadn\'t completely recovered from yesterday\'s weariness.
While she was inside this room, no one would torment her.
{n}Her headache wouldn\'t get any worse than it already was.
{n}......This room was her only peaceful space.
So when she left, it meant returning to the world of her husbands\' siblings probing each others\' minds.
...Then wouldn\'t it be better to just stay locked up in this room forever...?
Natsuhi smiled bitterly at this fantasy.
{n}...She was starting to sound like Kinzo.
...Even though most of the time she would call Kinzo names for staying locked up in his own room and taking no notice of anyone, the truth was that she actually longed to do so herself.
......Natsuhi gave her head a small shake, and her fantasy was replaced by the reawakening of her usual headache.
When she reached for the doorknob, trying to leave the room, her hand touched the scorpion charm that she had hung from it before going to sleep the previous night.
......It was Maria\'s charm, that Jessica had given Natsuhi.
If she remembered correctly, Jessica had said something about it having the power to repel magic, and that she should hang it from her doorknob.
...Maybe it was thanks to the charm that at least this room had been protected from her husband\'s siblings\' malice.
......As she thought this, her mood began to get a little more cheerful.
"...............So perhaps it was thanks to Jessica...that I was able to get a little peaceful sleep..."
Then Natsuhi remembered.
{n}That\'s right, last night, I promised Jessica that I would give her a charm of my own in exchange for this one, didn\'t I?
Natsuhi opened a drawer of her dresser, and took out an antique accessory case that she had treasured ever since she was a child.
Inside, there were many small objects that Natsuhi had thought were valuable at the time.
From amidst those, she pulled out a red pouch.
{n}...Inside was a small, round mirror about ten centimeters across.
It looked quite old, but the design on the back of the mirror was very ornate, and it felt like something with historical value.
At the very least, it looked much more effective when compared to the other charm, which looked like a plastic scorpion key‐holder.
She had heard that this mirror was a spiritual mirror to ward off evil spirits, and she had been given it specially by her grandmother when her grandfather\'s mementos had been distributed.
It has been believed since ancient times that strange powers dwell within mirrors.
{n}Most likely, the way they reflect light created a belief that they also deflect misfortune and malice in the same way.
Natsuhi returned the mirror to its pouch.
{n}...It would probably be a fitting object to hand over to Jessica.
Just as she was placing it in her pocket, the sound of someone knocking on the door suddenly echoed throughout the room.
".........Yes?"
"Good morning, Madam. It is Genji.
 My apologies for waking you so early."
"......I am coming now.
 What is it?"
No servant had ever come to her this early in the morning, and especially not directly.
...Maybe something bad had happened.
{n}For example, maybe some fatal oversight had been made during the preparations for breakfast, and the household would be put to shame in front of the guests, or something.
...Natsuhi breathed out slowly, as if getting a headstart on the troubles she was surely about to be told of...
When she opened the door, Genji once again said a morning greeting to her while bowing deeply.
{n}Natsuhi tentatively responded.
".........Good morning.
 Did something happen?"
"My apologies.
 .........It seems that the telephones are out of order due to last night\'s lightning.
 ...The internal lines have gone dead, so please forgive my coming to see you directly."
"The internal lines have gone dead?
 That will be troublesome.
 Will it be possible to repair it?"
"......I am afraid that we don\'t know the location of the damage.
 I would like to call an expert and have him repair it."
"Which means that we will be unable to repair it until the typhoon has passed?
 ...In other words, the lines will be out of order for the remainder of our guests\' stay.
 ...Will there be issues with providing them proper service?"
"............We will do all we can to make sure there are none."
"Very well.
 ...I will be counting on you to ensure that everything goes smoothly."
Natsuhi let out a small sigh of relief.
She had been prepared for the worst,
 but a telephone breakdown wasn\'t the kind of trouble she was worried about.
...But then, even this would probably be enough to spark sarcasm from Eva.
Natsuhi gave her head a light shake.
"Are the preparations for breakfast proceeding well?"
"......About that, ...we haven\'t been able to find Gohda.
 The arrangements for breakfast have yet to be carried out..."
"What did you say?"
Natsuhi was indignant.
...To her, this was a much bigger problem than the phones not working.
And despite that, this piece of information was the part that had been postponed.
Why did everything go well most of the time, and then come to something like this when the relatives were visiting...
Natsuhi placed a hand to her forehead, and shook her head sharply.
"Most likely he is oversleeping.
 Anyway, it doesn\'t matter who does it, just hurry with preparing breakfast.
 ...............Wha—"
 Natsuhi had exited into the hall and turned around for a second to close the door to her room.
The unpleasant "thing" that she saw there silenced her completely.
...It was an unsettling sight, as if someone had dipped their fingers in a dark red liquid and clawed at the area around the doorknob.
As though someone had soaked both of their hands in blood and groped at the door and the knob—
like someone had wanted to stage something like that and left this mark as an awful prank.
"Wh‐
......what wicked mischief is this.........?
 How awful...!"
".........I also just noticed it as I came to call you.
 I will clean it later."
"...M‐...most likely,
 a vulgar joke by one of the guests.
 ......Disgusting, truly disgusting...!"
Who in the world would pull such a childish and disgusting prank!
Natsuhi had a pretty good idea, but of course there was no proof,
 so even if she pushed the issue, it would just seem as though she was making a fuss about nothing.
On the contrary, it would definitely be better for her to say she hadn\'t even noticed that such a prank had been played in the first place.
Natsuhi gave the order to have it cleaned, and headed off to the parlor with clacking heels.
When Natsuhi and Genji arrived in the parlor, Eva and Hideyoshi were already there.
".........Good morning, everyone."
"Mornin\', Natsuhi‐san.
 I heard Gohda‐san would be makin\' us breakfast too, isn\'t that right?
 My stomach\'s been gettin\' all excited since I woke up.
 Wahahaha."
"Yes, food is about the only thing worth looking forward to here, isn\'t it?
 *giggle* *giggle*."
".........You too, Eva‐san, I\'m pleased to hear that you are well this morning."
Natsuhi returned Eva\'s gaze, which was fiercely competitive even though it was early in the morning, with a weary expression.
Then Kanon jogged in.
After bowing in apology to the relatives for running inside the mansion, he approached Genji and told him something in a small voice.
"......Kanon.
 Have you still not found Gohda?"
".........My apologies, Madam.
 I went all around the inside of the mansion and the guesthouse,
 ...but, still..."
"Where in the world has he gone?
 ......For now, breakfast is a higher priority than finding Gohda.
 Quickly, take care of it."
".........Yes."
Kanon glanced at Genji.
{n}...It looked like he had something else to report, but needed to ask Genji whether he was the right person to say it.
...Genji nodded, and decided to give the report himself.
"............Madam.
 It is not only Gohda.
 ...Your husband is also nowhere to be found."
"My husband?"
"Yes.
 I thought I would report to him before you about the lack of preparation for breakfast, and visited his room, but I did not find him there.
 Furthermore, it was not only he who was missing.
 ......Rudolf‐sama and his wife, as well as Rosa‐sama, are nowhere to be found."
"Not even in the guesthouse?
 And not in the mansion?"
".........Yes.
 Nor are they in their rooms in the guesthouse."
When she had heard that Gohda alone was missing, she had thought that he might have slept in or was loafing around somewhere,
 but once she heard that several of the relatives were also missing, she began to start thinking a little more optimistically.
Last night\'s family conference might have continued all night, and in fact might still be going on.
It would then be imaginable that they had wanted to cool off their heads after being in that stuffy room,
 and had all gone off on a group walk through the rain.
...The part about "cooling off their heads" really sounded like something Krauss would like to say.
Probably, Gohda had been called to go with them to aid them with something.
Gohda was not a man who lost track of time.
{n}He had to have understood that, if he did not return, the preparations for breakfast would be hindered.
So perhaps, as much as he\'d like to leave, the atmosphere would not permit him to,
 and the conference was continuing in that manner even this very moment.
......Yes, Natsuhi thought this to be an extremely persuasive theory.
Natsuhi remembered the illusion that she had felt that morning of being sucked into a continuation of the previous night,
 ...and upon learning that the feeling wasn\'t just an illusion, she once again let out a deep, weary breath.
Because the banquet of the filthy vultures circling around Kinzo\'s property was still continuing.
"......Most likely, they are still repeating that same discussion about the inheritance somewhere in the garden, or maybe the beach.
 ...In any case, we must call Gohda back, or we will never be able to complete the preparations for breakfast."
"So what\'re you sayin\'?
 ...Are Nii‐san and the rest still continuin\' their discussion...?!"
She had thought she\'d spoken in a small voice, but Hideyoshi had overheard her, and managed to grasp the situation.
"Nii‐san and Rudolf sure are tough.
 And maybe it\'s just youth in Rosa\'s case?
 ......The two of us were so tired that we had to go back to bed just after midnight.
 I do remember that Nii‐san and the rest were still having a heated discussion at that point.
 ......Men sure are nasty when they get excited."
Natsuhi snorted, her face still blank.
"Kanon, search outside.
 If you find Gohda, tell him to return immediately and begin preparations for breakfast."
"......Certainly."
"Natsuhi nee‐san, they aren\'t necessarily outside, right?
 Couldn\'t they also be inside Father\'s study?"
"...Ah, sure, I could see that.
 I don\'t know what they\'ve been discussin\',
 but there\'s also a decent chance that they\'ve moved to Father\'s study and included him in the discussion."
"......I cannot imagine that Father would willingly invite that detestable topic into his study."
"You really think so?
 Well, then there\'s nothing we can do.
 I\'m sorry, Genji‐san, Kanon‐kun, but could you search outside?
 I\'m sure it wouldn\'t be odd for Nii‐san to propose that they go outside for a walk to cool their heads.
 Even in this weather."
"I will go to Father\'s study.
 After all, there\'s still some chance they\'ll be there, isn\'t there?"
"..................Eva‐san, a guest such as you mustn\'t trouble herself.
 I will go.
 I can also tell him good morning."
"Really, then I\'m counting on you, alright?
 But I somehow doubt whether he will return your greeting.
 Natsuhi nee‐san, were you on good terms with Father?"
".........I don\'t know whether it could be called good terms,
 but I am certain that I have gained his trust as the wife of the successor to the Ushiromiya family."
"Then I\'m sure that he will at least answer you, won\'t he?
 I want to at least eat breakfast with Father.
 I wonder if you could convince him to come down and join us?"
"......It seems that he thoroughly despises the rest of us, but I\'m sure if his {i:trusted} Natsuhi asks, he will surely listen."
"...If you can\'t convince Father after speaking to me so sharply, and have to come down by yourself.........
I doubt you\'ll ever again be able to say that you have gained his trust, will you...?
 *giggle*giggle*!"
"............I am not confident, but I will try."
Natsuhi responded, discouraged.
{n}However, knowing Kinzo\'s temperament, she had absolutely no confidence in her ability to bring him out.
...Eva herself was treating it like a joke, expecting that it couldn\'t be done.
But even so, Natsuhi would lose face if she gave up, said it was impossible for her, and let Eva go instead...
Eva\'s mean‐spirited and unreasonable demand caused Natsuhi\'s tightly clenched fist to shake.
...When Genji realized this, he softly spoke to her over her shoulder.
"......Madam.
 If you would, please take this."
"Is that...?"
Genji handed Natsuhi a sparkling gold key of ornate design.
{n}It was the key to Kinzo\'s study.
The study would always lock itself, and couldn\'t be unlocked as long as Kinzo forbade entrance.
However, since Genji was especially trusted by Kinzo, he was allowed to carry a key to that door...
"But, if this key is used, won\'t you also receive the blame...?"
"......When the Master is sleeping deeply, simple knocking on the door may not reach his ears."
"...And when persuading the Master to leave his room, it would be more difficult if you must talk through the door.
 Please use it..."
"......Genji..."
Until now, Natsuhi had thought of Genji as a cold servant who worked directly under Kinzo, and would never work for her.
But it looked like she would have to alter her understanding of him...
She wanted to communicate her feelings of thanks, but by then, Genji had already turned his back on her, and was walking down the corridor with Kanon.
...But as Natsuhi watched them go, the words that reached her from behind were sneering.
"Be sure you bring Father with you, then, okay?
 After all, it\'s his son\'s darling wife who\'s asking. I\'m sure he\'ll listen to you.
 *giggle*giggle*.
 We are guests, so let us leisurely relax here."
"Quit it, Eva, you\'re talkin\' too much.
 Sorry, but Natsuhi nee‐san, we\'ll leave Father to you..."
Natsuhi left without replying, at a swift pace, her heels clacking loudly with every step.
After all that excitement the previous night, there was no way anyone was going to wake up soon.
George‐aniki, Jessica and I were snoring loudly on the bed in the cousins\' room.
But Maria, who didn\'t join in, and who had gone straight to bed the previous night, suddenly and completely opened her eyes.
"......................................."
As she rubbed her sleepy eyes and looked around, the loud snoring coming from the three cousins continued.
...For a while, Maria had to think about what had happened.
After that, she realized that her mother was not with her, and quickly got lonely.
Maria left the cousins\' room, trying to head to the room that had been arranged for her and her mother.
Paying no heed to the three who were sleeping soundly, she made a loud slamming sound on the way out.
In response, Battler mumbled and rolled over in his sleep, but it wasn\'t enough to wake him up.
After a while, Maria returned, once again opening the door with a lively bang.
"..................Uu."
When she had left the room, her face had been sleepy, but after returning, she now looked discontent.
After that, she climbed up on Battler\'s bed, which happened to be the closest, and started yelling and jumping on it like it was a trampoline.
"Uu‐uu‐uu!!
 Waaake uuup!!
 Uu‐uu‐uu!!"
"Waaa, what, what?!
 Is it a raid?!
 Surround themmmm!!"
After making sure that I was awake, Maria jumped over onto George‐aniki\'s bed and started bouncing on that too.
...In that manner, the three of us were all greeted with an extremely pleasant awakening.
"Thanks, Maria‐chan, for waking us up.
 You stopped us from sleeping in after that late night..."
"...But it would have been perfect if you could have just been a little more gentle..."
"...George nii‐san, you really are an adult, I respect that..."
"It\'s almost seven...
 Well, not really a bad time to wake up.
 *yaaawn*."
"Uu!
 Mama\'s not heeere!
 Uu‐uu‐uu!"
"Auntie Rosa?
 She wasn\'t in her room?
 I wonder if she has already woken up and gone to the mansion."
"She\'s—not—heeere!!
 Uu‐uu!
 Uu!
 Mammaa!
 Uu‐uu‐uu!!"
Maria kept groaning "uu‐uu" and looking unhappy.
{n}It seemed like she wasn\'t simply lonely because she couldn\'t find her mother, but actually unhappy because her mother wasn\'t in the place she thought she was, and this made her feel like she\'d been tricked.
If we could have just told her where her mother was, that might have been enough to satisfy her,
 but unfortunately, as long as we were here, we had no way of finding that out.
"It\'s time to go for breakfast anyway, so let\'s head over to the mansion."
"Good idea.
 Maria, let\'s go to the mansion together, okay?
 I\'m sure Auntie Rosa will be over there too."
"Uu?
 Mama\'s in the mansion?
 Then I\'ll go.
 Uu."
"That\'s right, let\'s go to the mansion.
 Our parents have probably already gone there."
Maria regained her usual composure, as though her earlier temper had never happened.
We got dressed, left the room, and headed for the mansion.
The door to the study was once again knocked upon.
 But there was no answer.
...He was still sleeping, and she couldn\'t wake him.
 ...If she returned downstairs saying something like that, Eva would be very amused and triumphant.
And even aside from the whole Eva issue, there was the problem that yesterday, during this once‐a‐year family conference, he had stayed locked up all day, and had still not come out to greet the guests.
...Even though he was the head—no, especially because he was the head—he couldn\'t fail to make an appearance.
...Could she convince him?
{n}Natsuhi readied herself, and, using the key that she had borrowed from Genji, opened the door...
A sweet stench that seemed to eat into her brain poured from the narrow opening she had created, and though she was prepared for it, she couldn\'t help but grimace.
Thinking that he might still be sleeping, Natsuhi entered the room quietly...
When she did, Kinzo, already awake, was looking down out of the window.
"S‐......so you\'re awake...
 Good morning..."
"..................How did you get in?"
Kinzo spoke with his back still facing her.
His voice was not harsh, but calm, and Natsuhi was slightly reassured.
...However, he was at least in a bad enough mood that he had ignored the sound of all of that knocking even though he had been awake.
Natsuhi wasn\'t able to break the tension.
"......My sincere apologies.
 I asked Genji‐san, and he allowed me to borrow the key to the study..."
"Hoh...
 Genji did?
 .........If my friend thought it was that important, then I have no choice but to listen.
 Tell me, ...what business do you have?"
"Y‐yes...
 .........Breakfast will soon be prepared, and I would greatly appreciate it if you would join us..."
"I will eat here.
 Have it brought here like always."
"But Father...
 This is the annual family conference.
 Please, at least let them see your face."
".........You ask me to go downstairs,
 and join in on the discussion of how my inheritance is to be chewed apart after I die?
 How foolish."
".........They can keep talking about that kind of thing as much as they like without me.
 And if that\'s what you call a family conference, it\'s nothing so important that I should leave my room for it.
 I am busy.
 Do not bother me."
With his last words came the threat that any further questions would be useless.
...Natsuhi realized that adding any further pleas would finally bring his wrath down upon her.
It would be annoying to hear Eva sarcastically say that she hadn\'t been able to convince him after all, but there was nothing more Natsuhi could do...
".........Is that so......?
 ...Understood......
 I am sure that everyone will be sorry to hear it, but I will tell them."
Natsuhi decided to give up.
{n}Bowing silently, she made to leave the room before Kinzo\'s spasmodic temper could fire up.
As she did, Kinzo called out to her.
......Compared to the usual Kinzo, this voice was calm and gentle, like it came from another person.
"......Natsuhi.
 ...It has been quite some time since you married into the Ushiromiya family."
"Y‐......yes.
 ...It has been a while since I was first permitted to bear the name Ushiromiya."
"......Do you sometimes long for your previous family?"
"...............No.
 ...Marriage means throwing away your parents\' family.
 I am Ushiromiya Natsuhi.
 If I have a family to return to, or to reminisce over, it is only the Ushiromiya family."
It was definitely not an exaggeration.
{n}Such was the level of Natsuhi\'s resolve in calling herself an Ushiromiya.
......That was why she was so sorrowful that, despite all of her effort, it had been fruitless and she was not even accepted by her husband.
".........If Krauss had been a woman,
 ...and you had been the husband...
 ............No, ...I won\'t say that."
"Wh‐......what do you mean by that,
 ...Father?"
Natsuhi was shocked.
{n}......If Kinzo\'s words just now had been meant literally...
.........They would have been more than enough to make up for all she had suffered up to that point.
"...............Forget it.
 It\'s just the nonsense of an old man."
Kinzo once again faced away from her.
{n}...He had told her to forget it, but Natsuhi couldn\'t help feeling a warmth in her heart...
"...Father.
 ............Even though I am not connected to you by blood, I am still your daughter.
 .........The honor and glory of the Ushiromiya family,
 ...and everything that you have left,
 ......I guarantee you, I will see it protected myself......!"
"..................You do not have the qualifications to wear the One‐winged Eagle.
 ...However, the One‐winged Eagle is surely engraved in your heart.
 .........In that case, you are unmistakably my blood relative, and one who will inherit the glory of the Ushiromiya family."
"............Some will sneer that there is no eagle on your clothes.
 However, that is nothing to lend an ear to.
 ...Only those who hold the eagle in their hearts are my true blood relatives.
 ............I now believe it an honor that I was able to welcome you into the Ushiromiya family..."
Without saying anything more, Kinzo remained with his back to Natsuhi.
However, Natsuhi couldn\'t help but feel something warm well up inside her that she hadn\'t felt since long ago, when she had been just a child...
Natsuhi bowed silently to his back and left the room...
"...Ah, what perfect timing.
 How is Father?
 You were taking so long, I came to check, you see?"
When Natsuhi left the study, she saw Eva climbing the stairs, and their eyes met.
Eva was smirking unpleasantly, thinking that Natsuhi had just left the room trudgingly after failing to convince Kinzo.
However, the way Natsuhi was now, such a frivolous laugh would not disturb her.
......She was not permitted to wear the family crest on her clothing.
{n}.........But she was permitted to wear it in her heart.
So she spoke calmly, clearly, ...and confidently, with the dignity of the one who would protect the glory of the Ushiromiya family.
"Father said that he would not join in on the family conference.
 He says that he has no interest in such an obscene topic."
"...Yes, yes, excuses, excuses.
 If you weren\'t able to persuade Father, say so frankly."
"......How pitiful.
 I\'m beginning to understand Father\'s feelings of regret."
"Wha‐......what do you mean by that...?"
Natsuhi did not answer.
Just as Kinzo had done earlier, she showed Eva her back as she headed down the stairs.
Struggling to gather what had happened, Eva could only determine that she had been made fun of, and that something had happened to quickly bolster Natsuhi\'s confidence.
Even so, she didn\'t have the courage to risk Kinzo\'s wrath.
Unable to even knock on the door, she could only scratch at the air in front of it, cluck her tongue, and follow after Natsuhi.
"S‐so, were Nii‐san and the rest there?
 Did Father tell you about them?"
"......I didn\'t get the chance to ask, but they were not inside the study.
 ...Father would never let them into his room to discuss such a lowly topic, so it is unlikely that he knows where they went.
 Let us go downstairs and wait for the servants to return from their search."
"...Breakfast may be late, but how about some tea, Eva‐san?"
"......I, ...I will be fine."
Eva couldn\'t hide her confusion over the complete difference in Natsuhi\'s demeanor.
...She was acting so boldly, and while Eva hated to admit it, she even had a sense of dignity about her.
Unable to find fault with anything, she could only follow Natsuhi back to the parlor.
When the two of them returned to the parlor, not only Hideyoshi, but the four children and Nanjo as well had gathered there.
Genji, who had been talking with Hideyoshi, reported the current situation when he noticed that Natsuhi had returned.
"You still have not found my husband and the rest?"
"......Yes, my apologies.
 ......Also, Kumasawa has begun the preparations for breakfast.
 She said that she will need just a little longer."
The clock read a little past 8 a.m.
Eight o\'clock was the time that breakfast was supposed to have started.
{n}The mere fact that the hosts had gone over that time limit was a disgrace under normal circumstances.
"......Kanon is now searching outside.
 ...Furthermore, no one has seen Shannon."
"Even Shannon?
 .........Honestly, how many people has my husband taken on this walk of his?"
How many people couldn\'t be found?
With the number of people having grown so large, it was starting to feel truly unpleasant, as though they were the only ones being left out on something interesting.
At the very least it looked like the children, no, Maria especially felt the same way.
She was indignant, her stomach grumbling, almost as though her mother and the others had left her alone to go off and eat something delicious without her.
Trying to fix her bad mood, the other children were flipping through the channels on the television, trying to find a program that might interest Maria.
Nanjo was sitting on the sofa, gazing blissfully at the children while reading a book.
 No doubt it was a book about chess.
The sound of footsteps came rushing towards them with a pitter‐patter.
{n}There was only one set, so they realized before they saw the source that it was not Krauss and the rest, but probably Kanon.
"............Madam, excuse me."
"Judging by your appearance, you still haven\'t been able to find them."
"...My apologies.
 I still—"
"That will be enough.
 You\'ve worked hard."
She didn\'t know where they were, but they had to be somewhere on this island.
{n}They hadn\'t put anything in their mouths since last night, so their stomachs must be growling about now.
They would surely saunter in any time now.
...Natsuhi was already dumbfounded, and she had begun to think that there was no urgent need to find them right then.
"I will go to the kitchen to prepare some tea for all of the guests.
 Thanks to both of you for all of your hard work so early in the morning."
Natsuhi, acting as though the release in tension had caused a new surge in her headache, left the parlor.
...Kanon tried to call her as she left, but Natsuhi departed swiftly.
"............What is it?
 Was there something else?"
".........Yes.
 ...I was unable to find her husband or anyone else, but,
 .........ummm."
Kanon sounded evasive.
{n}He still didn\'t know where they were, but maybe he had found something with some relation to that.
When Eva and Hideyoshi noticed this exchange of words, they came over.
{n}They had probably noticed the slightly strange way Kanon was acting.
"What\'s goin\' on, Kanon‐kun?
 Did you find Krauss nii‐san and the others?"
"......Actually...
 Something looked odd about the rose garden storehouse."
"............Something looked odd...?
 What do you mean by that?"
"......It was, um,
 .........how should I explain it..."
Kanon once again hesitated.
{n}...He wasn\'t speaking anything like you\'d expect from the usually fearless Kanon.
Eva and Hideyoshi exchanged quizzical looks at this display...
"What do you mean?
 You don\'t mean to say they\'re inside the storehouse?"
"No, ...I am going to inspect the inside now.
 I was just returning to get the key, but...
 ......Umm..."
"I don\'t really get it, but it sounds like we just gotta investigate inside, right?
 Where\'s the key to that storehouse?"
".........It is in the servant room.
 Let us check inside the storehouse immediately."
Kanon dashed off to the servant room and returned with the key.
Genji left the parlor, saying that he would go check, but Eva and Hideyoshi also followed.
...What was this "something odd about the storehouse" that had caused the usually fearless Kanon to hesitate?
It was still pouring outside, but their curiosity over this "something" that Kanon couldn\'t talk about won out.
While the children made a big fuss watching television, Kanon and the rest dashed off to the entrance...
The rose garden storehouse was a place that housed various tools used to manage the garden.
It was definitely not a pretty building.
{n}Because of its appearance, it had been built hidden in a corner of the rose garden.
Kanon, Genji, Eva, and Hideyoshi came cutting across the rose garden holding umbrellas.
They entered a small path just off the rose garden, which was not used by those simply appreciating the garden, but only by those maintaining it.
As they dashed further along it, the front of the storehouse came into view.
It was a very old shed of a storehouse, and compared to the flawlessly perfect beauty of the rose garden, it was pretty seedy‐looking.
 It was easy to understand why it had been built in a hard‐to‐see place.
Eva and Hideyoshi arrived at the storehouse long after Kanon and Genji.
"Hah...
hah...
 You two sure are fast...!
 I thought my heart was gonna explode..."
"I guess they did build a storehouse over here.
 .........bu—
wha‐
......what is that...?"
When Eva looked at where Kanon was pointing, she was at a loss for words.
{n}Noticing this, Hideyoshi also followed Kanon\'s finger and was likewise too shocked to speak.
The entrance to the storehouse was a kind of shutter.
 ......And there, .........
......Everyone there now understood why Kanon had been unable to find words that could describe what he saw.
On the shutter, which was completely filthy from being exposed to wind and rain for so long,
 ......plastered on it...
 ......Something that looked like a strange dark red...liquid?
 Mucus?
 Or maybe it was some sticky paint...
 ...Some kind of ghastly substance...had been used to draw an indescribably eerie shape.
The rain had caused it to drip down in several places, like fresh blood leaking from an open wound...
There was no longer any point in being choosy with words.
......A ghastly dark red substance meant to look like blood...
...had been used to draw some kind of figure or mark,
 ...intended to suggest something ominous.
...Two concentric circles were drawn there, and inside them was a design that looked like a cross.
The four ends of the cross were widely exaggerated, and it looked like some kind of crest from somewhere around Europe.
And in the cracks between these shapes, written closely packed together, were some unfamiliar characters,
 or possibly symbols......
".........What a vulgar bit of graffiti...
 ......Could this be...one of those?
 One of those magic circles used in demonic rituals?!"
With reference to this ghastly shape, drawn with a deep‐red, dripping substance, Hideyoshi\'s comparison was not unreasonable.
"When was this drawn...?!"
"......Last night, I came here before it started raining, but there was nothing drawn here at that time."
"............We must do something before anyone else sees this.
 If they laid eyes upon it, it would cause them great discomfort......"
"That\'s right...
 Even though it\'s just a shed, I don\'t want to leave such an unpleasant scribble untouched for even one second."
"There is some paint inside the storehouse.
 Let us paint over it temporarily as an emergency measure,
 then repaint it again someday when the weather is good.
 .............................."
Genji remembered that he had just recently seen another piece of graffiti, and that it too had been made with a strange, dark red substance of the same color as this...
.........That must have been...
 .........That\'s right, he had seen it on the door to Natsuhi\'s room...
"Kanon‐kun.
 Let\'s remove this graffiti quickly and return, alright?
 Even though it\'s just a storehouse, it\'s really irritating to have graffiti around the home I was brought up in."
"......Yes.
 I will take care of it immediately..."
Kanon squatted in front of the shutter and unlocked it.
{n}He then lifted it up with all of his strength.
A boisterous noise resounded, and the eerie shape drawn on the shutter began to get sucked in through the top as the shutter was raised.
...At least for the time being, that ominous thing disappeared from their direct gaze, and they all breathed a sigh of relief...
Thanks to a kids\' program that they had come across, Maria was feeling much better.
Battler and Jessica were making fun of the kids\' program at every turn, cackling.
George was enjoying the program along with Maria.
Nanjo sat on a sofa by himself, passing the time by reading quietly.
They heard hurried footsteps coming from the hallway.
They were footsteps from a single person.
...Did that mean that it wasn\'t the group of four that had just left?
Genji was the one who had returned.
It was very rare for Genji, who considered being out of breath a violation of a servant\'s virtues,
 to be gasping for air.
He had probably come dashing back from outside the mansion.
{n}His shoulders were soaking wet, and he didn\'t have his usual smart appearance.
When Genji noticed Nanjo looking at him, he gave a small, silent bow and quickly approached him.
".........Doctor Nanjo, my apologies.
 Please, come with me, quickly."
"Wh‐
.........what has happened?"
As Genji whispered something into Nanjo\'s ear, Nanjo\'s face changed color.
He stood from the sofa, trying not to be noticed by the children who were still engrossed by the TV,
 and the two of them rapidly left the parlor, muffling their footsteps.
Just as they were leaving the parlor, they came across Natsuhi, who was pushing a serving cart loaded with a tea set.
Genji whispered something into Natsuhi\'s ear, and Natsuhi\'s face too changed color, shocked.
...Then, leaving the serving cart where it was, the three of them started dashing towards the entrance...
George noticed them running down the rose garden through the window.
"......What\'s this?
 Genji‐san and Doctor Nanjo and,
 ......and that\'s Aunt Natsuhi, isn\'t it?"
"What\'s up, Aniki?"
".........Maybe something has happened.
 They looked horribly flustered."
Jessica and Maria also realized that something had happened from the fact that Eva, Hideyoshi and Nanjo were no longer in their seats,
 and because the serving cart had been abandoned at the entrance to the parlor.
"Could there have been some kind of accident...?"
"...Let\'s go check it out.
 It\'s no fun if we\'re the only ones left out, right?
 Ihihi!"
For some reason, what Battler said sounded extremely indiscreet.
...But they couldn\'t deny that they were a little insecure and concerned after seeing the adults run off into the rain disregarding their appearance.
"......Let\'s check it out, alright?
 I need to know what\'s happened..."
Jessica\'s insecure words spoke for all of them.
"Hey Maria, are you coming too?
 Or will you watch TV?"
"Uu!
 I want TV!
 Uuu."
"Then the rest of us will go by ourselves.
 Maria‐chan, we\'ll be back soon.
 Stay here watching TV."
"Uu!"
By the time the kids went outside, they had lost sight of the adults, who had left earlier.
But it looked like Jessica had a pretty good idea of where they had gone from the direction they had been running.
Following Jessica, they ran through the rain‐soaked rose garden...
It felt like the wind suddenly got stronger.
{n}...The malicious sound of thunder began to ring out like it had the previous night.
It felt like something eerie had surrounded the island, and was trying to stop them from moving forward.
"Jessica, what\'s over this way?!"
"I\'m pretty sure there\'s a storehouse for gardening tools or something."
"What in the world could there be in a place like that..."
Just as Jessica had said, a storehouse came into view in front of them.
{n}They could also see the adults there.
The shutter to the storehouse was open, and several of the adults looked as though they were searching for something.
For some reason, only Natsuhi was outside the storehouse, not even holding an umbrella; she was facing away from them, and it looked like she was hanging her head...
The ones who had just left—Genji, Nanjo, Natsuhi—
and the ones who had left before them—Kanon, Eva, and Hideyoshi—made this a large gathering of people, but there was absolutely no bustle of activity.
When Natsuhi realized that the children had come, a terrible expression rose to her face, and she ran at them with her arms spread wide.
"Don\'t come over here!!!
 Go back to the mansion!!"
......However,
 ...no,
 because of that,
 the kids saw that scene which Natsuhi was trying to keep them away from.
Inside the storehouse with the shutter wide open, a flickering fluorescent light shone down.
 And over there, ......
"KyaaaaaAAAAAAaaaaaAAaa!!!"
Jessica\'s piercing shriek rang out.
...But that was just because Jessica\'s scream was the loudest.
 ...The same thing spilled out of Battler and George\'s mouths as well...
Eva, just like Natsuhi, spread her arms, and with a terrible expression roared at the kids.
"George, take everyone and return to the mansion!!!
 Quickly!!
 Right now!!"
When Natsuhi had spread her arms, one might have thought that she was trying to prevent them from advancing any further.
...However, right now, that wasn\'t why Eva was spreading her arms.
...She was trying to hide that terrible scene from the kids.
It was her mother\'s heart, trying to protect the eyes and hearts of us children by attempting to block our view of that terrible scene by at least the width of one of her arms!
"......Is this some kind of joke? Is it...?!"
...I had seen this kind of cheap scene all too often.
{n}In manga, TV, anime, and movies, I had seen it over and over again...
This was just, just seeing something appear in real life that I had seen plenty of times before in some of those more sensational movies, wasn\'t it...?!!
That alone shouldn\'t...
 Aaaaah,
 but that, that suit,
 ...it\'s that old bastard\'s, isn\'t it...?
 I get it, then that\'s Uncle Krauss...
 And Kyrie‐san, and Auntie Rosa, uwooOOOOOOoooooOOo!!!
"Dad, DAD!!!"
"You mustn\'t, Jessica!!
 You mustn\'t go in!!
 You mustn\'t look!!!"
"Dad, Dad!!
 HyyaaaaaAAAAAAa!!!"
".........Rigor mortis has set in across the entire body...
 ......Probably,
 at least six hours have passed since death...
 As far as I can tell by looking at the damaged area, there is a high probability that they were damaged after their deaths..."
"......No, I must watch what I say...!
 I\'m a general practitioner...examining corpses is outside my area of expertise...!"
"......So what does that mean?
 Just killin\' them wasn\'t enough, ...so they went on to do somethin\' like this?!!
 The devil, this here\'s the work of the devil!!"
Aunt Natsuhi caught Jessica in her arms and Auntie Eva caught George‐aniki,
 ......so I was the only one who could approach the entrance to the storehouse.
............Aah,
 ...if only there had been someone here to catch me too,
 ......I wouldn\'t have needed to have this horrible, evil scene burned into my eyes...
......No, that\'s not it.
...I\'m standing here, not because the people who would catch me aren\'t here...
 {i:but because the people who would catch me are right there!!}
...Just as Jessica had said, it did look like a storehouse used to keep gardening tools.
A lawn mower and its replacement blades,
 a grass sickle and a hammer,
 a saw and some construction tools...
 Piled up potted plants and bags of fertilizer.
And treated just the same, the corpses of several people had been laid to rest there.
 No, had been thrown in there!
I could tell them by their clothes.
......That old bastard and Kyrie‐san.
 ...Uncle Krauss and Auntie Rosa.
 ......Further back, ...Gohda‐san and...
there\'s still more of them?
 How many people died...
 ......Fucking hell, I can\'t even count them on one hand, god fucking dammit!!!!!!!
I didn\'t know whether it had been one of these gardening tools, which if used for something other than their intended purpose could definitely be wielded with a naked brutality,
 or whether some horrible tool had been brought in here specifically for this.
......Whatever the case,
 .........the bodies lying about here, each of them had been given an atrocious makeover.
...This isn\'t a damn makeover...this is more like...
"their faces have been plowed"...!
 Their faces were smashed, forced into an expression that a normal person couldn\'t make even after death.
 ...I couldn\'t tell where the eyes or the nose were, but I could find the mouth...because it was gaping wide, the ridges of the teeth exposed!
But the front teeth were missing, and even the cheek that should have covered that was all torn up and exposed!
 The stylish makeup that he spent way too much time fussing over for a guy...is no help at all...!!
"...UwooooOOOOoooooooohh!!!
 Daaaaaaaaaaad!!
 Sure, I always thought you were going to hell!"
"But you weren\'t this bad, right?
 You weren\'t such a son of a bitch to have this done to you!!
 And Kyrie‐san,
 ......didn\'t I tell you to stop going out with this guy...
 ...There was no reason...
...for you to go through this as well......"
"...There\'s no face... There\'s no fucking face...
 Shit shit shit shit, hiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!!!"
"......Battler‐san, you mustn\'t look any more...
 There\'s no way that your mother and father would want you to see them like this...!
 For your mother and your father\'s sakes, ...you mustn\'t look any more!!"
"Dead people are supposed to have faces that look like they\'re sleeping peacefully, aren\'t they?!
 There\'s no face, my dad and Kyrie‐san have no faces!!
 I don\'t even know what kind of faces they were wearing when they died!!"
"What the hell am I meant to do?!
 Are you telling me I have to see these mangled monstrous faces every time I remember Dad and the rest?!
 Well that\'s perfect,
 \'cause I didn\'t even want to remember that old bastard\'s smug face anyway, this is perfect, perfect!!
"
"But you know, why Kyrie‐san\'s face as well...?
 Kyrie‐san wasn\'t a bastard...
 ...I sometimes got a little sick of her, but...
she was a little cool, just like a big sister to me......"
"......She didn\'t deserve this...
 She didn\'t deserve this......!!
 At least Uncle Krauss is better, isn\'t he?!!
 It\'s not his whole face, just the side!!
 He at least has half of his fucking face left!!
 Better that than this, better that than this!!"
"NooooooooooooooooooOOOOOOOOOOooooooooooooooooooOOOOOooooo!!!"
Trying to shut out my reckless words, Jessica tried to fill her ears with the sound of her own screaming.
"...Stop it, Battler‐kun...!
 Just stop it...just stop it......!"
"Aniki, Aniki!!
 UoooOoooOOOooooooooo!!!"
Disregarding age and appearance,
 ......I fell to my knees, clinging to Aniki\'s waist and sobbing.
It was as if I was crying on behalf of everyone there...
Representing the feelings of everyone there, I screamed over and over......
"...............Father...
 .........The ones who d—
 .........who are lying over there are...
Uncle Krauss, Uncle Rudolf, Auntie Kyrie,
 Auntie Rosa, Gohda‐san...
 ...............Five people...?"
"............No.
 ......Six.
 ......There\'s...
one more here..."
The body that Hideyoshi was looking down on now...was hidden in the shadow of a mountain of random objects,
 in a blind spot to George, who stood by the entrance.
...So George couldn\'t tell...whose body it was......
...Therefore, .........George cursed himself.
{n}He cursed that part of himself that imagines the worst......and is always right...!
"...So,
 ......the one lying at your feet is...
.........Sha‐
...Shannon, isn\'t it.........?"
".........Yes.
 ......It\'s Shannon‐chan."
"....................."
George was completely silent.
 ......He shook slightly, his lower lip trembling...
He wanted to run up to his beloved, screaming and crying.
...But, .........before rashly running up to her,
 ......he mustered up all of his strength, and asked his father.
"......Is Shannon also...
......the same as...
.........Uncle Krauss and the others?"
"................................."
Hideyoshi deeply understood the meaning of those words.
{n}...So he couldn\'t give George a quick answer.
......No, ......he thought that, to George right now, that was the only possible sincere and loving response.
When George had asked whether she was the same,
 ...he had meant to ask whether her corpse was the same as the others.
......Since Hideyoshi hadn\'t denied it,
 .........it meant that the body was just as horrible.
"............Can I...
...look at Shannon.........?"
".....................No,
 .........you can\'t."
"......Why...?
 After all, ......I won\'t be able to see Shannon\'s face again, right...?
 So, ......why can\'t I see...
...her last face......?"
"......The last time you met Shannon‐chan was yesterday?"
".........Yes."
"I see...
 .........When you left her,
 what kind of face was she showin\' you...?"
".................................
It was a wonderful smile."
After receiving the ring,
 ......she was bewildered even though her heart should have been decided,
 bashful,
 ...and so embarrassed to show him that face that she ran away...
 ...That expression was revived in George\'s mind...
"............I see.
 ......Then, I\'m sure Shannon‐chan......would also have wished to leave you with that smile."
...Hideyoshi looked down upon Shannon\'s body lying at his feet.
{n}.........Just like the other bodies, it was in such a horrible state that it would make anyone want to cover their eyes.
......Half of the face had been smashed off, and no more than half of her expression remained.
.........If that remaining half, soaked red with blood,
 had been wiped clean, that graceful smiling face might have peeked out.
 .........Only half of it......
Without thinking, Hideyoshi slapped his hand over his eyes.
{n}......How cruel...
If only all of it had been crushed, if they were going to crush it; then he might have been able to deceive George\'s heart for a while by saying that it was just someone else wearing Shannon\'s clothes.
Yet, they had left half of the face...!
It caused the body so much humiliation, ......and also made it clear that this body was none other than Shannon!
 How inhuman, how monstrous...
There at Hideyoshi\'s feet, trying his best to burn the image of the remaining half of Shannon\'s expression into his eyes, was Kanon.
......Kanon was not crying.
{n}...Tears had risen to his eyes, but they did not drip down.
But that didn\'t mean that he wasn\'t feeling as much sadness as everyone else.
......Losing Shannon, who had lived with him in the Gospel House,
 whom he had loved as a sister,
 must have been just the same as losing a blood relative...
"............George.
 ......I\'m sure Shannon‐chan...
would be grateful...
 She wouldn\'t want you to see her like this.
 .........I\'m sure...
...she\'d be thankin\' you for stayin\' strong..."
"......I understand.
 .........I understand, Father, ......I understand......"
George leaned against the outside wall of the storehouse, ...sinking down powerlessly.
".........Father.
 ......I have a request."
"What is it......?"
"......I want you to look for me.
 ...............On Shannon\'s finger,
 .........is there a ring...?"
"...A ring......?
 ......Let me see..."
Hideyoshi crouched down.
{n}...As he did, Kanon silently pointed to one of Shannon\'s hands.
"............Yeah,
 ......there is.
 It\'s a diamond ring.
 And not a chip diamond.
 ...Must have been pretty expensive..."
"And,
 ...............which hand,
 which finger is it on?"
"......Hmm,
 the ring finger of her left hand.
 ......I see...
 ......So Shannon‐chan...
was engaged..."
"...............George...
 ......You...couldn\'t have—"
"Eva!!
 Right now that doesn\'t matter!!
 A man made a lifelong promise to Shannon‐chan...!
 A man promised her happiness for life...
 It doesn\'t matter who it was!"
"Being told that by a man...
 ......It\'s a woman\'s dream, isn\'t it...?
 ...I don\'t know when she received this ring.
 I also don\'t know who gave it to her!
 But,
 .........even so, Shannon‐chan took this ring."
"And, ...she accepted it, and put it on her left ring finger.
 ...I\'m sure the man who gave it to her...
was happy too."
To most of the people there, Hideyoshi was simply disturbed by this extraordinary situation and was blurting out strange things.
.........But...
...to those who really knew the truth...
about George and Shannon\'s relationship,
 ......everything he said made sense.
"............I see.
 .........Thank you,
 ............Father."
George stood up.
 The traces of tears still streaked his face, but his expression had returned to its usual calm...
"......Let\'s go.
 Battler‐kun, Jessica‐chan.
 ......If we stay here any longer, we\'ll get in the way of the adults."
"............*sniff*
 .........You\'re right..."
Jessica sniffled once, and, trying to say that she was alright, she showed her face to her mother, who had been holding her the whole time.
...When she faced George again, she once again had on her usual face.
......Although she still couldn\'t recover her smile.
"......Battler...
 Don\'t lose heart........."
Battler kept on crouching in front of his parents\' bodies...
"........................I\'m sorry.
 ...It took this much crying to calm me down...
 You bastard, Dad, ...I bet you\'re laughing at me, always talking shit about you,
 then crying like a baby just \'cause you died."
"......It\'s not my fault...
 It\'s wired into our genes to cry when our parents die...!"
Battler\'s face was still bright red from the tears, but even though it was forced,
 ...he had at least recovered enough to fake a smile.
"......Kanon.
 ...You mustn\'t remain here any longer either.
 Take the children and return to the mansion."
Natsuhi, unable to take a step into the storehouse, had been standing under the rain the whole time.
 ...Maybe she had her own way of grieving, different from Battler\'s.
She realized that she had to take on a sense of responsibility now that her husband was dead,
 ......so she gave Kanon those orders.
"...............Yes.
 Madam."
Kanon rose silently, and turned to face them.
......His face was pure white, almost as though his own heart had died along with Shannon;
 ......there was no life in his expression.
If, during the course of a normal day, he had been instructed to do a tour of the beautiful rose garden,
 Kanon may have led the way for them.
......But now, there was no distinction between Kanon and the children.
{n}...They were now just kids of about the same age...with the wounds of having lost someone close to them.
After seeing the children go back, Natsuhi gave orders to Genji.
".........Genji.
 ...Contact the police immediately.
 They probably won\'t be able to come until the typhoon passes, but they should be able to tell us what to do next."
"......Understood.
 There is an emergency radio, so I will use that to contact them."
When she heard that, Natsuhi remembered.
{n}That\'s right, the telephones were out today, weren\'t they...
However, since it had been assumed that there could be trouble with the phones on this isolated island, a radio had been installed.
......Anyway, let\'s contact the police and seek their instructions.
{n}...Everything else can wait.
".........Doctor Nanjo.
 .........Is there anything further you can do here?"
"Unfortunately...
 .........I cannot do anything........."
"............Understood.
 ...Genji, could you at least cover their faces with something?
 Exposing them like this is humiliating to them as well..."
".........Yes."
Genji picked up several towels hanging inside the storehouse,
 when Eva stopped him in a shrill voice.
"Wait a second!
 Stop.
 This is the scene of the crime, isn\'t it?
 Then we can\'t disturb it.
 In our confusion, we\'ve tracked muddy footprints all over the scene, and I\'m sure that will have caused trouble for the police\'s investigation!"
"........................"
Natsuhi glared at Eva testily.
{n}......Objectively speaking, Eva was right.
Even so, she glared at Eva as though accusing her of refusing to do those tragic corpses,
 which had been humiliated even after death, the simple kindness of covering their faces.
......However, Eva had spoken both calmly and correctly.
This horrible state was definitely not an accident.
{n}It was a crime.
 ......Someone had killed them.
 It was a murder case.
In that case, they should be careful not to further disturb the site...
They had to aid the police as much as possible, so that they might hand over a clue that could be used to find the detestable culprit.
"............I agree with Eva‐san.
 ...Until the police come, we should leave everything be..."
"......What do you say, Madam?"
"...............You\'re right.
 ...Understood.
 Close it up.
 ...And, just in case, we should put a different lock on it."
"......A different lock?"
"Yes.
 ......When we came here, the shutter was locked.
 ...That means that the culprit used the key to the shutter to lock it."
"Th‐......that makes sense.
 Then, does that mean that the key which opens this shutter will have the killer\'s fingerprints?!"
"......I am sure it will be worthwhile to submit it to the police as evidence,
 but Kanon‐kun handled it just as normal, and used it to open this.
 It will probably also have his fingerprints on it."
"Also, that key was handed to Genji just now, and he took it with his bare hands.
 ...It doesn\'t look like it will be very useful as evidence."
".........That was careless of me.
 ...My apologies..."
"Genji‐san.
 Are there other keys to this storehouse?"
"......No.
 Only this one."
"Which means that the killer walked out of the servant room with that key,
 ...and then conscientiously returned the key to where they found it, right......?"
Hideyoshi\'s theory sounded plausible, but was actually very strange if you thought about it.
{n}Why would they go to all the trouble of returning a key they stole?
{n}......No, if you think about it even more deeply, there are some even more bizarre points.
Usually, when a criminal hides a body, they are trying to delay the point at which it will be found and use that time to escape.
The actual place where the six were killed wasn\'t necessarily here, but they had been killed somewhere on this island,
 and it would be normal to think that the reason they had been carried to this storehouse was to hide the bodies and delay the discovery of the crime.
......But that graffiti drawn on the shutter that looked like an eerie magic circle...
had eloquently indicated that the corpses were hidden here.
......It didn\'t specifically say that they were here, but after six people had gone missing,
 by making such an obvious scribble and even returning the key to open it,
 ......it seemed almost as though someone had wanted the corpses to be discovered here.
"......In any case, a lock that the killer has opened once before will not be sufficiently trustworthy on its own.
 If we want to protect this place from the killer\'s hand, I think we should put a new lock on."
"I think that is a good plan...
 I agree."
Genji fished around inside the storehouse, and unsealed a brand‐new padlock which had been inside a small box.
"What would you have me do with the key...?"
"......I will take it.
 I will take responsibility and hand it over to the police."
Natsuhi took the key to the padlock from Genji\'s hand.
After that, they all exited and lowered the shutter.
......Because of that, the corpses were once again sealed behind that shutter, covered with that gruesome magic circle.
Genji crouched down in front of the shutter to fasten the new padlock.
...In addition to the main lock on the shutter, there is sometimes a place where you can attach your own lock in front of it.
 This was one of those types.
In the midst of the roar of thunder and the pouring rain, the storehouse stood there, ominously...
{n}On its closed shutter was the magic circle, drawn in a creepy blood‐like substance, and swallowing up the bodies of six whole people.
......To Natsuhi, putting the new lock on may not have been entirely to preserve the scene for the police,
 ......but rather, she might have felt like she wanted to shut that mouth for all eternity,
 to prevent any more victims from being swallowed by that eerie demon......
"......Come on, let\'s go, everyone.
 ...Doctor Nanjo, thank you very much for your work.
 ...Genji, quickly, contact the police."
"I will contact them as soon as I return..."
The adults left the storehouse.
...The ghastly magic circle drawn on the shutter,
 still swallowing the six bodies, loomed eerily, occasionally lit up by the lightning......All that could be heard was the sound of the rain, the voices from the kids\' television program that Maria was watching,
 and the engrossed Maria\'s cackling voice.
In other words,
 ......what greeted them as they returned dumbfounded from that horrible, bizarre scene,
 was the voice of Maria as she rolled around laughing at the television...
Not knowing how to explain to Maria that her mother, Rosa, was dead, those who returned to the room couldn\'t manage any more than a suffocating silence.
At first, Maria returned their stares with a dubious look,
 but when she realized that they weren\'t trying to blame her for anything, she ignored them and again immersed herself in the television program...
The children wordlessly sat down on the sofa...
{n}Their minds were probably blank from their state of shock.
Though they had all cried and mourned so much...now they just vaguely sat there, their faces expressionless...
Only Kanon had returned to his usual calm expression.
{n}...However, that probably didn\'t mean he had been able to wipe out the shock.
...Nothing was reflected in his eyes as he stared into the emptiness...
Hideyoshi, fidgeting as he remembered that horrible scene, kept muttering.
 Unbelievable—That can\'t be somethin\' of this world—It\'s the work of the devil.
Every once in a while, he turned these into questions and bounced them off Nanjo,
 but Nanjo, in a calm doctorly manner, kept repeating that nothing could be understood by only glancing at the scene,
 and that until the police arrived, he wouldn\'t know anything.
However, Nanjo only appeared calm by comparison to Hideyoshi, who could not contain his agitation and fear.
In fact, Nanjo had also received a huge shock, and his face was deathly pale.
Maybe it was because of their attitudes that Natsuhi tried to rise to the challenge and take control.
Natsuhi was apparently unchanged from her normal attitude.
{n}And she briskly gave directions.
"......I will head to where Father is.
 ...Genji, quickly contact the police."
"Certainly..."
"I wonder if you would allow me to tag along, Natsuhi nee‐san?
 ......Since Krauss nii‐san is now gone, the task of aiding Father has been left to me.
 It would be improper of me to relax here while relying entirely on you."
Natsuhi was struck speechless by Eva\'s aggressive actions in a situation like this.
It seemed that she was claiming that, with Krauss dead, the one to take responsibility should not be his wife,
 but herself, the next highly ranked in the family.
...Possibly, she was not happy that Natsuhi was ignoring her and handling matters herself in this extreme situation.
Of course, even Eva\'s mind had been blank from the shock until just now.
...She only returned to herself after Natsuhi started giving orders.
"........................
 ......You may do as you please."
Natsuhi walked out without saying anything more.
{n}Eva followed behind her.
...Mere moments after they left, Kumasawa ran into the parlor.
Since she wasn\'t the kind of person to run around, it would be normal to sense that something had happened,
 ...but since everyone had been stricken by that earlier shock, none of them took any notice of this trivial difference.
"......U‐umm,
 ...Madam,
 ...Madam.........!"
"If you\'re lookin\' for Natsuhi nee‐san, she went to see Father.
 She\'ll probably be back soon.
 ...What happened, Kumasawa‐san?"
"Th‐that is, .........in the dining hall, ......blood, .........blood...!"
Everyone in the parlor turned to listen.
Everyone thought the same thing.
 ...“I hope I misheard that.”
......Just like how any container has a limit to how much you can put in it,
 ...no one felt like they could accept any more tragedies beyond what had already happened.
So they all thought it.
 I hope I misheard that......
"Wh‐......what?
 ......In the dining hall...?"
"When I went to the dining hall...
to set up for breakfast...
 ......Awawa{0}wa{0}wawa...wawa..."
The first to start running was George.
{n}His harsh footsteps jogged Hideyoshi and Nanjo to their senses, and they chased after him.
 Battler and the others followed.
They flew into the dining hall one after another, but they didn\'t find any change that would have caused Kumasawa to go pale.
...To those who had viewed that gruesome scene in the storehouse, it was a bit of an anticlimax.
However, Kumasawa, who had followed them, pointed it out.
{n}......There really were some traces of blood on the floor.
...Compared to that terrible scene, it was not very dramatic.
{n}...However, if you calmly thought about it, this definitely indicated the loss of a lot of blood.
"......There\'s a puddle of blood here as well.
 ......What in the world..."
"......It appears that a great deal of time has passed...
 ......It\'s probably safe to say that they were killed here last night..."
"I‐it would seem to mean that...
 ...We\'d been talkin\' together in the dinin\' hall until late into the night...
 After that, someone must\'ve broken in..."
"Father, when did you two let yourselves out of the meeting and go to sleep......?"
"...Hmm...
 It was a little past midnight...
 ......So,
 ...sometime after that...
is probably when it happened..."
".........Christ...
 .........I can\'t take this........."
"Milady, ......stay strong......"
"...Heheheheh...
 ...After seeing that hell on earth in the storehouse, I think I can handle this much..."
"......Really? Great for you...
 I feel like my head\'s gonna friggin\' explode...
 ......This is the dining hall, you know?
 This is where every day I would eat, complain about school, complain about homework,
 ......talk to Dad about my grades,
 ......that\'s what this place is to me......"
"............Milady.
 It wouldn\'t be good to remain here any longer.
 ...Let\'s return to the parlor."
"I agree...
 .........Uncle Hideyoshi!
 I think this room will be really important to the police.
 Don\'t you think it would be bad if we trampled all over it?"
Battler proposed this in a slightly powerful voice as, together with Kanon, he grabbed the pale and shaking Jessica\'s shoulders.
".........Everything is just as Battler‐san has said.
 There is nothing more to be gained from remaining in this room."
Nanjo spoke while looking at the pale faces all around.
......Even though that horrible scene in the storehouse had felt like something not of this world,
 at least it was in a place far from here, a place we had been able to cut ourselves off and run away from, which had helped everyone to keep on going.
......However, this dining hall was different.
It was in the mansion\'s main wing,
 ...and as Jessica had said, it was supposed to be one of the more relaxing places within the mansion.
 It was the same place where all of the relatives had enjoyed lunch and dinner yesterday.
......The shock of seeing this place smeared with blood reminded us of that horrible spectacle in the storehouse,
 and forced us to accept that we really hadn\'t been able to run away from the scene of that tragedy......
"...Yeah.
 I agree too...
 The killer might have left traces in this room!"
"Amateurs like us shouldn\'t stir the place up.
 ...Let\'s leave quick.
 Come on, come on!"
Hideyoshi also understood the meaning of what Battler had said, and pushed everyone to hurry out of the dining hall.
...The way we were then, looking at that blood any longer would have been too harsh.
Nobody went against his words.
 Everyone raced each other out of the dining hall.
 ............Almost as though the last person in the room would be trapped in there, all alone...
Once in the hallway, we lent a shoulder to Kumasawa, who was leaning against the wall still trembling, and we all headed back to the parlor together.
...Then, Genji returned.
"......Oh, Genji‐san.
 Were you able to contact the police?"
"..................I can only offer my sincerest apologies.
 ...Whether it was a failure of the radio or something else that caused it, I cannot tell, but—"
"What... You can\'t reach the police...?!!
 You tried the phone and the radio and both failed?!"
"...My apologies.
 A boat will be arriving on Monday morning, and I believe we will be able to borrow their communications equipment."
"Isn\'t there a boat on this island?!
 Can\'t we just take a little trip out to the Niijima Police Department?!"
"...Hideyoshi‐san, that would be impossible with this weather...
 At the very least, we can\'t do anything until the typhoon passes by us."
"Krauss‐sama\'s boat is being repaired and is not on the island...
 Therefore, I am afraid we have no option but to wait for Monday\'s boat......"
"H‐how could this happen...?!
 Six people are dead!!
 The phones and radio aren\'t working, and there\'s no boat!
 So until the typhoon passes and the boat comes—until tomorrow morning—we just have to stay here on this island, unable to even contact the police?!"
".........Which means that...
...not just us,
 ...but the criminal who killed everyone is also confined to this island..."
"......That certainly follows.
 ......The culprit who killed everyone is still here on the island."
"S‐......so the bastard who killed Dad and the others can\'t get off the island, and he\'s still hiding somewhere...
 ......Damn it, dammit{0}dammit{0}dammit!!!
 I\'ll find you, you bastard, you think I\'ll hand you over to the police?!!"
"I\'ll tear you to shreds myself...!!!
 Uuuughh!!!"
"...................................."
Maria had finally realized that something was odd in the parlor.
...Or, rather than noticing something odd,
 it was probably better to say that she felt unhappy and neglected since everyone was getting so excited about something only she didn\'t know about.
".........Uu.
 ...Jessica onee‐chan.
 Did someone die?"
The way she spoke was completely calm.
 ...Just as though she was talking about characters in a TV drama—as though it didn\'t affect her at all.
...Jessica probably didn\'t like that.
......As though trying to say "can\'t you tell just by looking at me, overwhelmed with grief!", she flared up against Maria.
"They all died, everyone, everyone!!
 My dad, Battler\'s mother and father!!
 Gohda‐san and Shannon!!
 And even your mother, too!!"
"Stop it, Jessica‐chan...!!
 You aren\'t the only one who\'s sad...!"
"...Maria‐san...
 I know this will come as a shock, but please listen.
 ......Your mother...
......has died."
"............Mama is dead?
 ......Uu...?"
"......Yes, someone killed her.
 ...I know it\'s sad, but stay strong—"
"........................How many people...
died?"
"Six people!!
 Six!
 ......Shit, shit, shit!
 How could you do something so cruel!!
 There\'s a limit to how cruel you can be, if you\'re a human...!
 I don\'t know who it is, but the killer\'s not human!!
 There\'s no way their blood is red!!"
"............Uu.
 Killer\'s not human.
 Just the{0}{nobreak:{m:-5:——}—}{0}chosen by the{nobreak:{m:-5:——}—}."
"Huh?
 ...............Hey, Maria,
 did you say something just now?"
Maria had just said something,
 but since the words were so remotely separated from the flow and context of the conversation, for a second, I couldn\'t understand them.
As I was about to ask her to repeat it,
 I was shocked by the sudden sound of Aunt Natsuhi\'s loud voice coming from the entrance to the parlor.
It looked like Aunt Natsuhi and Auntie Eva had returned from their trip to see Grandfather.
"You can\'t contact them with the radio?!
 .........If we can\'t use it at a time like this, why do we even have an emergency radio!"
"...............My apologies.
 I believe it was having annual maintenance inspections, but..."
"Wait, what about one of those boat signaling devices where you can flicker the light on and off?
 Couldn\'t you use something like that to contact the next island?"
"......We do not have such equipment...
 ...My apologies..."
Just then, Kumasawa came pushing a serving cart loaded with breakfast.
{n}......Since there was no way we would be able to eat in the dining hall, Hideyoshi had ordered her to bring it to the parlor.
"Why are we eating breakfast here?"
"......Aaaahhh, Natsuhi‐san... I\'ll tell you later.
 More importantly, Eva, how was Father?"
"Judging by the fact that he is not with you,
 .........he won\'t even leave his room for a situation like this..."
"He isn\'t there.
 ......The room was empty."
"What the...
 Where could he have gone at a time like this...?!"
"............Did you say that the Master has left his study...?"
"...That\'s right. I am as surprised as you...
 I wonder when he left his room......
 Do either of you have an idea?"
Natsuhi looked at Genji and Kanon as she said this.
...She probably thought that the servants permitted the One‐winged Eagle, who served directly under him, would know of a place he might go.
.........However, it seemed to be the other way around.
{n}...Their faces made it clear that those who knew Kinzo best realized even more than everyone else how impossible it was for him to leave his room.
".........Even we have no idea."
"...As you all know, the Master had everything set up within that study, from a place to sleep to a bathroom.
 I cannot imagine him leaving that room except under very exceptional circumstances."
"............In that case, ...what?
 Isn\'t it natural to think that one of those "very exceptional circumstances" came up...?!"
"We still don\'t know whether that is the case!"
"Anyway, he is a fickle person, so it\'s possible that he went for a walk by himself without knowing the current situation.
 ......If that is the case, we have to tell him what has happened and ask for instructions as fast as we can."
"......That\'s right.
 .........Although I don\'t want to think about it, ...it\'s possible that something has happened to him, isn\'t it...?"
"I don\'t even want to think about something that ominous...!"
No one had seen Kinzo since the six horrible corpses had been found.
{n}On top of that, the phones were broken, the radio wouldn\'t reach anyone, and there was no way to contact the police.
...It looked like the typhoon would leave tomorrow and a boat would come,
 ......but until then, no one could rely on anyone outside the island, nor could they escape the island.
Everyone had lost their composure at the extremely sudden tragedy.
...A heavy silence and a sense of impatience.
{n}...Even though they needed to do something, they couldn\'t think of anything;
 some of them became irritated, while others merely held their heads in their hands.
.........But not one of them...could explain what was occurring on this island of Rokkenjima......
After that, we sat in the parlor and wordlessly chewed through the breakfast that Kumasawa‐san had made.
Of course, this was right after something like that had happened.
{n}No one had any appetite.
...However, we realized that not eating would weaken our bodies.
 ...It would also be rude to Kumasawa‐san, who had made the breakfast.
Kumasawa‐san had taken the tasteful western vegetables, ones that Gohda‐san had probably special ordered for the purpose of some extravagantly fancy dish, and cooked them in a Japanese style,
 making them turn an unpleasant color.
As to what Gohda‐san had been planning to cook with those ingredients...
right then I couldn\'t even imagine it.
If I did think about it, I would be reminded of the way Gohda‐san had died, and the inside of my mouth would be filled with a sour taste...
For the time being, everyone pretended to eat, but there was no hope of anyone making any headway into the meal.
Then, everyone was brought up to speed on the current situation.
First off, ......that Uncle Krauss,
 my dad,
 Kyrie‐san,
 Auntie Rosa,
 Gohda‐san and Shannon‐chan...
had been found in the rose garden storehouse as cruelly mutilated corpses.
And that despite that, we were unable to use phones or radio, and still couldn\'t contact the police.
......So until the typhoon passed, there was nothing we could do.
Furthermore, Grandfather, who we had hoped might be able to show a little leadership in this kind of a situation, had disappeared at some point.
......Gohda‐san hadn\'t made breakfast, so Grandfather\'s stomach must have been empty,
 and if he had just been taking a casual walk, by now he should have been stomping back to whine about how hungry he was.
And yet,
 he hadn\'t appeared.
......There was more than a small chance that he had become caught up in the earlier crime.
Aunt Natsuhi and Auntie Eva had said that, on their return trip from going to see Kinzo, they had called out to him on every floor, looking for him, but were not able to find him.
...If you think about the timing of it all, it was probably best to think that he had been caught up in the crime.
If the culprit had taken the trouble to move the bodies of Dad and the rest, who we figured had been killed in the dining hall, all the way to the storehouse,
 then maybe they had already killed Grandfather,
 moved his body to some strange location, and we had simply not found it yet...
 No one actually said it, but this theory seemed extremely convincing...
"We will go check that all of the windows and doors are closed.
 We must also carefully search for Father.
 Children, make sure you do not leave this room."
"Eva‐san and Hideyoshi‐san, I\'m sorry, but please stay here with the children.
 Doctor Nanjo as well."
"...I understand.
 I will wait here......"
Aunt Natsuhi led the servants—Genji‐san, Kumasawa‐san, and Kanon‐kun—out of the parlor.
All that was left was Auntie Eva, Uncle Hideyoshi,
 Doctor Nanjo, and the four of us children for a total of seven people.
"Let\'s all stick together, and maybe watch some TV while we wait.
 Geez, Sunday daytime TV sure doesn\'t have many good shows on, huh?"
Uncle Hideyoshi tried to stir up this gloomy atmosphere, acting cheerfully.
"Uu.
 Good show, watch it, watch it.
 Uu‐uu!"
"Oh, really?
 You want to watch TV, Maria‐chan?
 Then come and watch it with your uncle."
Maria was the only one who played along.
...Even though Maria had been told of her mother\'s death, she didn\'t show the slightest flicker in her emotions.
Was nine really this young an age......?
No one else was feeling the slightest bit like joining in, and they each sank into their sofas and let their minds go blank...
"............Aniki.
 Can I ask you something?"
"...What is it?"
"......Just now in the storehouse.
 You said something about Shannon‐chan and a ring.
 ......Did you give that to her?"
George‐aniki didn\'t answer, but he hung his head and closed both of his eyes.
 ......There could be no clearer response.
"Quit it, Battler.
 ......Have some tact."
"......You\'re right.
 I shouldn\'t have asked that."
"...............That\'s right.
 It was me.
 .........Last night,
 I proposed to her.
 ...That was when I gave her the ring.
 ......I told her that tomorrow,
 she should put it on whatever finger she wanted,
 as her answer.
 ......Haha, I must have sounded so full of myself."
......And that ring had been...
...on the ring finger of Shannon‐chan\'s left hand.
".....................Actually,
 ...I\'ve been having talks with Shannon for several years.
 ...About you, George nii‐san."
"......I wonder what she could have said."
"...............Shannon was always really bad at lying.
 It was instantly obvious that it was you she was talking about."
"...............She...
asked whether it would be okay if she got close to you, being just a servant.
 ......She asked about stuff like what kind of things do boys like,
 and what kind of clothes should she wear to make them happy,
 lots of stuff like that.
 ..................How should I say it... Well, I was jealous of her."
".........All that...and right after she\'s handed the engagement ring...
it\'s just...
...all over?"
"......I know people value things differently.
 ......But being proposed to by a man,
 .........is, in a way,
 the high point of a girl\'s life.
 ......So I\'m sure.
 Last night, I think Shannon was...
happy from the bottom of her heart...
...no, the happiest she\'d ever been since she was born..."
".........................................."
...George‐aniki, without raising his head, sighed deeply...
{n}......Or maybe tears had risen to his eyes.
"............It seems that Shannon was on duty in the guesthouse last night.
 ......But, ...because she was too embarrassed to go back to the guesthouse with me,
 ......she went over to the mansion."
"......Think about Shannon\'s feelings.
 ...When you receive an engagement ring, no matter how much you\'ve prepared for it beforehand, it\'s normal to feel so elated your mind goes blank.
 ......She must have been so embarrassed she didn\'t know what to do with herself."
"......And then, Shannon,
 ............even though she hadn\'t been on duty there, she went to the mansion,
 ...............and got caught up in all this........."
"If only I hadn\'t,
 ...on that day,
 in that place,
 ......given her that ring......
Shannon wouldn\'t have,
 ......Sayo wouldn\'t have...
...been caught up in this incident...!
 ...uuuuughh!!"
"Aniki.
 It\'s not like that.
 It\'s definitely not like that.
 ......So don\'t cry any more."
"..................uuuuughh..."
"Battler‐kun.
 Leave him be."
After those words from Auntie Eva, I stopped talking to him.
...Misplaced words of comfort might actually hurt him.
{n}Jessica sat down next to Aniki, and quietly put an arm around him.
.........Maybe only Jessica, who had known about Aniki and Shannon\'s love since the beginning,
 and who had been discussing that relationship with Shannon, ...could comfort Aniki now.
I went over to Auntie Eva and sat down on the opposite sofa...
"Battler‐kun, you really are strong...
 It looks like you\'ve kept a good hold on yourself."
"...Umm, well, look, the depth of the love becomes the depth of the wound, right?
 That old bastard, I couldn\'t care less about no matter how he snuffed it.
 ...I feel bad about Kyrie‐san, but...well, she wasn\'t actually my parent."
"My, my.
 But on the other hand, you were crying a lot back then, right?"
"Well, I did think that at least that much crying was due as gratitude to the parent who raised me...
 Hehehe..."
".........The way you can switch your mood quickly like that, and your dry tone, must have come from Rudolf.
 ...That kid would always get violently happy, sad, and angry,
 but he would always regain his cool immediately afterwards."
"......It\'s nothing like that.
 I haven\'t really been able to get over the shock yet either.
 ...I think it\'s just that the emotions that rose up in me were...different from everybody else\'s."
"What do you mean?"
I was acting much calmer than George‐aniki and Jessica were.
...That wasn\'t because my sadness was less intense and I\'d already sprung back to normal.
{n}It was because my sadness had been gradually replaced, by a different emotion.
"............Rather than sadness,
 .........it\'s more like I\'m irritated.
 What bastard did this and where the hell is he?
 ...I feel like I can\'t settle down until I\'ve smacked him upside the face."
That was what I really wanted to do.
 It was like I couldn\'t allow myself to just sit here, overwhelmed with sadness and hugging my knees.
"......Since the time Dad and everyone else was killed, this island has remained covered by the typhoon.
 ......In short, that means that the asshole who pulled this disgusting, detestable bullshit is still somewhere on this island."
"It certainly does.
 .........I wonder if they\'re hiding themselves somewhere in that dark forest even now?"
.........I felt like I\'d had...
a very similar conversation with Kyrie‐san the night before.
That\'s right.
 After the letter from the person who claimed to be {f:5:Beatrice} appeared at the dinner table last night,
 ......we had talked about whether or not a 19th person actually exists.
"Auntie Eva.
 .........These murders,
 ...do you think they have anything to do with the letter from {f:5:Beatrice} last night?"
"...Aah, that thing?
 ............Well, I wonder.
 Although all of us siblings were in agreement that the mysterious letter had been sent to further complicate the problem of Father\'s inheritance,
 .........as to whether that and the incident this morning are related, it\'s impossible to tell at this stage..."
"Was that letter really given to Maria by some witch called {f:5:Beatrice}?"
"How could it be?
 All of it was a farce devised by Father, wasn\'t it?
 He made someone like Shannon‐chan wear the dress from the portrait and deceive Maria‐chan, right?
 Isn\'t that just like the kind of intricate prank Father would pull?"
".........Last night, I talked with Kyrie‐san about whether {f:5:Beatrice} actually exists,
 and she also said that {f:5:Beatrice} was probably one of the 18 of us."
"Isn\'t that obvious?
 There\'s no one else on this island besides us!
 So obviously it must have been someone amongst us pretending to be {f:5:Beatrice}."
"There\'s no one else but us on this island,
 huh..."
"Obviously, right?
 Who else could be here?
 No one is on this island except us.
 There are only 18 people.
 ...So the one who pretended to be {f:5:Beatrice} has to be one of those 18."
Kyrie‐san had denied that there was a 19th person by "flipping over the chessboard".
Even though Auntie Eva hadn\'t constructed an argument that complicated, her opinion at least was the same.
...Except, if that is the case, our situation starts to look very ugly......
At the time of {f:5:Beatrice}\'s letter, we were able to dismiss the matter as just someone\'s prank.
...However, if we deny the existence of a 19th person at this point, matters are not so jovial.
.........In other words,
"...If there is no 19th person,
 ......then the culprit who killed Dad and the others is also one of the 18, right?
 .........So, in other words, that would mean that someone in this very mansion is the one who killed them...!"
"......................................."
Auntie Eva smiled meaningfully.
...It looked like Auntie thought that this conclusion should have been obvious from the very beginning.
"The culprit carried the bodies of those six into the storehouse.
 But they sure did a good job getting into that storehouse, didn\'t they?
 That shutter was always kept closed and locked, I\'m told."
"In other words, in order to carry them into the storehouse, the culprit would need to unlock the shutter.
 ...Understand?"
"......Is there any possibility that the shutter was left open by mistake that day?"
"The servants said that it\'s always shut.
 In other words, unless they brought the keys out of the servant room, they definitely couldn\'t have opened the storehouse."
"Is the only key the one in the servant room...?"
"Genji‐san said so, yes.
 Which means that the culprit knew where that single key was stored and took it out."
"Just now, I saw Kanon‐kun return the key to the servant room.
 The wall was packed with keys, and I don\'t think that a novice would know where and to what those keys went to.
 The culprit was magnificently able to select the key to the storehouse from all of those."
"Furthermore, even though the key didn\'t have a tag or anything sticking to it, they knew it was the key to the storehouse behind the rose garden.
 ...And while I\'m at it, they also knew where the storehouse was.
 .........I\'ll say it even clearer.
 The culprit knew the inside of the servant room well."
Her argument was extremely plain and clear.
......If the bodies had been thrown somewhere in the bushes of the rose garden, no explanation would have been necessary.
However, the one key to the storehouse was in the servant room,
 and stored with a large group of other keys, such that a novice would not be able to tell them apart.
This meant that the culprit was someone who was used to going in and out of the servant room, and knew well where the key was.
...The family didn\'t normally go into the servant room.
{n}......Which meant that............
"......Which means that...
...one of the servants...
...is the culprit......"
"I\'m sorry, but even your auntie can\'t say any more than that.
 ......However, I\'ll tell you one thing."
"......What\'s that?"
"The culprit, ......we should properly say they were culprits in the plural, and what\'s more, they were well‐armed.
 You see it, don\'t you?"
"They had to assault the four in the dining hall and kill them all at once, drag a total of six bodies all the way to the storehouse beyond the rose garden, and scribble that disgusting makeup on their faces.
 ......There\'s no way that a single culprit could carry all of this out on their own, right?"
It was impossible.
 It might not have been if a single person spent enough time on it, but that would have taken ages.
It was probably best to think that a significant number of people had been part of it.
"...............Whoo.
 So what you mean is...
...maybe all of the servants were in cahoots."
"Please keep it quiet, okay?
 It\'s bad to speak from speculation alone."
"......Besides, what would you do if it really was true?
 They might not let us return alive.
 This is an opponent who had no trouble killing Nii‐san and the three others."
"The only people in this room right now who look like they could put up a decent fight are the three people in my family, and maybe you as well—four at most?
 The situation is no different than it was last night.
 ......In short, it would be easy for the culprit to massacre the rest of us."
I had been playing detective with Auntie Eva out of a desire to expose the person who had killed Dad and the rest before the police did.
...If I could manage to skillfully penetrate the culprit\'s identity, I wanted to stick the evidence in their face.
......I had gotten it into my head that if I did that, the culprit would give up and surrender, just like in one of those detective movies.
However, the culprit only surrenders there because they are in a situation where resisting would be futile.
The culprits behind these incidents on the island were far from helpless,
 and might even be able to massacre all of the remaining people on the island.
...And on top of that, this island was like a giant locked room, cut off from the outside world by the typhoon,
 so they had the full day until tomorrow to kill, scheme, and cover up their handiwork......
In short, we weren\'t in the kind of safe atmosphere where we could entertain ourselves by playing detective...
On the contrary, we were at a stage where we had to be scared stiff,
 since playing detective might displease the culprits, and cause them to repeat another mass murder......
"...Well, it is just a possibility, right?
 ......But I can\'t bring myself to trust the servants yet.
 And that doesn\'t mean they\'re the only ones I suspect.
 I also think there might be some mastermind behind all this."
"A mastermind?
 Hmm... Why do you say that?"
"It\'s just a feeling.
 ......Think about what the word servant literally means.
 It means they serve someone—they do someone\'s bidding, right?"
"Everyone who was killed had some relation to the Ushiromiya family.
 So it would be natural for someone with interest in that result to be involved."
This was also plain and clear...
The Ushiromiya family were currently right in the middle of discussing how to distribute the inheritance if Grandfather died.
If this followed the formulaic plot used to death by many classic mystery novels,
 it would definitely be a crime by someone with ties to the Ushiromiya family and who was entangled in the inheritance problem...
Auntie had probably also read a few books in that genre.
......Her theory did have a few one‐sided conclusions to it, but it was a run‐of‐the‐mill idea that anyone would surely hit upon.
I think anyone would have suspected the servants, even if their logic was different.
Especially the talk revolving around the key to the shutter—that was enough to make it easy to suspect strongly that one of the servants was involved in the case...
"...............Which is whyyy...
I don\'t like it for some reason."
"What do you mean, you don\'t like it?"
"Nah, just talking to myself.
 Ihihi!"
I dodged the question by joking, but I couldn\'t wipe out the sense of unease I felt inside me.
......Because the reasoning we had arrived at was altogether too simple.
{n}{i:Reasoning that anyone could arrive at.}
 ...And I just couldn\'t accept that.
...If I tried "flipping over the chessboard" like I had learned from Kyrie‐san,
 ......that was exactly why it was impossible for the servants to be the culprits.
If the servants really had been the culprits, they wouldn\'t have hidden the bodies in a place that was tied to themselves.
Certainly not the rose garden storehouse of all places, whose key they themselves controlled.
The police would probably immediately pursue whoever had been in control of the key.
That would create a danger for exposure.
{n}......If we were to assume that they were the culprits, they had no reason to carry the bodies into the storehouse.
...Did they expect us to think that, and so put them in the storehouse deliberately?
{n}No, that definitely didn\'t make sense.
When the police come and inspect the site, all kinds of things will probably become clear.
No matter how deeply careful the culprits were in carrying out murder, some kind of traces will definitely be found.
So, in summary, they have everything to lose and nothing to gain.
If you think about it this way, and look at the game from the culprit\'s side,
 it feels like there\'s no point in advertising the location of the corpses.
If the bodies were found, a report would be sent to the police,
 the remaining people would become more cautious,
 they could start looking for who was responsible,
 ...anyway, none of these things would make the culprits feel any more comfortable.
...Just like the words of the main character\'s mother in a novel I read recently called {i:Higurashi no Naku Koro ni}.
A mystery story has four parts—introduction, development, turn, and conclusion—and so, to commit the perfect crime, it is essential to eliminate the "introduction".
......Right now, no one knew where Grandfather was.
We didn\'t know whether he had already become a victim, or if he was one of the culprits,
 .........but this state of confusion had to be beneficial to whoever did this.
By blatantly advertising the bodies to us,
 and declaring "Hey! There\'s a murder case going on!", the culprit had absolutely nothing to gain.
Right, that was where we could "flip over the chessboard".
So this blatant advertisement of the bodies was itself the culprit\'s goal.
......So, it may well be that, to the culprit, {i:having the six corpses be present there meant more than the deaths themselves}.
In other words, the culprit wanted to display these murders.
 To who?
......To us.
 It was a message.
{n}The culprit was trying to shove something in our faces.
...I didn\'t know what that could be.
At the current time, none of us could grasp anything from this vulgar mass murder except malice.
......Malice towards...
everyone...
perhaps.
Each one of the survivors had some kind of connection to one of the six who had been killed.
Uncle Krauss\'s death brought sorrow to Jessica\'s family.
The deaths of Dad and Kyrie‐san brought sorrow to me,
 while Auntie Rosa\'s death brought sorrow to Maria.
......Gohda‐san\'s death probably dealt a shock to his fellow servants,
 and Shannon‐chan\'s death brought grief to George‐aniki, who had proposed to her, and to Kanon‐kun, who had loved her like an older sister.
......Everyone now on this island had received an equal amount of sadness.
Auntie Eva had claimed that the servants were definitely in cahoots,
 ......but then how could you explain the deaths of Gohda‐san and Shannon‐chan?
......And by this argument,
 {i:the grief caused by the six deaths hit everyone but Auntie Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi}.
It was very possible to doubt Auntie Eva herself,
 who was acting like she was outside the net of suspicion, and who might have been trying to point that suspicion at the servants.
......In the first place, she had managed to avoid suspicion and place it on the servants with that argument about the key to the shutter,
 ......but if you looked at it from a perspective of motive, about who would gain something from the murders,
 ............Auntie Eva\'s name floated to the top of the list.
"......Battler‐kun, Auntie knows what you\'re thinking, okay?"
"Huh?
 Ihihi, oh no,
 please don\'t tell anyone,
 that I had my head all full of {i:y\'know, that kind of stuff}..."
"I\'m the one who would gain the most from these murders.
 ......Since I\'m going to be suspected anyway, I might as well get it out in the open myself."
I had tried to dodge this conversation by joking around, but it looked like it hadn\'t worked.
"The inheritance is to be divided between the siblings.
 But now, the four siblings are just me.
 All the assets of the Ushiromiya family will become mine.
 ......Heheheheh."
"If Uncle Hideyoshi heard you, he\'d say "Give it a rest Eva, it\'s not a joke"..."
"I\'m sorry, okay?
 No matter how I try to smooth it over, I\'ll just be suspected anyway, so I was just fooling around."
"......So I\'ve been thinking, from my point of view, this murder might have been planned to cast suspicion on me.
 ......Unfortunately, my alibi for last night is weak."
"Could you tell me about it?
 About last night?"
"As you know, the discussion of how we siblings would gnaw apart the inheritance continued until late in the night.
 But I don\'t know how late it lasted.
 My husband and I had woken up early that morning.
 We were so sleepy, and we let ourselves out a little past midnight.
 We then returned to the guesthouse and rested there."
"......Can anyone other than Uncle Hideyoshi prove that?
 Oh, of course, it\'s not like I\'m suspecting you or anything, you kno~w?
 Hihihi!"
"My, I wonder about that!
 *giggle*.
 I don\'t know if it counts as proof, but when we returned to the guesthouse, we were greeted by Genji‐san and asked if we needed a towel."
"I think that should be enough to prove that we returned to the guesthouse a little after midnight.
 ......Of course, if my theory was correct and the servants were all in cahoots, that wouldn\'t actually make for an alibi, would it?"
"That is a point, isn\'t it?
 Does that mean that, right now, I\'m playing detective with the real culprit?
 Ihihi!"
"But let me say this for my honor\'s sake: if my goal was the inheritance, I wouldn\'t commit this weird kind of murder!"
"After all, if I just wanted to make them forfeit their rights to the inheritance, the method of their deaths wouldn\'t have mattered.
 On the contrary, I\'d try to make their deaths look like an accident, wouldn\'t I?
 If I\'d been roping in the servants, and carefully planning everything out, that\'s even more reason I\'d do that."
"You\'re right about that...
 If you were killing someone to make a profit, you definitely shouldn\'t make it look like a murder."
"You see?
 So from here on, your auntie will be in a very blue mood.
 ......I\'ll probably be treated as the person behind this by the police, and harshly investigated.
 I can\'t wait..."
Auntie Eva shrugged with a bitter smile.
......Just like it was easy to think of the servants as suspicious, it was also very easy to think of Auntie Eva as suspicious.
So if we "flip over the chessboard",
 ......did that mean it was impossible for the culprit to be the easily doubtable Auntie Eva...?
However, if that logic could pass so easily, then motive wouldn\'t count for anything.
No, that can\'t be right...
{n}Knowing the motive should be a big clue towards knowing the culprit.
...That is why murderers throughout history have tried to ensure their motive will not be found out, by skillfully complicating the incidents......
.........I don\'t know, ...I don\'t know...
{n}Every time I flip over the chessboard, it keeps flipping from front to back and back to front...
...Were my thoughts closing in on the truth?
{n}......Or.........
Auntie Eva didn\'t want to talk any more than that, so I headed to the window, folding my arms, so that I could cool my head a little.
As I looked over the parlor, I saw George‐aniki and the others gathered, talking.
...It looked like they were talking about the magic circle that had been painted onto the shutter.
As Uncle Hideyoshi thought back to that time, he started drawing the shape in the margins of Maria\'s notebook.
......Yes, Maria is second only to Grandfather in knowledge of the occult, so she might understand what it meant.
"Hmmm, I think it was probably somethin\' like that!
 There was a mark like a cross, but tweaked a bit."
"And then, there were these closely packed strange letters all inside the outer circle like this, and there was somethin\' written on all four sides of the cross, and in the empty spaces in the corners as well.
 It didn\'t look like the alphabet or somethin\' like that.
 It was what they call ancient characters."
"......Also, around the top of the circumference, there was a small mark.
 ...Five small circles arranged in a plus sign, and straight lines connecting them..."
"Ah, yes, there definitely was somethin\' like that drawn there...!
 Yep, this was it, there\'s no mistakin\' the shape.
 I don\'t know the exact characters, but the arrangement was nearly the same."
Everyone was staring down at the shape, so I stared down at it too.
...From what I had heard, this had been painted on the shutter to the storehouse with some material that looked like blood.
......I see, this sure is unsettling.
"...Grandfather\'s about the only one who\'d get it into his head to draw this nonsense.
 ......Seriously, where did he go?!
 I wanna grab him and ask what the hell this is supposed to mean!!"
Jessica\'s voice contained impatience and anger.
She hadn\'t gone so far as to say that Grandfather was the culprit,
 but it looked as though she thought that Grandfather definitely knew the culprit\'s identity.
......Certainly, if you asked around for the link that bound the Ushiromiya family and the occult together, ten out of ten people would name Grandfather.
......And, to a person who knew nothing of the occult, this strange mark would have no meaning.
Which meant that......
...this might have been...something addressed to Grandfather......
That\'s right, the reason to advertise the crime is to show it off to the survivors.
......In that case, where had Grandfather, as the essential recipient of this message, disappeared off to......?
"Does this shape ring any bells...?"
"..............................
 ......Uu."
Maria looked at the shape with a serious face.
...Maybe she was enthusiastic since this was her area of expertise.
...However, her appearance was that of someone separated from the events at hand,
 ...as though this thing hadn\'t been drawn on the shutter closed around her mother\'s corpse...
"......My first impression was that the design resembled some kind of foreign cross‐like symbol..."
"Aah...
 It certainly does have that kind of design.
 Does that mean it has somethin\' to do with that foreign country?"
"That cross symbol was originally a crest from a religious order of knights and was supposed to protect pilgrims traveling to sacred places..."
"......Then this magic circle has some religious meaning or something...?
 This is starting to sound like gibberish......"
When I looked over at all of them, preparing to jump into the discussion, ......something shocked me.
Maria was...grinning, an eerie expression on her face that defied description.
...A sort of grin almost like she was making fun of everyone\'s ignorance.
 ......It was an expression that I wouldn\'t ever have believed Maria to be capable of making...
And then,
 ......she laughed.
An eerie, jarring laugh;
 ...even though I was looking at it right in front of my eyes, I really didn\'t want to accept it as real.
"Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi.
 That\'s completely wrong, everyone.
 Kihhi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi...
 Can\'t you tell just by looking?
 Kihhi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi."
While everyone was scared out of their wits, Maria, alone, kept on cackling happily...
After a while, that laugh suddenly and abruptly cut off.
But her expression was still like someone completely different from Maria.
"This is the seventh magic circle of the sun.
 ......The characters are Hebrew.
 Lend it here?"
"Ah, ......yes."
Maria stole the writing materials from the stunned Hideyoshi\'s hand.
She then started drawing another magic circle, effortlessly, right next to the one that Hideyoshi had drawn...
"......See?
 It was this kind of shape, right?"
"Y......yes...
 It was..."
"...M‐Maria, that\'s incredible...
 You really do know a lot..."
Jessica tried to smooth things over by praising Maria.
......Maybe she wanted to make sure that this was still the Maria who everyone knew so well.
...But Maria didn\'t give her any particular response.
Maria started fluently writing unfamiliar characters in the corners of the shape.
...At this sight, the eyes of Uncle Hideyoshi and Doctor Nanjo instantly began to widen...
"Written on the four arms of the cross are the names of the angels who preside over air, fire, water, and earth.
 Chasan, Arel, Talihad, and Phorlakh.
 And in the four diagonal directions are the names of the four great rulers.
 Ariel, Seraph, Tharshis, Cherub.
 ...Do they match?"
Even if you are unable to correctly write what you have seen,
 ...if you are once again shown something identical, it isn\'t difficult to state that the two are the same.
Asked by Maria whether they matched, Uncle Hideyoshi and Doctor Nanjo nodded over and over again.
"It\'s unmistakable... Yes, these kinds of characters were definitely written there...!
 How can you write somethin\' like that......?"
"Th‐...there were also characters written around the circumference......"
"I know.
 .................................Like this, right?"
Maria began jotting down Hebrew all around the circumference...
"It\'s from the Old Testament\'s Book of Psalms, Psalm 116, verses 16 and 17.
 ......You must at least read the Bible.
 Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi......"
Acting as though knowing this was only common sense, Maria laughed.
For a while, everyone, including me, was at a loss for words.
{n}...After some moments, George‐aniki returned to his senses, and slowly managed to speak.
"......That\'s incredible, I\'m surprised...
 ...So, what meaning does this magic circle have?"
"It\'s a magic circle to borrow the power of the sun.
 ......He who wears it as a talisman drawn in gold shall receive the power to break free from the bonds of any prison, and gain freedom."
"...Break free from the bonds,
 ......and gain freedom...?
 It sounds deep..."
"The word "bonds" is not limited in its interpretation to some kind of physical object.
 ...Therefore it does not only hold meaning for people locked up in an actual jail.
 It can also refer to the release from mental bonds such as ties of obligation and inescapable fate."
"......Ties of obligation...
and inescapable fate......you say?
 ...That\'s also pretty deep."
"But I really don\'t understand...
 What does this have to do with those six bodies?
 ...Far from bein\' released, they were killed and stuffed in a storehouse, weren\'t they?!"
"It\'s not like the magic circle was drawn for their sakes.
 The six of them were there for the sake of the magic circle.
 It is truly pitiable.
 ...Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi."
"What do you mean...?
 What in the world do you mean when you say the six of them were there for the sake of the magic circle?"
Maria lifted up her index finger and waggled it as if she were making fun of us.
"That\'s written around the circumference.
 Can\'t you read?
 Psalm 116, verses 16 and 17."
"......I\'ll read it for you.
 "The Lord has freed me from my chains.
 I will offer to you the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call on the name of the Lord."
 ......See?"
"See, you say...
 .........I have no idea what you\'re saying."
"............You\'re saying that...
...they\'re sacrifices?"
If the part that Maria had just read aloud was the vital part of the magic circle,
 ......then it was saying that the benefit of this magic circle required sacrifices to be offered in exchange.
...So inside the storehouse, where the magic circle had been drawn, the sacrifices had been offered.........
It looked like everyone else had slowly arrived at the same conclusion.
...Some were shocked, others spat out "they\'re insane" as they punched their knees...
......This was starting to become a seriously disturbing story.
{n}...And we couldn\'t accept it, nor understand it.
......I don\'t care what kind of magic circles or curses other people believe in—
that\'s their right, and I won\'t pick a fight with them.
...But did they really kill Dad and the rest as sacrifices for some bullshit like that......?!
I just couldn\'t stand that feeling.
......I\'d rather still be disgusted over all that talk around the inheritance...!
As I started getting pissed off with a feeling between anger and sadness, I broke from the circle everyone was in and returned once again to the window.
......Something had gone insane since yesterday.
That letter from the witch, {f:5:Beatrice}, that Maria had read aloud at last night\'s dinner.
...I feel like ever since that point, we...
...no, this whole mansion and this whole island...have begun to be drawn into some kind of peculiar world...
That\'s right.
 When I think back on it, that letter was an invitation from the witch.
The ruler of the nighttime island had invited us inhabitants of the day into another world.
With the phone and the radio interrupted, and the island shut off by the typhoon, you could now call it another world cut off from the real one.
......Yes, on this island right now, it is perfectly normal for witches to send letters, and for sacrifices to be offered to magic circles.
.........So what will happen next?
{n}Will some weird people wearing goat masks start doing the Bon Festival dance or something...?!
...Aah, it\'s no good, it\'s no good, I don\'t get it...
{n}The inside of my head\'s all screwed up, and I don\'t even know what to think...
Anger, sadness.
{n}The opposing emotions all swirled up together, and they started to suck me in.
Unable to resist, ...I could do nothing but cover my eyes with my hands and entrust my mind and body to the spiral swallowing me.........
.........As I started losing heart, I began to recall a distant memory.
It was from when I was very young.
I had unfortunately seen a scary occult movie on TV, and for a while, I hadn\'t even been able to go to the bathroom by myself.
...That old bastard had given an exaggerated laugh and said this:
......Hey, Battler.
 Why do you think they go to all of the trouble to make movies like this about demons and the occult and such?
It\'s \'cause they don\'t exist. ...Something that ridiculous can\'t be found anywhere on the planet.
\'Cause they don\'t exist, people want to see them and go to a lot of effort making them.
 That\'s why those occult movies just make me laugh.
If you ask me, rather than demons and monsters, this year\'s earnings call and angry wives are a hundred million times scarier.
I\'ll go further, alright? If you ask me...
being scared is an emotion for the entertainment of people who have too much time on their hands and too much empty space in their minds.
They have so much free time they don\'t know what to do with it, so in order to play around with unusual emotions, they created a culture of demons and monsters and stuff.
.............................................
{n}......Seriously, why have I been acting so damn thickheaded.
{n}I was totally taken in.
.........To hell with that shit, this is the human world.
{n}As if I give a crap about witches, demons, magic circles and sacrifices.
The human who killed Dad and everyone else is still on this island.
{n}That\'s all there is, right...?!
Next to start speaking to my heart was Kyrie‐san.
You know, in chess and shogi...
the deeper you proceed into the mating attack, the very last moment of the endgame, the more limited your best possible moves become.
......Therefore, in that very moment when you\'re backing someone against the wall,
 or someone is doing the same to you,
 both players\' moves become infinitely easier to read.
In other words, when you are completely cornered and you think you have no moves left, that is the moment when it is easiest to read your opponent.
......However, when a person is forced into a defensive position, they can\'t help but lose their ability to think clearly, so they forget to read their opponent\'s moves.
......That\'s when...
you "flip over the chessboard".
With all of my strength, I slapped my face with both hands.
{n}.........Now, my eyes were truly open.
When you don\'t understand anything, and you\'re completely cornered just like I am now, isn\'t that the perfect time to "flip over the chessboard"...!
With us put on the defensive, we couldn\'t even guess at the culprit\'s scheme.
...If you flipped it over and looked at it the other way, just how far could you see?
......First off, at the time the murders were committed by the culprit, they knew that the island was cut off by the typhoon.
So, they should have understood that even if they carried out the murders, they wouldn\'t be able to get away until the next morning.
In short, the culprit had begun without securing a way to escape.
Furthermore, the bastard had even tossed the corpses in the storehouse,
 while doing the courtesy of telling us "They are here" with that weird graffiti.
In other words, since we would probably find the corpses sooner or later, they wanted to "show us them".
......If we had all been dim,
 and hadn\'t noticed the storage shed, perhaps the culprit\'s goal "would not have been achieved"?
Hehe, if you think about it this way, that murdering maniac...
{n}Since this morning, he must have been watching our every move with bated breath.
After all, if we hadn\'t been so kind as to discover what was on the storehouse,
 all of that hard work and preparation that they had done last night would have just gone "poof".
What did the culprit want to make us feel by showing us the corpses in the storehouse?
All six of the bodies had had their faces noticeably destroyed.
{n}...A grudge?
 A warning?
The defacement of the bodies had occurred after death.
{n}So it hadn\'t been the means by which the culprit had murdered.
{n}It didn\'t mean anything to those who had been killed.
{n}...It had "meaning to those who discovered it".
The culprit wanted to show them to us—look how brutally I killed them!
Ha!
 After thinking this way, I really want to tell that asshole to stop taking me so lightly.
Who would dance to that tune? If I\'m told "Please be scared", I\'m not just gonna say "Really? Sure thing!"
...When someone tells the great Ushiromiya Battler "Entrance This Way", I\'m the kind of guy who\'ll start wanting to sneak in through the window!
The next thing that had me concerned was the attempt at a magic circle on the shutter.
...It was a genuine magic circle, declared authentic by even Maria, who had demonstrated that her knowledge of the occult rivaled Grandfather\'s.
They must have drawn that thing in pitch‐black darkness while holding an umbrella in one hand,
 and it must have taken them a lot of time—that\'s a formidable amount of hard work and attention to detail.
What purpose would have been worth all of that effort?
...If something related to the occult happened in this mansion, most likely, we would all automatically suspect the involvement of Grandfather.
Did they want to "make us think Grandfather was involved"?
But if that was all they wanted, they could have just drawn any old scribble that looked like a magic circle.
It wasn\'t like any of us amateurs could tell the difference between genuine and fake.
...However, this magic circle was genuine, and furthermore, it had even been written in Hebrew.
.........So this magic circle...
had a message “that could only be understood by someone with knowledge of the occult”.
Messages are a form of communication.
{n}......You send them, and hope for a reaction from the other party.
...Reaction?
{n}.........For some reason, we couldn\'t find Grandfather now.
I don\'t know how Grandfather could have managed to see the magic circle on the shutter,
 ...but had he chosen to hide himself in reaction to that sign...?
No, was it a trap to make us suspect Grandfather\'s involvement?
...You could read it either way—damn, that\'s annoying.
......What kind of reaction was the culprit hoping to get out of us by showing this imitation of the occult...?
Somehow, that felt like the culprit\'s weak point...
A section of {f:5:Beatrice}\'s letter that Maria had read aloud during last night\'s dinner sprang back into my mind.
......The part that said "I ask that you enjoy your battle of wits".
Sounds like fun.
 This is a battle of wits between us and the witch.
Which will be first, us being swallowed up by your occult games?
Or me revealing you for who you are?
......There\'s a whole day until the typhoon passes.
{n}Why not enjoy ourselves...?!
I finally noticed that the inside of the parlor had gone quiet again.
Everyone had sunk into their favorite sofas, some deep in thought,
 some irritated, some depressed.
Maria was once again enjoying the television as if she had never left it.
...It looked like she found the commercials more fun than the boring program, and she happily yelled "uu‐uu" and giggled.
I stared at each person\'s appearance in turn.
{n}If there isn\'t a 19th person,
 .........the culprit must be in this room.
...Right now, Aunt Natsuhi was searching the mansion with the servants, though, wasn\'t she?
......Then it shouldn\'t be "in this room".
{n}......“In this mansion” is what we should say.
...After all, there was also the possibility that Aunt Natsuhi was behind this,
 ...and we still couldn\'t deny that one of the servants could be the killer.
.........Anyone could be the bad guy.
Still, Aunt Natsuhi and the rest sure are slow...
Of course, it\'s not a small mansion, but isn\'t this taking a little too long just to walk around, checking the windows and doors...?
Just as I thought that, Aunt Natsuhi and the rest returned.
Not one of them was missing.
{n}......But our relief was short‐lived.
Everyone looked at Aunt Natsuhi, shocked...
".........!!"
......The talk I\'d had with Auntie Eva started to creep back into my mind.
The possibility that the culprits had enough in numbers,
 or weapons, to kill all of those six at once.
".........Sorry if I\'ve startled you.
 I brought this to be prepared for the worst."
Because that thing in Aunt Natsuhi\'s hand was a rifle.
At a glance, its silhouette looked a lot like a hunting gun,
 but it was unusually short, and kinda looked like a kid‐sized gun.
However, it had a thickness to it which revealed that this was definitely not some kid\'s toy.
"...Isn\'t that Kinzo‐san\'s gun...?"
"Did you know about it?
 That\'s right.
 I remembered that it was in Father\'s old collection, and I managed to find it."
"Whoa!
 Awesome...
 Aunt Natsuhi, is that thing real?"
"Yes, it\'s real.
 It can fire live ammunition.
 Long ago, Father used it to scare off wild birds."
"......Ah, I remember.
 Where could that have come from?
 No matter how much I asked him to let me touch it, he never let me lay even one finger on it."
"Huh...
 Grandfather had one of these...?
 I didn\'t know."
"Long ago, Grandfather was really addicted to westerns.
 That generation really liked this kind of rifle."
"It looks like it has some considerable history to it.
 But I\'ve never seen one this short before."
"Ahhhh!
 I remember that gun!!
 That\'s the one the gunman goes firin\' off with in that old movie I used to love!!
 Father sure has good tastes...!"
".........Long ago, the Master had that brought over specially from America.
 ...As you can see, it is a real gun, so I would ask that you keep this a secret..."
"He was quite tickled by it when he first got his hands on it.
 It seems the workings that ejected the cartridges were more interesting to him than shooting it, and he played around with it back in the forest all the time.
 Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho..."
"......Still, what a dangerous thing.
 Are you sure you should be dragging this out?"
"This is preparing for the worst.
 .........There\'s probably more than one of them.
 Furthermore, they are terrifying people who killed six of us, including my husband.
 ......I have the responsibility to protect everyone until tomorrow, in my husband\'s place."
As Natsuhi‐san said this, she slumped down into one of the sofas and took a deep breath.
As well as checking the doors and windows, ...she had also been trying to find Grandfather.
Since Grandfather was not with her, apparently his whereabouts were still unknown.
"...I carefully checked all of the doors and windows throughout the mansion.
 However, we must be prepared for anything.
 Everyone, I think it would be best if we all remained here."
"I agree.
 If everyone is gathered here, then we can all feel more secure by keeping an eye on each other."
".........What do you mean by that, Eva‐san?"
"Nothing really?
 I\'m just agreeing with your opinion, aren\'t I?"
There was a dangerous atmosphere between the two of them...
{n}If you thought about who stood to gain the most from the inheritance problem standpoint, Auntie Eva was the obvious answer.
...However, there was no proof that Aunt Natsuhi was innocent.
......No, if you view {f:5:Beatrice}\'s letter as Grandfather\'s elaborate prank,
 and think of this incident as just an extension of that, there was more than enough evidence to doubt even Grandfather.
Aunt Natsuhi thought that the criminal was on the outside.
{n}...But Auntie Eva thought the criminal was on the inside.
In short, it was the question of whether or not a 19th person exists.
.........It was the doubt that had been repeated endlessly since last night\'s dinner, with the letter from the witch who called herself {f:5:Beatrice}.
......So was the culprit among us,
 or not.
{n}And did the witch {f:5:Beatrice} exist,
 or not.
If you assumed that something as stupid as a witch couldn\'t exist,
 it was the same as saying that one of these relatives here, who shared a common bloodline, was the culprit.
If you didn\'t like that, it would be much more comfortable to simply accept the fairy tale about the witch.
............Did a witch do it?
{n}Draw that weird magic circle and sacrifice those people?
If I could only accept that rubbish, ...I would be able to completely trust everyone in this room.
However, damn common sense got in the way.
{n}......It kept repeating that witches don\'t exist.
......In that case,
 ............the culprit was among us...
In the middle of the seemingly endless rain, none of us could break our silence...
Lunch had ended, and the servants had removed the tableware, and were now in the kitchen.
{n}The wind and rain had neither weakened nor strengthened, and the island remained cut off from the outside world.
It seemed that, at first, Natsuhi had planned not to let anyone set one foot outside the room,
 but when it came time to prepare lunch, she finally realized that this was impossible.
However, in order to avoid having anyone alone in the kitchen, she told the three servants to go together.
Because of that, the servants were the first ones given the right to leave the stuffy parlor, which had been packed with eleven people.
......Since breakfast had immediately followed that terrible incident,
 and many of them hadn\'t eaten much, everyone tore into their lunches in silence.
"I will wash the dishes, so you can rest a while, Genji‐san, Kanon‐kun.
 ...Do you want something to drink?"
".........Nothing for me.
 .........Kanon?"
"......Nothing for me either."
"You two must have been so busy, and so early in the morning...
 It\'s no wonder you\'re worn out..."
The only sound was that of Kumasawa washing the dishes, which resounded throughout the kitchen.
Genji and Kanon sat in some chairs a short distance away, their eyes lightly closed.
Just as Kumasawa had said, those two had probably built up a great deal of fatigue.
But that didn\'t mean they could let it show in front of the relatives.
...Avoiding that was one of their virtues.
After the silence had continued for some time,
 .........Kanon opened his mouth and muttered.
"...............Shannon...
 ...............Why...did she have to die in such a horrible way...?"
"......Forget about how she died.
 .........It was nothing more than...bad luck."
".........You\'re right.
 ...It was nothing more than bad luck..."
They both fell silent once again.
 ...Kanon\'s expression was filled with grief.
"To think that Shannon‐chan\'s actually dead...
 I still can\'t believe it.
 ......Poor, poor Shannon‐chan...
 ......Not being able to meet her again feels like a lie...
 I just wanted to see that girl\'s smiling face one more time..."
Kumasawa spoke with her back facing them.
...Kumasawa hadn\'t seen Shannon\'s corpse,
 so she had no trouble mentioning Shannon\'s face.
...When Kanon heard those words, it reminded him again of how only half of Shannon\'s face had been left, and his grieving expression twisted even further...
".........Why did {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama do that to Shannon...?
 ......If she wanted a sacrifice, there were plenty of others to choose from...
 ......Why... ......Why...?!"
".........It was nothing more than bad luck.
 ...If chance had fallen even slightly differently, it could have been me or you lying out there."
"Or even someone else.
 ......Everything is left to fate."
"Genji‐sama.
 .........You said that the door to Madam\'s room was stained with traces of something like blood, right...?
 The same substance that was painted on the shutter?"
"......Yes.
 ...It was an unpleasant mark.
 Almost as though someone with blood‐stained fingers had been trying to pull out the doorknob,
 ...no, scratch through the door...
 ...That sort of unpleasant mark."
"So does this mean that...{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama came to visit Madam\'s room,
 ......and tried to open the door, but...
couldn\'t...?
 Is that what this means...?"
Genji thought back to the time he had seen those traces of blood on the door to Natsuhi\'s room...
With the substance sticking to the door around the doorknob, and the marks of something scratching against the door...
it had definitely appeared as though someone had tried to open the door,
 but couldn\'t...
"...Why...
......was Madam not chosen as a sacrifice...?
 If only she had been chosen,
 ......Shannon wouldn\'t,
 ......Shannon wouldn\'t have had to die..."
Just then, a loud, sharp noise resounded from the hall.
{n}Both of them turned around, surprised.
"........................Sounds like a pretty interesting discussion you\'re having.
 Let me join in too."
Battler was standing in the doorway to the kitchen.
"......Battler‐sama.
 Please, excuse me..."
Genji‐san and Kanon‐kun stood up, surprised, and hastily bowed.
...But I didn\'t care about stuff like that.
{n}I was more concerned with continuing their discussion.
"I told them I was going to the bathroom, so they let me go.
 I thought I\'d suffocate if I was locked up in that room any longer."
"...When I was about to come ask you for some water, I overheard something pretty interesting.
 ......You don\'t need to bow your heads or anything.
 Please, let me hear the rest."
"............That just now......wasn\'t really......"
"I\'ve been listening to you for a while.
 Don\'t try to hide it now."
"............So I\'ll ask directly.
 ...Who is this {f:5:Beatrice}?
 She\'s supposed to be a witch from a kid\'s story, but it doesn\'t look that way now."
"........................"
Kanon‐kun averted his gaze.
...It was obvious that he didn\'t want to talk about this,
 ...which only made me want to ask even more.
While making an effort to smile, I grabbed the collar of his shirt.
"......If it were last night, this\'d be none of my business.
 But after this morning, everything\'s changed.
 Now that Dad and the rest have been killed, this is totally my business.
 .........I have the right to listen to this suspicious story, don\'t I...?"
I glared into Kanon‐kun\'s eyes as he still continued to look away, in apparent pain.
...Since there was a big difference in our heights, Kanon‐kun had to stand on his toes, and it looked like it hurt a bit.
"............Battler‐san...
 ...Please let go of him...
 It\'s not like Kanon‐san is really hiding anything..."
"Then you won\'t have any problem talking about it, right?
 It\'s lonely being out of the loop, get it?"
When I tried to further twist up his collar, Genji‐san cut between us and spoke.
...There was a slight sense of resignation on his face.
{n}......It looked like he didn\'t plan on hiding anything.
".........I can talk about it.
 ......Kanon only hesitated because you might have taken it badly, Battler‐sama..."
"Hesitating isn\'t very manly, is it?
 Keeping it a secret\'s even more unpleasant."
"......Tell me about it.
 It\'s not like I have anything better to do before tomorrow comes.
 A slightly shady story might be the best way to stave off boredom."
After Genji‐san and Kanon‐kun looked at each other, they nodded as though they had decided to talk...
"......Understood.
 Please ask us anything.
 ............We will talk."
"Right.
 Then I\'ll ask."
"......Who in the world is {f:5:Beatrice}?
 ...All I know is that she\'s a witch who lives in the forest of Rokkenjima.
 ...I\'ve heard that it\'s a story that Grandmother or someone invented to keep people out of the dangerous forest.
 ......Is that wrong?"
"............No, ...it isn\'t wrong.
 It\'s as you say.
 {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama is a witch who dwells in the forest of Rokkenjima."
"......Battler‐sama.
 .........I don\'t expect you to believe this all of a sudden, but...
{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama exists.
 ...She is a real person, the one who gave the Master a vast amount of gold and who has worked by his side for many years."
"Huh...?
 Ah, come on...
 Is Grandfather paying you to repeat everything he says...?"
I laughed like it was a joke,
 but neither Genji‐san nor Kanon‐kun laughed,
 ......not even Kumasawa baa‐chan, who avoided my eyes, flustered, and started washing the utensils.
So unfortunately, I was the only one laughing.
 ...Painfully, bitterly.
"......I see now why you warned me, Genji‐san.
 ...Anyone sane would take this badly.
 ............So you\'re saying that a person named {f:5:Beatrice} actually exists?"
"......Yes.
 She has been working for the Master since before the mansion was built on this island.
 ...Most likely, she has been working for him even longer than I have."
"What do you know, Kyrie‐san\'s theory was off...
 ......Grandfather really did have a confidante called {f:5:Beatrice}.
 ......And she\'s on the island now...?"
"...............Yes.
 I believe that she is here."
"...That\'s a vague way to say it.
 I guess that means you haven\'t seen her face today or yesterday."
"......Yes.
 ......It is extremely difficult to say, but...
...umm..."
Kanon‐kun once again dropped his gaze, avoiding my eyes.
"...Come on, don\'t just stop there.
 That\'s like freezing an inch before the blow!"
I urged him on jokingly.
...However, it looked like Kanon‐kun was still unsure as to whether he should speak or not.
.........Then, Kumasawa baa‐chan whispered.
"...Hoh‐hoh‐ho...
 You cannot see her face,
 .........because {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama has no form..."
"............She has no...
......what?"
"{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama has no body.
 ...Therefore, unless {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama wishes it, common people like us are not able to see her form."
"I have heard that the portrait shows what {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama looked like back when she had a human form...
 ......I hear she often lingers in front of the portrait, yearning for her old form...
 ...Hoh‐hoh‐ho..."
"{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama sometimes changes her form into glittering butterflies and shows herself.
 ......On the rare occasion that you spot them somewhere in the mansion, there is a rule that you absolutely mustn\'t chase after them."
"It is whispered that you will meet with disaster if you follow them.
 ...In fact, there was a servant who broke that rule and quit because of a great injury."
"......Wait a sec, are you kidding me?
 Are you all serious about this......?"
"...Battler‐sama, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama has already arrived.
 Such language may be unwise."
"{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama is not fond of those who profane her.
 ......If you doubt her existence, you will surely meet with disaster."
"Battler‐san... You probably find this story unpleasant.
 But you know what?
 {f:5:Beatrice} does "exist", okay?"
"......She "exists".
 {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama has an exceptional dislike of that being called into question."
"............Don\'t you understand, Battler‐sama?
 ......{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama has already arrived here..."
"...Come on, quit it.
 I\'m weak against that stuff, you know...?
 You\'re freaking me out..."
However, there was no trace of a joke in the eyes of the three servants.
On the surface, I laughed and tried to look unconcerned, but I was quickly starting to sober up.
{n}...Their eyes were also sobering up fast.
"......Battler‐san... I beg that you stop profaning {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.
 Please trust me..."
Kumasawa baa‐chan, who was usually cheerful and would always tease people,
 ......now spoke with a totally straight face that I had never known her to make.
".........W‐......well...
 Sure you say she exists...
 But I don\'t see anything...
 Are you trying to say that she\'s standing right next to me or something?
 Quit joking around..."
"Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi......"
Just then, that unnerving laugh suddenly filled the kitchen...
...When I turned around, Maria was standing there by the entrance.
{n}...But her expression and the feeling about her, her presence...felt exactly the same as the servants.
"...Whether your wavelength matches or not is determined at birth.
 Battler, you were born with a mismatched wavelength.
 That\'s why you can\'t see her,
 can\'t meet with her,
 can\'t talk to her."
"...Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi.
 You\'re the type {f:5:Beatrice} hates the most."
Maria\'s laugh sounded like she was greatly enjoying herself, ...yet it was extremely eerie.
......It was almost like she was laughing at me because I alone didn\'t understand.
"Do you want to know about {f:5:Beatrice}?
 ............{f:5:Beatrice} is a thousand‐year‐old witch.
 ......She has all the demons at her command, and can harness the power of alchemy to create the philosopher\'s stone and a vast quantity of gold.
 Grandfather built up all of the vast wealth of the Ushiromiya family by making a contract with her."
"......Yesterday, I read {f:5:Beatrice}\'s letter, didn\'t I?
 That was real.
 ...Well, I guess it\'s pointless for me to try and force you to believe."
"...After all, it looks like you were born without a trace of the sixth sense.
 Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi...!"
"......What are you talking about?
 Witches, demons?
 Who told you that...?"
"Kihihihihihihihihi.
 I heard it from {f:5:Beatrice} herself.
 Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi!"
Maria kept doing that unpleasant laugh.
{n}...However, the servants who watched over this didn\'t even blink.
She heard it from...that witch in the portrait adorning the entrance hall.
{n}Maria kept on laughing in a weird voice, as though this was nothing more or less than the truth...
"...Maria, it might be rude to ask, but I\'ll ask one more time, okay...?
 Who gave you that letter yesterday?"
"I got it from {f:5:Beatrice}. How many times must I tell you before you understand?"
"......You don\'t get it, do you?
 You can\'t see her, I know.
 You can\'t believe it, I know!
 ...Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi."
Just then, Maria\'s laughter suddenly stopped.
".........Battler.
 You still can\'t tell?
 That {f:5:Beatrice} "exists"."
"She "exists", you say.........but where?"
"Like I said, {f:5:Beatrice} "exists", right here."
......That\'s right.
{n}Now that I think about it, I\'ve been feeling for some time now that the others haven\'t been looking in quite the right direction.
...I\'d figured that everyone had just been gazing into the distance, but......that wasn\'t the case.
The four here—Genji‐san,
 Kanon‐kun,
 Kumasawa‐san,
 ...and Maria—
 ......everyone except me—
 ...............was looking at a spot right behind me......
Holding my breath tightly, I slowly looked over my shoulder.
...Of course, there wasn\'t anyone there.
{n}I\'ve known that the whole time!
.........However, everyone in the room except me was focusing on that point as if there was someone there.
"{f:5:Beatrice} is a great witch of gold who has lived for one thousand years.
 ......But she can\'t show her form to humans of the wrong wavelength, and she can\'t talk to them."
"...And you know what?
 She finds that really sad.
 ...That\'s why she truly despises it when people like you, who were born without a fragment of magic sensitivity, deny that she exists...!"
".........You\'re lucky, Battler.
 Good thing that I gave you that charm yesterday, right?
 Who knows what kind of curse {f:5:Beatrice} would have put on you by now if you hadn\'t been carrying it around.
 ...You really are lucky, Battler.
 Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi...!"
".........Right, that scorpion keyholder.
 I\'d thought that was just some cheap gift or something, but I guess it really had some benefit, then?"
"Kihihihihihihihi.
 If it weren\'t for that, you\'d be lying in that storehouse as a sacrifice with your face crushed by now.
 Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi, you\'re so lucky, Battler...!
 Kihhihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi!"
"......I see.
 So if it weren\'t for that, I\'d have been killed by now......"
"Battler, why don\'t you believe in {f:5:Beatrice}...?
 Even though she "exists".
 Right now, over there, look."
"Kihihihihihihihi!
 Hey, I\'ll bet you want to believe it now.
 Believe it.
 And thank me for giving you that charm...!"
"If it weren\'t for that, you\'d be in the storehouse right now.
 But then, maybe you would have saved someone else in exchange, right?
 Kihhi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi!"
Pff...!
......Right then, I burst into laughter.
{n}Playing witches had been pretty fun up until a second ago, but unfortunately, that last one didn\'t quite hit the mark.
"Hahahahahahah.
 ......Then it\'s no goddamn good at all, is it, Maria?
 If that\'s true, then I\'m sorry, but it\'s no goddamn good at all."
When Maria saw me suddenly start laughing, she stopped.
{n}Even though she didn\'t understand what I was laughing at, she realized it wouldn\'t be pleasant for her.
".............................."
"I thought it might hurt you, so I didn\'t say it earlier, but..."
"......Although I thought I\'d put that charm you gave me in my pocket,
 I must have dropped it somewhere, you see?"
"......That means the charm can\'t be the reason I\'m alive now, and even though I should have been cursed by the witch, I\'m perfectly fine.
 ......Sorry, but I don\'t believe in things I don\'t see with my own eyes."
"Sixth sense?
 Wavelengths?
 Magic sensitivity?
 Sorry, but I don\'t believe in fake stuff like that.
 When I hear the girls in class start talking about how good or bad their ability to sense the supernatural is, it pisses me off!"
"...I don\'t know how much Grandfather is paying you, but if you\'re trying to talk me into joining some cult,
 believe me, you won\'t be able to do it that easily."
"...............Battler‐sama..."
"...You guys are free to believe whatever you want.
 But when it comes to whether I believe or not,
 that is always
 for me
 to decide!"
"Sorry, but I can\'t believe in something as shady as {f:5:Beatrice} until I\'ve seen her with my own eyes...!!"
I spoke forcefully and sharply...
{n}When I did, Maria started cackling again.
"Kihhihihihihihihihihihihi...!
 Well that\'s just fine, isn\'t it...?
 Eventually, even people like you with totally mismatched wavelengths will be able to see {f:5:Beatrice}."
".........Very soon, she will revive.
 {f:5:Beatrice} will revive.
 ......Once that happens, she\'s promised to talk with me and play with me a lot."
"...There\'s neither a need to doubt nor to force yourself to believe.
 ......She will appear, very soon.
 Kihihihihihihihihihi...!"
Some people usually head to the bathroom after a meal; others prefer to take a short nap.
It seemed that several people had gone out of the parlor, just like I did when I went to the kitchen to drink some water.
In the end, Aunt Natsuhi\'s order to keep everyone packed together in the parlor was reluctantly withdrawn, under the conditions that:
 no one was to be on their own,
 and no one was to go far from the parlor.
After all, if eleven people are shut up in the same room starting early in the morning, the air will start to stagnate.
...And now that a little time had passed,
 everyone had started to recover from the shock of that morning—maybe their sense of danger was weakening over time, too.
......However, it was a certain fact that six people had been killed inside this mansion,
 so no one was completely negligent.
So when they went out into the hallway for a breath of fresh air, trying to act tough,
 ......they would get scared of standing there, isolated, and would end up returning to the parlor.
...Like that fable.
 You know, "The North Wind and the Sun".
{n}If you force someone to stay shut in, they\'ll resist, but if you tell them to do whatever they want, they\'ll come back, obediently.
People sure are hypocrites.
.........When the servants finished cleaning up from the meal,
 they returned obediently to the parlor just as Aunt Natsuhi had told them to, and sat in a sofa near the entrance, patiently awaiting orders.
Maria, almost as though she had suddenly finished playing witches,
 had returned to the pure Maria I knew well, saying "uu‐uu".
...What in the world was that back there?
{n}.........I hadn\'t felt even an atom of the presence of this person called {f:5:Beatrice}, supposedly standing behind me, invisible.
...However, it felt like, inside Maria, I could catch a glimpse of a little of that presence...
"You\'re right.
 When Maria‐chan starts talking about witches, she changes.
 ...Battler‐kun, you also saw it down by the beach yesterday, right?"
"You mean when she gave me that scorpion keyholder?
 ...No, I don\'t mean like when her feelings were hurt,
 I\'m talking about when she looked like she had, you know, a dual personality."
"Aah, that happens sometimes too.
 ......Just like when Maria started talking about the magic circle, not very often, but it happens.
 It\'s freaky though."
Apparently, according to Jessica, the "Kihihihihihi" laughing Maria shows up every now and then.
This was just bad timing, and furthermore, it was the first time I\'d seen it, so it really shocked me...
"So what is that?
 Does Maria have a dual personality or something?
 Or are you saying that her spiritual sense really is that strong, and she gets possessed by stuff like that?"
"...No, I don\'t think it\'s that.
 Didn\'t you ever experience it?
 A desire to be someone other than yourself, when you were small."
Right when humans are born, no one has any individuality.
{n}However, when they reach their growth period, and their sense of self starts to be born, they start to gain a sense of individuality.
They want to be different from other people.
...But of course, they will find that they\'re no different from the others in their class,
 since they are learning the same thing in school and forced into the same lifestyle.
When they realize that, they start off by breaking the rules, in what\'s called the rebellious age.
{n}Since everyone follows the rules, they want to show off their individuality by breaking them.
...Even those who call everyone around them babies and stir up trouble...
are just cute kids searching for themselves when you look at them this way.
......Well, I\'m lecturing about all this like I\'m so smart, but I actually got it second‐hand from George‐aniki.
I myself was one of those embarrassing guys who thought it was cool to act like a little bastard...
Well, that was when I was the age where you try standing out for the opposite sex.
"At the very foundation of the growing period is an impulse to escape from being a kid, much the same as a chick trying to crack the shell of their egg.
 Do you know what the difference between a child and an adult is?"
"Age?
 Or physique?"
"No, it\'s experience.
 Adults look down on children because children have very little life experience.
 The reason they snort and look down on children whenever they say anything is because children don\'t know anything about the world."
"Yeah, I know what you mean.
 When you\'re a kid, you try to say things like you\'ve got life all figured out, and try to act like an adult.
 ...No matter what a kid says, adults will just snort at them because they\'re too naive or because they\'d "understand once they grew up" or something."
"...Well, it\'s probably true, but to a kid, it\'s just annoying, like they\'re being looked down upon."
"......I get it.
 It\'s about whether they have knowledge and experience.
 ...You\'re right, you don\'t earn respect just by becoming old and not achieving anything."
"Therefore, what we have is: a period where they have the impulse to escape from being a kid; and also, they want to have individuality, different from other people.
 If what separates kids and adults is knowledge and experience, then...?"
"............I get it, if they know something that no one else knows, that\'s one way to form an identity."
"When you\'re in, like, elementary school, if you knew stuff no one else knew,
 had stuff no one else had, wore stuff no one else wore, you could become a bit of a hero for it.
 I bet you did the same thing, Battler."
"Yeah, yeah.
 There was definitely an age when I wanted to excel in something.
 ...I see, that was because I was trying to separate myself from being a child, my growing period."
"If you look at it in a good way, the growing period, by forcing you to separate yourself from others, pushes you to gain skills and knowledge that no one else has."
"...This is also interesting from a sociological standpoint.
 Because people hate being like everyone else, they try to learn skills that other people don\'t know.
 In this way, society can acquire the broad range of skills it needs to survive.
 ...The quality of the gods\' programming is truly surprising."
"Well, individual personalities can also be negative, right?
 Like saying, everyone else in the class is studying hard, so I\'ll slack off so I stick out."
...That was actually me.
{n}It was only recently that I\'d finally been able to feel thankful towards that middle school teacher who had slapped me after school.
"But, well, I did have those desires to jump over the vaulting box that no one else could,
 or sprint as fast as I could trying to lap those guys with good grades when we did a marathon."
"...It was in my nature that, if I couldn\'t study well, then at least I could get back at them by exercising.
 ......I get it, I really went all out during my growing period."
"I guess boys do tend to focus more on physical things."
"But you know? Girls of the same age tend to focus more on emotional things.
 ......I\'ll bet there were groups of girls in your classes that were really interested in like, fortune telling and their spiritual senses."
"Yeah, yeah! There was, there was!
 They\'d come over, asking me for my sign and my blood type! And then they\'d laugh, "Aah, I thought so, *giggle*giggle*!"
 It really got on my nerves."
"No matter which class you go to, girls like fortune telling.
 There was always a group that went on about spirit senses being strong or weak, or "sensitivity", or seeing things that can\'t be seen."
"That\'s because fortune telling and spiritual senses are things that aren\'t taught in school.
 To girls, who unlike guys are more introverted,
 that\'s a genre which is easy to build an identity upon, and one that they find very interesting."
"Just like when boys enter their growing period, and start acting tough and rebelling against adults,
 when girls enter their growing period, they start getting interested in that kind of thing instead.
 ......Well, not me though!"
"......So Maria having so much interest in the occult isn\'t that rare among girls her age?"
...Even if you accept that, ...I wonder if it explains that creepy dual personality thing...
............Well, I think I can accept it vaguely.
"As I said before, becoming an adult means gaining knowledge and experience.
 So kids must study various things so that they can gain knowledge and truly awaken."
"...There is a specific kind of fantasy useful for this, which is and has always been prolific in the world of children.
 Do you know what that is?"
"You see it all the time in manga and anime, right?
 You know.
 Like, memories coming back to you from a former life.
 Or like, channeling the soul of the great whatever."
"Ah, there\'s also sleeping genes awakening,
 or sealed powers or memories returning...there\'s a lot of versions.
 For some reason, those kinds of things are really popular at that age.
 ...Why\'s that?"
"All of those examples you\'ve just mentioned are fantasies by which children can immediately add knowledge and experience to their childhood selves.
 Even a nine‐year‐old girl simply has to say that she has a thousand‐year‐old witch possessing her,
 and she can gain a 1009‐year‐old identity."
"So what you\'re saying is that for people who think studying is annoying,
 but want to learn different skills from everyone else and brag about it, and get attention from it, it\'s a convenient delusion."
So you can brag about something without having to work hard or study.
{n}......I see, isn\'t that a kid\'s greatest dream?
"Furthermore, their ideal self image is always self‐projected onto their desires to escape from being a kid,
 and it\'s not rare for that desired form to become established as an alternate personality."
"Even you, Battler‐kun, I\'m sure your character is a little different at home and at school, right?
 It would probably be embarrassing if anyone at school saw how you were at home.
 At school, you try to project yourself as you want to be, but home is where you are your true self."
".........So, in other words, I\'m changing my character for different situations.
 ......Are you trying to say that having multiple personalities is actually really common?"
"A girl who is a fan of the occult might say that she\'s being possessed, or has awakened.
 Honestly, there are some kids who can change their personalities so drastically, it can change your whole opinion of them."
"......Even some boys, right?
 Guys who just blow their top and get violent over nothing.
 I bet they think it\'s pretty cool, but it\'s painful to watch."
"So let\'s sum this all up.
 ...Girls of about Maria\'s age, even if they show a creepy second personality like she did a minute ago,
 you\'re saying that\'s not such a rare thing...?"
"If you bring it all together simply, that\'s what it means.
 ...Identity is an important thing used to build up one\'s sense of self.
 If you make fun of that, it could actually cause children to go back into their shell."
"So it\'s important to go along with them to some degree.
 ...Although to accept it completely requires the tolerance of a parent."
"......Aniki, I can\'t believe you aren\'t married...
 You sound like you\'ve already raised kids through middle school.
 .........Then, I wonder if Auntie Rosa also knew much about Maria\'s dual personality."
"She knew.
 .........Just between us, Auntie Rosa couldn\'t friggin\' stand it.
 She said it was creepy, and it was just making Maria more and more separated from the rest of the class."
"So any time Maria started talking about the occult or laughing like a witch, she\'d slap her.
 ...And it looks like Maria stopped talking that way in front of her."
.........Maybe it was just a little game, from a girl facing her growing period,
 ...that thing that had happened back there.
Just a girl trying to show that she was different and independent by holding interest in witches and the occult.
...And since she wanted to have another side to herself that wasn\'t infantile, she was switching between her normal personality and the personality of her ideal, a witch.
.........In the beginning, I had found that very disturbing,
 but after George‐aniki\'s lecture, it felt like this was a path that everyone walked down at one time or another.
......I haven\'t told anyone, but when I was in kindergarten,
 I joined up with a little gang of kids trying to form a Earth Defense Force, saying we\'d help protect peace on earth.
My face turns red when I remember how, during what we called battle practice, we would chant "EDF! EDF!"...
Just like usual, Maria was relaxing,
 immersed in the TV, "uu‐uu"ing and laughing just like any girl her age.
......But on the inside, another personality, that of the ideal witch that she admired and blindly accepted, was sleeping.
But that wasn\'t anything extraordinary; it was perfectly natural for a girl of her age...
............I calmed down a little.
{n}I had started to recover from the shock of my bizarre experience in the kitchen.
...If I hadn\'t talked to Aniki and Jessica, I might still have been frightened by the idea that an invisible witch was standing right behind me.
...However, ......can I really accept that as an explanation of what happened back there?
If it had just been Maria, I could have explained it as the fickle fantasies of a growing girl.
...But Genji‐san, Kanon‐kun, and Kumasawa baa‐chan had also been there.
None of them had denied what Maria said.
.........They had silently accepted that {f:5:Beatrice} "exists".
I was starting to feel a little uneasy...
Auntie Eva had claimed that no 19th person exists,
 saying that someone within the family had committed the crime in connection with their messy quarrel.
On the other hand, Aunt Natsuhi had claimed that the culprit was hiding somewhere outside the mansion.
That meant that she was denying that the crime had been committed by one of us, and accepting that a 19th person exists.
And in the kitchen, Maria and the servants had agreed that a 19th person exists.
But according to them, this 19th person isn\'t human.
{n}......They had said that it was an invisible witch, plotting something mysterious.
Is there a 19th person, or not?
{n}And is the culprit a human, or a witch?
For some reason, I couldn\'t just laugh off any of the possibilities.
{n}...Not even the most ridiculous one about the witch.
"......Jessica,
 all I know about the story of the witch is that it was a story made by the adults to keep the kids too scared to enter the forest, but...
...is it different here in the mansion...?"
"............Hmmm...
 I\'m with you on this."
"I think it was just a dumb ghost story made by the parents so their kids would listen to them.
 ......But I can\'t deny that the atmosphere inside the mansion makes it a little hard to say it out loud..."
"......Because Grandfather has proclaimed that {f:5:Beatrice} does exist.
 And because of their position, the servants can\'t doubt that.
 Jessica\'s mother and father don\'t want to get into a fight with him either, so on the surface, they go along with it."
"......So you could probably say that, inside this mansion, doubting the existence of {f:5:Beatrice} is a kind of taboo.
 Unlike the rest of us, who only come here once a year.
 ......Is that right?"
Jessica puffed out air in admiration...
{n}It looked like Aniki had guessed right.
"......You\'ve got it totally.
 No one really believes it on the inside.
 ...But on the outside, they accept she exists."
"See, it\'s just like the way some people are about gods.
 Even if you know there\'s actually no such thing, it feels rude to actually say that out loud..."
"......How do you think the servants feel about it amongst themselves?
 Is it true that, since Grandfather who employs them says she "exists", they have to go along with it...?"
"Well...
 I don\'t really know the details,
 ......but between the servants, the story about {f:5:Beatrice} has been treated a bit like a ghost story."
"...Remember yesterday, when Shannon was talking to us down by the beach?
 About how they saw unsettling things while doing the rounds in the mansion at night."
She had said something like that, hadn\'t she...
Back then, I didn\'t give it much thought, assuming she was just going along with the displeased Maria,
 ...but now that I think about it, she did say that, and completely seriously.
......That\'s right.
 She definitely said it.
...She definitely said the same kind of thing that Genji‐san and the rest had all unanimously declared back in the kitchen...
"In addition, some servants have also seen will‐o\'‐the‐wisps and glittering butterflies dancing around.
 ......Kanon‐kun also said he saw something like that when he went patrolling one night."
"And recently, the servants have been talking about strange footsteps inside the mansion near midnight.
 We have whispered together that the {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama from the portrait sometimes walks through the mansion invisible."
"...It happened a long time ago, but I have also heard those kinds of footsteps while patrolling at night."
......That\'s right.
 She definitely said that.
{n}Exactly the same thing that I had been told just now.
"Ah, ...but, there\'s nothing to be afraid of, you know?
 {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama is another ruler of this mansion separate from the Master.
 So, she won\'t do anything bad, as long as you respect her and don\'t act oddly afraid."
"However, she\'s fearsome if you don\'t respect her, right?"
"...Yes.
 I heard that someone who quit just before I began working, after falling down the stairs and receiving a large injury to their back,
 had been speaking badly of {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.
 Because of that, there was a rumor between the servants that {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama\'s anger had been brought down upon this person..."
"......If you don\'t respect her, her anger will be brought down upon you, and you will be injured.
 ...So, to the servants, {f:5:Beatrice}\'s existence...
is just as credible as the story that, if you pull pranks on {c:86EF9C:Inari‐san}, you will be cursed by the {c:86EF9C:kitsune}."
Of course, even though everyone accepts that curses and the like don\'t exist in the modern era,
 ...people are still afraid and still have a little respect for them.
You see it a lot even in residential areas, such as when someone is building a house, and they call a Shinto priest for a ceremony to honor the god of that plot of land.
...You might think that\'s just a big waste of time and money,
 but the workers say that a big accident will occur if they don\'t do it, so they apparently never neglect the procedure.
You also hear about how, if an Inari shrine is carelessly removed during a town replanning,
 there would be a curse by Kitsune‐sama.
I think I might have read somewhere that when the occupying forces were trying to expand an airport, and had to remove an Inari‐san that was in the way,
 all of the workers were suddenly taken out by some mysterious fever.
Even in modern cities like Tokyo,
 it isn\'t rare to see modern buildings packed all around an old Inari shrine, leaving the shrine itself untouched.
And this isn\'t limited to Japan.
{n}It\'s probably similar to how people baptize babies.
If I remember correctly, by the Christian doctrine,
 unbaptized souls, though their sin is the lightest, still fulfill the conditions for going to hell.
Putting water on a child\'s forehead doesn\'t do anything but make them cry.
But if a parent can prevent their child from going to hell with just that little effort, they will happily go through with that ceremony.
......In short, even in this modern society of reason,
 we are still unable to throw away every trace of belief and fear.
...You could say that it\'s a passive acceptance of the supernatural.
Maybe the only difference on this island was that {f:5:Beatrice} was the name that was respected here...
"...So, in other words,
 if anything happens that doesn\'t seem explainable in human terms, it\'s called the work of {f:5:Beatrice}."
".........I think Shannon‐chan was talking about it.
 About windows and doors that had definitely been properly shut or locked being open the next time they were checked.
 Lights that had been off being on, and lights that had been on being off."
"......And, if I remember right, Jessica, you used to joke that it was {f:5:Beatrice}\'s doing that you couldn\'t find your bag sometimes when you went to leave in the morning, right?"
"Good memory.
 ...Normally, you\'d say a fairy took them, but on this island, it\'s {f:5:Beatrice}.
 Man, what a stupid story."
"This mansion has been standing for about thirty years by now, hasn\'t it?
 It\'s natural for things that old to get their fair share of ghost and occult stories.
 Like the seven mysteries at a school."
"...............So here...
is where we "flip over the chessboard"."
"Huh?"
".........Basically, on this island, there\'s a rule that {f:5:Beatrice} can be blamed for anything that couldn\'t have been done by humans.
 Anything that the humans can\'t do.
 ......How many humans are there?
 There\'s 18."
"............In other words, the culprit is modelling things after this rule, trying to make it appear that this crime was the work of the witch.
 In short, they desperately want to claim this as the doing of a 19th person."
"............{i:I don\'t like it}.
 I really don\'t like it."
"What don\'t you like...?"
"............Just assume that an invisible 19th person existed, and that this person wanted to make it known that they existed.
 ......If it were me, I\'d do it with more perfect timing."
"......What do you mean by perfect timing?"
"...Well.
 After all, the crime took place after midnight while it was still dark, right?
 People were talking together until midnight, some people had the night shift, and some people had returned to their rooms and were sleeping."
"...Everyone\'s alibi is really vague, and there\'s plenty of room to suspect that the crime was committed by one of us.
 George‐aniki, Auntie Eva probably told you too, right?
 That there\'s a good chance that one of us is the culprit?"
"...mh......yes.
 ...I guess."
"......In other words, if the 19th person really existed and wanted to show themselves, this first crime was a complete failure."
"...No, in the first place, the timing was a mistake.
 If this invisible 19th person really wanted to show themselves,
 they had to make sure that the crime took place {i:under conditions which proved that the remaining twelve people were all innocent}."
"Unless there are no suspicious humans, they can\'t prove that they exist.
 So by killing them in the middle of the night, when everyone\'s alibi was at its most ambiguous,
 whether or not this 19th person exists was also at its most ambiguous.
 Even so, they chose that time to commit the crime."
"......By committing the crime then, it\'s obvious that one of the 18 would be suspected.
 ...Yet they took the name of the witch and handed Maria the letter, and everyone denies doing it."
"In other words, ......you\'re trying to say that one of the 18 is trying to make it look like a 19th person called {f:5:Beatrice} exists...?"
"That\'s pretty crazy......
 ...I think my mom\'s theory that someone is hiding outside the mansion is a little more credible...
 ...Battler, don\'t tell me you actually suspect that someone in this room is the culprit...?"
"Yeah.
 ...Someone trying to force us to accept that {f:5:Beatrice} exists.
 ......That\'s right, the letter last night is when this whole thing started.
 ...I don\'t have any basis or proof, but..."
"......With the chessboard upside‐down, this is my best guess."
"......Seriously, that\'s too crazy...
 Haven\'t you been reading too many weird detective novels...?"
"But it does hit on a point that we can\'t ignore.
 ......Whether there\'s a 19th person or not,
 the culprit is definitely planning something based around that rule about this island."
"......Just now, listening to Battler‐kun talk, I remembered something that\'s a little disturbing."
"Something disturbing...?"
"Yes.
 ......Do you remember?
 {f:5:Beatrice}\'s letter.
 ......It said that {f:5:Beatrice} was going to collect interest.
 And as for what that interest is, it said: everything of the Ushiromiya family."
Jessica and I thought back on what Maria had read aloud the previous night...
"...It said that.
 It definitely said that.
 That the collecting of the interest would now take place, but if the riddle of the gold could be solved, she would lose that right."
"...Grandfather was granted the gold, and the Ushiromiya house prospered.
 Basically, {f:5:Beatrice} is saying that everything he birthed from that gold counts as interest.
 ......In other words—"
".........That\'s pretty scary for a joke, Aniki...
 ......Don\'t tell me that everything of the Ushiromiya family—
in other words, everything that Grandfather gave birth to—
refers to everyone with Grandfather\'s blood flowing through their veins...?!"
"If you read the letter that way,
 ...these murders are just {f:5:Beatrice} legitimately collecting interest.
 ...If that\'s the case, these crimes will continue.
 ...Because the collection of interest is still only halfway completed."
George turned around, looking over the parlor.
{n}......There were still many people who held the name Ushiromiya.
And we knew that, since Gohda‐san and Shannon‐chan had been killed,
 not even the servants, who didn\'t bear the name Ushiromiya, would be spared...
"A‐...are we...
......all gonna be killed...?"
"...But that\'s weird, George nii‐san!
 Why only six people, then?
 They could have killed a lot more.
 In the worst case, it might even have been possible for them to assault us all while we were sleeping and kill everyone in a single night.
 Why didn\'t they do that?!"
"............The special clause.
 ...If someone managed to solve the riddle of the gold, the right to the interest would be lost.
 ......And remember how the very last part of the letter concluded?
 ...It said for everyone to try to solve the riddle of Grandfather\'s gold."
"Jesus...!
 ......It looks like we\'re finally getting close to understanding the culprit\'s message...
 In other words, the culprit is telling us to try and solve the riddle on that epitaph Grandfather had made.
 ......{i:Furthermore, they\'re saying that if we just sit around, they\'ll keep collecting the interest}..."
I realized that this was all based on several crazy guesses.
......But not everything that happens in this world is joined together in a perfect line.
...Most unknown phenomena are nothing but individual points.
{n}......By joining them together into lines, we deepen our understanding.
The closer together the points at the ends of those lines are, the more logical it is, and the easier to understand.
...And the farther away they are, the more it lacks those qualities.
{n}That is why we use a distance analogy, and call such theories "way out there".
{n}...However, if you can only join up to a small, limited distance away, we call it having a "limited imagination".
Is imagination different from reasoning?
{n}Was I just trying to force everything that I knew about the case to fit my simple imagination?
No, that\'s not it.
{n}When you\'re searching around with your hands in the dark, that search is imagination.
Only imagination can find the two points you should connect together.
{n}...Reasoning is nothing more than the action of drawing the line between them.
If you can\'t imagine, you can\'t reason.
{n}......What I was doing might be "out there"...but it shouldn\'t be wrong, either.
Only the power of imagination can pull out a clue from the darkness.
{n}......And the power of reasoning ties those clues together.
...It\'s a lot like the process of searching out an enemy\'s weak spot and striking.
It\'s alright if it\'s crazy.
{n}Find the weak point first.
{n}Then we can think about how to strike!
Now was the time to find the points that we could tie together later...!
For the time being, I put aside whether a 19th person exists,
 and announced the theory that the goal of the culprit might have been to make us solve the riddle of the epitaph.
Uncle Hideyoshi looked like he was really interested, but Aunt Natsuhi thought it was ridiculous.
"Of course.
 If you think about it that way, even that letter from yesterday makes sense.
 That motive seems to fit pretty well with the facts...!
 Settin\' aside whoever it was that gave Maria‐chan the letter."
"Uu!
 {f:5:Beatrice} exists!!
 Uu."
Even though she was puffing up her cheeks in that cute way she had been doing since yesterday, ...I couldn\'t think of it as cute.
...If I took it lightly, it might suddenly transform into a creepy laugh...
"...The hidden gold doesn\'t exist.
 However, the idea that we have a culprit who foolishly believes otherwise, wants Father\'s gold,
 and whose motive is to make us solve the riddle and then steal the gold from us, does indeed make some sense."
"However, in that case, why did they kill those most highly ranked in the Ushiromiya family first?"
".........A good point.
 If they wanted to make us solve the riddle, killing those closest to Kinzo‐san doesn\'t sound like a good plan to me."
"I agree...
 Besides, if we follow that argument, wouldn\'t it have been quicker if they had threatened Father in the first place?
 You\'d think it would be faster to just ask the person who wrote it, rather than try to force us to solve it."
"That\'s also a good point.
 ...\'Course, I don\'t think that Father would let it slip from any ordinary threat."
"Anyone who knows Kinzo‐san well would surely be well aware that he won\'t bow to ordinary threats..."
"......He is the man who bears the burden of the Ushiromiya family and all its wealth.
 He has been exposed to many threats and attacks in the past.
 It is because he was able to overcome them that the family prospers today."
"Totally agreed on that.
 I can\'t imagine our grandfather letting himself get pushed around just \'cause some asshole threatened him!"
"...Jessica, that is not how we talk."
"............u...
......yes."
"In that case, .........what about this one?
 ......No wait, is this "out there" as well...?"
...I couldn\'t hesitate!
 A crazy idea is like a bow and arrow.
...It might be hard to hit with, but it\'s a great weapon that can strike enemies from afar.
......Research shows that most people who have died in battles were killed by wounds from arrows.
......In a battle, you don\'t shoot off just one arrow.
You shoot off a whole bunch of arrows at once, and assault the enemy soldiers with a wall of them.
{n}......So shoot them, over and over!
 "Assault the truth with a wall...!"
"If the culprit is after the hidden gold, it would be very inefficient for them to force us to solve the riddle.
 Asking the person who made it in the first place would be much quicker and easier."
".........In that case, the question is,
 ...is this all a message directed at Grandfather?"
In other words, these murders were a threat directed at Grandfather.
{n}......If he didn\'t tell the culprit where the gold was, his family members would be killed off one by one.
What if we weren\'t the only ones being forced to solve this riddle...
 ...What if Grandfather was too?!
If you think about it that way, it explained Grandfather\'s mysterious disappearance.
If the culprit had attacked Grandfather, then judging by the state the six bodies were left in,
 he would definitely have been displayed somewhere with that horrible makeup added.
But despite that, we still hadn\'t found him.
 ......Did that mean that Grandfather had been kidnapped, and was being held somewhere?!
".........How could...
 .........You aren\'t saying, how could......!"
"*giggle*giggle*.
 That sounds interesting.
 ...So Father is being confined somewhere,
 and being threatened that if he doesn\'t tell them the location of the gold, we will be killed off one by one?"
"I struggle to understand what you find interesting about that...!"
Aunt Natsuhi threatened her, but Auntie Eva just smiled calmly.
"......Since we still haven\'t seen him after all this time, I think that it\'s almost certain that Grandfather has gotten caught up in the crime.
 When you think about that, you can\'t just ignore Battler‐kun\'s theory, right...?"
"Stay quiet, George.
 ......In the first place, when exactly was it that Father went missing?"
"...Who was the last one to see Father?"
".........It was probably me.
 This morning, when we were worried that we didn\'t know where my husband and the rest were, we were talking about how they might be in Father\'s study,
 and I went to check his room and greeted him."
".........Come to think of it, I\'ve been holding the key to his study the whole time, haven\'t I.
 Genji, let me return this to you."
Aunt Natsuhi pulled out the gold key and handed it to Genji‐san...
Looking at the key, Auntie Eva giggled...
"...Hey, Genji‐san.
 I\'m sure the police will inspect Father\'s room thoroughly anyway.
 ...It doesn\'t matter what you hide, it will just be exposed anyway.
 ......So you might as well just tell us about it right here, right now, don\'t you think?"
"............What are you talking about?"
"It\'s simple.
 .........Don\'t forget, Father\'s study is a locked room, with no way in or out except for that key.
 I want to double‐check how that\'s being defined.
 There is one entrance to Father\'s study.
 And also the windows?
 Any other entrances or exits?"
"............There are none.
 There is no way to get in except for the entrance."
"You\'re sure about that?
 There isn\'t some secret hidden door or anything?
 ......Since Father isn\'t here, I am the highest ranked member of the Ushiromiya family.
 I am asking you as a representative of the Ushiromiya family head.
 Understand that and answer me."
"Are there any ways in or out of that room other than the main entrance?
 ......As Father\'s closest aide, I\'m sure you know."
Aunt Natsuhi looked a little offended at the part about the "highest ranked family member",
 but she kept her mouth closed for the time being, and waited for Genji\'s answer.
......I couldn\'t help but feel a little uncomfortable.
{n}Why was she going on and on about hidden doors...??
"You too, Kanon‐kun, Kumasawa‐san—if you know, won\'t you tell me?
 If there is one, it would be better if you said it."
"...If there isn\'t, then someone is going to be very much driven into a corner in a second.
 ......If I\'m given that there is a hidden door, then my argument comes to nothing."
Auntie Eva didn\'t specify which person was about to be driven into a corner,
 ...but following the flow of the conversation, I had to feel that she was referring to Aunt Natsuhi.
"......Mother, ...what are you talking about?"
"George, stay quiet for a while.
 .........What do you say?
 Genji‐san?
 Kanon‐kun?
 And Kumasawa‐san?
 Is there a hidden door?
 Or not?
 Genji‐san, when you remodeled Father\'s study, you must have overseen the construction.
 I won\'t let you say that you don\'t know."
"............There is nothing of that nature in the Master\'s study."
"You\'re sure?
 What about Kanon‐kun, entrusted with the One‐winged Eagle?"
"......Yes.
 I\'m sure.
 ......There is nothing like a hidden door in the Master\'s study."
"Kumasawa‐san?"
"N‐......no, I haven\'t heard of such a thing..."
"What about Doctor Nanjo, who had a close relationship with Father?"
"......I, I have never heard of something like that..."
"Great!
 Then are you ready?
 Let me begin.
 It\'s really simple."
Everyone tilted their head doubtfully, wondering what Auntie Eva was so proudly starting to talk about.
...Auntie Eva laughed triumphantly, as though she were about to reveal a secret that only she knew.
"Natsuhi nee‐san was the last person to spot Father, right?
 ...I forget the exact time, but I think it was a little before nine in the morning."
"......Nee‐san, do you remember?
 I ran into you just as you were coming out of Father\'s study, right?"
"......Yes, I remember.
 What does that have to do with anything?"
"And the next time you went to visit Father\'s study?
 That was after we had found the bodies of Nii‐san and the rest, right?
 Together with me, you went up to the study to report that, and we discovered that he wasn\'t there."
".........By the way, Nee‐san.
 At that time, when you went to enter Father\'s study, did you notice anything?"
".........Notice anything?
 ...What are you talking about?"
"Come on.
 You picked up some trash, right?
 A folded receipt."
"......I do seem to remember picking up some trash.
 What does that have to do with...?"
"I got that receipt when I bought some candy at a store in the airport."
Auntie Eva pulled a small bag of candy out of her handbag.
"...Aah, the receipt from when you bought that candy?
 ...But, Mother, what does that receipt have to do with anything...?"
"George, stay quiet and listen for just a little longer..."
Uncle Hideyoshi\'s expression was a little strict.
{n}...Somehow, it seemed that he understood what Auntie Eva was getting at.
"It was really just on a whim, you see?
 It wasn\'t out of any foresight,
 and I certainly wasn\'t planning on setting a trap for you or anything."
"......Actually, this receipt...
 You remember, Nee‐san, that just after you met Father and left, you met me, right?
 At that time, I stuck this into the door to the study."
"......So, what does that mean?
 Does it mean that, until Aunt Natsuhi picked up that receipt, no one had opened the door...?"
"W‐wait a second, Auntie Eva...!
 Sticking a receipt in would be obvious!
 It\'s possible that, when Grandfather opened the door, he noticed it, found it interesting, and stuck it back in the door..."
Jessica hurriedly argued back.
...She still didn\'t really know what it meant,
 but she realized that, whatever it was, it was placing some kind of suspicion on her own mother.
"Of course, I folded the receipt up very small so that no one would notice it.
 But even if you assume that he saw it fall, he would have no way of knowing how high up the door it had been stuck, right?"
"I checked it while Natsuhi nee‐san was taking the key out.
 The receipt was still stuck not one millimeter away from where I had put it...!"
"I, ......I can\'t understand why you would pull such a childish prank!
 I, I\'ll bet you were the one who did that prank on the door to my room, too!"
"......The door to your room?"
"...It was unpleasant to talk about, so I didn\'t,
 but this morning, when I woke up, there were the signs of some prank on the outside of my door, with what was probably the same red paint that was scribbled across the shutter.
 There were some unpleasant marks, as though someone had been tearing at the door..."
"Wait, what is this!
 Why have you been silent about this until now...?!!"
"My apologies.
 Since so many horrid things have happened since then, I had completely forgotten about it until just now."
"I don\'t know or care about that.
 I am not talking about your door, but the door to Father\'s room, okay?
 After you checked that he was in his room, and until we made sure that he wasn\'t, that door wasn\'t opened even once.
 How did Father get out if he didn\'t use the door?"
".........I, ...I don\'t know that...!
 That\'s what I want to know!!!"
"Natsuhi nee‐san, other than you, who else checked to see whether Father was in his room?"
"The last time I met Kinzo‐san was when we were playing chess last night...
 ...I believe I was with him until just before dinner......"
"Did anyone see him after that?"
"...............I did.
 I gave him his dinner last night."
"......Yes.
 Shannon and I were with him."
"So up till then, Father was still definitely in his room.
 ...But, Natsuhi nee‐san.
 It sounds like when you found out he wasn\'t there, all ways in or out of the study were closed, right?
 ......But even so, you said that you met and talked with him this morning."
"......I, ......I don\'t understand why everyone has become so gloomy.
 ...Could someone explain it to me...?"
"M‐......Mother and Father, are you...
......saying that what Aunt Natsuhi says about meeting Grandfather this morning...
...is a lie?"
"Wh‐why the hell would she tell a lie? Mom\'s innocent!!
 Why the hell would she lie!!"
"Jessica!
 I keep telling you to watch your language!"
All at once, everything became confused...
From across the parlor table, Auntie Eva and Aunt Natsuhi confronted each other,
 while George‐aniki confronted Jessica...
 ......What the hell is going on...?!!
"Remember, it\'s only up until last night that we have multiple people saying they saw him.
 But the only one who claims that they saw Father since this morning is Natsuhi nee‐san."
"......And then there\'s that strange fact we learned from the receipt.
 ...So, how can we connect these points together...?"
Auntie Eva urged everyone to work their imaginations...
......Sure, that receipt could become an important point.
{n}...But I didn\'t know what other point I could draw a line towards...!
The answer Auntie Eva was hoping for...
......was that Aunt Natsuhi had lied to make it seem as if Grandfather had been in that room this morning.
And Auntie Eva\'s mere whim had exposed that......??
"That makes no friggin\' sense!!
 Why the hell would Mom lie?!!
 She has no friggin\' reason to!!"
"......That\'s what I want to know."
"But Jessica‐chan.
 You can\'t say that there\'s no possible reason for her to lie about Father being in the room, right?
 You see it every once in a while in detective novels, don\'t you?
 That trick of confusing the time of death to create an alibi."
"Wh‐what are you talking about?!
 I\'ve never even heard of that!!"
"...We still haven\'t found Father yet, but if you think about it normally, it would be natural to assume that he has already been killed.
 In that case, we should expect to find his corpse soon."
"...If, at that point, the time of death could be faked, Natsuhi nee‐san would be able to create an alibi.
 ......Do you understand?
 Everyone?"
...This morning, when Aunt Natsuhi went to check that Grandfather was there, she lied,
 ...and he was already dead at that time?
...And, she moved the body to some location, and disguised it to make it seem like he had just been killed there.
......And then she could stay with everyone else to prepare an alibi.
......And then, she could say "I heard someone screaming!"
 or something and dash over there, and become the first to find the body along with everyone else... Is that what Auntie Eva\'s saying......?
"How preposterous.
 Detective novels are nothing more than indulgent entertainment!
 You can only think of such an indiscreet idea because you read them all the time!"
"Yeah!!
 Even if she tried to fake the time of death a little, all of that would be blown away in an instant once the police did their autopsy!!
 It might have fooled the people in old books, but do you seriously think that kind of trick would fly in modern Japan?!
 Are you insane?!"
"......You think so?
 This morning, when Doctor Nanjo looked at the corpses, he was only able to give a vague estimate of the time of death, right?
 Autopsy results are affected greatly by the corpse\'s surroundings and individual peculiarities.
 It\'s a very rough estimate with an uncertainty of several hours."
"And, unfortunately, the police\'s scientific investigation will have to wait until tomorrow.
 Measuring the exact time of death after that, even in modern Japan like you said, wouldn\'t be that easy, you know?
 Right, Doctor Nanjo...?"
"............Examining a corpse is an extremely difficult task that requires both experience and instinct...
 I have heard that there is a very high rate of mistaken diagnoses...
 I imagine it is very possible for a misreading of just a few hours to occur..."
"...However, for an alibi, that\'s more than enough!
 It\'s not just a trick for the classics!
 It\'s a trick that actually works!
 ......Natsuhi nee‐san.
 It\'s not like we want to suspect you, alright?
 We don\'t, an\' that\'s why we just want you to prove you\'re innocent."
"What is this innocence you want me to prove?!!
 This morning, I definitely met with Father!!
 And he told me to keep the One‐winged Eagle engraved in my heart...
 ......Are you denying that he said that, too?!!"
"I will definitely not permit that!!
 I won\'t permit you to deny that Father said those words!!"
"......Maybe Father\'s body won\'t appear at all?
 Normally, a person has to be missing for seven years before they\'re officially declared dead.
 Wouldn\'t that be a clever way to extend Father\'s nearly finished life another seven years and keep all of his wealth for yourself!"
"I, I cannot abide this!!
 I cannot abide any more from you!!"
"I am Ushiromiya Natsuhi!!
 Although I do not have the right to wear the One‐winged Eagle on my body, it is certainly engraved in my heart!!
 Speaking that way to the wife of Krauss, successor to the head—to the person who will act as such in his place—absolutely disgusting!!!"
"What\'s thiiis?
 Are you going to shoot me with that gun?
 Go ahead, then?
 Why don\'t you just shoot?!
 You\'re just desperate because you can\'t think of a way out, aren\'t you?!
 Do it, just try to obscure the truth with violence...!!"
"Y‐......youuu!!!!"
It wasn\'t like Aunt Natsuhi had been actually holding that gun at the ready and threatening anyone.
{n}But after she was told to by Auntie Eva, she did hold it at the ready!
...Unsurprisingly, once things got to this stage, Jessica and Genji‐san tried to stop her.
"...Madam, please, calm yourself......!"
"Mom, you aren\'t lying!
 So there\'s no reason for you to listen to this!!"
"......Calm down, Natsuhi nee‐san.
 Don\'t you just have to swear that Father was definitely in that room?
 Why are you getting so worked up over that...?"
"...Th‐...that\'s right.
 Natsuhi‐san isn\'t lying.
 Isn\'t that the end of it...?"
"Then I want you to explain.
 How did Father manage to disappear from the room?
 ...The windows were closed tight from the inside.
 And the door too, remember!"
"......If you really met with Father this morning,
 ...then you must explain how he disappeared from this "unopened door" locked‐room scenario.
 If you don\'t, that would mean that you are a liar after all, right?"
"How far do you plan to mock me......?!!!"
"If you want to argue back, go ahead!!
 That\'s right, try explaining it right here, right now.
 After that, I can apologize to you for doubting you.
 How did Father manage to get out from that locked room?!!"
"I can\'t explain that, and I don\'t need to!!"
"Really?
 Then let me explain it!
 We\'ll take the best parts from my perspective and yours, and come up with a more friendly explanation!
 ......I\'ll believe that, like you said, Father was still in his room this morning."
"But the next time the door was opened, Father wasn\'t there.
 You don\'t have any objections so far, right?"
"I have no desire to listen to anything more you have to say!!
 Shut your frivolous mouth!!"
"My reasoning goes like this, alright?
 I verified on both occasions that you were the only one to go through that door.
 And the receipt is proof of that!
 So what is the answer to the puzzle of how Father was sent out of the room regardless?"
"The window!
 He was sent out the window.
 ......Natsuhi nee‐san, you pushed Father out of the third‐story window of the study into the courtyard!!!"
"YOU....VICIOUS MALCONTENT!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Madam, please, endure it...!!"
"Eva‐sama... Please stop this.....!!"
"Father died from the fall into the courtyard,
 and when you left saying you were going to check the doors and windows, you went and hid the corpse somewhere!
 That was probably when you took some measures to fake the time of death, right?!"
"......This all ties in with the case regardin\' Krauss nii‐san and the rest, and also the case regardin\' {f:5:Beatrice} last night!
 There\'s an extremely good chance that Natsuhi‐san is suspicious in those cases...
 Normally, I wouldn\'t want to say this."
"...But now it\'s out in the open, there\'s nothin\' else I can do...!
 Please, Natsuhi nee‐san!
 Please explain how you can be innocent!!
 Or else, I can\'t help but suspect you...!!"
"Why me?!!
 Why must I, Ushiromiya Natsuhi, be insulted like this!!!!!!!!"
...............Hmm.
 ...Looks like everyone else has said their piece.
"Ihihihi.
 ...No good. {i:No goddamn good at all},
 Auntie Eva."
"...Wh‐...what do you mean "no good", Battler..."
Jessica looked up at me, hanging on to my every word.
{n}Auntie Eva\'s expression was composed as always.
"......No good at all, you say? What is?
 Battler‐kun.
 Tell me."
"You can only see this from one angle—that\'s why you\'re convinced that it has to be Aunt Natsuhi.
 ...It\'s not like I\'m defending her, but bluffing a checkmate like that isn\'t gonna work."
"I think the theory you\'ve based around that receipt is passable.
 It\'s not a bad thread of logic.
 But I\'d only give it a grade of 65 at best.
 If this were an exam, that\'d be bad enough to get you extra lessons in detention, you know?
 Ihihi!"
"...Oh my. Well, how would you break through a door sealed by a receipt, and make Father disappear? Other than by my theory?!"
"Your theory is interesting, I admit.
 And if we could state definitively that there was no way to make Grandfather disappear other than yours,
 then we could say for certain that the last person to see him, Aunt Natsuhi, has to be responsible."
"However, since there still is a possibility that she is innocent, and that these accusations are false, you can\'t make that claim!!"
"......Hmm. Then, Battler‐kun, who are you saying could have made Grandfather disappear, other than Natsuhi nee‐san?
 It would be impossible for anyone else to do it.
 My receipt proved that, right?"
"From the first time she visited that study,
 and until the second time when we visited it together, the study was a perfect locked room, and when the seal was broken on the locked room, he was already missing!
 If this doesn\'t prove that she was the culprit, what kind of trick could they have used?!"
"Like I said, Auntie Eva, only 65 points.
 So, let\'s try "flipping over the chessboard", shall we?
 It\'s not about how they managed to make Grandfather disappear from the outside.
 Think about how Grandfather disappeared from the inside."
"The door had the receipt stuck in it, so it couldn\'t have been used.
 He also couldn\'t have gone through a window, because they can\'t be locked from the outside, and when you visited the study, you checked to make sure they were locked.
 So the windows also weren\'t used.
 At that point, the study really was a locked room.
 We have to accept this!"
"However, the study didn\'t remain a locked room forever.
 Once the seal created by the receipt was removed, it became possible to use the door, and possible to escape through the door."
"...In other words, it\'s not about how Aunt Natsuhi made Grandfather disappear.
 ...We need to think about how he was able to escape!!"
"Grandfather\'s study isn\'t any ordinary study, right?
 According to Genji‐san, there\'s a toilet and a kitchen and even a bedroom, almost like a little house.
 ......If he hid under the bed, for example, he could trick the two of you into thinking he\'d disappeared, right?"
"Auntie Eva, even you didn\'t check that carefully, did you?
 And then the two of you went back down the stairs, thinking that he wasn\'t there."
"At that time, the receipt was already gone!
 In other words, if Grandfather was hiding in his room the whole time when it was a locked room,
 and escaped after letting the two of you go past him, we can crack this locked room right open!!"
"Wh‐what is this?!
 Why would Father want to do something that weird and then escape the room?!
 Don\'t be so absurd!"
"Yeah, it might be absurd.
 However, it still shows that there is a possibility that Aunt Natsuhi is being accused falsely.
 Your receipt wasn\'t perfect.
 In chess, we might call that check,
 but it isn\'t checkmate!!"
"And the thing that I like least,
 is how you pressure Aunt Natsuhi to explain it, and then argue that if she doesn\'t, she must be guilty!
 If that passes as logic, then why don\'t you let me......"
"...flip over the chessboard one more time!!"
"Auntie Eva, according to your argument,
 ......you must explain to us here and now why you and Uncle Hideyoshi couldn\'t have killed those six last night and then casually returned to the guesthouse...!"
"You\'ve been trying to force Aunt Natsuhi to explain.
 I\'m sure you can prove your own innocence, right?!
 Auntie Eva, who\'s had all of Grandfather\'s wealth suddenly dropped right into her hands!!"
"Th‐that\'s right, you\'re pretty damn suspicious yourself, aren\'t you!!
 If you say Mom\'s suspicious \'cause she was the last person to see him,
 then what about you, Auntie Eva, who was the last person to see Dad and the rest?!!
 Just like Battler said, prove that you two weren\'t the ones that killed them!!"
".........Mother, I also think that your reasoning was a little overeager.
 ......I\'m sure that the receipt was an important hint."
"But, like Battler‐kun said, that\'s not enough to prove that Aunt Natsuhi is guilty to any degree.
 ......We\'re all equally suspicious.
 It\'s not right for only Aunt Natsuhi to be persecuted."
"Our, our noble father, crawling on the floor under his bed?
 You call nonsense like that an explanation?!"
"Then why don\'t you explain first?!!
 Who killed those six, and how, and then try showing us proof that you weren\'t involved!!"
"......*cough*,
 *cough* *cough* *cough*,
 *cough*,
 *kof*!!!
 uu, *cough* *cough* *cough*!!
 *coughCOUGH*!!
 *kofkofkofkof*!!!"
"Milady... Milady...!!"
Jessica suddenly started coughing.
 At first I thought that she was just choking after yelling too loud, but it seemed to be lasting too long for that, and she really looked like she was suffering...
Jessica kept coughing and choking, down on her hands and knees...
"Jessica... Hang in there...!!
 Doctor Nanjo...!"
"...Jessica‐san, your inhaler, quickly.
 ......No, wait, I have one with me."
Doctor Nanjo pulled a bronchodilator inhaler from his own bag, which was lying on the sofa, and handed it to Kanon‐kun.
......Come to think of it, six years ago, didn\'t Jessica sometimes break into violent coughing and have to use that...?
But six years ago, I never saw Jessica look like she was in this much pain.
"......Aniki, was Jessica\'s asthma always this bad...?"
"It\'s gotten a lot worse these last few years...
 It\'s no problem when she\'s normal...
 But when an attack comes suddenly, she can\'t stop coughing."
"*cough* *cough*!!
 uu, ga*COUGH* *coughcough*!!
 *kofkof*, *kofkof*!!"
"......Milady, your medicine.
 .........Here..."
"...............nnn...
...
 ......*coughcough*!!"
Taking the inhaler from Kanon‐kun, Jessica used it with a practiced hand.
...For a while, it looked like her throat was still feeling itchy, but it gradually settled down...
"Are you alright, Jessica...?
 You scared me..."
"......It\'s no big deal.
 ...Don\'t worry about it..."
Beads of sweat covered Jessica\'s whole body and she couldn\'t hide her rough breathing, but it looked like her sudden attack had calmed down for now...
This disturbance had left the room\'s hostile atmosphere in an awkward, unsettled state.
But that was fine.
 ......There was absolutely no need to be driving up everyone\'s suspicions of each other.
When you think about it, even probing at each other\'s alibis and searching for the killer were probably completely unnecessary.
After all, we\'re just powerless, ordinary people,
 and when the police come tomorrow, they\'ll definitely employ cutting‐edge techniques and investigate the case thoroughly,
 solve all of the riddles and arrest the killer...
"............I wonder if Battler‐kun is right after all.
 ...Just like Natsuhi nee‐san is suspicious, I can\'t ignore the fact that we are suspicious too.
 Arguing about that now is certainly unproductive.
 ...Everything will be fine if we just leave it to the police tomorrow."
".........But don\'t you want to know too, Battler‐kun?
 Who the killer is?
 ...Don\'t you want to let them know right this very second the pain you feel from losing someone precious to you?"
".........I won\'t deny that.
 Even one day would be too long to let the bastard who pulled this detestable bullshit go."
"......But that doesn\'t mean that I want to doubt one of the 18.
 Even though I said what I said earlier, I don\'t even want to doubt you, Auntie Eva.
 ...To me, you\'re an awesome aunt who\'s always mischievous and entertaining."
"......I don\'t want to trade insults with an aunt like that.
 Not a single person here wants to do that.
 .........Right?
 Everyone?"
"..................I feel the same as Battler‐kun.
 ...It\'s pointless to trade insults.
 ......It\'s probably just the stress built up because so many people have been crammed in one place since morning."
"......Probably.
 It is only natural...
 It may be easier said than done, but I think we should all relax as much as possible..."
"...............Eva.
 Don\'t you think we should cool our heads?
 ...I do think the receipt is gonna be an important clue in searchin\' for Father\'s whereabouts.
 We should tell the police about it when they come..."
"...Yes, you\'re right.
 ...Yes.
 I just felt a little triumphant when I figured out that part with the receipt.
 ......Of course it isn\'t fair to only doubt Natsuhi nee‐san.
 We\'re just as suspicious."
"......But still, Battler‐kun?
 At least the part about the receipt is real, alright?
 ...Don\'t forget this.
 And try thinking deeply about what this means, okay...?"
"....................."
"...................................."
Auntie Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi stood up.
{n}It looked like they planned on leaving the parlor.
"In the end, it\'s pointless for us to continue playing detectives.
 After all, the police will reveal everything in the end anyway."
.........That\'s right.
Even if we don\'t play this detective game, when the typhoon passes,
 ...and those lively seagulls return to the harbor, everything will settle itself.
Yes.
 If you think about it, this kind of crime is completely trivial.
......It will definitely be resolved—
even if we do nothing—
{i:when the seagulls cry}.
"...Natsuhi nee‐san, I\'ll take it that you don\'t want to see my face anymore?
 I feel the same.
 ...If I remember correctly, yesterday, you had some rooms prepared for us in the mansion so that we wouldn\'t need to go back to the guesthouse, right?"
"There should be a bath and a toilet there, as well as a lock and a chain to secure the door.
 There\'s even a bed to lie on, and my husband will be able to watch TV without having to fight with Maria‐chan over which channel to watch, okay?"
"....................................
 ......You may do as you please.
 ...But...make sure to be cautious."
"Thank you, Nee‐san.
 ...And mind your own business.
 I\'ll be counting on you to keep an eye on everyone, alright?
 Because the killer is definitely among us.
 ...And Nee‐san, make sure you don\'t forget that you\'re being watched, too."
".........Haven\'t you made enough parting remarks?"
"...Yes, that\'s enough.
 .........See you, Natsuhi nee‐san.
 ......Genji‐san, please call for us when it\'s dinnertime.
 Until then, we\'ll keep ourselves locked in with the chain."
"..........................."
"......Genji, Kanon.
 Escort them to the guest room."
"We\'ll be fine.
 I don\'t want to end up being escorted by the killer.
 In fact, I would be more comfortable if nobody left this room until we reach ours.
 .........Let\'s go, George."
"...............I\'ll stay here with everyone else."
"George...!
 The killer is in this room.
 Do you plan on staying in a place like that...?!"
"......Leaving this room...would be the same as suspecting one of my relatives.
 ...I......refuse to believe that anyone in our family is capable of something so horrifying."
"George...!
 ......Honey, say something to him...!"
".........George is already an adult.
 ...If his code tells him not to leave this room, then it\'s up to him.
 Let him do what he wants..."
"...Father..."
Auntie Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi left.
{n}The only voice that called after them was the sound of the rain.
The parlor was being buried beneath the savage atmosphere...
{n}When I looked at the clock, I was surprised to find that it was already evening.
.........Had we really spent that much time worrying, talking, fighting about such needless things...?
Feeling bored, I started clawing at my head, when...
...Maria and I made eye contact.
Since I had thought she was completely immersed in the TV, I was a little surprised.
"......I\'ll believe it now."
"Uu...?"
"The letter, the murders, everything—it was all {f:5:Beatrice}.
 ...No, actually, I wish she would just come out and say that was true.
 .........I want it to be the work of a 19th person.
 Otherwise, the 18 of us will have to keep on doubting each other...
 ...I think believing in a 19th person is better than that..."
".............................."
"...Bringing Grandfather outside without opening the doors or windows must be a piece of cake for {f:5:Beatrice}, right...?"
Maria, after taking a single, short breath, hung her head, ......and then raised her face again.
"............That\'s right.
 Kihihihihihihihi, locking a door is useless against a witch.
 ......{f:5:Beatrice} is familiar with all 72 demons.
 The 33rd ranked, Gaap, gives the power to instantly carry the desired person to any location."
"...To her, taking a person out of any locked room isn\'t hard at all, you see?
 Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi..."
"Witches sure are incredible.
 ......Tell her, if she still plans on committing another crime, to do it in a way that no human could,
 ......to make me believe that a 19th person,
 ......no, a witch, exists."
".................................Kihihi.
 ......Alright.
 If I meet her, I\'ll tell her."
Dammit...
 I don\'t even understand my own thoughts anymore...
When I\'m led to believe in a 19th person, I deny it, and when I\'m led to believe that there are only 18 people, I deny that too.
Even though I wish that there were more than just the 18 people here, I can\'t accept the existence of that 19th person.
......In short, even though there are more than 18 people, there are less than 19.
{n}......The number of people in this mansion is 19>X>18.
{n}So the number of people can\'t be represented by an integer.
......However, it\'s impossible for there to be anything after the decimal point.
{n}You shouldn\'t be able to represent the number of people with anything but an integer.
...And yet, 19>X>18.
{n}Why does a fraction less than 1 play into this...!
It\'s no wonder.
 ...That 19th person is an {i:invisible being, that can\'t be {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen}}.
{n}That\'s why, in the integer representation that must be used to describe numbers of people, she {i:can\'t be {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen}}.
That witch cannot be {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen}.
{n}Because {f:5:Beatrice} has no body.
{n}Therefore, she is invisible.
Is there a 19th person, or not?
{n}Does the witch exist, or not?
19>X>18.
{n}...The witch exists somewhere in that X...!The uncomfortable atmosphere continued even after those two left.
It was thick with the idea that thinking about who the killer was would be the same as deciding who to doubt.
 ...It had begun to feel like discussion of the incidents was itself taboo.
So no one was mentioning it, at least out loud.
......However, those thoughts were what filled our minds.
{n}All that we couldn\'t say aloud made our heads feel like they were going to explode...
So, at least on the outside, the parlor had once again regained its calm mood.
Though everything was left unsettled.
"......It feels like the rain\'s gotten a little lighter."
"Uu...?
 Still pouring down.
 Uu..."
"Even if it did stop, there\'s no boat on this island.
 ...But it\'d be nice if the boat came quickly tomorrow.
 I\'ve had enough of this Western mansion vacation, ihihi."
"Mom, when will the boat come tomorrow?"
"Originally, the boat to take them back would have arrived at three o\'clock today.
 They probably would have telephoned to say that they would come after the typhoon passed, but unfortunately, the telephones aren\'t working..."
"......But they aren\'t children over there.
 They were told this was for the purpose of dropping off and collecting our guests,
 so they will most likely arrive first thing tomorrow morning—
probably around nine o\'clock, I believe."
It was completely black outside.
{n}When I looked at the clock, I realized that it was just past seven.
{n}I was starting to get hungry...
In the kitchen, Kumasawa was cooking enthusiastically.
{n}She had laid out a variety of dishes, and while they didn\'t match the level of Gohda\'s artful cooking, they were still quite gorgeous.
It was an act of kindness from Kumasawa, trying to use food to enliven everyone\'s low spirits.
Kumasawa wasn\'t nearly as talented as a professional cook like Gohda, but she was far from unskilled.
...On the contrary, since she had been brought up in a fishing village, the simple food she created was sometimes very highly valued.
Kanon arranged the food Kumasawa had finished creating on plates, under her direction.
Kanon also helped in the kitchen sometimes, but since he was rarely placed in that role, he was slightly awkward, even though he tried his best...
Self‐conscious about the fact that he couldn\'t skillfully arrange the food, Kanon\'s expression darkened slightly.
But Kumasawa smiled to say everything was fine.
"Hoh‐hoh‐ho, it\'s arranged beautifully.
 Kanon‐kun, aren\'t you skilled."
"...............If it had been Shannon nee‐san,
 ...it would be even more beautiful..."
Kanon stopped arranging the food for a bit, and hung his head...
Shannon was the one who always assisted Kumasawa in her cooking.
{n}...Tonight, Kanon was doing it instead.
......And as he remembered Shannon\'s face, and her brutal end, he grimaced...
"............Forget it for now..."
Genji spoke kindly to Kanon as he advanced a pawn.
...Nanjo had escaped from the parlor once the mood had become sour, and Genji had become his opponent in a game of chess upon Nanjo\'s request.
".........Yes.
 ......I will forget it for now."
"...Good.
 That is probably for the best."
Genji purposefully faced away from Kanon as he spoke.
...He did so because he understood that it might make things tougher on Kanon if he noticed that someone was looking at his eyes.
Nanjo also understood that, and held back any thoughtless words.
"......I wonder where Kinzo‐san has gone...
 ......I hope that he is safe, but..."
".........I do not know.
 ...Only, I think everything is as the Master hoped—as he has arranged.
 ......To distrust that would exceed my role as furniture working for the Master."
"...Aren\'t you scared, Genji‐san...?
 I am frightened something bad will occur again tonight..."
"............I have nothing to be afraid of.
 ...I simply work for the Ushiromiya family."
Nanjo sighed through his nose, and made a carefully considered move.
...Nanjo was very slightly dubious.
 ......Could Genji possibly think that he would be left out of this?
He couldn\'t begin to imagine what was happening inside this mansion.
...But he definitely couldn\'t deny the possibility that it was something of Kinzo\'s design.
...If you liken this island to chess, Kinzo had opened the game, and as a result, six pieces had fallen.
......Could it be that Genji was calm because he believed that he alone was outside the chessboard, and safe?
Nanjo thought about it.
 ......Wasn\'t everyone just a piece on this chessboard, lined up equally, without any exceptions?
......Wasn\'t even Genji, who had gained more of Kinzo\'s trust than anyone,
 ...no, wasn\'t Nanjo himself, although proud of his position as Kinzo\'s only close friend,
 ...just another one of the pieces laid out on the chessboard?
".........Genji‐san.
 ...I am really frightened about tonight.
 ......I\'m hoping with all my heart that we will be still be safe when tomorrow morning comes..."
The guest room that Eva and Hideyoshi had moved into was used to house guests before the guesthouse had been constructed.
So until a few years ago, they had stayed in this room every family conference and were very familiar with it.
This room, just like a room at a hotel, had a bedroom and a bathroom,
 so even though they were still shut in, it was far more comfortable than the parlor.
"Guess it\'s true you can relax more when you\'re alone with your immediate family.
 ......They should all just do this, shut themselves in guest rooms and lock the doors."
"But Natsuhi nee‐san\'s throwing her weight around, saying no one can leave the parlor.
 How can any of them talk back?"
"She always felt she was being left out in the cold, so now that Nii‐san\'s dead, she\'s in high spirits, thinking her time has finally come.
 ...Seriously, how shameless can she be."
"...Come now, don\'t say that.
 Natsuhi‐san\'s workin\' pretty hard.
 No need to jump on her like that.
 .........And about that receipt earlier, you went too far there."
"......Aww, come on.
 If I hadn\'t said it there, there wouldn\'t be another good time to say it..."
Eva, sulking cutely, sat down beside Hideyoshi, who was lying on the bed watching TV.
"Still, ............it\'s been a very long time since we\'ve been alone like this."
"Sure has.
 When I think about it, both you and I have gotten older.
 Since George was born, everything\'s gone by in the blink of an eye."
"...It really has gone by in the blink of an eye.
 ......I wonder if we were too hasty in having a child."
Eva\'s eyes looked like they were staring off into the distance.
{n}......Yes, she had thought it a once‐in‐a‐lifetime chance.
...Her older brother Krauss had been unable to have a child for quite some time.
{n}Six years passed after his marriage to Natsuhi without any signs of pregnancy, which didn\'t please Kinzo at all.
As for Eva herself, she would be removed from the Ushiromiya register anyway once she got married, so whether a successor to the head was born or not, it was all the same to her.
 ...So she had thought.
But then, one day,
 ......she had a heavenly revelation.
{n}......Or maybe it was the whisperings of the devil that she had heard in her greed.
Perhaps she could remain in the Ushiromiya register if she gave birth to a successor first?
...If things went well, perhaps she could even inherit the Ushiromiya family herself...?
When she proposed this to Hideyoshi, he approved of it instantly.
{n}......This had not been because Hideyoshi also had greedy thoughts.
...For Hideyoshi, who had no close relatives,
 it was a chance for him to feel once more that long‐forgotten thing called family.
So he agreed, without hesitation, not to fuss over which family name they were to keep upon getting married, and assented to having his name entered into the Ushiromiya family register.
It wasn\'t easy to persuade Kinzo, but as his daughter, Eva knew Kinzo\'s personality well.
......So, she chose the time when Kinzo was most dissatisfied with Natsuhi,
 and expertly managed to make him accept Hideyoshi as a son‐in‐law.
......Looking at Hideyoshi, who had achieved success after starting from nothing, Kinzo might have seen a little bit of himself.
He quickly grew to like Hideyoshi, and permitted him to transfer into the Ushiromiya register...
George would eventually become the successor to the Ushiromiya family.
{n}They had raised him strictly with that purpose in mind.
George had been worth their while, and had grown into a fabulous young man who wouldn\'t disappoint no matter where he went.
...That was why she couldn\'t stand that he was in love with a servant like Shannon.
......So when she had learned that Shannon had died and the engagement had been invalidated,
 ......while part of her had been shocked at the gruesome crime,
 another part of her had been relieved that her precious George wouldn\'t be stolen by some servant girl...
"..................
 .........I...
......always did hate Krauss nii‐san.
 He was so full of himself, always swaggering around.
 So proud that he would one day become the head."
"......So I wanted to get back at him.
 ...Those were just my emotions as a child, of course...?
 But in the end, those emotions......took over my entire life.
 And if only that had been all!
 ......Because of those emotions, I got you and George involved, and I used you."
"............Eva, don\'t blame yourself so much."
Hideyoshi sat up and put his arm around Eva.
{n}......She could feel a warm understanding from him.
"...Well, I reached the halfway point in my life long ago.
 ...But you know, I have never once regretted how I\'ve lived my life.
 Not once."
".........I think that since I\'ve been with you, Eva, I\'ve been able to relish an enjoyable life that other men never will.
 ......After I lost my relatives in the war, you taught me once more what the warmth of family is.
 So I\'m grateful for the Ushiromiya family, and think of it as my only family."
".........In this life I\'ve led with you, not a single thing has been wasted.
 It\'s really been a fun life up to today."
"......Thank you,
 ......honey."
Eva hung her head, burying her face in Hideyoshi\'s chest...
{n}......Probably, no one in the parlor could even imagine that this side of Eva existed.
"I\'m the one who should be thankin\' you.
 To this day, there hasn\'t been a single day that I\'ve regretted being with you!"
"...............Me too.
 I\'m so glad...to have you by my side."
"George is already a fine adult.
 He\'s a man who can do his job well on his own, even if I\'m not there lookin\' out for him.
 ......How about it?
 Around New Year\'s, do you wanna go spend some time in the Maldives?
 Just us two, no one else."
"......No wayyy.
 Aren\'t you always saying that you\'re so busy responding to New Year\'s cards that you don\'t even sleep...?"
"None of that this New Year\'s!
 I won\'t read New Year\'s cards.
 I\'ll just stay quiet and check to see if I\'ve won the New Year\'s lottery.
 It\'d sure be nice if we won a color TV this year!"
"No wayyyy...
 I don\'t wanna check the lottery in the Maldiiives..."
"Then none of that either!
 ......Just the two of us, takin\' our time, carryin\' on from when we were newlyweds, just before George was born."
".........Yeah.
 ...That does sound nice..."
"I hear the Maldives are wonderful.
 An island with nothin\' on it, surrounded by beaut\'ful coral reefs and cottages lined up over the water..."
"......Carrying on from when we were newlyweds... When will that be...?"
"Soon as I\'ve finished some business.
 I won\'t know until I ask the travel agency, but probably before New Year\'s Eve—"
"No way.
 .........Right now,
 ...I want to start right now."
Peevishly, or maybe coquettishly, Eva pled for his lips...
The only sounds that filled the room were the distant voice of the announcer on the news, which Hideyoshi had left on, and the obnoxious pounding of the rain against the window...
There was a knock on the door, and Genji‐san entered.
".........Madam.
 Dinner has been prepared.
 Will you eat in here again...?"
"...Yes.
 Bring it here.
 Is Doctor Nanjo still in the kitchen?"
"............Yes.
 He has said that he wishes to carefully deliberate over his next move.
 ...Do not worry, he is with the other servants."
"Genji‐san\'s good enough at chess to be Grandfather\'s opponent.
 I hear he\'s even better than Doctor Nanjo, you know?"
"...Is that right.
 I played against him long ago, but he must have let me win."
"Maria, sounds like it\'ll be time to eat soon.
 But look at you, you\'ve been watching TV all day long and you still haven\'t gotten bored!"
"Uu.
 I\'m always watching TV so I\'m fine.
 Uu."
"Heh, Maria‐chan sure is a TV kid."
"Food\'s coming, so we have to clean up the table."
It was still cluttered with the aftermath of the drawing contest we had all been having, using several pages torn out of Maria\'s notebook.
Jessica began cleaning that up quickly.
{n}......Still, everyone here sure can draw.
 Really shocking.
"......Genji.
 Ask Eva‐san and Hideyoshi‐san whether they would at least like to have dinner with us.
 ......Although they will probably turn us down."
"...Certainly."
"First Father, now Eva‐san...
 We seem incapable of managing a full showing at the Ushiromiya dinner table."
Natsuhi felt her headache start throbbing again, and lightly held her temples...
The distance from the kitchen to the parlor wasn\'t that large, so Genji had gone there and back by himself, but the guest room was a little farther away.
Natsuhi had warned him not to be alone without good reason,
 and just now, Nanjo had also admonished him, saying that it would be better if he held a little more concern for his safety.
...Genji took Kanon with him, and the two of them went to visit Eva and Hideyoshi in their guest room.
Genji knocked on the door.
"......Eva‐sama, Hideyoshi‐sama.
 Dinner has been prepared."
He waited a short while for them to come out, but there was no response.
"............Genji‐sama, ......look at this."
Kanon pointed under the door.
......A Western‐style envelope had been inserted under it.
Normally, when something was inserted this way, it would be interpreted as a message from someone outside to someone in the room.
...So, since this might be a private note meant for Eva and Hideyoshi, it was not something that Kanon and Genji were supposed to take interest in.
...But this Western‐style envelope...
...was Kinzo\'s envelope, the same as the one Maria had taken out last night and surprised everyone with.
".....................
 ...There\'s no mistake.
 It\'s the Master\'s envelope."
"......Or...
........."
Although it had been Kinzo\'s envelope, ......the author of the letter Maria had read aloud last night had not been Kinzo......
Genji continued knocking a little harder and called out in a loud voice.
"Eva‐sama.
 Eva‐sama...!
 It is Genji.
 Are you there?!
 Please answer, Eva‐sama...!!"
But there was no response from inside.
Sometimes, when the servants went to call some guests for a meal, the guests would be sleeping so deeply that they wouldn\'t wake up.
...In times like that, the servants would stick a letter in the door to show that they had called by, and then leave the guest be.
......However, despite that, Genji beat even harder on the door and called out Eva\'s name.
But there was no answer.
Kanon stuck his ear up to the door, and holding his breath, listened for any sounds coming from inside...
"............I hear something that sounds like the television.
 ...But I don\'t sense anyone.
 ...The room might be empty..."
Genji took out a handkerchief, and, careful not to touch it with his bare hands,
 gently pulled out the envelope which had been stuck under the door...
It had been sealed with deep red sealing wax.
{n}...Without a doubt, the mark on that sealing wax had come from the Ushiromiya Family Head\'s Ring...
"Eva‐sama!
 Eva‐sama!!
 Please answer!!
 Are you still in your room?!"
Even so, there was still no answer...
There was a chance that the two were aimlessly walking around the mansion.
...This was the home Eva had grown up in.
{n}There was plenty of reason to think that she had gone out on a casual stroll...
Genji groped around in his pocket, and pulled out a bundle of keys including the one that would open the guest room.
"......Genji‐sama...?!"
Kanon also understood what this meant.
......They would sometimes unlock a guest\'s door so they could go in and do things like make the beds, but only after they had made sure the guest was out.
To unlock the door for a separate reason, and especially to do so when there was a chance the guests were still in there and without their permission, was an action unbecoming of a servant.
...However, Genji had decided.
 .........If the only problem had been that his knock hadn\'t received a reply, he wouldn\'t have gone this far.
But the envelope under the door was doubtlessly Kinzo\'s.
{n}......Or rather, one of the Western‐style envelopes of the Ushiromiya family head.
...And after last night, the sender of this envelope could be someone other than Kinzo.
......If this letter had been sent by someone other than Kinzo.........
"Eva‐sama...!
 My apologies.
 Allow me to enter your room..."
After giving that final notice, Genji stuck one of the keys from the bundle into the keyhole.
There was the sound of the door unlocking.
 ......And then, he slowly turned the knob, and slowly started opening the door.
Light seeped through the crack of the door.
{n}......Were they in the room?
 Or had they......forgotten to turn out the lights...?
Clank.
...It was the sound of the door chain being pulled tight.
{n}The chain had been secured.
The chain couldn\'t be secured from the outside.
{n}That meant that they were in the room now.
The sound of voices on the TV seeped out of the room.
{n}...The lights, the chain, and the TV.
{n}All of these things made it clear that they were in the room,
 .........but there was no sign of them.
Genji called to Eva once again through the crack of the door.
{n}But there was no answer.
".....................Genji‐sama...
 ............What should we do...?"
As part of their job, the servants were able to unlock almost any lock in the mansion.
But they had no way to open a door with a chain.
......The only way to get by the chain was to cut it.
{n}...That was certainly not permitted as part of a servant\'s usual work.
......A creepy chill was already rushing up their backs...
Kanon held his breath again and tried to sense someone through the door, but even so, he was not able to sense anyone.
"...............I\'ll go call Madam.
 ...Kanon, cut the chain."
"Y‐......yes...!"
As Kanon rushed away hurriedly to get a cutting tool, he was called back by Genji.
"Wait, Kanon...!
 .........Go back to the kitchen and take Kumasawa with you.
 Whatever you do, do not act alone."
"......Yes...
 Certainly..."
It looked like Kanon was wondering why he had to do something so troublesome in the middle of this urgent situation.
......But Genji had said it out of wariness.
...He didn\'t care what happened to himself.
{n}......But in the worst case scenario, he didn\'t want anything to happen to Kanon.
In the kitchen was Kumasawa, who was piling food on the serving cart,
 and Nanjo, who seemed to have thought of a move that would turn the tables on Genji, and had been awaiting his return, wanting to show him.
...But he immediately realized that something was wrong with Genji\'s demeanor.
"......Oh, ......what has happened, Genji‐san..."
".........Doctor Nanjo, my apologies, but please allow me to suspend this match for a time.
 .........Kanon, take care of the chain.
 Kumasawa, stop setting up dinner for now and accompany Kanon.
 I will go over to Madam.
 If you would come with me, Doctor Nanjo."
"Ha‐...has something happened......?"
Genji took Nanjo, who still didn\'t know what was going on, and quickly left the kitchen.
"...Kumasawa‐san.
 My apologies, but please come with me."
"Wh‐...what happened, Kanon‐san......?"
Unable to take in the situation, Kumasawa said almost exactly the same thing as Nanjo, and chased after Kanon, who had flown out into the hallway...
Accompanied by Kumasawa, Kanon went to the storehouse,
 and from amongst the tools packed in toolboxes and hanging on the walls, he looked for a tool that could be used to cut the chain.
"What are you looking for...?
 ...I will help......"
"......We\'re cutting a door chain.
 ...Where was that large bolt cutter..."
"A door chain...?
 Wh‐why would you do something like that...?"
"............The chain is locked to Eva‐sama and Hideyoshi‐sama\'s room.
 ...Even though they should be inside, when we called to them, they didn\'t answer."
It took Kumasawa some time to figure out how cutting the chain and Eva and Hideyoshi not answering were connected, but she did realize that this was an urgent situation.
"This will probably..."
Kanon took down a very large bolt cutter that had been hanging on the wall.
{n}It was called a cutter, but maybe it would be easier to understand if described as having the shape of a large pair of pliers.
......He recalled being warned that it was a dangerous tool that could easily cut through one of your fingers...
Kanon took that and rushed up the stairs.
{n}.........He knew it instinctively.
 ...He should fight for every minute, every second to open it quickly.
{n}............Or maybe,
 ......already............
"Please wait, Kanon‐san......!
 Haah, ...haah...!"
"......Hurry!"
Kumasawa eventually caught up with him, gasping for breath with both hands on her knees.
When Kanon changed his grip on the bolt cutter and looked up at the door, he let out an "ah", struck speechless...
".........Wh‐
......what is this.........
 .........hiiiiiiiii......"
Kumasawa screamed weakly, her face pallid...
That was no surprise...
 Because, right there, .........on the door, ......just like the magic circle that had been drawn on the shutter of the rose garden storehouse,
 there was another eerie shape drawn with paint that looked like blood.
However, it was dubious whether this one could be called a "magic circle".
...Because, unlike what most people would think of as a magic circle, it wasn\'t a circle with shapes drawn inside it,
 but a slightly more geometrical shape.
......However, the strange non‐alphabetical characters written in the gaps of the figure were without doubt the same as the magic circle on the shutter...
But the thing that had Kanon struck speechless was not how eerie the magic circle was.
......Only moments ago, this hadn\'t been here...!!
He had returned to the kitchen for a short while.
 He had then gone to the storehouse to grab a tool, and headed right back.
Put those together and it couldn\'t have been more than five minutes.
...How could someone add something this creepy during that period of time...?!
And as though it had just been drawn,
 almost like the door itself was bleeding, several unsettling vertical red lines slowly dripped down, getting longer and longer......
"......hiiiiiiiiiii... ......hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii...!"
Kumasawa\'s knees gave way, and she sank down on the spot.
{n}...If Kumasawa hadn\'t done this first, then Kanon surely would have wanted to.
"......B‐{f:5:Beatrice}...sama..............."
"Hiiiiiiiiiii...!
 It\'s the work of {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, how horrid, how horrid...!!"
"...........................hh."
Kanon gulped, then readied the bolt cutter and approached the door.
...He didn\'t want to get close to this disturbing magic circle, and he really didn\'t want to touch the steadily dripping substance that looked like blood.
......But if he didn\'t get close, he couldn\'t cut the chain.
Fighting this cold feeling, he gulped again, and after gathering his courage, went even closer, putting the bolt cutter up against the chain.
......He then pressed with all of his strength, and cut through the chain far more easily than he had imagined.
The cut chain fell into two separate parts, which continued to clang as they swayed back and forth...
".........Kanon‐san,
 .........by your feet, an envelope......
 ...And isn\'t that...the Master\'s......"
It looked like Kumasawa had also noticed the Western‐style envelope at the bottom of the door.
{n}And that the sealing wax had been sealed with the Head\'s Ring.
Kanon was lost for a just a second over whether he should open the letter first or check inside the room,
 but he decided on prioritizing his original purpose.
...Kanon pulled a handkerchief out of his pocket.
{n}This was so he wouldn\'t leave fingerprints on the door.
......If his worst fears had been realized, .........the police would want to investigate this room too...!!
He slowly pushed the door open...
 He was able to hear the sound of the television that had been seeping out slightly more clearly now.
"........................Eva‐sama......?"
Eva was face up on the bed.
{n}......On the bed with her shoes still on...?
Kumasawa, who had fearfully entered after Kanon and who was hiding behind his back, screamed a short "hii!!" again when she saw Eva like that.
Eva\'s shoes had been the first part of her that Kanon had seen, so the incongruity of wearing shoes in bed was the first thing that entered his mind,
 ...but after he shifted his line of sight towards Eva\'s head,
 ...Kanon couldn\'t help but let out a short scream like Kumasawa...
Right in the middle...of Eva\'s forehead, ......something was...
{n}......set there?
 Growing there...?
No.
 ...Right in the center of her forehead,
 ...an old‐fashioned "knife",
 or some weapon like it, was stuck right in!!!
From the base where it was stuck in, blood dripped down, staining the sheets on the other side bright red...
Kumasawa\'s knees gave way once more, and she sank down on the floor.
{n}...Her mouth kept flapping open and closed, but she couldn\'t even scream.
......Eva, with some kind of weapon sticking out of her forehead, was dead.
Both eyes were open wide, and the image of the person who killed her must have been burned into them,
 ...but the mouth with which to speak that truth had already been eternally sealed.
Even though that forehead was the last place they wanted to look, they couldn\'t tear their eyes from it...
Right there, the weapon was stuck into Eva\'s forehead, standing almost perfectly upright.
And on the handle was a design so complicated you could never expect to see it on an ordinary weapon.
......That thing...could be summed up with the word "occult".
{n}...It was a vulgar object, with a design that might have been of some demon.
"......What about Hideyoshi‐sama...?
 ...Hideyoshi‐sama...!"
Eva was on top of her bed, but the other bed was empty.
...Where was Hideyoshi?!
After taking a backwards glance at Kumasawa, still on her knees and stupefied, he checked the bathroom just in case.
At the moment he opened the door, he was greeted by steam and the sound of the shower.
The bathroom was of the same familiar style as most hotel bathrooms, containing both a bath and a toilet.
When taking a shower, a waterproof curtain was used to keep water from flying out.
That waterproof curtain was half open,
 ......and lying tumbled down in the bathtub was Hideyoshi, completely naked, both eyes still open—
and those eyes were pointing right at Kanon.
Just like Eva, a weapon with a demonic design was stuck into his forehead.
Since his head had been under the hot water of the shower the whole time, his face wasn\'t half covered and filthy with blood like Eva\'s had been,
 ...but the sight of him dead while still taking a shower was tragic enough......
Just then, Natsuhi\'s voice rang through the hall.
{n}She was probably coming with Genji.
"......A‐again with this graffiti......
 ...What about this letter...?
 What does it say inside?"
"...I have not yet read it."
".........We shouldn\'t touch it carelessly...
 The culprit\'s fingerprints might be left on it...
 We should hand it over to the police..."
"......They went out of their way to leave it here.
 I\'m sure they wouldn\'t have left fingerprints."
Stating this with finality, Natsuhi picked up the envelope.
...And before checking its contents, she entered the room herself, ......where she found Eva, dead.
"E‐......Eva‐san......!!!!"
"......Madam... Hideyoshi‐sama is here, too............"
"Th‐......this is......
truly atrocious......"
"...Kanon, turn off the shower...
 Don\'t let this be any more pitiful than it needs to...!"
"Y‐...yes."
Kanon gripped his handkerchief and twisted the valve, turning off the shower.
In the bathtub, a small bottle of body soap had fallen with its cap off.
......It really looked like he had been attacked right in the middle of taking a shower.
{n}......A spray of blood still clung slightly to the white bathtub, and the combination of red and white made a horrible contrast.
"............Doctor Nanjo..."
"...I, ......I understand......
 ......No signs of postmortem lividity...
 Rigor mortis hasn\'t begun either.
 I\'d say barely an hour has passed since they were killed, if that..."
"But even so, ......how a weapon with such a short handle could do that to the skull......
 I cannot imagine..."
Nanjo checked their pulse and their pupils, making certain of their deaths once more.
...As Kanon watched this businesslike treatment, he thought.
{n}......Couldn\'t you tell at a glance that they\'re dead without doing all that?
Nanjo thought about removing the weapon,
 but after deciding that where possible it would be better to hand the scene over to the police without disturbing it, he left it alone.
However, a close examination of the base revealed that it had no blade.
{n}...Or rather, it wasn\'t shaped like a flat blade, but was conical.
...He noticed that, rather than a knife, it was more like a short‐handled spear, something with a shape better suited for thrusting than slicing.
Rather than a short spear, some people might call it a thick icepick.
At any rate, the original hideous purpose for which this weapon with its unsettling design was made,
 and exactly how that purpose was carried out, were both displayed here in such a glaring fashion that there was absolutely no need to use further words to describe it...
Natsuhi, hoping to escape the repulsive steam filling the bathroom as soon as she could,
 covered her mouth with a handkerchief and dashed from the room...
Just viewing their gruesome bodies for an instant had been enough to burn the image into her eyes.
 If she looked any longer, that image would surely remain in her vision for all eternity...
The rising urge to vomit was exactly the same feeling she\'d had that morning at the gardening storehouse...
For a while, Natsuhi couldn\'t help but stand with her back facing the guest room, fighting that sickness in her stomach...
"......A‐.........anyway, we can\'t let the kids,
 ...we can\'t let George‐kun see this room.
 Quickly, close this room up...!"
".........Gra‐...gracious, no, it shouldn\'t be shown to them...
 If George‐san saw his parents in this brutal state......"
But the recklessly approaching footsteps were obviously George\'s even before he came flying into the room.
George and the other children had been waiting in the parlor.
But when they had seen Genji call Natsuhi out, and had noticed her turn pale and fly out of the room, they had felt that he might have been the bearer of bad news.
And when they saw a large group of people gathered around the guest room, they were sure of it...
"Father!!!
 Mother!!!"
".........Aaahh,
 wha‐......what is this,
 another......magic circle?!"
"...................................."
"Auntie Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi are safe, right?!
 Hey, Kanon‐kun!
 What\'s this all about?!"
"...Battler‐sama...
 ................................."
Kanon didn\'t have to say anything; George\'s scream after he ran into the room told them everything they needed to know.
"......UwaaaaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaa!!
 Who,
 ......who did this!!
 I\'ll kill you, I\'ll kill you!!!"
"...George‐kun,
 .........hang in there, dear......"
Natsuhi touched George\'s shoulder with her hand, but he violently shook her off.
...George collapsed to the floor beside Eva, and buried his face in the bed in front of his mother\'s face, wailing.
Then he pounded on the bed with his fist, over and over again...
".........Geor‐
...George nii‐san,
 ......ha‐hang in there......
 .........huh,
 ...Battler?"
"............Battler‐sama..."
Battler.........had his back against the wall of the hallway,
 ......and was, without restraint, covering his eyes with his right hand and weeping......
"Horrible......
 ............That\'s horrible......
 ......He proposed to the girl he loved and lost her the next day.
 .........And on the same day, even his mom and dad were killed...
 ............Isn\'t that...just way too harsh......"
...Of course, he felt sorry for everyone who had died.
{n}But Battler......felt far more sorry for those who had been left alone by the deaths of others.
Everyone here now had lost someone close to them.
{n}George wasn\'t the only one he felt sorry for.
......However, ...George\'s pain was far greater than everyone else\'s.
"..................Battler........."
"Sure, ...all people die sooner or later...
 If you\'re human, the day\'s going to eventually come when you\'ve got to fight the sorrow of losing someone close to you.
 ...But still, shouldn\'t that day be far in the future for Aniki,
 ......and shouldn\'t those deaths visit him one at a time...?!!"
"......Horrible...
 That\'s too horrible......
 ......Bastard......
 Bastard.........!
 Don\'t you have......the slightest bit of human compassion...?!!
 Uuu{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}uughhhh!!!"
".........Uu...
 Battler, ...don\'t cry, don\'t cry..."
Maria tried to comfort Battler in a mechanical‐sounding voice...
{n}Battler violently wiped his tears.
"Aah...
 Damn it, ...I won\'t cry anymore...
 Tears of regret, tears of sadness, I won\'t shed them again..."
".........Yeah, it\'s no goddamn good at all.
 The witch is backing us into a corner.
 We\'re always on the defensive...!
 And that\'s no good, it\'s no goddamn good!
 I\'ll flip over the chessboard...!!
 That bastard probably thinks of us like sheep, just cowering in fear until tomorrow with no way of running."
"...But guess what, I\'ll flip it over!!
 That bastard can\'t escape this island until tomorrow either...!
 We won\'t be the ones hiding away pissing ourselves, that fucker will!"
"I\'ll expose you, you\'ll see.
 By tomorrow—
no, forget tomorrow, tonight.
 Before this night\'s over I\'ll be gripping you by the collar...!!""......At any rate, we\'ll lock this room and leave everything as it is until the police come.
 ......All agreed?"
Natsuhi proclaimed it as though she didn\'t care whether they agreed or not.
...If anyone had a right to object, it would have been George, ...but he looked as though he had shed enough tears.
Still facing away from them, George nodded slightly and rose to his feet, and everyone else agreed in response.
Natsuhi still hadn\'t opened the head\'s Western‐style envelope she had picked up.
{n}...But since they would all be leaving the room now, she decided that she would unseal it in the parlor, where everyone could watch.
As soon as they walked out into the hallway to head back to the parlor,
 .........some of them immediately felt something out of place, ...or maybe sensed something strange.
"...............Uu.
 ......Stinky."
"Ah, ...you notice it too, Maria?
 ...What is this stench... It smells awful..."
As they all sniffed the air,
 ...they did notice a horribly foul burnt smell, unlike anything any of them had ever smelled before, drifting through the hallway.
"......I will go quickly to check the kitchen...
 I\'m sure I turned the flame off......"
After noticing a burnt smell, it was natural that Kumasawa, who had just been cooking in the kitchen, suspected that her own clumsiness had caused it.
 Kumasawa hastily dashed away.
"......Kanon, go with Kumasawa.
 Do not let her be alone."
"Y‐yes...!"
After nodding at Genji\'s order, Kanon went chasing after her.
{n}...The others, although they did not run, also followed in order to search for the source of the smell.
"...Uu.
 Stinky.
 ......Uuu."
"It truly is......a stench that makes the nose wrinkle.
 ...However, I am not sure it would be safe to open a window for ventilation..."
Natsuhi was reluctant to open the windows in a situation where self‐defense was so important.
"......Let us run the fan.
 I do not believe there will be any need to open the windows."
"...George‐aniki.
 ......Is it okay if I talk to you?"
"......If it\'s about finding the killer, then I have no problems."
It seemed that George had already climbed out of the abyss of his sorrow.
...All that filled his chest now was the quiet flame of hatred towards the killer who had stolen the lives of his beloved parents.
"...The chain for the room was set.
 ...From what I could tell by looking at it, I\'m positive that it couldn\'t be opened from the outside.
 ......In other words, that means it was a perfect locked room."
".........Yes, it does.
 In the case of the rose garden storehouse, they might have sneaked the shutter\'s key out of the servant room,
 or maybe they had a duplicate key... I can imagine many ways they could\'ve done it."
".........But this chain is different.
 Among generally used locking techniques, a chain is the simplest one to create a locked room with."
"Only a chain will block everyone coming from the outside as long as it isn\'t physically broken.
 So does this mean that the culprit couldn\'t have gone in or out through the door...?"
"......That\'s interesting.
 Just a few hours ago, I seem to remember everyone making a fuss over how to get out of a room without using the door."
Back then, everyone had been making a fuss over how Grandfather had disappeared from his room.
Because of the receipt that Auntie Eva had stuck in the door on a whim, it was revealed that the door had remained sealed,
 and since Aunt Natsuhi had been the only person to enter or exit during that time, she had come under suspicion.
Auntie Eva had proposed a theory about how Aunt Natsuhi might have thrown Grandfather out the window,
 and left by the door herself.
But this door is much simpler.
It was sealed from the inside by the door chain.
{n}The window had also been closed from the inside, and the bodies had been in the room.
......This time it really was, without exaggeration, a true locked room.
...That\'s right.
 If you include Grandfather\'s disappearance, three incidents have occurred, and all three times, the door has been the point of interest.
The first was the shutter.
There was a key in the servant room, and if we assume someone knew about that, this can\'t really be called a locked room.
The next was the door sealed by the receipt.
However, since Aunt Natsuhi had entered the room,
 she could have let Grandfather out through the window, or thrown him out, and she would have been able to lock the window before leaving.
Or, like my crazy theory, he could have hidden until the receipt was gone, and left the room later.
 ......Basically, this door can be defeated with a handful of desperate tricks.
In that sense, you really can\'t call this one a locked room either.
And now, we have the door sealed with the door chain.
...Finally, we have to give up.
{n}The window, the door...everything had been locked from the inside.
 It was a perfect locked room.
The first hadn\'t been a locked room because everyone could be suspected.
{n}...The second hadn\'t been a locked room because Aunt Natsuhi could be suspected.
...But this time, no one can be suspected!
{n}This room was a perfect locked room, sealed by a door chain that denied access equally to everyone...!
"......In that case, did the culprit carry out the crime without entering the room...?
 Some method from outside the room...?"
"Good thought...
 It is a chain, so even though it can\'t be opened wide enough for a person to fit through, you can open it a small crack.
 The culprit could knock on the door to make them peer out before attacking them, or...
 Wait, ...is that naive...?"
"Yeah, it is.
 .........If Auntie Eva\'s body had been lying right next to the door, then it might have been possible."
"But she was on the bed in the center of the room!
 And Uncle Hideyoshi was even in the bathroom.
 Looking from the crack in the door, you couldn\'t even see them, and you couldn\'t reach them with your hands either.
 ......Damn it, this is no goddamn good at all, I don\'t have a clue!!"
......Something was tugging softly at my sleeve.
 ...It was Maria.
"............Uu.
 ...Satisfied?"
"What do you mean "satisfied"?"
".........Kihihihihihihihihihihihihi.
 ...Battler, since you didn\'t want to doubt any of your relatives...you made a wish, saying that you wanted the culprit to be {f:5:Beatrice}, right?"
"Well, {f:5:Beatrice} granted your wish.
 ...Just as you said, she did it "in a way that no human could, to make you believe in the witch"."
"............Yet you\'re being stubborn.
 Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi.
 Ouch."
I tapped Maria, who was laughing unpleasantly, on the head with my fist.
"Sure, thanks for granting it.
 That was an expression of my gratitude, and a free lesson in not laughing at times like this.
 More importantly, tell me.
 There was more mysterious graffiti on the door to Auntie Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi\'s room.
 Was that another magic circle?!"
"......Kihihihihihihihi.
 It has an especially memorable and characteristic design, so I\'d hoped you\'d at least know that one.
 Ouch."
"I don\'t know, that\'s why I\'ve handed the stage over to you.
 Quit whining and explain."
".........You sure are violent, Battler.
 I won\'t tell you if you\'re too mean, get it......?
 Ouch!
 Uu...... I\'ll say it, I\'ll say it, you brutish man.
 .........That\'s the first magic circle of the moon."
"What does it mean?
 What is this magic circle\'s benefit?!
 What does the Hebrew writing mean?!"
"The words are from the Old Testament, Psalm 107, verse 16.
 ......‘For he has broken the gates of brass and cut through bars of iron’.
 ......This magic circle has two effects.
 First, it can open any door regardless of the method used to lock it."
"That sure is convenient magic.
 ...So your witch is proclaiming this to be a door that can\'t be opened without relying on the power of magic...?!
 And the other effect?!"
"It takes the unopening door as a representation of an unassailable situation, and opens it.
 ......By using it in a difficult situation, it gives you a solution you hadn\'t even thought of until then.
 ......To put it simply, it grants the powers of observation and discernment, inspiration and intuition."
"............Kihihihihihihihihihi.
 {f:5:Beatrice} is trying to provoke you lowly humans, since she thinks there\'s no way you could ever understand how this door was opened.
 Kihhihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi..."
"Ouch."
"Alright, good work, now shut up.
 ......Suits me fine. I accept that witch\'s challenge!"
"......Maria‐chan.
 ...Things like witches and demons don\'t exist in this world.
 ...Someone killed Mother and Father!
 I don\'t know whether that was someone I know or not.
 But either way, it was definitely a human...!!"
".........Yeah, but......how?
 How did they reach them through a crack in the door that couldn\'t have been more than ten centimeters wide...!"
"At any rate, I can hardly stand this stench.
 ......What in the world could it be...?!"
Kanon and Kumasawa, who had gone ahead, realized before they even reached the kitchen that the smell wasn\'t coming from there.
That was because, on their way to the kitchen, they noticed that an even thicker wave of stench was rising up from the stairs leading to the basement.
".........The boiler room..."
"......I wonder if there\'s something wrong with the boiler again..."
Those stairs led to the underground boiler room.
The mansion\'s boiler was old, and had been playing up recently.
{n}Both of them had witnessed problems with the boiler on several occasions, but they had never smelled it belching out a stench like this before.
Slam.
"Wh‐what was that sound......?!"
The sound that they had heard from the basement had definitely been the sound of a door closing.
{n}......Although she did phrase it as a question, Kumasawa too had already realized that the sound couldn\'t have been anything else.
Kumasawa was so surprised at that sound that her knees gave way yet again and she cowered...
......Because, {i:at that very moment, no one could have been in the boiler room}.
Just a few seconds ago, everyone had been crowded together in Eva and Hideyoshi\'s room!
{n}So who caused the sound of a door closing just now?!
".................................!"
"Kanon‐san...!!"
Instantly gathering the situation, Kanon ran down towards the basement...!
Since they had heard the sound of a door closing just now, and there was no trace of someone climbing the stairs, it meant that the person who had closed the door was now inside the boiler room.
If the boiler room had been a dead end, Kanon wouldn\'t have rushed in so hastily.
...But Kanon was a servant, so he knew.
{n}There were two entrances, one that opened to the mansion and one that opened to the courtyard.
If he didn\'t chase them now, they might slip away...!
Kumasawa reached the same conclusion long after Kanon did.
{n}...But she couldn\'t let him go alone...!
If the thing in the boiler room was the killer,
 ...an opponent who had easily killed six adults in the first murder,
 then Kanon would be no match if he simply confronted them alone.
...Of course, by this argument, Kumasawa joining him alone wouldn\'t mean anything, but...
At any rate, after a delay, Kumasawa decided that she mustn\'t let Kanon go alone, and she dashed down the stairs...!!
At that time, Kanon was already in the boiler room.
The boiler room\'s characteristic damp heat tormented him.
{n}...It had always been an unpleasantly smelly and hot place.
And on top of that, the room was full of that horrible stench...which made Kanon feel like he was going to be sick.
......There was no doubt that this room was the origin.
In that case, Kanon should have been searching for where the smell was coming from.
However, Kanon kept gazing straight forward as he grabbed a hatchet from a tool shelf just off to the side of the door.
...He hadn\'t stretched out his hand because he\'d wanted a hatchet.
 ...He had wanted to grab a weapon, any weapon.
 ...Why?
"..................................................."
Kanon gazed into the darkness where the naked light bulb couldn\'t pierce.
{n}......Then, he {i:answered}.
"..................In roulette, you bet on a number or the colors red or black, vying for a payoff.
 ......However, low risk bets like red or black only offer a similarly low payoff."
The words coming from Kanon\'s mouth...were swallowed up by the darkness.
That darkness suddenly started to swirl, glittering...
It was......a very fantastical scene...
Golden sparkling butterflies that hid in the shadows all over the boiler room...
flapped their wings, twinkling beautifully, ...and disappeared into the darkness, gathering together...
Kanon continued speaking, directing his words at the darkness as it swallowed the butterflies up.
{n}......But as the butterflies gathered in the darkness, they...{0}...{0}...perhaps...{0}probably...{0}no, they must have...{0}...laughed.
...But Kanon continued to speak without faltering in the slightest.
"...On the other hand, if you bet on something of a lower probability, you receive a payoff proportional to the risk.
 ............The Master called succeeding despite an astronomical risk a "miracle",
 and called the astronomical payoff gained as a result "magic"."
"............I have no interest what kind of "magic" you and the Master were seeking when you spun that roulette......
 But you forgot something.
 ......You forgot that roulette has a pocket that is neither red nor black."
Roulette has a special pocket called "0", which means that the house takes everything in certain variants of the game—
meaning that all of the coins bet on the table will be swept up, just as though everyone has forfeit...
".........I set my heart on one thing.
 ...That if...
......Shannon were to be killed, and I was left alive,
 .........I would bring this roulette of yours to ruin even at the cost of my life...!"
"............This isn\'t one of the Master\'s rules, ...and it certainly isn\'t one of yours.
 .........I made this rule myself.
 .........I\'m not furniture anymore.
 .........I\'m the zero on your roulette...!"
...Kanon\'s face twisted with humiliation.
{n}.........It was clear that he had been dealt ridicule in response to his self‐denial.
Kanon\'s brow creased even further, ...and a furious expression that he had never shown anyone appeared on his face.
......The hand grasping the hatchet was shaking.
 ...His sweat became drops which slid down...
It was clear that the emotion causing Kanon\'s hand to shake was not anger alone.
...However, Kanon suppressed that emotion...
".....................I won\'t let your words lead me astray again.
 .........This is where the Demons\' Roulette ends."
"...W‐
......wait another thousand years in hell for your next summoner,
 {f:5:Beatriceeeeeeee}!!!"
When Kanon swung the hatchet upwards and tried to dive into the darkness, the darkness definitely sneered.
It sneered at that courage as vulgar, lazy, futile, and meaningless.
......Kanon, his hatchet still held aloft,
 .........couldn\'t take another step after that...
With a clang,
 the hatchet that Kanon had been grasping fell and rolled on the floor...
And following that, with a pair of thuds,
 Kanon\'s knees hit, ...left, then right...
That hand, which looked like it was trying to catch the sky now that the hatchet had been dropped, gradually lowered,
 ......and rested on his chest.
 Then, the other hand did the same.
......Right there, ......was a handle with a demon‐shaped design engraved upon it.
{n}The same type of weapon that had been stabbed into Eva and Hideyoshi\'s foreheads......was in Kanon\'s chest......
"...............u
.....................ghh,
 ............"
Fresh blood dribbled from the corner of Kanon\'s mouth as it twisted in anguish...
{n}...It was...makeup too powerful for Kanon\'s white skin...
Around this scene, the glittering gold butterflies danced mesmerizingly through the darkness...
It was a beautiful, beautiful dance—a funeral march of tribute, ridicule, and contempt for a single boy\'s self‐sacrifice.
...Kanon had already been prepared for his own death,
 ......but he attempted one last measure of resistance, to reject death in at least the form it had been delivered to him.
...With both hands, he grasped the handle of the weapon sticking into his chest,
 ............and gritting his teeth at the acute, unearthly pain...............
 ..............................he pulled it out.
For only a moment, a bright‐red spray gushed out.
......It made an unpleasant bloop sound.
It probably resembled the sound of Kanon\'s soul as it was sucked into the swamp of the dead...
"...............Kanon‐san?!
 Hiiiiiiiii!!!
 So‐someoooooooone!!
 Hiiiiiiiii!!"
Kumasawa screamed at the incomprehensible sight in front of her.
Kanon was lying in a pool of blood...
{n}...Kumasawa\'s heart was a complete mess.
Aah, what a terrible fate!
{n}He wouldn\'t have been killed if I had been with him!
Aah, what incredible fortune!
{n}If I had been with him, I might have been killed too!!
As she screamed, her expression was filled with complete confusion, and all of the muscles of her face were pulled up, almost as though she was smiling while crying...
{n}No one could have made fun of an expression such as this...!!
"What is it, Kumasawa?!!
 Answer me, Kumasawa!!!"
The first one to dash in was Natsuhi, with rifle at the ready.
Battler and Genji dashed in after her.
Normally, they probably would\'ve started discussing the origin of that violent stench filling the boiler room.
......But after they saw Kanon, who was lying on the ground as if he were drowning in an ocean of his own blood, the stench wasn\'t important any more.
"Kanon!
 Answer me!!
 ......Genji, bring Doctor Nanjo here!!"
Natsuhi realized that even though Kanon was on the verge of death, he was still conscious, so she sent Genji to get the doctor.
...Natsuhi, holding the rifle aloft, faced the darkness in the center of the boiler room and shouted!
"......Who is hiding over there?!!!
 Come out quietly!!
 If you don\'t come out from there, I\'ll shoot without mercy!!"
"A flashlight!
 Auntie, let\'s light \'em up!!"
Battler, thinking quickly, took a large flashlight from the tool shelf alongside the door and used its light to cut through the darkness Natsuhi was glaring into.
But the light only shone on mechanical‐looking piping and a door.
The door had been left open a small crack, and it was obvious that someone had left through there in a hurry.
"......Aunt Natsuhi, where does that door go?!"
"G‐Genji...!
 Where does that door lead to?!"
"...The, the courtyard...!"
"L‐like hell I\'d let you get away, you damn bastaaaaaaaard!!!"
Battler let out a war cry as he slammed into the door.
Cool air from outside suddenly rushed in.
...There were some thin, rough stairs leading up.
{n}...Battler ran up them, shouting!
"Wait, Battler‐kun!!
 It\'s dangerous to be alone!!"
Natsuhi also rushed up the stairs, chasing after Battler.
At the top was the courtyard.
{n}...The courtyard of the mansion had been built strictly for lighting purposes, so it wasn\'t a very elegant place.
Because it was surrounded on all sides, the air was calm and completely undisturbed, even though they could hear the sound of strong winds.
There was only the gentle, sorrowful rain...
Through the cold scattered raindrops, Battler dashed up the stairs and into the courtyard, where he looked in every direction.
......Of course, the odds of him finding a suspicious silhouette just standing around nonchalantly were pretty much zero...
Battler turned around, looking in all directions.
 He turned again and again.
{n}He kept spinning until he almost lost his sense of direction.
{n}He prayed that he would see the culprit somewhere in this scenery...!
But there was no chance.
 All he saw as he spun was more and more of the mansion\'s heartless walls and windows...!
Furthermore, there were two entrances into the mansion from the courtyard, and neither of them were locked.
Because the courtyard couldn\'t be entered from outside the mansion, the doors had been built without locks.
......He couldn\'t tell which one they had left through!
{n}He had to give up.
Battler pounded the wall with his fist, swearing...
"......Battler‐kun!!
 You mustn\'t run ahead by yourself!!
 ........................
 ............Battler‐kun......?"
Battler put his head against the wall, ...and scratched at it with his fingernails as he cried...
".........Shit, ......shit, shit...!!
 Auntie Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi!
 And now Kanon‐kun too?!!!
 You killed six whole people!!
 And that wasn\'t enough, so you killed three more!!"
"Fuck you, fuck youuuuuuu!!
 Auntie Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi were always fun and kind to us...!!
 I just met Kanon‐kun yesterday, but I\'m sure I\'d have gotten along fine with him!
 Why did you kill them?!!"
"Why, why...?!!!
 When people die, they don\'t come back to life again, you know?!
 They aren\'t gonna quickly sprout up again like bamboo shoots!
 .........Why would you kill them?!
 Why...
 Why...?!!!
 Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh...!!"
...Battler was a boy who could understand the feelings of pain and regret in a person\'s heart.
{n}...So he cried.
 With all his strength.
Natsuhi, who had always thought of Battler as a strong person, was a little surprised to find that he had this delicate side,
 ...and at the same time, understood how easily hurt the heart of a young person could be, so she held him.
"........................It\'s alright.
 ...I will definitely protect you, George‐kun, Maria‐chan, and Jessica.
 .........As a mother, ...and as the representative of the Ushiromiya family...!"
"......uuuUUuuUuuUUUuughhhu!!
 AaaaaaAAAAAAAAhhh!!"
Battler, after sobbing into Natsuhi\'s chest for a while,
 wiped his tears with a bitter smile, and tried to convey that he had cried more than enough already, just as he had done the times before...
"Anyway, let\'s go back down for now.
 ......Protecting ourselves is a higher priority than finding the culprit.
 Tomorrow, the boat will arrive.
 After that happens, the police will come, and everything should be brought to light.
 .........There\'s no way the killer can escape this island, no matter how much they struggle...!!"
"......Right.
 ...When the police come..."
When the seagulls cry, ...the crime will be solved.
But, ...for some reason, Battler felt a slight sense of uneasiness...as if the seagulls would never cry again.
......That couldn\'t be true.
{n}When the typhoon passes, the lively seagulls should return to the harbor again......
I returned to the boiler room along with Aunt Natsuhi and told the room weakly that we hadn\'t found anything.
They told me that Doctor Nanjo and George‐aniki had carried Kanon‐kun to the servant room.
The servant room had a first‐aid kit and a sink, and could apparently function as a nurse\'s office.
Kumasawa‐san and Jessica had accompanied them.
...Stains from Kanon‐kun\'s blood remained on the floor.
Judging by the large amount of blood lost and the ruthless shape of the weapon that had fallen unceremoniously to the ground,
 ......I figured that Doctor Nanjo\'s treatment would probably end in vain...
That weapon was doubtlessly the same type that had been stuck in Auntie Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi\'s foreheads.
......But wait, isn\'t the demonic design on the handle a little different...?
There seemed to be some small differences in that part.
 Still, as far as their overall shape was concerned, the weapons were all of the same type.
Though it had seemed brutal, we\'d left the weapons stuck into Auntie Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi to preserve the crime scene.
...So this was the first time I was able to have a perfect view of the entire weapon.
Indeed, the weapon was not bladed like a knife, but shaped like an icepick,
 ...or rather, a thin stake.
And also, ...it had a spiral‐shaped design, sort of like a drill?
...To use a disturbing analogy, it looked like something that might be driven into the hearts of human sacrifices in some demonic ritual...
Including the handle, it was about twenty‐five centimeters long.
 Half of that was the stake‐shaped part, which was stained with deep red blood.
......The length of the blood‐stained part made it clear just how deeply it must have penetrated into Kanon‐kun\'s chest...
But Aunt Natsuhi and the rest were not even looking at the weapon, instead standing in front of the incinerator, where the horrible stench was emanating from.
They had probably pulled {i:that} out of the furnace, where it must have been burning.
...It was still smoldering and kept sending out dense waves of that awfully unpleasant smell...
Genji‐san and Maria were staring down at it.
Aunt Natsuhi probably couldn\'t stand to look directly at it.
 ...She kept shaking her head, her back to it.
"........................ug...!"
...I\'d thought that after everything that\'s happened, nothing could surprise me anymore, but...
...this was...
...gghh...!
I stood there for a while, moaning, with a rising urge to vomit...
.........The true nature of that unearthly stench...
......was the charred smell from within the incinerator...
of a burning corpse......
The clothes, the surface of the body, and the hair were all hideously burned.
 That grotesque corpse was in a state where not the face, nor the age, nor even the gender could be guessed at...
But when I thought about it calmly, I realized that a corpse appearing at this time could only be one person.
.........Grandfather,
 who had disappeared that morning, and whose whereabouts had been unknown.
".........I believe...it is most likely the Master."
"...............I...agree.
 ............That he would pass away in such a state......
 .........How heartrending..."
"...But is there any proof that this corpse......really is Grandfather...?
 It\'s burnt so black, you can\'t even tell what sex it is..."
"Battler‐kun, ...look at the feet."
Aunt Natsuhi, with her handkerchief over her mouth and her eyes averted, pointed and told me to look at the burnt corpse\'s feet.
..................?
"......The toes, on both feet. Look closely."
"Huh?
 ..................ah,
 ......you\'re right........."
Just as Genji‐san had said, there were six toes on each foot.
Each of the toes had been arranged so normally that I hadn\'t noticed...
"......The Master had these uniquely characteristic toes since birth.
 ...Consequently, the Master was entrusted with the revival of the Ushiromiya family."
"I have heard that since long ago, cases of polydactyly were common in the Ushiromiya family.
 ...It\'s probably hereditary."
Polydactyly literally means "many fingers".
Because of a little mistake by God when the person is born, one of their toes or fingers splits into two, and the total number increases.
But a big deal isn\'t usually made of polydactyly in the world at large.
{n}That\'s because it isn\'t a disease, but something people are born with.
So the hospital is already aware of it when they are still babies, and at about the time they turn one year old, they are given surgery to make them normal.
So, even if a child has polydactyly, it is treated before they become self‐aware, so they might not even remember it themselves.
Incidentally, it seems that it can occur with a probability of about one in every two thousand babies,
 so even though it\'s not usually seen, it isn\'t that rare at all.
Speaking of which, I think Uncle Hideyoshi mentioned something to me long ago.
 ...Something about how even Toyotomi Hideyoshi, the man who unified Japan at the end of the Sengoku period, possessed six fingers on one hand...
According to Aunt Natsuhi, among the many Ushiromiya family heads, the ones praised most for their wisdom had all possessed polydactyly.
......Because of that, when Grandfather was born, his relatives were all excited at the thought that he might become another wise leader.
 And, when the leading relatives all died in the Great Kanto Earthquake, it was apparently argued that if anyone could restore the family from that,
 it would be Grandfather, because of the auspicious sign of his birth.
If Grandfather thought being the head was not a bad gig, this sixth toe must have been pretty lucky for him.
......Come to think of it, I think I\'ve heard about some country where it\'s believed that people with polydactyly should be treated as gods and revered...
This is beside the point, but it\'s fairly common in mystery novels for a corpse to be burned to hide whose body it is.
......But it looks like in Grandfather\'s case, just being toasted wasn\'t enough to hide the proof of his identity...
And......Grandfather\'s body was not simply burnt.
......Just like Auntie Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi, ...and Kanon‐kun too, who had been stabbed in his chest,
 he had one of those "demon\'s icepicks"...stuck into his forehead......!
"............The "Head\'s Ring" is not on his finger."
"...So everything is as the letter last night said.
 ..................Father...
...would probably be horribly disappointed......"
Aunt Natsuhi let her head droop and closed her eyes tightly...
......This room had also become a vital crime scene for us to hand over to the police.
......It was decided that we would leave Grandfather\'s corpse here and lock the room, sealing it.
It wasn\'t clear when Grandfather\'s corpse started burning in the incinerator.
Since, according to Genji‐san, the flames hadn\'t been that strong, the body must have started burning a long time ago,
 and that stench must have slowly crept out of the furnace and filled the room bit by bit, eventually pouring out and climbing up the staircase.
......Putting aside whether he was rare or well‐done,
 Grandfather had been brought out, killed, and burned...even though he had started out in the locked room created by his auto‐lock.
 ...There\'s probably no doubting this...
However, according to Genji‐san, the boiler room is usually locked.
......The probability that someone outside our group was lurking around committing the crimes was now overwhelmingly high,
 and there was also a good chance that this person was walking around with something like a master key.
...After all, the doors and windows throughout the mansion had been checked.
But despite that, the culprit was freely strutting around the mansion.
After this latest crime, can we now be sure that a 19th person exists?
{n}They haven\'t shown themselves once, and yet they\'re trying to tout their existence.
Along with Kyrie‐san\'s chessboard theory, I\'ve been using this contradiction to deny the existence of a 19th person.
...By flipping over the chessboard once more,
 the very fact that this crime makes it perfectly obvious that a 19th person exists...
means that the existence of the 19th person is even less possible.
 As long as that 19th person doesn\'t show themselves in front of us...!
......If the culprit could get Grandfather out through the door sealed by the receipt,
 if they could kill Auntie Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi from the other side of a door sealed by a chain,
 ......then is it possible for them to even create a fictional 19th person through strange tricks and devices...?!?!
If we still want to believe that the culprit is among us,
 ......then the list of suspects is very short.
The four of us kids, Aunt Natsuhi.
{n}Genji‐san,
 Kumasawa baa‐chan,
 and Doctor Nanjo.
{n}...One of these people has to be the culprit!
Wait, we can\'t be sure of that.
 ......Just a second ago, we started doubting whether the body here was actually Grandfather\'s, right?
...Maybe we should try thinking of the other bodies in the same way.
For example, the first six all had their faces horribly destroyed.
......Some of the bodies had kept enough of their faces for us to confirm who they were, but my old bastard, for example...
had lost his entire face, as though it had been peeled off...
We\'d only figured out which body was which by their clothes and surroundings...
Had the culprit prepared a fake corpse beforehand and disguised it to make it look like they\'d died...then hid somewhere and continued their killing spree...?
...It sounds ridiculous, but that doesn\'t mean it\'s an impossible trick.
......It\'s too early to give in to this 19th person,
 ......no, .........this witch......!
"Maria‐chan, you mustn\'t stare so fixedly anymore.
 Come on, Battler‐kun too.
 I am worried about Kanon\'s condition, and I don\'t want to stay in a place like this any longer than I have to.
 Let\'s go back."
"......Uu."
Maria hadn\'t gone out with everyone else, but had remained in the boiler room.
The thing she was staring fixedly at was probably...
not Grandfather\'s body, but the "demon\'s icepick" that was sticking out of his forehead.
...No doubt an irresistible item for the obsessed.
I rapped her on the head.
"Hey, Maria.
 ......What\'s {f:5:Beatrice} after?
 Is it all of our lives...?"
"......Kihihihihihihihi.
 {f:5:Beatrice} will revive very soon.
 ...At that time, none shall be left alive.
 ...Kihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi."
"How can you laugh at something like that?
 Do you think you\'re the only one who\'s safe?
 Why don\'t you feel like you\'re in danger?
 Why aren\'t you scared?!"
"......{f:5:Beatrice} promised me.
 ...She said that she\'s going to take me to the Golden Land."
".........It\'s a wonderful place where you have no obligations, everyone\'s always together, and everyone is always nice to everyone else."
".........I\'m looking forward to it, you know?
 That time will come, very soon now.
 ...Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi..."
...Just what kind of person is Maria...?
.........I only know what Maria was like six years ago, when she was three.
{n}She had been pure and obedient—a good kid.
This new Maria six years later and the Maria I knew, ...didn\'t seem to fit together.
......Just who is she, this "witch" who calls herself Maria...?
To her, with her obstinate belief in witches,
 ......this series of unsolvable crimes is proof that witches actually exist.
Every time something occurs that would be difficult for a human, it becomes a little harder for the rest of us to not believe in that witch called {f:5:Beatrice}.
It must be an "intense pleasure" for Maria...to see her relatives, who once firmly denied the witch\'s existence,
 start acknowledging her existence one by one...
......Is that why she\'s in high spirits...?
".........Maria,
 let me ask this one more time.
 You\'ll probably answer the same anyway, but I\'ll ask just once more."
"Uu...?"
"...Yesterday, you were given a letter in the rose garden.
 ......Who gave it to you...?!"
"Uu.
 ...Like I said, {f:5:Beatrice}.
 ...You still don\'t believe.
 Uu."
Maria only repeated what she had already said.
......Maria had met with the 19th person, the witch.
Had that really been a 19th person, or had that been one of the 18, who told her to say otherwise?
All that\'s certain is that Maria has been with the rest of us constantly, has always had an alibi, and hasn\'t done anything that would put her under suspicion.
......She\'s simply overjoyed at being made {f:5:Beatrice}\'s messenger, and certainly is not our 19th person.
 ..................I think.
That\'s right,
 I wonder what\'s written in the letter we picked up in Auntie Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi\'s room...
 Aunt Natsuhi should still have it with her.........In the end, Kanon‐kun did not regain consciousness.
Even though Doctor Nanjo and the rest did all they could to heal him...
{n}...There was very little that could be done on an island like this without medicine or proper facilities...
However, Kanon‐kun was the only human ever to confront the culprit.
{n}If only he could give us some kind of clue...
But by the time he was carried here, it was already...
......too late.
".........My sincere apologies.
 Without proper facilities, there was nothing I could do about such a serious wound..."
"...No, that\'s perfectly understandable.
 Thank you so much for giving it your very best."
Doctor Nanjo\'s shirt had been sprayed by a violent spurt of blood, so it was easy to imagine the devotion with which he had tried to save Kanon‐kun\'s life, up until the very last second.
Jessica was crouched in the corridor, crying in anguish.
{n}......She had probably been taking care of Kanon‐kun until the moment of his death.
George‐aniki tried to approach her with words of comfort, but when Jessica pushed him away,
 he stopped trying to interfere and left her alone.
"............If only I hadn\'t let Kanon‐san go alone...... ......ooohhhh..."
"......Don\'t let that bother you.
 ...Even if you had been with him, you may have been attacked as well.
 ......He foolishly jumped forward and paid for his mistake."
"How can you say it like that?!
 Kanon‐kun spotted the killer and bravely stood up to them!!
 If only Kumasawa‐san had gone with him, the killer might have hesitated and chosen to run away!!"
Emotion‐filled words that I never thought I\'d hear from the normally tactful Jessica tumbled out of her mouth.
...Kumasawa, looking truly sorry, could do nothing but hang her head...
"Jessica..."
".........Now isn\'t the time for words.
 ...Even I feel as if— ......and probably you\'re the same?
 As if I don\'t have the first clue what\'s going on anymore—as if my heart is going to split open......"
There were tears in George‐aniki\'s eyes again.
{n}...Seeing Jessica break down crying probably brought back the pain of losing his parents.
............I had already cried myself dry.
{n}...So I didn\'t want to cry anymore.
...However, I felt myself the pain in their hearts.
"............It\'s alright, Jessica onee‐chan.
 .........You\'ll be able to meet Kanon again soon."
"...Stop it!
 You aren\'t helping...!"
"{f:5:Beatrice} will revive the dead, and even the love they possessed.
 ......So, you\'ll definitely be able to meet him soon.
 Then everyone will be able to live in peace."
"This {f:5:Beatrice}, who you say gave you that letter yesterday, is she the one who killed Kanon‐kun?!
 Where is she?!
 Where is she hiding?!"
"I\'ll find her and tear her limb from limb!!!
 Say it! You know, don\'t you?! You know who the killer really is!!
 What do you know and what are you hiding?!!
 Tell me, damn it!!!!!!!!"
"Mi‐......Milady, please stop...!"
"Uu!
 Uu!
 {f:5:Beatrice} exiiists!
 "Exiiists"!!
 Uu‐uu‐uu!!"
"Dammit, let go of me, Genji‐san!!
 Maria knows who the killer is!!
 And she\'s been hiding it on purpose!
 She must be telling them what we\'re doing, guiding them as they kill us!!"
"Jessica, be silent!!"
Jessica rushed at Maria and grabbed hold of her...
Genji tried to stop her, but Jessica could not be calmed.
 ...The next thing I heard was the sound of Aunt Natsuhi slapping Jessica\'s face.
After that, only Jessica\'s sorrowful sobbing voice resounded throughout the hall...
"......Maria‐chan.
 ...I know that there\'s no way you\'re one of the culprits.
 ...You have been with us since the beginning, and there was no time for you to communicate with any killer."
"............So, I want you to tell me something.
 ......This "{f:5:Beatrice}" who handed you the letter yesterday, ...who was she?"
......Although those words seemed kind, ...they clearly showed that George still had some doubts about Maria.
......He hadn\'t tackled Maria.
{n}However, he felt exactly the same way Jessica did.
"......Aniki.
 I asked her the same thing only just now.
 ...The answer won\'t be any different."
"I want to hear it from Maria‐chan\'s mouth.
 ......Who is {f:5:Beatrice}?"
"........................
 Even if I tell you, you won\'t......believe me anyway."
"What do you mean by that?!
 ...Is it possible that the killer is someone we know well,
 ...and that, for some reason, you\'re covering for them by remaining silent?!
 Who gave you that letter?!"
"............I got it from {f:5:Beatrice}.
 I\'ll say it no matter how many times you ask.
 I got the letter from {f:5:Beatrice}.
 ......Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi.
 George onii‐chan, do you refuse to believe in {f:5:Beatrice} because she\'s not an opponent you can hit?"
"You want to turn your feelings of helplessness into violence and beat someone up.
 So you won\'t be satisfied unless your opponent is a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} you can hit."
".........So even if I tell you the truth, you won\'t be able to accept it.
 So it\'s pointless for me to tell you.
 You won\'t believe."
"............But I will keep on saying it.
 I\'ll say it because it\'s true.
 ......{f:5:Beatrice} "exists"!
 Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi...!
 The door to the Golden Land will soon be opened.
 And that\'s where I\'m going.
 {f:5:Beatrice} promised!"
"In that world, Mama is nice, and Papa is with us and is also nice.
 I want to go there right away.
 ......Everyone is afraid of {f:5:Beatrice}.
 And that is only natural.
 ......But calm yourselves.
 ...{f:5:Beatrice} told me herself."
"{i:By the time the typhoon has passed, she will have ended everything.}
 Kihihihi
...ouch."
"......Maria, I actually don\'t dislike you being talkative, but let\'s leave it at that for now.
 ...I\'ll bet this is all a pretty happy situation for you, since you\'re always going on about how witches exist, but keep that to yourself for the time being.
 Leave everyone else out of it."
"Uu."
"Th‐this brat, I\'ve long thought she was creepy,
 ......but she\'s actually screwed up, somehow she\'s screwed up!!"
"Don\'t you think so, Battler?! Genji‐san?!
 Kumasawa‐san?!
 What about you, Mom?!!
 Maria knows who the killer is and she\'s hiding it!
 Sure, maybe she hasn\'t directly done anything!"
"But she\'s definitely the killer\'s accomplice!!
 That\'s right, she\'s a spy!
 We can\'t let her stay with us any longer!!!"
"...........................Kihihihi."
".........Maria‐chan.
 ...You must learn that there are some times where indiscreet discussion must be avoided.
 If you continue to add any more oil to the fire, even I will get very angry."
".................."
Aunt Natsuhi glared at Maria with frightening eyes.
...Maria was used to Auntie Rosa\'s loud style of scolding, but she apparently hadn\'t developed a resistance to this kind of silent telling‐off.
 ...She shrugged and kept her mouth shut.
A desolate feeling filled the room...
{n}It felt as though things would just get more complicated if anyone spoke.
......How many people had already died?
Six in Dad\'s group.
 Also, both Auntie Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi; Kanon‐kun; Grandfather.
.........There were a whole eighteen people on this island.
{n}...Ten of those had been killed.
More than half of us had been killed.
 ......And at this stage, there was absolutely no guarantee that the remaining eight were going to be alright...
"......Anyway, now is not the time for discord.
 ......Now that we are certain that the killer can enter and leave the mansion at will and strike out of nowhere,
 we must give our undivided attention to surviving until tomorrow."
"...I agree strongly with Aunt Natsuhi.
 ......We can take our time racking our brains over the culprit later tonight.
 For now, we should consider where to barricade ourselves in."
As I said this, I pointed out the clock to everyone.
It was already eight at night.
 ...We had been receiving shocks over and over again since the early morning, and both our bodies and our minds were completely tired out.
......There was still a long, long time until tomorrow.
 We needed to find some place to barricade ourselves in, somewhere we could rest our bodies and feel even the slightest bit safe...
".........I agree...
 Everyone is already pushing their mental and physical limits, myself included.
 I believe it would be wise to consider our plans immediately..."
"Settled, then.
 .........There\'s a high probability that the enemy has the equivalent of a master key."
"...Were Shannon, Kanon‐kun and Gohda‐san holding master keys?"
".........Yes.
 As long as they were on duty, they would have had them."
"...We didn\'t want to disturb the scene, so we didn\'t investigate this, but we can\'t eliminate the possibility that a key had been stolen from one of them."
".........Even before that, we know there\'s a chance that the culprit visited the servant room at some point in time so that they could unlock the shutter to the rose garden shed.
 I think it very likely that they had already obtained a master key while there."
There were many servants serving the Ushiromiya family.
{n}Because of that, there were several master keys.
Furthermore, every time the shifts changed, the keys were passed between servants.
 She had to admit that the arrangement had been somewhat sloppy.
"Assuming they did borrow a bundle of keys from the pocket of one of the murdered servants,
 is there any safe place that even those keys couldn\'t open...?"
".........Because of the nature of our jobs, we have been entrusted with keys to all of the rooms...
 All of them in the mansion and in the guesthouse..."
"So in other words, ......no matter where we hole up and lock ourselves in, it\'d just be pointless.
 ...Fine by me, who needs goddamn locks?! If you\'re gonna come, come on, dammit!
 I\'ll kill you first!!"
".........The enemy won\'t approach us from the front.
 I don\'t know about the first six, but if we look at what happened to my parents and Kanon‐kun,
 ...and even Grandfather, the enemy has only gone after isolated people.
 They don\'t have the power to assault all of us openly in a secure room."
"That\'s right.
 It\'s just like Aniki says.
 ......Maybe Auntie\'s rifle can serve to stave off the enemy."
"............I hope that is so, but..."
".............................."
"Maria, I know you want to say something, but keep it to yourself and stay quiet for a while."
"...Uu."
Maria probably wanted to say that witches weren\'t afraid of things like guns, or something like that.
But if she were to say it out loud, the atmosphere around here would start to get pretty edgy.
{n}I had noticed and decided to put a stop to it...
"...............If I may.
 There is one place that cannot be entered even with the servants\' keys."
"Where is that?"
"......Very well.
 It is the Master\'s study."
"I, ...I\'m against this!!
 I don\'t even wanna think about going in Grandfather\'s creepy room!"
"How many keys can gain access to that room?"
"......There are two.
 I always have one of them.
 The other was held by the Master himself, but just now, from the body in the boiler room..."
Genji‐san took a handkerchief out of his pocket and opened it, showing us the burnt and filthy key to the study.
Then, he showed it alongside his own key, which he had once lent to Aunt Natsuhi.
"...Normally, I should have left the Master\'s key for the police,
 ......but he had ordered me to always protect the safety of the study, so I borrowed it for the time being."
".........I see...
 Which means that Kinzo\'s study is the only safe location right now..."
"...It would appear that way.
 ......I don\'t even want to think about being shut up all night in that room of peculiar smells,
 but it appears we must accept that his room is safer than anywhere else right now."
"...............Grandfather locked himself up in that "safe room", but the culprit still brought him out and killed him.
 ...We can\'t say for certain that it\'s truly safe."
"If we go with your theory, that Grandfather skillfully outlasted the receipt and then left the room of his own free will,
 ...it still might have some worth as a place to barricade ourselves in..."
"......You\'re too optimistic, Aniki."
However, ......at the same time, I thought he brought up a pretty interesting point.
After all, this gives us a chance to question the enemy, the witch herself, about how the sealed door had been opened.
If we assume that the culprit used some technique to abduct Grandfather from his study...
...they would have to show us the same trick again if they wanted to assault us in the study.
......It\'s an opportunity to force the culprit to demonstrate that trick right before our eyes.
If they\'re a real witch, we would be forcing them to say Open Sesame and open the door by magic right in front of us.
 ......But such a thing is probably impossible.
If you flip over the chessboard, you realize that the culprit is obviously just trying to act like they\'re a witch.
......If they really were a witch, all they\'d have to do is appear in front of us and show off a spell colorful enough to silence all our doubts.
...Since they\'ve avoided doing that, everything must be the work of a fake witch who wants us to think otherwise.
......Therefore, {i:a culprit who used a technique other than magic to defeat the locked room couldn\'t open the door before our eyes}.
"......Is Grandfather\'s room big enough to stuff eight people in?"
".........Yes.
 There is a bed, a sofa, and blankets, so while it is not luxurious, it will be more than enough to spend the night.
 There is also a sink, a bathroom, a refrigerator and a liquor cabinet."
"Whoa.
 That\'s incredible.
 ...But isn\'t that weird?
 You\'re saying he built another house inside his house?
 That\'s pretty cramped for the last house of someone like our grandfather, who bought a whole island and realized all of his dreams."
"........................
 Yes, it is.
 ......After some point in time, Father wouldn\'t trust any other place even inside the mansion."
".........We always sneered about how he shut himself up in there, and this time, we\'re the ones who are gonna shut ourselves up.
 ...Ha!"
Jessica spat the words out.
"Jessica‐chan, ...it feels like you would rather go search for the culprit than stay shut up somewhere."
"...Of course, I don\'t think we\'ll be able to find them if we just start searching now.
 ...In the end, we can\'t do anything but wait."
"Then it doesn\'t matter where we wait, does it?!
 I won\'t run away or hide.
 Why don\'t we just take it easy in the parlor, watching TV or something and waiting for the great {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama to appear?!"
"......It will be perfectly satisfactory for her not to appear.
 There is no need for us to expose the culprit."
"Well said......
 We shouldn\'t take too many risks before the police get here."
"Thank you, Doctor Nanjo.
 .........I think we should move to Father\'s study.
 ...Certainly, considering the possibility that Father was taken out of there, there\'s no guarantee of absolute safety."
"......However, just as Battler‐kun reasoned,
 I also can\'t deny the possibility that Father left the study of his own accord and was attacked outside."
...That crazy theory had just been what I came up with to stop the argument.
However, just as Auntie Eva had said, even though that trick would work,
 I can\'t begin to explain what motive could have made Grandfather do something so awkward to sneak out of his own study.
Plus, that trick of hiding under the bed and waiting for the receipt to be removed before escaping,
 couldn\'t have been used unless Grandfather had "known that the receipt was wedged in the door".
Auntie Eva hadn\'t pointed out that last part,
 ......but it\'s clear how absurd the theory was.
Then does that mean, that as Auntie Eva claimed, the door was sealed and it was a locked room?
Is it a doubtless fact that Aunt Natsuhi was the culprit, and that the room was a locked room...?
............If Auntie were here now, she would probably make that claim openly and do me the favor of blowing my strange theory away.
...But anyway.
I had to admit that a room with both a bed and a toilet, that all eight people could be shut up in,
 ...and with only two keys, both of which were gathered here, had to be the safest place in the mansion right now...
At the very least, I figured this would be better than shutting ourselves up in the parlor again, and saying "nothing went wrong while we were in there before".
No, wait, ......were we safe only because we were shut up in the parlor?
{n}What if leaving that room and moving to an unexplored location is actually more dangerous...?
...Aah, no good, no good, no goddamn good at all...
{n}.........My flimsy head is about to break out in a fever.
...As I keep flipping over the chessboard, the real and the inverse keep switching with each other over and over, and I lose my ability to believe anything...
When it seems like the culprit is one of the 18, I want to believe in {f:5:Beatrice},
 and once I start believing in {f:5:Beatrice}, I start wanting to find the culprit amid the 18.
...That keeps spinning around forever, and in the end, my thoughts haven\'t taken one step from where they started...
......How far back in the past was it that Kyrie‐san taught me this chessboard way of thinking...?
That concept of examining the situation by flipping it over and thinking from the enemy\'s side...
 I get the feeling that I was so interested in this way of thinking at the time, that I let it guide the way I thought about everything.
......By the way, Kyrie‐san was Dad\'s coworker back then.
{n}...I hadn\'t dreamed that the day would come when she would be added to our family...
...Didn\'t Kyrie‐san...
...tell me something?
I get the feeling she once said that, while this chessboard thinking was one way to look at things, it wasn\'t all‐powerful by any means,
 and in fact was actually bad to rely on too much...
"Chessboard thinking...
is my interpretation of something called game theory, which I read about in a book.
 It\'s a very interesting subject, so you should try tackling it when you get into college, Battler‐kun."
"I really wanna try it!
 If I could study that and perfect my chessboard thinking, it\'d be like I could read into any opponent\'s moves—that\'d be really fun!"
"But you can\'t believe in it blindly.
 Game theory is a very deep and complicated subject.
 Chessboard thinking is just my interpretation that skims the surface of game theory.
 ......In order to thoroughly read your opponent\'s moves like you are imagining, you need to do a lot of study."
"Additionally, while chessboard theory is convenient and practical, it isn\'t perfect.
 It has many weak points despite its convenience."
"......Weak points?"
"Yes.
 ...Chessboard thinking is founded upon game theory.
 And game theory is essentially math when you boil it down.
 Do you know what the weak point of math is?
 .........It\'s noise."
In math, when you write 1+1=2,
 that equation will always be 1+1=2 no matter how many billions of years pass—nothing more, nothing less.
That\'s because there\'s absolutely no noise mixed in.
But, for example,
 ......unlike math, the Japanese language has noise mixed in.
Kanji are a good example.
 Old kanji and new kanji are slightly different,
 which represents an introduction of noise created by change over the ages.
Isn\'t history the same?
 ...There are dozens of policies that seem foolish in the modern era, but were meaningful at some point in the past.
Because the rules of chess are fixed, when a pair of experts are discussing one particular position,
 it\'s possible that they could reach the same conclusion whether they\'re from a hundred years in the past or a hundred years in the future.
...However, if the rules of chess had gone through massive changes over time,
 it\'s possible that the discussion about that same position would have changed as well.
"Precisely.
 Events in the world of humans are naturally full of noise.
 Aren\'t human emotions that way?
 Even if the exact same thing occurs more than once, there\'s no guarantee that humans will always act in a predictable fashion."
"......The very fact that we\'re trying to read an opponent\'s actions by applying a mathematical theory to them...
means we must realize that there are already some limits and weak points to our theory.
 ......To put it quick and easy, chessboard thinking is extremely weak against noise and fickleness, and even mistakes or incorrect knowledge."
...That\'s right.
 Kyrie‐san definitely said that...
In the first place, chess is a game where both sides play by the same rules and fight with the same objective, namely victory.
 This is why it is possible for both sides to predict the other\'s moves.
.........It\'s possible to read an opponent because you can always suppose that they will advance with the best moves they can find.
......But what if...
the opponent is fickle or a little tired, and makes a move that can hardly be called "the best"?
Or maybe, ...what if the game actually has special rules,
 only the enemy knows them, and they can make use of something unknown to you?
In fact, what if the opponent actually has some goal other than victory?
Think from your enemy\'s perspective.
{n}That is the basis of chessboard thinking.
...Which means that...
...if you misunderstand your enemy, any and all answers that you draw from that process will be complete rubbish, and of no use at all...
Many times, I\'d thought that by using chessboard thinking, I had gotten a glimpse into the person behind these crimes.
However, I don\'t know anything about the culprit.
{n}......Am I just playing in a labyrinth of thought?
.........If Kyrie‐san were here at a time like this......
she\'d probably be able to notice something with her much, much sharper thinking ability......
......Jessica never warmed to the idea of moving into Grandfather\'s study.
But in the end, Aunt Natsuhi persisted and we decided to move there.
Everyone was already trapped by paranoia.
...Kumasawa‐san had prepared dinner once already, but after the incident involving George‐aniki\'s parents, the kitchen and the parlor had become temporarily devoid of people.
Someone said that it might have been poisoned at that time.
{n}...Because of that, we were unable to even touch the food that Kumasawa‐san had taken the trouble to make for us.
.........The manner in which the first six had been killed was still unknown, but there was a possibility that it was poison.
...And indeed, by this method, even a single person would be able to carry out the murder of six fully grown adults.
...Furthermore, this idea made it seem like there was only a single culprit, who was also afraid of Aunt Natsuhi\'s rifle, and this was very good for our emotional stability.
But the fatigue and hunger were even harsher than we had imagined.
......So, on Kumasawa‐san\'s suggestion, we all went along together to the kitchen,
 and gathered some canned food, which would be hard to poison, to take in with us.
All of Kumasawa‐san\'s efforts to reward us with at least a nice dinner on this savage day regrettably came to nothing...
The food piled up on the serving cart looked just a little sad.
We all started climbing the stairs.
 Aunt Natsuhi led the group, warily staring into the darkness with both eyes and the barrel of the gun.
When we arrived on the third floor, just as Aunt Natsuhi had warned us beforehand,
 there was a mixture of a chemical smell and a sickly sweet aroma, a stench hanging in the air that felt like it was eating into our heads.
"......Yeah, this kind of stench probably would give you a headache if you were shut in with it for a whole night.
 ...I know it\'s a little late, but I find myself siding with Jessica against going into Grandfather\'s study."
This exceptionally magnificent door felt like the source of the stench.
......So this was the door to the forbidden study, which had turned away all who visited it...
While Genji‐san was unlocking the door, Maria was staring at the door and the doorknob with great interest.
".........Uu.
 ...What a door."
"It looks old and strict and like it\'d stop any jokes cold—sure is a fitting door for Grandfather\'s study."
"......It contains a really strong power to ward off any spiritual menace.
 .........{f:5:Beatrice} probably couldn\'t open this door."
"Oh...?
 What does that mean?"
Maria pointed at the doorknob.
.........A scorpion crest—
no, a design like a magic circle arranged around a scorpion, was inscribed there.
...This design... ...That\'s right.
{n}Isn\'t this just like those keyholder charms that Maria gave Jessica and me yesterday...?
".........The fifth magic circle of Mars is a strong magic repellent.
 Additionally, this magic circle was very diligently constructed, and is full of power.
 ............To beings of magic like {f:5:Beatrice}, this magic circle is quite troublesome."
"Isn\'t that comforting.
 Are you saying that we can even escape the grip of {f:5:Beatrice}\'s evil hand in this room?
 Our little witch here sure is reliable."
"......Then how did {f:5:Beatrice} take Grandfather out...?"
"............Just as Battler reasoned.
 ...{f:5:Beatrice} can\'t go inside.
 But she has magic, and she also has familiars.
 Using those, she might have been able to force Grandfather to leave the study."
"Aah, I read that in a manga.
 There was a scene where the vampires were frightened of crosses, so they couldn\'t get close,
 but their familiars were fine, so they made their familiars attack."
"That scorpion keyholder‐like charm I gave to you yesterday also had the fifth magic circle of Mars on it.
 The power dwelling within it was paltry, but it would have been enough to protect you until you left the island."
".........Although it sounds like you lost it, right?
 Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi..."
"......Scorpion keyholder charm?"
"Ah, ......aaah, umm...
 The charm I gave you yesterday was something I got from Maria.
 I heard that it would repel magic if you put it on your doorknob, ...and at the time I thought maybe it would be better if you had it..."
"......Is that so?
 ...I thought it was an odd thing for you to be carrying around."
"............Aunt Natsuhi put that...
on her doorknob?"
"Yes.
 ...Last night, after hearing about it from Jessica, I hung it from the doorknob on the inside of my door."
"Then, Aunt Natsuhi, you\'re really fortunate.
 .........If you did that, {f:5:Beatrice} probably couldn\'t even lay one finger on you yesterday."
"...I think {f:5:Beatrice} must have been really annoyed.
 ......Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi..."
...{f:5:Beatrice}, annoyed...?
{n}Couldn\'t lay one finger...?
Natsuhi thought back on that eerie graffiti she had seen that morning, like someone had been tearing at the outside of her door with blood‐soaked hands, ......and gasped in surprise.
Could it be,
 .........that this witch who called herself {f:5:Beatrice},
 ......had tried to enter through the door to her very own room...?
But the magic‐repelling charm had been hanging from the inside.
{n}...So she couldn\'t break through the door.
 So she was annoyed.
{n}...So, she scratched at it...?
"Quit it, don\'t talk about that...
 Witches don\'t exist.
 The killer does.
 And that\'s a human just like us."
"......And if you need proof, why don\'t we dice her up and see if her blood\'s red?
 ......Damn it, .........damn it......
 ......How could you...do that to Kanon‐kun........."
Click.
 Genji unlocked the door.
The eight entered Kinzo\'s study...
Grandfather\'s study, .........I\'d heard rumors about beforehand, so it didn\'t surprise me all that much.
He had done nothing more than fortify it thoroughly with his occult hobbies.
...If Grandfather\'s hobby had been chasing after pop idols, these walls might have been buried beneath idol posters.
Even if I didn\'t understand it, I did realize that this room was an amalgamation of all the things he enjoyed.
Even so, I couldn\'t help but remain dumbfounded by the smell of his creepy medicine and the sweet stench that seemed to melt my head...
When the door closed, it automatically made a clunk.
{n}...I see, this is the auto‐lock that\'s activated whenever the door is closed...
And there were only two keys which could open this door from the outside, both of which were in this room.
 ......In other words, this room had become a "locked room".
.........The shutter, the receipt, the chain.
{n}......And now, the auto‐lock.
...This fourth door had been locked in the most magnificent fashion yet, constructing a locked room in a perfect form that none could argue with.
Just to make absolutely sure that the room was secure, we checked all over for ways in or out.
The windows were tightly locked.
 That should have been enough, but just in case, we tried knocking all over the walls.
......After all, there had been whispers that there might be a hidden door in this room.
{n}...But we couldn\'t find anything suspicious.
Grandfather\'s study was very large.
{n}Even though we called it a study, it wasn\'t really a single room.
It could be divided up into four basic sections: a study section, a bedroom section, a toilet/bathroom section and a section for cooking that had a sink.
I see, this study does have enough in it to live in.
{n}...Now I could understand how Grandfather could live his whole life in this room without ever leaving.
It seemed that Grandfather wasn\'t in the habit of watching TV; there was no television in this room, nor even a radio.
......Until tomorrow morning, there would be nothing for us to do but pass the time listening to the sound of the rain.
Doctor Nanjo gazed at the chessboard that sat on the table in front of the sofa, and muttered...
It was apparently the partly finished chess match he\'d been playing with Grandfather until yesterday.
......The black had the white pretty well cornered, and it looked like checkmate would be reached within a few moves—the end of the endgame.
Even though checkmate had almost been reached,
 ......the endgame had been rushed,
 ......and in the end, was never completed.
"......Kinzo‐san.
 ...It seems...
......we weren\'t able to see this match through after all..."
".........Doctor Nanjo..."
"...I was Kinzo‐san\'s friend for a long time, ......but I never knew about more than half of him.
 ...I believe that two Kinzos existed, a wise one...and one trapped by some madness..."
"............I never understood anything about him..."
"...Especially when it came to {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, it would seem like his personality changed..."
In the direction of Kumasawa‐san\'s upward gaze, a portrait of {f:5:Beatrice} could be seen.
It wasn\'t massive like the one hanging in the entrance hall, but small, made for this room.
Grandfather probably spent every day in this room, and so much of his time...
talking to the witch in that portrait.
......Who was {f:5:Beatrice} to Grandfather in the first place?
...By now, you couldn\'t just explain her away by saying she was a story made by the parents to frighten children away from wandering into the forest...
While eating the canned food we had brought from the kitchen, we talked together about who {f:5:Beatrice} was.
......Whether the culprit was {f:5:Beatrice} herself or someone pretending to be her,
 whether they were a witch or a human—the lady in this portrait was strongly related to the basis and background of these crimes.
.........You couldn\'t talk about them without talking about her.
"......Oh yeah.
 ...Mom, you picked up a letter from the culprit in Auntie Eva\'s room, right?"
"Yes...
 We still haven\'t opened it, have we...
 ......Let\'s open it and see."
...Aunt Natsuhi took out that Western‐style envelope.
Genji‐san pulled a letter opener out of a drawer in the study desk and handed it to her.
While watching her open it, George‐aniki grimaced slightly.
......After all, it was a letter left at the site where his parents had been murdered.
{n}...There was a good chance that its contents would say something unbearable to Aniki...
It seemed that Aunt Natsuhi also realized that.
{n}...So she glanced over the contents first without reading it aloud.
We were a little frightened that she might grimace after reading something shocking, but she just frowned unhappily.
"......What does...it say...?"
"...There is one unpleasant sentence.
 ......It must be trying to provoke us."
Aunt Natsuhi, after deciding that the contents could be shown to the children, set it openly on the table.
 Everyone stared at it at the same time.
"‘Praise my name’.
 .........The hell?
 ......So frickin\' smug..."
".........It\'s probably {f:5:Beatrice} declaring herself the victor.
 ............Damn it..."
".............................."
"I expect you were hoping for another weird magic circle to show up."
"......It wasn\'t a magic circle.
 ......But it was just as I expected.
 ...Kihihi."
"What could it mean......?
 I wonder if she wants to tout her own existence..."
"That seems reasonable.
 ......With this letter, we now know that the author of last night\'s letter is the culprit.
 ......I think the identical envelope is more significant than what is written here."
"...............Without a doubt, this is the type of envelope and sealing wax that the Master used."
"...Ooooohh...
 I don\'t know what\'s going on anymore......
 This is the first time I\'ve seen anything like this since I started working for the Ushiromiya family..."
"If we\'re to believe the letter last night, ......then {f:5:Beatrice} claims to be Grandfather\'s oldest confidante.
 ......Grandfather often said the same thing in the past, right?"
I directed the question to Genji‐san and Kumasawa‐san, who nodded together.
"...So, the two of you knew more about this than anyone except Grandfather.
 .........Could you tell us?"
".........For a long time, I made a point of ignoring this topic.
 But now that it has come to this, I can no longer do so.
 ...Genji, tell us everything you know."
"......................................."
Genji‐san didn\'t answer.
 ...Did he remain silent despite his knowledge, or did he know nothing at all?
...Still, I had a good guess.
 ...The ghost story of the witch {f:5:Beatrice} had long been deified among the servants.
......He had probably been very close to Grandfather, too, and his occult hobbies.
So there was a good chance that he\'d been indoctrinated with even weirder things, and had increasingly come to deify the witch.
As Grandfather\'s most trusted servant, who had sworn loyalty to him,
 he might be the most influenced by the witch illusion that Grandfather had created...
So there was only one reason for Genji‐san to remain silent.
......He could say it, but it would definitely cause a backlash, so it was better if he kept his mouth shut, and it wasn\'t like we would believe him anyway.
 Something along those lines.
...Only a short while ago, Maria had been more than willing to speak bluntly and unrestrainedly, and that had earned her a scuffle with Jessica.
It was natural for Genji‐san to keep his silence...
"......Was she Father\'s...
...mistress,
 perhaps?"
His mistress.
 ......That could be possible.
For ordinary poor people, polygamy isn\'t only viewed negatively from a moral perspective.
 It is also an unmaintainable financial situation.
......But that isn\'t the case for the very rich.
It\'s possible for them to have another lover in addition to their real wife.
{n}...We can\'t deny the possibility that Grandfather had another woman in his life besides Grandmother.
"Maybe...
 When Grandmother was alive, it seems she strongly suspected it.
 That he was cheating on her.
 ......I\'d always thought she was just referring to the witch in Grandfather\'s head, but..."
"...This is getting really interesting.
 ......You told me, didn\'t you, Genji‐san?
 You said {f:5:Beatrice} has been working for Grandfather since before the mansion was finished."
"I have heard that the construction of the mansion was completed in 1952."
"That would mean that this person called {f:5:Beatrice} had been in a relationship with Grandfather for over thirty years..."
"Could that mistress of thirty years ago...or maybe a relative or hidden child of that person...hold some kind of grudge and be planning revenge?
 ...Ihihi, I see, this is starting to sound just like your standard Western mansion mystery."
"............It\'s a filthy topic, but the easiest line of reasoning to accept.
 ...Well, Genji?"
"..............................
 ...............The Master surely had feelings of deep love for her.
 There can be no mistake that he cared for her more than his late wife."
"......Who is this person called {f:5:Beatrice}?!
 And what is she doing now?!"
"..................
 ......I have heard that she passed away before the mansion was completed."
"She\'s already dead...?"
"......Yes.
 ......The Master mourned for her most grievously,
 .........and he devoted himself to the art of black magic as a means to revive {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama."
"......The Master loved {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama from the bottom of his heart.
 ...It was that madness which drove him to do all that you see here."
As Genji‐san said this, he spread his arms, ......as though asking us to look at this room, filled with the signs of Grandfather\'s madness.
...We were all at a loss for words.
Before this, his black magic hobby was nothing other than creepy, and we had found it impossible to understand what drove him to devote himself to it.
...Nobody had tried to understand Kinzo, dismissing him as an "eccentric" who had restored the Ushiromiya family amidst his madness...
All that had been on Grandfather\'s mind was the loss of the woman he loved,
 ......and the sorrow of being unable to give up on her.
......Just a few moments ago, this room had seemed creepy,
 ...but in that instant, everything about it started making sense.
The creepy books,
 the magic circles,
 the medicine,
 ...all of it.
......All just because he wanted to revive once more the visage of a single woman, who had left this world thirty long years ago...
"............The Master only told me about {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama\'s story once, when he was very drunk.
 .........Although I have forgotten the details.
 ......It was...
a deep, deep love, enough to make a woman like me jealous."
"......When Kinzo‐san succeeded the headship of the Ushiromiya family,
 ...his marriage to his late wife was decided by the few surviving elders of the family."
"...So, he married a woman who would benefit the Ushiromiya family,
 ......because he was forced to?"
"......That is correct.
 ......Kinzo‐san was installed as the head who would revive the family, and had to bear all of that heavy responsibility.
 .........I...do not pretend to know the details of when or where Kinzo‐san first met {f:5:Beatrice}."
"............It\'d be rude to say any more than that."
That was when Grandfather truly fell in love for the first time...
How deep that affection must have been.
{n}...It was easy to tell just by looking around us.
......This room was covered with piles upon piles of things having to do with black magic.
{n}And Grandfather had spent day after long day shut in here, immersed in his research and isolated from the outside world, never taking a single day off.
......You couldn\'t help but realize how deep Grandfather\'s love for {f:5:Beatrice} was...
".....................
 ......I......had it all wrong, Genji‐san."
"...............What might that be?"
"I, ......I\'ve always thought that...maybe you servants believed blindly in the witch because you were influenced by Grandfather\'s creepy black magic hobby.
 ......But that\'s not how it was..."
Perhaps they had been acting as though at least {f:5:Beatrice}\'s soul had been restored,
 ......and existed inside this mansion,
 ......in order to soothe Grandfather\'s heart...
With closed eyes, and an expression as though he was remembering something from the distant past,
 ......Genji maintained his silence.
............He probably felt that to confess that would be to betray his one and only master in the most serious way, even though that person was already dead.
......{f:5:Beatrice} has revived as a witch, and she is in the mansion even now.
......That was his mantra,
 what he had believed,
 ...what he had made others believe.
{n}.........And Genji would take that with him to the grave.
This might have been the last service he could offer his master.
The legend of the witch, the mysterious tale of Rokkenjima that was still whispered of amongst the servants.
......Its true nature was...
...a sad lie.
 ...No, an act of kindness, towards Grandfather, who had lost the person he loved above all else.
"..................
 ......I remember denying the witch\'s existence in front of Father on multiple occasions.
 .........Now I finally understand how much that must have wounded him..."
"......Right now, I can understand very well.
 .........If I thought that I could revive Shannon using black magic,
 ......I\'d immediately become the next owner of this room and start researching..."
"..............................Aniki."
Another strand of tears dripped from George\'s eyes.
{n}......Maybe it was infectious; tears rose to Jessica\'s eyes too, and she sniffled...
"............{f:5:Beatrice} told me.
 .........Very soon, she\'ll be able to revive.
 We\'ll be able to meet up."
― Very soon, the door to the Golden Land will be opened.
In that promised land that glitters gold, she\'ll resurrect all the dead people\'s souls, and revive the love they possessed as well.
......And I will sleep, in a world of peacefulness, for evermore.
"......Did she say that?
 The {f:5:Beatrice} who gave you the letter?"
"...............You don\'t believe, do you?
 ......Kihihihi."
"......If only Grandfather were here.
 I\'m sure he\'d be happy.
 I\'m sure he\'d be jumping for joy now that {f:5:Beatrice} is about to be revived..."
"...In that case, I\'ll believe.
 ...If spending half of his life on research is what brought life back to Grandfather, and if believing that the soul of the woman he loved had been resurrected is what enabled him to live to a ripe old age, ...I\'ll believe too."
".........Battler........................"
"...When love for a single woman is persistent over a long time,
 ......it is shared by those around you and becomes the truth."
".........Maybe you could say they\'re just being considerate.
 .........But right here, now, ...I\'d like to call that magic."
"............It isn\'t consideration.
 .........It really is...magic.
 ...She\'s a witch.
 ......Kihihihihihi.
 It looks like nobody can see {f:5:Beatrice} after all..."
Some time passed.
 As we listened to the sound of the rain,
 ......we considered what kind of love and madness must have possessed the owner of this room as he spent half of his life here...
".........If you ask me as a woman, then while I\'d like to understand Father\'s feelings of true love,
 ......it does leave Mother in an awkward position."
"Haha, I agree.
 Cheating is cheating.
 No way to make it pretty..."
"......That\'s also true.
 Poor Grandmother."
"So, ......is there any story about a child between {f:5:Beatrice} and Grandfather...?"
The keyword "{f:5:Beatrice}" has been hidden in every corner of this case.
So it\'s natural to suspect any relative of {f:5:Beatrice}.
"No.
 .........I have not heard of anything like that."
"......If there had been one, I\'m sure he would have given them all of his affection, in memory of his beloved.
 ...Since that didn\'t happen, and he immersed himself in black magic, maybe we should assume that there was no such child."
"..................Come to think of it, this reminds me of a rumor I heard.
 ...You know it, right?
 You know that story about how Grandfather heavily supported a welfare institute called the Gospel House?"
"...Enough of that.
 That is nothing more than slander which would desecrate Father."
"Tell us, Aunt Natsuhi.
 ...Don\'t you agree that we shouldn\'t hide things from each other?"
"...............It\'s a worthless story.
 Father heavily supported that institute, and opened up servant employment positions for them within this house as part of their social studies.
 ...Some foolish people started spreading rumors that Father had foul motivations—that is all."
"At one point, there was a rumor that he was collecting sacrifices for his black magic...
 And since he was actually doing weird experiments and rituals in this room all the time, I half believed it myself..."
"......And who are these servants who came from the Gospel House?"
"............There are several, but during the family conference, only Shannon and Kanon were scheduled to be here."
To resurrect {f:5:Beatrice}, he had summoned servants from a welfare institute......as sacrifices...?
"After all, everyone that Grandfather selected as a servant was young, always about the same age as Shannon or Kanon‐kun.
 ...I was sure that Grandfather had some weird inclinations."
"Jessica!
 Control your words."
When Aunt Natsuhi scolded her, the atmosphere instantly went sour and everyone fell quiet.
...However, something was tugging at the back of my mind.
Sacrifices...
 Sacrifices...
 .........Sacrifices brought over from the Gospel House...
......What is it?
 Freaky words like "sacrifices" don\'t pop up often.
...Yet I\'ve seen or heard that word somewhere recently.
{n}.........Some part of my memory is tugging at me.
......Come on, {f:5:Beatrice}.
{n}What do you know...?
I had arrived in front of the portrait of {f:5:Beatrice}.
It wasn\'t as vast as the one in the entrance hall,
 but that portrait, which he must have had drawn by some famous painter, was still just as intimidating in this smaller size.
...Below it, just like in the entrance hall, was the epitaph said to point out the place where the gold was hidden......
"..................ah...
...............!
 Sacrifices...
......"
"Wh‐what the hell, Battler?
 You\'re creeping me out..."
".........Sacrifice...
the six.
 ............ah...
......AAAAAAAAaaaaaaaahh!!!"
Both of my eyes opened as wide as plates...
{n}......Right there, everything had been predicted since the very beginning......!
Everyone crowded around.
{n}And the same expression of terror filled every face...!
Yes.
 It was written in the epitaph.
"On the first twilight, sacrifice the six chosen by the key."
"Ah, ......aaahh, there\'s no doubt.
 Six people died in the beginning!
 And even on the shutter where the magic circle was drawn, no, where the Hebrew was written, it mentioned the offering of sacrifices...!!"
"......Uu.
 ...I\'ve been saying that from the beginning."
That\'s right, Maria had said it at the very beginning!
{n}Right after we found the six bodies, when Maria was in the parlor watching TV, she had said it!
― ............Uu.
 Killer\'s not human.
 {i:Just the sacrifices chosen by the key.}
"This has nothing to do with the location of the hidden gold!!
 It\'s black magic or something, the instructions for a resurrection ritual!
 If I remember right, this epitaph requires a large number of "deaths"!"
"...It, it sure does.
 Even reading through it quickly, there\'d be 6+2+5...
...13 people who have to die...!"
"...How many people are normally on this island?!"
"It, ...it varies depending on the shifts for the servants, but there\'s Father, my husband, me and Jessica.
 And two or three servants.
 ...Today and yesterday, there were five of them, but there aren\'t normally that many."
"Which means that normally,
 ......there wouldn\'t be enough sacrifices to carry out this "ritual".
 ......No, wait.
 ......There\'s that rumor that Grandfather was collecting servants from the Gospel House to be used as sacrifices in some creepy ritual..."
"So, what?!
 He increased the number of servants to increase the number of sacrifices, ......and waited for the annual family conference when even more people would gather...
 ...Isn\'t now the only time of the year that this ritual could be held?!"
When Jessica screamed this, Maria broke out in that creepy laugh, looking truly pleased.
"...............Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi.
 ...Aren\'t there some people who make bets to test their fate?"
Like throwing a sandal and saying that if it lands right side up, tomorrow will be sunny.
{n}...Or saying that tomorrow will be a good day if a coin lands on heads.
......There are many little superstitions like that.
If you\'re fed up at how nothing is going right for you, and you happen to roll some dice and get three sixes, it would probably make you want to believe that it\'s a sign of some miracle.
...When flipping a sandal, you have at worst a fifty percent chance.
{n}Even if you get it right side up, it\'s not worth much.
...But if you carelessly roll three dice and they all come up six, you might think that\'s a small miracle.
".........Sorcery works the same way.
 ...You keep on praying earnestly, hoping for that impossibly unlikely outcome.
 ......Then, when that impossible result shows itself, the feelings from all those stored up prayers are made incarnate through magic."
"............The sorcery that Grandfather was trying to perform was probably like that.
 The key randomly selected sacrifices in a lottery.
 So to reduce the chance that he himself was selected, he chose the day with the greatest number of people on the island to carry out the ritual..."
"How ridiculous!!
 Are you saying that all these incidents were part of the process of some questionable magic ritual?!"
Natsuhi yelled.
......She couldn\'t stop thinking fearfully about how she might have been protected just because of the scorpion charm.
.........If I hadn\'t received that charm from Jessica and hung it from my doorknob,
 ......would I have been killed, been one of those six?!
And the strangest part is...even though I hung the charm from the inside of my door, they couldn\'t get through the door.
......The killer had noticed the charm from outside the door, and had given up trying to open the door.
......A human couldn\'t have perceived that.
The charm meant to stop someone that was not human...had done just that...!!
 Impossible, impossible, impossible!!!
"However, Natsuhi‐san...
 Look, ......the epitaph traces the events that followed..."
"O‐on the second twilight, those who remain shall tear apart the two who are close...
 ...Could this be talking about Eva‐sama and Hideyoshi‐sama...?"
".........P‐painful as it may be, ...we must reach that conclusion.
 ...And after the culprit killed them, they left the words from "the third twilight" in a letter there."
"Th‐that\'s right...
 After carrying out the second twilight, they left the third twilight in that place.
 ...The third twilight is...just like Aunt Natsuhi just read...!!"
"On the third twilight, those who remain shall praise my noble name."
Aaaaaaaaaahhh... Now I read it, it just keeps going on, doesn\'t it?
"On the fourth twilight, gouge the head and kill."
Gouge the head and kill.
......George‐aniki\'s parents were killed with the "demon\'s icepicks" gouged into their heads.
...But if that counted as the second twilight,
 ......someone else must be gouged in the head...
"......That\'s Grandfather...
 He had been burned in the incinerator, and our eyes were so drawn to that part that we didn\'t notice,
 ......but Grandfather\'s forehead,
 ...no, his head had been gouged."
"Grandfather is......the victim of the fourth twilight?
 Th‐...then, Kanon‐kun...!"
"...‘On the fifth twilight, gouge the chest and kill’.
 ......We thought that Kanon‐kun\'s case was an unexpected encounter with the culprit, .........but that\'s wrong.
 They had been planning on luring someone out alone and driving something through their chest from the beginning..."
"............If the culprit has followed the epitaph this far...
...does that mean that three people still have to die...?!"
"On the sixth twilight, gouge the stomach and kill."
"On the seventh twilight, gouge the knee and kill."
"On the eighth twilight, gouge the leg and kill."
"......Y‐......yes,
 ...you could read it that way...
 ......hiiiii..."
"Well, I wonder about that...
 .........After those three die, it reaches the ninth twilight.
 Take a look..."
"On the ninth twilight, the witch revives, and none shall be left alive."
"We are...all going to be killed by {f:5:Beatrice}......"
".........I don\'t get it.
 Doesn\'t that mean that everyone will die no matter how many people there are?
 ......What was Grandfather\'s goal?
 Doesn\'t this mean that this ritual would kill Grandfather himself no matter what...?!"
"...............It doesn\'t matter that no one\'s left alive.
 ......On the tenth twilight, we finally arrive at the Golden Land."
"On the tenth twilight, the journey ends, and you shall reach the Home of the Gold."
"The witch shall praise the wise, and bestow four treasures."
"......Grandfather wasn\'t afraid of something like death.
 .........Look at the second and third of the four treasures."
"............‘One resurrects all the dead people\'s souls.
 One even revives all the love they possessed.’
 ......So Grandfather believed that he would eventually be revived, even if he died partway through this ritual...?"
"Ridiculous, that\'s insane!!
 When you die, it\'s over, right?!
 The dead don\'t come back to life.
 That\'s a miracle that humanity has been chasing after for thousands of years and still hasn\'t accomplished!
 So it\'s gotta be something like this, right?
 Something like, you can revive and meet them in the world after death?!"
"......If what you say is right, ......would that mean...
Grandfather, whose remaining life is slim and who is insane because of love, is committing suicide,
 no, ...a massive forced group suicide...?!"
"...................................."
"......Genji.
 ...Can that possibility be considered...?!"
"............I do not know.
 ...The Master is a man who sometimes has the wisdom to see a thousand years into the future.
 However, there are times when that appears to be nothing more than madness to commoners such as myself..."
"What, does that mean "yes"?!
 What do you say, Kumasawa‐san?!"
"I, I don\'t know anything...!
 No, you can be sure of that...
 Do you think I would be on this island today if I did know?
 I would have faked an illness or done whatever it took to get the day off, good gracious, yes!!"
"What about your opinion, Doctor Nanjo—you\'ve been Grandfather\'s friend for many years..."
".........I, I feel the same as Genji‐san.
 ...Kinzo‐san was a man who far surpassed ordinary people.
 I\'ve even felt a sort of inhuman power from him at times."
".........Not even I.........understand what Kinzo‐san was thinking when he wrote that epitaph...!"
"...All we can say......is that even if the person who created this outline was Father, the one carrying it out is a different person."
"That\'s right.
 .........At the very least, there\'s another culprit who attacked Grandfather and Kanon‐kun.
 Furthermore, that person is still continuing the crimes just as the epitaph says...!"
"...The letter in the beginning that we didn\'t think deeply about...
 What was it that was written there?"
We thought back to the recitation of the letter last night...
{f:5:Beatrice} had proclaimed something inside the letter.
{n}She had proclaimed that, in accordance with her contract with Kinzo, she would collect everything of the Ushiromiya family as interest.
But then she had also revealed a special clause.
If someone discovered the location of the gold Grandfather had hidden, that right would be lost.
At the time that the letter had been read, Grandfather was still alive.
{n}...But at that time, it had already been sealed with wax by the Head\'s Ring.
...Which meant that Grandfather had handed the ring over to {f:5:Beatrice} while he was still alive.
.........If you think about that straightforwardly,
 we should probably take that to mean that {f:5:Beatrice} is carrying out that strange contract, and Grandfather is securing her that right.
......Simply put, it was the same as saying that Grandfather knew of and approved of the contents of that letter.
In other words, it\'s as though it was a joint message from {f:5:Beatrice} and Grandfather...
telling us that {f:5:Beatrice} will start collecting interest if we don\'t solve the riddle.
......In short, Grandfather and {f:5:Beatrice} were telling us to solve the epitaph\'s riddle.
 And if we couldn\'t, they were saying they would kill us all, following the procedure in the epitaph.
What meaning is there to that?
 What do they want?!
{n}I don\'t have a clue what it means!
".....................
 .........Look, another letter from {f:5:Beatrice}."
"......Huh?
 What did you say?"
Maria was pointing at the top of the table, where the canned food that everyone had been eating just now still lay.
A Western‐style envelope was sitting there, ......but so what?
"......What?!"
Aunt Natsuhi let out a hysterical cry, looking between her own hand and the table.
......Because the envelope that she had just opened was still grasped in her hand.
......And despite that, there\'s an envelope on the table...?!
"Wh‐......what is this?!?!
 What\'s going on, Maria!!
 Where did that envelope come from?!"
"......Just now, I looked and it was lying there.
 Uu."
"I, ......I don\'t know anything, anything!!"
"This isn\'t funny, there\'s only the eight of us here!!
 There\'s no way some ninth person snuck in!!
 There wasn\'t enough time during the few seconds that we gathered around the portrait, right?!"
"Get back, all of you!!!
 Back against the wall!!"
Aunt Natsuhi was pointing the rifle at Genji and the others, bellowing at them...!
Genji‐san was overpowered, his face looking like he didn\'t have a clue what was going on...
Of course, I felt the same, ......but a few moments late, I reached the same conclusion Aunt Natsuhi had.
Until just a few seconds ago, there was no letter like this on the table...!
 And nobody had entered this room!
 That means someone among us had placed it there during the few seconds when everyone was looking away, preoccupied with the portrait...!!
"Battler‐kun, open that envelope and read what\'s inside!"
"S‐sure!!"
I picked up the envelope.
 ......It was still sealed with wax.
Even without disturbing its contents, I realized that this was an unopened envelope, an unknown envelope!
Without relying on a letter opener, I violently tore it open and pulled out the letter inside.
The contents were as follows.
{e:070:― Are you enjoying the riddle of Kinzo‐sama\'s epitaph?
As you are all probably aware, you have very little time remaining.
Please abandon any naive hopes of escaping after the storm passes.
This game can only end with my victory or yours.
When time runs out, I will win by default.
 There will be no ties.
Make sure that you do not misunderstand your current situation.}
"That\'s what it says......"
".........It isn\'t clear who put this letter there.
 However, I have been able to narrow down the list of suspects.
 It\'s all of {i:you}!!"
"......M‐Madam...
 That\'s just......too horrible......"
"Just before I moved towards the portrait, I set a can of food down here.
 At that time, there definitely wasn\'t anything as strange as this letter there!!"
"And at that time, Jessica, George‐kun and Battler‐kun were already in front of the portrait!!
 And they didn\'t leave the spot in front of the portrait until the letter appeared!
 So the person who set that letter down is one of you four!!!
 {f:5:Beatrice} is one of you!!!"
".........Uu.
 We aren\'t {f:5:Beatrice}.
 ...{f:5:Beatrice} "exists"!"
"Silence!!!
 I don\'t know whether I should suspect one of you or all of you.
 ...But without a doubt, at least one among you is the culprit!!!"
"......Th‐...that\'s right.
 There can\'t be a 19th person...!
 There\'s no way witches exist!!
 Even when Kanon‐kun was killed,
 ......yeah, that could be explained if Kumasawa‐san was the one who did it!!"
"The truth is that Kumasawa‐san entered the boiler room with Kanon‐kun and killed him!
 And then she lied, saying he had already fallen when she got there!!"
"Y‐you\'re making a mistake, Milady...!!
 Why would I do something like that...?!!"
"...I don\'t have the slightest idea how my parents were killed in that locked room.
 But when they were killed, everyone except for the servants had an alibi."
"......The only ones who didn\'t were the servants...
 But, ...is it really correct to suspect them...?!"
"......W‐...well, now that you mention it, they do have no alibi for any of the cases, but...
 .........nghh!!"
Should we really be so quick to make that judgment?!
{n}But this time...in this room, in this place, in this moment...in this minimally small bit of time and space, it\'s obvious.
Only one of the four of them could have set the letter there in our blind spot...!!
{n}We can\'t tell who put it there, but it\'s obvious that one of the four did it...!!
"...Na‐......Natsuhi‐san.
 Please, calm yourself...
 A lot has happened today!
 I understand the condition your heart is in right now...!"
"Doctor Nanjo, it truly pains me to call you suspicious...!
 However, as Father\'s personal doctor—and his closest friend!—you have been by his side for many years."
"You might know about {f:5:Beatrice} as well.
 Could you be hiding some kind of old personal connection of his?!"
"Of course not...!!
 Calm yourself...!"
It was pitiful to watch Doctor Nanjo frantically pleading his innocence.
{n}It was probably a normal reaction that anyone would give if they were suspected.
Kumasawa was the same.
 Since Jessica had started suspecting her in the murder of Kanon, she was now totally flustered.
That was why Genji\'s still‐calm appearance looked so bold.
Aunt Natsuhi pointed the barrel of the gun.
"............Genji.
 You were Father\'s number one subordinate.
 ...Was {f:5:Beatrice} a fantasy you showed to Father, with you as the performer?!"
".........If by suspecting me, you recognize me as the Master\'s greatest servant,
 ......then it is a great honor to me, regardless of the circumstances.
 .........However, I am not the one who put the letter there."
"Do you expect me to just accept that?!!
 You must be the ringleader!
 Maybe Kumasawa and Doctor Nanjo are your accomplices!!
 .........And you too, Maria‐chan."
Not content to doubt just the adults, Aunt Natsuhi pointed the gun relentlessly at Maria too.
But Maria acted as though nothing had happened.
.........Or maybe she thought she would be fine even if she was shot.
"Maria‐chan.
 ...By this point, we can no longer remove someone from suspicion just because they are young.
 So for the last time, let me ask the question that everyone\'s brought to you since last night!"
"...Yesterday, who was the {f:5:Beatrice} that handed you the letter?!!"
"..................Uu."
"......Maria, don\'t try to fool us!!
 Make it clear!
 Who the hell gave you that letter?!!"
"...Kihihihihihi.
 ...How many times do I have to tell you?
 It\'s {f:5:Beatrice}.
 The thousand‐year‐old Golden Witch."
"............If you want to know what she looks like, just turn around.
 ...See, she\'s right there.
 {f:5:Beatrice} is.
 ......Kihhihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi!"
"You, you think this is a game, you little bitch?!?!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Stop it, Jessica!
 Maria, too.
 Don\'t you understand the situation?!
 What are you hoping to gain by saying stuff like that?!
 Stop stirring each other up pointlessly!"
"......I don\'t understand.
 ...Who do you people want to be the culprit?"
"You only believe in {f:5:Beatrice} when you don\'t want to doubt one of your own,
 ......and when you\'re trying to settle a grudge because someone who\'s close to you has been killed, only then do you want to believe in a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} culprit who you can attack with violence, and deny {f:5:Beatrice}."
"............That\'s why you can\'t {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} her.
 ......{f:5:Beatrice} "exists".
 You all can\'t {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} her!"
"Silence!!!
 I don\'t want to label you as the culprit, but there is no longer any doubt that you enjoy making this situation unpleasant, serving the interests of the enemy!!"
"......Kihihihihihihihi.
 ...Then what will you do?
 Shoot me?
 I don\'t mind.
 Very soon, the door to the Golden Land will be opened.
 Then all the dead will be resurrected.
 ......Right now, death is nothing to be afraid of.
 ......Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi!"
"M‐Mom, she really is suspicious!!
 We can\'t stay with her!!"
"But Aunt Natsuhi, please, calm down...!
 There\'s no reason to shoot Maria‐chan!
 Please remain composed...!"
"The letter was meant to provoke us, but it\'s nothing to be afraid of!
 Even the culprit is scared—scared of tomorrow.
 Scared of the police!
 Right now, this island is free from the reach of the law, but that\'s only because it\'s isolated by this typhoon!
 Once the typhoon passes, the law will return!
 So you mustn\'t shoot...!!"
"...How can you stay so calm, George nii‐san?!!
 One of these four is the culprit!
 No, maybe all four of them are working together!
 How can you stay so calm when one of these four might be the culprit who killed your parents?!!"
"Even I have the desire to find the culprit and kill them...!
 But that would be simple barbarism.
 I will leave the judgment of crimes to the law!
 So no matter how suspicious they are, you mustn\'t pull that trigger!!"
"I, I feel the same as George‐aniki...
 Aunt Natsuhi.
 Get ahold of yourself for a second...
 Anyway, it\'d be bad to shoot, ihihi...!
 In times like this, I hear you should tilt your head back and say "Stay cool" three times..."
"...............Let me make this clear.
 Witches don\'t exist!
 Not on Rokkenjima, not in the Ushiromiya mansion!"
"I declare it as Ushiromiya Natsuhi, representative of the Ushiromiya family!!
 There\'s no witch here!
 I won\'t accept {f:5:Beatrice}!!
 No matter what you\'re planning, I won\'t let you lay one finger on my daughter or the rest of them!!!
 That\'s my duty as a mother and as representative to the family!!"
Those words, ......were the final words of farewell that settled everything.
...To protect her daughter, Aunt Natsuhi would regard any suspicious person as an enemy.
......The only reason George‐aniki and I were standing on this side was because, by coincidence, we had a clear alibi regarding the letter.
If I hadn\'t approached the portrait,
 ......I too may have been at the other end of that gun barrel, treated like a criminal...
......But even though part of me thought that,
 ...part of me was thinking that chasing all of the suspicious people from this room would finally guarantee our safety...
Genji‐san, Kumasawa‐san, and Doctor Nanjo—all of them were on Grandfather\'s side.
{n}You could even say that Maria was on Grandfather\'s side, since she had a blind belief in {f:5:Beatrice}.
 ......That\'s right, they\'re all suspicious.
But is this really alright...?!
{n}Is it really alright for us to fight back against the lawlessness of the witch by throwing out all the suspicious ones without due process...?!
Aunt Natsuhi didn\'t tell them to leave with her own words.
......But with wordless pressure, she was inducing them to say that themselves.
......So, if Doctor Nanjo hadn\'t said those words, this cold silence would surely have continued forever.
"............Calm yourself, Natsuhi‐san.
 .........But I understand your feelings well.
 I myself feel like there\'s something wrong with my head after all of these strange, repeated incidents...
 So I understand well why you want to suspect us..."
"..................If you really have nothing to do with this, ...I would think that what I am doing is beyond rude.
 .........However, ...please understand, just this once."
".........I understand.
 ...Let\'s leave the room.
 .........What do you say, Genji‐san?
 ...Shall we return to the parlor and continue our chess game?"
"........................If that is what you wish, ......by all means."
"......I, ......I don\'t want to...!
 I mean, that means we\'ll have to leave this room knowing that the wolf is among us...!
 I don\'t want to, Madam, please forgive me, hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii......!"
What Kumasawa‐san was trying to say made total sense.
{n}If she was innocent, then she was being ejected into dangerous territory along with the culprit.
......In the current situation, pressing her to leave this room along with the suspects was almost exactly the same as letting her get killed...
However, Kumasawa‐san really was suspicious just for being the first one to discover that Kanon‐kun had been murdered.
...At that time, everyone except Kumasawa‐san had an alibi.
......As long as the use of some trick or the existence of some 19th person could not be established, Kumasawa‐san was one of the most likely suspects by far.
I didn\'t want to believe it.
 However, Aunt Natsuhi and the rest of us were in such a difficult situation that we couldn\'t help doubting any of them, Kumasawa‐san included...
So we didn\'t say anything to stop Aunt Natsuhi from trying to oppressively chase them from the room.
 ......We had stopped her from shooting, but when it came to exiling them from the room, we were passively agreeing...!
Maria spoke to the still‐fretful Kumasawa‐san.
"............You\'ll be alright.
 ......{f:5:Beatrice} is kind to those who respect her.
 ...You believe that {f:5:Beatrice} "exists"."
"...So I\'m sure you\'ll be fine.
 ......I\'m going to watch TV in the parlor.
 Let\'s watch it together.
 ...This place has no TV and it\'s boring.
 ............Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi."
It looked like Kumasawa found Maria\'s roguish laugh very frightening...
However, the three other people had agreed to leave the room.
{n}Kumasawa couldn\'t fight the flow, and had to agree, crying as she left the room...
"...Well then, Natsuhi‐san.
 I shall leave you for tonight.
 ......Let us meet again tomorrow."
"......Yes.
 Please understand, at least for tonight.
 When the police come, I promise to apologize to you all for my rudeness."
"...You may play chess, but do it in a safe place if you can.
 ...Genji, I leave it to you."
".........Certainly."
"...Ho......hohoho...
 It can\'t be helped, can it...
 They always say that the most frightening bears are those with their cubs."
"......Genji, Kumasawa, my sincere apologies.
 ......Let us meet again tomorrow.
 ............Maria‐chan too.
 ...Please forgive your cold aunt."
"Uu.
 I forgive.
 Uu!"
"Madam, the keys to this room.
 ......I will hand both over to you."
Genji‐san pulled the two golden keys from his pocket and handed them to Aunt Natsuhi...
"...And I will also hand over my bundle of keys to the inside of the mansion."
He took out a bundle of about ten keys of various shapes, and handed it over.
.........To the servants, those keys were probably the proof of their position.
{n}Being placed in charge of those keys meant that they were trusted, relied upon.
......Being forced to return them...meant that they had lost that trust.
...Thinking about it this way, ......there could have been no greater humiliation for Genji‐san, who had served here for all these years.
......However, his usual indifferent expression remained on his face.
"......Genji.
 ......I had planned that, after Father passed away, I would reward you for your many years of hard work and allow you to retire.
 .........And yet, I am treating you like this...
 ...It makes me feel ashamed from the bottom of my heart............"
"I have already received the Master\'s favor.
 ......Everything I have done until today has been in repayment for that.
 .........Please, do not worry over it."
"......Well, then, ...shall we, everyone?
 ...Good night to you all."
"Uu.
 Night‐night.
 Battler too, night‐night, uu!"
"......Ah, ......Maria.
 Wait a sec."
Guilt made me call Maria back.
...I groped around in my pocket, ......and took out that scorpion keyholder.
"............This repels magic, right?
 ...Keep it on you."
"Uu...?
 Didn\'t you say you dropped it......"
"...Back then, I was kinda pissed off, and I was just bluffing that I\'d lost it.
 ......There\'s no way I\'d lose your precious charm."
"........................"
Maria silently took the charm.
{n}......I was unable to say anything after that...
"............Well then, everyone, good night to you......"
Unable to respond, ......we watched them leave, our expressions completely tired out.
......And until the door closed and we heard the auto‐lock, we were unable to even draw our next breath...
Then, when I was finally allowed to take a breath.
{n}...I noticed that {f:5:Beatrice}\'s letter, which I had been gripping the whole time and which was soaked with my sweat, actually had two sheets.
...The paper had been tightly stuck together, so I had mistakenly thought that there was only one.
There was nothing written on the second sheet.
{n}......The thing drawn there was a magic circle, written with a red ink like blood.
.........Just like how every magic circle up until then had been different, this magic circle was one that I had never laid eyes on.
Inside the circle, a large triangle and a small triangle were fit together in a simple design.
But just as before, there was writing in Hebrew, and it seemed clear that it held some kind of meaning.
I wanted to know what that could be, ...but we had just chased Maria, the only person who could understand the meaning of magic circles, out of the room...
............I thought of the magic circles as a second set of messages from {f:5:Beatrice}.
...What does this one mean?
 ..................Damn it...!
We\'ve chased out all the suspicious people; now all we have to do is stay barricaded here until morning, and...then will everything be over?
......Once the typhoon has passed, when the seagulls cry, will everything be resolved?
But the letter that had unexpectedly appeared in the study had rejected that naivety.
{n}......It had made it very clear that, if time ran out, it would mean victory for the witch.
When time runs out, is the witch planning to take on the offensive?
{n}......Is she, finally, planning to display some fearful magical power, maybe something that could have been used to kill six adults at once?
...Wait, when {i:is} time supposed to run out?
 ......I don\'t know...anything...
"............Now......we should finally be safe.
 ......Finally.
 .........Definitely..."
Even as she said that, Aunt Natsuhi couldn\'t stop gripping that rifle.
 ...There was no release in the tension of her expression.
Of course, none of us felt like breathing a sigh of relief yet.
.........At least, not until we could hear the cries of the seagulls once more......After we chased them out, ......nobody said another word.
...We had exiled all of the suspicious ones.
 Even though we had known that there might be some innocents among them, we had exiled them all the same.
......We had chased them out of this paradise,
 where people didn\'t have to doubt each other.
However, our motive for chasing them out had been suspicion of our fellow man—the worst kind of crime for a human.
......If we had been able to accept the existence of a 19th person, of the witch,
 ......then we all might still be talking face to face, trusting in each other.
In that instant,
 we had agreed to chase out all of the suspicious people.
......But had that been the right thing to do?
......During this endless silence, we could do nothing but be quietly tormented by that sin......
Aunt Natsuhi was facing the door, seated all the way back in her sofa, not letting go of her rifle for even an instant.
......She would probably spend the night staring at the door without a wink of sleep.
George‐aniki was gazing through a gap in the closed curtains by the window,
 looking down at the courtyard and the mansion that surrounded it.
......Whether he was checking to see if any suspicious shadows would become visible through the window,
 ...or whether he was engaged in some deep internal conversation, ...I couldn\'t tell.
Jessica was sitting at an angle on the sofa next to Aunt Natsuhi\'s...with a dead expression on her face.
......And every once in a while, as though she\'d just remembered something, she would take out the inhaler that she had used during her asthma attack and stick it in her mouth.
...I just heard it from Aniki, but,
 ......apparently Jessica liked Kanon‐kun.
It seems that it was such a vague thing that she hadn\'t realized it herself.
...You know.
 It\'s the kind of thing that other people tend to spot before the person in question realizes it.
...In that case,
 ......she might have first learned of her feelings when the person she liked died.
.........It was truly pitiful and sad.
Come to think of it, ...Kanon‐kun had been the one to hand her that inhaler.
 ......Maybe she was remembering that.
As for me, ......I was fishing around Grandfather\'s study, thinking I\'d research the meaning of the magic circle on the second sheet of the letter.
Even though we were shut up here in a defensive position, my rebellious nature made me want to keep up the offense, find some key to all of this.
...We have plenty of time until tomorrow morning anyway.
{n}No matter what I do with that time, no one can find fault with it.
No one else showed that much interest in this magic circle.
...Its meaning was unknown, and once we understood it, we were sure to find some message that would cause us unnecessary anguish.
......I also agreed about this.
...However, I still couldn\'t let it go, so I killed time pretending to research it...
".........You sure are enthusiastic.
 ...Did you find anything that might serve as a hint...?"
"...Not a thing.
 The first task is even finding a book written in Japanese.
 ...Just how many languages could Grandfather read?
 He\'s incredible."
"Aren\'t you tired, Battler‐kun?
 ......You should take a rest while someone else is staying awake for you.
 Aunt Natsuhi may be saying she\'ll stay vigilant all night, but there\'s no way her body can handle that.
 We should take turns sleeping."
"Then you sleep first, Aniki.
 .........I\'m gonna keep on with my little research until the drowsiness hits."
"......That magic circle?"
"...Pretty much.
 We\'ve got plenty of time to kill.
 ......I thought it\'d be interesting to find out what kind of message the great {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama put in it."
"............I wouldn\'t.
 Keep that up and you\'ll get possessed by something weird."
"Relax.
 I\'ve been certified by Maria.
 ...She said I\'m utterly lacking any spiritual talent.
 Ihihi...!"
".........Were we too...
.........cruel...
to Maria?"
"............Jessica.
 ...You mustn\'t think that now."
"But Mom...
 If Maria wasn\'t involved, and the killer\'s someone totally different,
 ......they\'re obviously gonna go for the easy targets.
 ......If she\'s killed because of this,
 .........then we\'ve just...let her die..."
A gloomy silence settled once again.
 ...It looked like Jessica regretted that she\'d let her emotions take hold of her and snapped at Maria.
......She always was like that.
{n}...Always acted tough, went too far, and regretted it later.
"......I understand how you feel, but Maria was in close contact with the culprit,
 and what\'s worse, she seemed to be taking their side with her endless series of mystifying statements.
 .........I am relieved that we chased her out."
"...That\'s pretty harsh, Aunt Natsuhi.
 ......Couldn\'t it just have been the nonsense of a nine‐year‐old girl?"
Even I thought I was being brazen saying that...
{n}I myself had thought Maria was creepy on several occasions today, and had doubted her true nature.
......And when Maria had been chased out of this room, I couldn\'t deny that I\'d felt some relief...
"..................If that is the case,
 then tomorrow, I will apologize for what I did.
 ...I will take full responsibility for chasing them out of this room.
 ......This isn\'t something that the rest of you have to worry about."
I could feel a tragic determination in Aunt Natsuhi\'s words.
{n}......To protect her own daughter, she would resolutely chase out the suspicious ones.
...And if, as a result, she had left to die those people who had the misfortune to be suspected, so be it.
 ...She was prepared to take full responsibility.
"...Why does Maria have to keep saying stuff like that?
 She\'s bringing about her own ruin..."
"..................I think that the reason Maria‐chan adores witches and magic so much...
......might be because of Auntie Rosa."
"Because of Auntie Rosa?
 What does she have to do with this?"
"......I think you must have realized it too, Battler‐kun.
 ...Maria‐chan\'s real father ran off somewhere a long time ago.
 ...Although Auntie\'s trying to cover it up by saying he\'s on a foreign business trip."
"............Talking about Rosa‐san\'s family has become a kind of taboo in the Ushiromiya family."
"I think Auntie even thought about remarrying.
 ......But I also believe Maria‐chan may have become her shackles and made that quite difficult.
 ............After all, she sometimes...
got incredibly emotional and took it all out on Maria‐chan."
"............I agree with you there.
 ......It looked like Auntie Rosa was trying hard to like Maria."
"......Which means...
...that she didn\'t really like her.
 .........I\'ll bet she had some strong thoughts about Maria, standing in the way of her getting remarried..."
"...I think that the emotional rejection from her mother must have left some deep scars on her young heart.
 ......So when she learned about this occult hobby from somewhere, she immersed herself in it so she could fill the holes in her heart."
"......Did you know?
 To Maria‐chan, the image of a witch isn\'t negative at all.
 ...Remember yesterday, at the beach, when she showed us her notebook...?"
"......Yeah.
 ...It was full of all those fun‐looking scribbles."
Yesterday, when we had doubted the witch down by the beach...
{n}...Maria had gotten all riled up and started explaining about witches.
And not one of the pages had shown a picture of an ugly witch.
They were all brightly colored, beautiful, cute witches who looked like they were having fun.
There was absolutely nothing sinister about them, like a boy might have imagined;
 ...they were beings adorned with beautiful dresses, who could grant anyone\'s dreams with their mysterious magic and who made everyone happy.
......The sorrow of not being loved by her mother.
...Had Maria sought salvation from the witches as beings who could save her from that sorrow and make her happy?
Someday a witch would come, and using her wonderful magic, would bring Maria happiness.
......Even though she believed that, as she grew older, she had to face reality as her fleeting dreams were sliced to ribbons one by one.
.........If, in front of a girl like that,
 something claiming to be the witch of Rokkenjima appeared,
 and whispered that she would take Maria to the Golden Land, where Maria could be happy...
"...........................
 ......I...
......think it\'s time I confessed what\'s in my heart.
 ......Maybe throwing out Maria‐chan,
 ......no, ......Genji‐san and the rest too,
 ......was probably...the wrong thing to do..."
"...............I do feel...
......guilty..."
Since Jessica had been the one to face them and slam them with words of rejection,
 ...her conscience must be tormenting her a lot right now.
"Then, how do you all explain that letter?
 No one could have set it there except the four people standing behind me.
 I was able to see that quite clearly with my own eyes."
"...If those four are innocent, how was that letter placed there in a locked room with eight people in it?"
"............That\'s just it...
 ......When you put it that way, those four really do seem suspicious.
 .........But."
"...{i:That\'s no goddamn good}.
 Yeah, {i:it\'s no goddamn good at all}..."
"No good? ...What is?"
"Right.
 .........It might not be worth anything anymore, but let me flip over the chessboard again.
 ...What I mean is, if one of those four really is the culprit, it makes no sense."
"...........................That\'s right...
 ......Wasn\'t setting that letter openly on the table the same as confessing that one of them was the culprit?"
"...You\'re right, that makes no sense.
 ......If you were gonna do that, you\'d put it, like, in the crack of the door, to make it look like someone had slipped it in from the outside!
 Yeah, they must\'ve known they\'d be suspected if they didn\'t make it look like the culprit was outside the room!"
"Yeah, that\'s it exactly.
 ...If the culprit was one of those four,
 setting that letter right in the middle of the table would be both risky and meaningless."
"............But, putting aside whatever trick they used to set it there,
 ......if we assume that the culprit is someone other than those four, ...in other words, someone who was outside the room,
 then they had a lot to gain from that letter..."
"...............Stop that, Battler‐kun.
 ...At this point, that issue is insignificant."
Aunt Natsuhi quickly guessed what I was getting at.
......No, maybe she had thought of it long before I had, and had simply held her tongue...
"......If the culprit was outside the room, ...then once we shut ourselves up in a locked room where the culprit couldn\'t touch us, it was all over for them.
 .........That\'s right.
 It\'s the same as the theory I proposed about how Grandfather disappeared from this room, isn\'t it?"
"......That theory that Grandfather left the room of his own accord.
 ...If the culprit used some tactic to lure him out, and Grandfather left of his own accord, then..."
Come to think of it, ...even Maria had said it, when we found the scorpion magic circle on the doorknob to the study.
......{f:5:Beatrice} couldn\'t get through this door.
But she might be able to induce someone to leave of their own accord.
"......In that case,
 ............that would mean we fell for the culprit\'s trap completely...
and sent out some new potential sacrifices..."
"............Genji and the rest aren\'t fools.
 If they desired to protect themselves, they would quickly think of the next safest place after this room.
 They are surely hiding themselves there."
Aunt Natsuhi hadn\'t answered the question.
......She herself realized that if the culprit wasn\'t in that group, that letter could easily have been a trap.
However, it wasn\'t worth the risk of calling back the people she had once thrown out.
...To Aunt Natsuhi, right now, her greatest and only duty was to protect the children.........
And to that end, she was thinking, a few sacrifices may be an unfortunate necessity...
".........Hey, Aunt Natsuhi.
 Let me ask something a little difficult, alright?
 ......If, by coincidence, Jessica had also been standing behind you at that time,
 .........would you have chased Jessica from the room too?"
"......................................."
"Sure, there may have been a degree of cruelty to it.
 ...But, as a mother, you thought you should protect your daughter no matter what.
 And it was out of that duty that you sent them out, fully aware you\'d eventually be held responsible for it."
"............I\'m not trying to criticize you for it or anything.
 I just, umm.
 .........I was just thinking about what a great mother Jessica has."
"......Yes.
 ...You\'ve been dealing with these incidents since morning, and you\'ve been pulling all of us along this whole time, without losing your composure."
"......If you had been as confused as the rest of us, every last one of us may have been in the culprit\'s grasp by now.
 ...So I think that we all have to thank you."
"........................Thank you."
"...............
 ...So what you\'re trying to say is...this, right?
 .........You want her to act as Maria\'s mother too......?"
"................................."
"......I...
.........always thought of Maria as a real little sister and adored her.
 .........And yet,
 ......a bunch of things happened, we got a bit confused...
 ......And I said a lot of mean things to her and hurt her..."
"..................Mom,
 ...please.
 .........Let\'s stay with Maria,
 .........no, with everyone...
 .........There was no...
culprit among us......
 Why can\'t the culprit behind all this...
......just be the witch, {f:5:Beatrice}...?
 So let\'s just......stop doubting each other......"
Aunt Natsuhi closed her eyes for a short while.
...Was she coping with her throbbing headache again, ...or was she thinking of something...
".................................
 Jessica,
 .........you are my precious daughter, ......the daughter I was finally blessed with a whole twelve years after I married my husband.
 I would become the worst kind of demon to protect you."
That was some pretty strong language at the end there...
{n}She realized very well that these were only words, but even so, she was strongly resolved to protect her daughter even if she had to become a demon.
............But that was because she was tormented by guilt.
.........Today had been so long.
{n}...So many things had happened in one day, ...and we had been put under such pressure...
......I wonder if we have the right to greet tomorrow the way we are now......
...............Th‐...There it is.
"......I found it.
 ...It\'s this magic circle."
Within the books I had been constantly flipping through, I had finally found the same magic circle that had been drawn on the second sheet of the letter.
George‐aniki peered at it as well.
This magic circle\'s name was......the third magic circle of Mars.
The Hebrew written on it was from the Old Testament\'s Book of Psalms, Psalm 77, verse 13.
"What god is so great as our God?"
The meaning of the magic circle was...
......“discord”.
{n}...It agitates internal divisions and causes the enemy to bring about their own downfall.
"............Whoa, whoa...
 Seriously......?"
Could there be a more fitting way to describe our current situation and mental state?
We couldn\'t help but be stunned into silence.
"......So......this letter was a trap...?!
 How\'d they put it here?!
 There wasn\'t anyone in this room except for us eight!"
"A‐anyway, let\'s ignore how they got it in here for now.
 ......The culprit was after just one thing!
 They wanted to spread the seeds of doubt inside this impregnable study and use us to throw the sacrificial sheep out...!!"
"In that case...what they\'re after...is the people who went out of the room......!!"
"M‐Mom, ......what should we do?!!
 Those four are in danger...!"
"...................................."
It wasn\'t surprising that Aunt Natsuhi remained unpleasantly silent.
{n}...Even if this was all a trap by the culprit, even if the four who had been chased out of the room were in danger,
 it had nothing to do with the safety of the four people in here.
And there was no way to prove the innocence of the four people we had kicked out.
{n}......If we\'re willing to let them die, then we shouldn\'t leave this room no matter what.
 ...That way is...safest!!
Just then, all of a sudden, the piercing sound of a phone rang through the room.
It was the antique extension phone that was set on Grandfather\'s study desk.
......It had started ringing right as we began this conversation.
{n}It was only natural that we would think it an SOS from the others we had kicked out.
But then Aunt Natsuhi spoke.
"How, .........how can the telephone be—?!
 It should be broken down and unusable...!!"
"That doesn\'t matter...!
 If that\'s Maria and the others calling for help...!"
"If the problem with the phones was the culprit\'s work in the first place......
then this phone call is...
......more than likely......"
With that one sentence, the ring of the phone, which had sounded like a scream for help...started to sound like a ghastly summons from some unknown person...!
Aunt Natsuhi hesitated over whether to pick up the receiver.
"Le‐let\'s take it, Auntie...!
 The phones might have been fixed for some reason...
 It could still be an urgent call from Maria‐chan and the rest...!"
"That\'s right...!
 And on the slight chance that it is a call from the killer, bring it on!
 Let \'em friggin\' talk...!
 It\'s just a phone call.
 No matter what they babble through the receiver, it\'s not like it\'s gonna hurt you...!!"
"......If you won\'t pick it up,
 ......then I will......!"
"I, ......I will take it.
 ......Hello?"
I stretched out my hand to take the receiver, but Aunt Natsuhi picked it up first as if to say she had it under control.
...We all held our breath, trying to figure out who the person on the other end of the phone was...
But for a while, Aunt Natsuhi just kept saying "hello".
.........A silent phone call...?
{n}There\'s no way Maria and the others would do something so creepy.
......Which means...
...this phone call...
 .........Might it possibly,
 ...really.........
Natsuhi stopped repeating "hello" and strained her ears.
.........Because she thought she heard something far away on the other end of the receiver.
............What was it......?
"......Huh?
 .....................Is someone...
...............singing...?"
"What do you mean......singing?"
".........I don\'t know.
 Faintly, from the other end of the phone, ......I can hear someone singing......
 I wonder what...it could be......"
"G‐give it here for a sec...
 Hello?!
 .................................?!"
I half forced the receiver from the stunned Aunt Natsuhi\'s hand and pressed it against my ear.
...............At first, I didn\'t hear anything.
...But, ......because I had been told about it beforehand, I noticed.
............Not in a quiet voice, but rather, far away from the receiver,
 ...............I could hear a girl singing a song.
......The voice sort of sounded like Maria\'s, ...but that just made the situation even more inexplicable.
At the very least, the one who had made the phone call hadn\'t been Maria.
{n}After all, Maria was singing some song far away from the receiver.
......In that case, the one who made the phone call should have been Genji‐san, Kumasawa‐san, or Doctor Nanjo.
............And yet, they weren\'t saying anything.
 ...Why...?
 For what reason...
 ............Who was the person who made this phone call......?!?!
"Hey!!
 Hello?!!
 Who is it? Answer me!!
 Is that Maria singing?!
 Answer me!!"
"Wh‐...what\'s going on?!
 What is it?!"
"I don\'t know...!
 All I can say is,
 ...this is probably a trap, ......and Maria\'s in trouble..."
Aunt Natsuhi took the receiver again, but after calling into it several more times, she realized that she wasn\'t getting anywhere and hung up.
She then dialed quickly.
 ......And clucked her tongue.
Oh, right, if the phones are back, we should be able to reach the police.
{n}......But judging by her reaction, the outside line still wouldn\'t connect.
"......Le‐let\'s go!
 Even if we know it might be a trap, we have to go!"
"Yeah, absolutely!!
 Jessica, Aunt Natsuhi, stay here!"
When Aniki and I tried to dash out, Aunt Natsuhi stopped us.
"Wait just a minute.
 .........I cannot let you go alone.
 I will go too.
 Jessica, you wait here."
"And you\'d have me be the only one left out?!
 Not a chance, I\'m coming too...!!"
"Yeah, it might be better that way.
 ...If the goal of that phone call was to split us up further, it wouldn\'t be a good idea to leave someone to watch this room."
"There\'s no time to argue.
 Let\'s all go!"
Aunt Natsuhi raised the rifle high and took the lead.
I needed a weapon myself as well.
I found a three‐pronged candelabra, which looked like it could be used for some strange ritual, and armed myself with it.
With the spikes it had to fit the candles on, although they were short, it was almost like a three‐pronged spear.
Then the four of us left the study.
 We left the study, which should have been the safest place inside the mansion.
And so we had been lured out, despite the fact that we had barricaded ourselves in a safe locked room,
 ...and perhaps, we were even...
...repeating exactly the same series of events that had led to Grandfather disappearing from there...
"Mariaaa!!
 Where are youuu?!
 Answer meee!!"
I listened closely, but didn\'t hear anything...
{n}The mansion was vast, and the sound of the rain even noisier than before, as if the passing typhoon was making its last stand.
"...Maria‐chan said that she wanted to watch TV in the parlor, right?!
 Let\'s try going downstairs!"
"............Yes.
 Good idea.
 ......Everyone, be mindful of your surroundings!"
"Yeah!!"
With Aunt Natsuhi in the center, her rifle readied and her finger on the trigger,
 we moved in a group, our backs together, checking our surroundings in all directions......
As though the power of that magic circle designed to spread discord had brought it all into being,
 ...we had split up, and furthermore, had been dragged into dangerous territory.
......In other words, even now in this very moment, we were doing just what the culprit wanted us to do.
 ...This was now a strange space where it wouldn\'t be odd for anything to suddenly occur...
Aunt Natsuhi nervously pointed the barrel of the gun at every dark spot and shadow.
It felt like that motion was out of fear rather than caution...
But the rifle she held in her hand would surely also be our trump card that the killer was afraid of...
"......You know, I\'ve been thinking.
 ...It wouldn\'t be impossible to stick one of those "icepicks" into someone\'s chest, like in Kanon‐kun\'s case.
 ......But splitting the skull and sticking them into the forehead, like it was with my parents, wouldn\'t be that easy."
"You think the culprit had that kind of animal strength...?!"
"...They probably have some kind of weapon, a device that can shoot or pound in those "icepicks".
 That handle was too short to be driven in that deeply by human strength alone."
"......Whatever the case, they have enough force to break through a skull.
 ...It seems that Kanon\'s wound even reached his lungs.
 ......Even if you see our opponent, do not step out in front.
 You must not move away from my back."
Just how sinister and frightening was this weapon that could shoot those creepy icepicks?
......And could I do anything to combat it with just this candlestick in my hand?
In the first murder, the culprit had probably assaulted four of our parents at once as they discussed the inheritance problem in the dining hall.
{n}...And we also had four people.
......Apparently, I wasn\'t the only person thinking this.
......George‐aniki,
 Jessica,
 ...and, of course, Aunt Natsuhi...
...were stretching their senses to the utmost limit, in the highest and worst state of tension, slowly advancing one step, then another...
.........Aaah, what sinful people are we...
...A world as terrifying as this, ......and we pushed Maria and the rest right into the middle of it, just because of the seeds of doubt spread by that single letter...
We finally reached the first floor.
 .........The parlor was just across the hall.
When we listened carefully, .........we could hear it faintly.
{n}......Maria\'s eerie singing voice.
She wasn\'t singing naturally, as though she were in a good mood.
.........She was singing mechanically, as if she was in music class in school and had been ordered to sing.
...The song she was singing was just a common folk song, one that everyone has probably sung in school at one time or another.
......But why that, in the middle of the night, alone, with all her heart, over and over, why...?!
When we had just left the study, we had called out in loud voices, asking Maria where she was.
...But this time, no one said even a single word.
......We hid our breath and the sound of our footsteps, heightened all our senses, and examined everywhere around us to a neurotic degree......as we advanced each step...
The door to the parlor was closed.
{n}But we could hear Maria\'s singing voice through it...
Aunt Natsuhi put her hand on the handle of the doorknob...
 George‐aniki stopped her.
"...I\'ll open the door...
 Aunt Natsuhi, Battler‐kun, ready your weapons."
"............All right.
 ......Be careful."
"They might attack as soon as we open it...
 George nii‐san, watch yourself...!"
"...Sure...
 .........OK then, ......here we go...!
 ............nn?!"
He tried to open it, but immediately felt the hard resistance of the lock.
Aunt Natsuhi took the bundle of keys from her pocket and gave them to George.
......There were about ten keys, and none of us had a clue which was which.
Because of this, George had to fumble around loudly and test several of the keys.
......Since we had hidden our footsteps, preparing to make a surprise attack on the room, this felt almost fatal...
The whole time, we could hear Maria\'s voice from the parlor, singing the same song over and over.
......It was like a broken, crazy cassette tape...
In the morning, we had been in that room the whole time.
{n}...All of the frightening things had occurred outside that room.
{n}...So, we had convinced ourselves that even if nowhere else could be trusted, that room alone was safe.
.........That baseless impression was quickly falling apart......
"............Nn, .........it unlocked."
"...Thank you.
 George‐kun, Jessica, move behind me."
"......Auntie.
 Let\'s all jump in at once and split up in different directions.
 If we just stand around after opening the door, those icepicks might fly right through the center...!"
"I\'m well aware.
 .........Ready...?"
"Ihihi...!
 Actually, I kinda wish I could call it quits...!"
I readied myself.
{n}...If they\'re going to throw icepicks at me, we\'ll see how they like my candlestick!!
"......Go!!!"
Aunt Natsuhi and I rammed into the door as we flew into the parlor,
 quickly splitting up left and right, and searching the parlor for someone who might be waiting for us.
But what our eyes landed upon...
.........was an altogether...
.........outlandish scene...
The parlor.........was stained with blood.
This place, where we had spent almost the entire day,
 where we had pressed in together to protect ourselves from some unknown malice,
 had become stained with fresh blood, had become an ocean of blood...!!
On the floor lay Genji‐san, Kumasawa‐san, and Doctor Nanjo, their entire bodies stained bright red with blood...
.........But the only way we could identify them was by their clothes.
......That was because......aaah, that\'s right, this was how this whole tragedy started...!!
Their faces were all mashed up like Dad and the others in the storehouse, ...and you couldn\'t even tell where the eyes and noses were!!
It was like someone had vulgarly gobbled apart a tomato pot stew wrapped in a pie crust, ......all globby and sloppy, ...uuwaaaaaaAAAAAAaaaaaaAAAAaahhh!!
And that wasn\'t all.
{n}Their bodies had other wounds.
......They were those "demon\'s icepicks"!
{n}They were in......Genji‐san\'s stomach, Doctor Nanjo\'s thigh—no, his knee?
{n}Yeah, it would be his knee...! In the epitaph, the sixth twilight was the stomach,
{n}and on the seventh twilight, it said to gouge the knee!
So after seeing one of them stuck near Kumasawa baa‐chan\'s calf, I couldn\'t help masochistically laughing "yeah, of course it would be"...!!
On the sixth twilight, gouge the stomach and kill.
{n}On the seventh twilight, gouge the knee and kill.
{n}On the eighth twilight, gouge the leg and kill.
Aaaaaah, ......now even the eighth twilight is over.
 And the next one, the ninth twilight, ......what was it again...?
Maria......was there.
.........She was facing the far wall, ...standing stock still, completely alone.
Facing away from this horrible scene, standing in front of the wall, singing her song over and over...
There was nothing else in the room.
......Just the corpses of the three who had been brutally killed, ...and the receiver, still off its hook, showing that it had been this room that the call had come from.
.........Just that and Maria, her back to this scene, facing the wall as she kept on singing......
......We couldn\'t even scream at this......bizarre scene.
...We could only stare shocked, our mouths hanging loosely open......
"Ma‐.........Maria............?"
Jessica called out to her.
...But Maria showed no reaction.
{n}.........Alone, she kept singing, on and on......
We had come here trying to save Maria from some approaching danger.
...So, now that we had found her, we should have been running up to her, hugging her, joyous that she was safe.
 ......And yet, not one of us could do that...!
Everyone thought it. But they couldn\'t say it.
 After all, because...because...that\'s right, it\'s crazy, and yet......but no, it couldn\'t be.........!!
"Ma‐......Maria!!
 Stop singing!!
 Are you listening?!!"
At some point, ...Aunt Natsuhi and I had pointed our weapons at Maria\'s back.
......I yelled at Maria in a violent voice.
{n}......But there was no reaction.
{n}She just kept singing...!!
With the candlestick still readied, I ran up to her, and forcefully—no, violently slammed my hand down on her shoulder.
 Then I pulled on her shoulder, forcing her to turn around!
"......Uuoa.
 ............Uu."
Maria\'s small body was quickly pulled down and fell.
...And, as though unhappy about how her singing had been interrupted, ......she looked into my face with her usual expression.
Even in this gruesome situation,
 {i:she was just like normal!!}
"Maria, what the hell is this?!
 Who, ...who did this?!"
".........Uu.
 {f:5:Beatrice}."
"Enough of that {i:fucking} bullshit!!!"
I threw the candlestick I had been holding against the wall.
{n}The violence of that reckless sound should have gone straight into Maria\'s heart.
{n}......But her expression didn\'t change at all!
"Battler‐kun, stop!
 Maria‐chan, ......this time, you should have seen the face of the culprit who killed these three.
 Was the culprit......the same {f:5:Beatrice} who gave you the letter?!"
"......Uu.
 {f:5:Beatrice}."
"Well, now we know for sure.
 There is a 19th person, {f:5:Beatrice} does exist!!"
"Then, Maria, I\'m sure you\'ll tell me this, at least?
 How did they kill these three people?
 What the hell did they do to them to kill them in such a brutal way?!"
"......Don\'t know."
"How could you not know?!
 It happened in this room!!
 Are you trying to tell me you were so absorbed in singing that song that you didn\'t even notice?!"
"Calm down, Battler‐kun!!
 Ma‐...Maria‐chan.
 Let\'s you and me have a chat.
 ...Okay?"
George‐aniki, as he always did, crouched down next to Maria so that their eyes met, and talked to her very kindly...
"...Maria‐chan, ......can you tell me why were you facing the wall and singing that song...?"
".........Uu.
 ...{f:5:Beatrice} said to face the wall and keep singing for a long time.
 Uu."
"So {f:5:Beatrice} came here, then?!
 Genji‐san and the rest were still alive at that point, right?!"
"......Uu.
 We all came into the parlor together and sat down.
 ......Genji‐san made sure to lock the door."
"It {i:was} locked when we got here......but then, how did {f:5:Beatrice} get into the parlor?!!"
"Uu.
 But {f:5:Beatrice} is a witch so locks don\'t matter.
 She turned into butterflies and came in through the crack in the door."
"Huuhh?!
 Give it a rest with your goddamn jokes!!!
 Like hell that happened!
 What are you going on about?!"
"Kihhihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi!!
 You can\'t believe it?
 That\'s why I didn\'t want to say.
 Even if I tell you, you don\'t believe."
"But {f:5:Beatrice} is a witch.
 She can do anything with her strange magic.
 That\'s why {f:5:Beatrice} doesn\'t care whether a door is locked or not.
 Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi...!"
"A‐and then?! After {f:5:Beatrice} appeared, what happened to everyone?!"
"......{f:5:Beatrice} talked to us.
 She said Grandfather\'s study was protected by a powerful force, and she couldn\'t enter no matter what she did.
 So she told us she\'d select the three sacrifices from the four people in the parlor.
 ......They all begged her not to."
"Kihihihihihihihihi, Kumasawa‐san kept saying "please, please don\'t".
 But {f:5:Beatrice} chose.
 ......And when she did, she said I would be fine.
 .........Why do you think?"
"It\'s because I had the scorpion charm with the fifth magic circle of Mars, upon which Battler prayed for my safety and which he put his feelings into.
 Because of that power, {f:5:Beatrice} couldn\'t do anything to me, and me alone."
"So she decided to use the other three for the sacrifices.
 And then she said this to me."
{e:070:― Come, face the wall and sing a song for me.
......You will sing lots and lots of songs, so no matter what happens, no matter what you hear, you won\'t hear you won\'t hear you won\'t know.
Come, let me hear many fun songs.}
"So I was singing the whole time.
 Over and over.
 So I didn\'t hear anything, didn\'t know anything.
 ...And then all of you came.
 Uu."
"You expect me to believe that crap?!
 Don\'t take me for a moron!!!"
"Kihhihihihihi!
 Then who will you suspect this time?
 Suspect me?
 Try killing me right here?
 Even if you do that, {f:5:Beatrice} won\'t stop "existing".
 Now, the eighth twilight is over, and {f:5:Beatrice} will revive!!"
"No she fucking won\'t, I\'m done with your shit, I\'ve had enough to last me a lifetime!!
 There\'s no such thing as witches, that crap won\'t work on me!!!"
"I won\'t accept it, {f:5:Beatrice} doesn\'t "exist"!!
 I\'ll never accept that she does!!
 So I won\'t let her exist, I won\'t let her revive!!
 The legend\'s a legend and that\'s all it\'s ever gonna be.
 I won\'t accept something like that!!!!!!!!"
"Battler, stop...!!
 It\'s not like Maria killed them or let them die!!
 B‐{f:5:Beatrice} came, and Maria had to obey, unable to resist...!!"
"............Huh?!
 A‐......Aunt Natsuhi?
 Sh‐she isn\'t here...!"
"Huh? What?!"
"M‐Mom? Where did she go......?!"
"...............She went out by herself just now, reading a letter."
Letter?!
 Th‐that makes sense, the culprit\'s done with the eighth twilight and it\'s all gone swimmingly for them.
They might well have left a letter so they could brag even more.
We had been so wrapped up in questioning Maria that we forgot to look for one...!
But even as well armed as she was, why had she left the room all by herself in this dangerous mansion after reading it?!
Jessica tried to chase after her and tugged at the handle to the door, but it resisted strangely and wouldn\'t open...!
"Mom, Mom!!"
"What\'s going on?!!
 Open... Open...!!!"
It was only natural.
 ......Natsuhi had picked up the candlestick, which Battler had thrown at the wall and which had fallen to the floor.
.........She had then skillfully wedged it between the doorknobs on the double doors like a bolt, holding them closed.
...The intricate design of the candlestick meant it jammed well, and formed a truly sturdy seal on the door.
The tragic scream of a daughter for her mother...
{n}Did it reach Natsuhi\'s ears, or not...?
Natsuhi was...
......alone in the entrance hall.
It was the place where the portrait of {f:5:Beatrice} had been hung.
Natsuhi threw down the final letter from {f:5:Beatrice} that she had read in the parlor,
 readied her rifle again, and in a voice that rang clear, yelled in the massive space that was the entrance hall.
"......I am Ushiromiya Natsuhi, representative of the Ushiromiya family!!!
 Show yourself,
 ...Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}!!!"
The entrance hall was dimly lit.
 Other than a faint light which shone on the center of the room, everything was blotted out by the jet‐black darkness.
......In that darkness,
 .........butterflies glittering in gold squirmed, twinkled,
 ......and sneered.
Natsuhi gave one more huge gulp, and pointed the cold barrel of the gun at the gold butterflies......
"............At last...
.........you have shown yourself.
 ...............I still can\'t believe...
......that something like you really existed...
 ......But that isn\'t a problem."
"......Both I, bearing the title of representative to the Ushiromiya family,
 and you, claiming to have succeeded the head of the Ushiromiya family, are here right now.
 ......At this point, whether you are a witch or not is a trivial problem!"
"...............Come,
 ...let us settle this.
 ...Which of us will truly succeed the Ushiromiya family?
 ...Me, Ushiromiya Natsuhi,
 ............or you,
 ......{f:5:Beatrice}!!
 Allow me to respectfully accept your request for a duel...!!"
The gold butterflies slowly formed a human shape, which walked into the dim light...
Natsuhi readied the rifle,
 ......and glared.
The witch raised her golden staff overhead,
 ...and laughed.
Natsuhi\'s finger...
slowly squeezed the trigger.........
"And...gooooooooooooooooo!!!"
Battler made an all out dash at the door and rammed into it, crushing the candlestick which had been barring it, and making it possible for a big gap to be opened in the door.
He kept kicking the candlestick through that gap, and the door was finally released.
At that time, they heard it.
{n}...They clearly heard, just once, the crisp sound of gunfire...!
"Mom!!
 Moooooooooooooooom!!!"
"Jessica‐chan, you mustn\'t run off by yourself...!!"
"That was the sound of a gun just now!!
 Aunt Natsuhi just shot!!"
At who?
 At the culprit!!!
The noise had come from the entrance hall.
{n}And the entrance hall......looked like a stage.
Like the heroine of a tragedy, lying down and bathed in light,
 .........arrayed in the beauty of that silence,
 ......Aunt Natsuhi was face up, crumpled on the floor......
Half‐crazed, Jessica ran up to Aunt Natsuhi.
...On her forehead,
 ...it was almost as though a sparkling shard of pigeon\'s blood ruby had been placed there.
......And,
 ......from it, a single stream...
.........of blood makeup...
passed by her eye,
 and began to traverse her face......
The faint smell of gunpowder smoke came from the barrel of the rifle Aunt Natsuhi still grasped.
............Huh?
 Then,
 .........then,
 ............she...
...shot...
herself......in the forehead...?!
 Why?!
"Mom, Mom Mom!!!
 UWAAAAAaaaAAAAaaAAAA!!!"
"...I, I don\'t get it!!
 Why did Auntie run away alone,
 ......why did she shoot through her own forehead?!"
"......Maria‐chan, Aunt Natsuhi read a letter before she left the room, right?!
 There\'s no letter here!
 Damn it, what did she read, and why was she lured out here?!"
"I don\'t know I don\'t know, who cares about that...!!
 What the hell, why suicide?!
 Why......did you leave me alone?!"
"UwaaaaaaAAAAAaaaaaa......!!"
Jessica clung to her mother\'s corpse, crying earnestly...
My body consumed by an anger I didn\'t know what to do with, I stole the rifle from Aunt Natsuhi\'s hand,
 and spun around, pointing the barrel of the gun into the darkness on all sides, as though I was pointing a light from a lighthouse, trying to find the culprit.
George‐aniki, even in this situation, was trying to calmly figure something out, but that effort might have been doomed to futility.
............And Maria alone was completely indifferent.
{n}......Is she treating this as some kind of predetermined fate?
No, that\'s not it.
 This is all......a prelude to a wonderful world.
The door to the Golden Land will finally...
open.
"......On the ninth twilight, the witch revives, and none shall be left alive.
 ......And on the tenth twilight, the journey ends, and you shall reach the Home of the Gold."
"......It\'s all over now, {f:5:Beatrice}.
 Congratulations, congratulations.
 ...So lead me, lead me to the Golden Land you told me of...
 ...Right now......!!"
There, all of the dead will be resurrected, and even the love they once possessed will be revived.
{n}............So, in Maria\'s eyes, it\'s just as though all of today\'s tragedies never even happened.
And all those days she spent deprived of love never happened either.
"Will you cut that out?!
 What\'s so fun, what\'s to be congratulated?!!
 There were eighteen people on this island!
 Fourteen are dead!
 Only the four of us are left!!"
"I\'m definitely not gonna die!
 Until the night is over—no, until the typhoon passes, and the seagulls gather again at the harbor, I\'m definitely not gonna die!!
 I\'m gonna survive, I\'m gonna survive, definitely!!"
"............Kihihihihihi.
 Give it up, Battler.
 ...Guns are meaningless against {f:5:Beatrice}.
 Besides, survival and everything else doesn\'t matter now, because it\'s over.
 {i:The journey has already ended.}
 ......See, look at the clock."
...Huh?
 The clock?
{n}Hearing those words, I looked at my wristwatch.
Both hands were almost touching near the top.
{n}......Very soon, it would be 12 a.m.
 ...In other words, 24:00.
When you think about it, isn\'t 24:00 a strange time?
{n}...It can be called 24:00, and it can also be called 0:00.
It\'s the hour at the culmination of the previous day, ...and at the same time, it is hour zero as the next day begins.
"............{f:5:Beatrice}!!"
Maria suddenly called out happily, and ran towards the darkness.
It was almost as though......{f:5:Beatrice} was somewhere in that darkness, and Maria was running up to her.
As I looked down the barrel of the rifle,
 as Jessica hugged her mother\'s corpse,
 as George‐aniki stood there shocked,
 ......we gazed into the darkness...
Our eyes...fixed just in front of {f:5:Beatrice}\'s portrait.
And there, Maria leapt into a hug...
...with the portrait\'s...
subject.
You\'ve got to be kidding me,
 ......this is...ridiculous, impossible...
...This madness can\'t possibly {i:be},
 ...witches don\'t "exist", I won\'t accept it...!
Things like you must not "exist",
 because this is a human world—you think I could accept something that\'s not human?! Never, I will never!!
I pulled hard on the rifle\'s lever; the cartridge was ejected, fell on the floor, and a new cartridge was loaded.
Then, I sighted the witch down the barrel...
Maria turned around.
{n}......Still clinging to the Golden Witch, she turned around.
"......Didn\'t I tell you it\'s meaningless?
 ............Mere lead bullets are meaningless against {f:5:Beatrice}."
"......Humans are so stupid, aren\'t they?
 ......Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi."
"I won\'t accept the existence of witches!!
 Who are you?!!
 Just try moving one step, just try moving one finger!!
 I\'ll blast you away!!!"
"Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi,
 *giggle* *giggle* *giggle* *giggle* *giggle*"
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*, *cackle*cackle*"
""Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!!""
The laughter of the witch—no, the witches—was joined by the laughter of even the large clock in the hall...
It was probably telling us that the time was 24:00.
It was both a tone telling us that we had reached the culmination of this day, and a tone informing us that all had returned to nothing.
{i:The rules had specified that the witch would win when time ran out}.
".........Battler.
 ...George onii‐chan and Jessica onee‐chan.
 ......The journey...{0}has ended...{0}and the witch...{0}has revived...{0}you see?"
And {i:none shall be left alive.}
{e:070:The witch shall praise the wise, and bestow four treasures.
{n}{n}One shall be all of the Golden Land\'s gold.
{n}One resurrects all the dead people\'s souls.
{n}One even revives all the love they possessed.
{n}And one for the witch to eternally rest.
{n}{n}Rest in peace, my beloved witch, {f:5:Beatrice}}."Hey, everyone, good job finishing "Umineko no Naku Koro ni"!
 Man, I still didn\'t have a clue what was going on when the story ended!"
"So just what happened?
 Was that basically the "bad ending", where time runs out before the culprit can be exposed?"
"Uu.
 Definitely a bad ending.
 Uu."
"I think so too.
 {f:5:Beatrice}\'s letter, which Maria‐chan read on the first day, did tell us in advance to solve the riddle of the epitaph.
 We were all so busy trying to protect ourselves and look for the culprit that we didn\'t even take a shot at it."
".........Yes, that\'s true.
 If we had actually tried to solve the riddle, I\'m sure things would have ended differently."
"I wonder about that.
 Shannon‐chan, you did a good job too!"
"You don\'t have to be our waitress and serve tea.
 After all, this is a wrap party.
 As a group of people who met a horrible fate, let\'s all get along and lick each other\'s wou~~nds!
 Licklickli~ck!!"
"Speaking of a horrible fate, Shannon beats the rest of us hands down, doesn\'t she?
 She was such a beautiful character, so I thought she\'d definitely survive until the very end,
 but she was killed right in the beginning, and on top of that...what was it?
 Half of her face was smashed, right?
 That\'s the worst!"
"............That was my role, so, umm......there was no way around it..."
"...Nee‐san, it\'s nothing for you to worry about.
 Judging by the final epilogue, even Milady and the others met with a considerably tragic end."
"Ahahaha... It seems that way.
 I think I remember seeing this horrible picture, kind of like my entire body had been eaten apart and dismembered."
"Speaking of which, don\'t you think Kanon‐kun\'s last moments were the coolest?
 Even though he had the tables turned on him, it was a showdown with the culprit, right?
 It\'s a whole bunch better than our confusing last moments!"
".........Though, in the end, I was no match for her."
"Still, ...I think that Kanon‐kun\'s death was a big hint.
 I mean, because of that, it became clear that a 19th person existed."
"Yes.
 At that time, everyone\'s location was obvious.
 So it was impossible for anyone other than some unknown 19th person to kill Kanon‐kun."
"Uu!
 I did say it was {f:5:Beatrice} from the beginning, over and oooover.
 Uu!"
"......I don\'t wanna believe it, but that does prove the culprit was a witch calling herself {f:5:Beatrice}."
"That\'s right...
 There were many strange things that happened which a human couldn\'t do..."
"Uu. Only a witch could do things like Auntie Eva\'s locked‐room murder.
 A human couldn\'t do that!
 Uu!"
"............Not only is it clear that a 19th person exists, but it is also obvious that this person holds a power that humans can\'t even imagine."
"In that case, I don\'t think there\'s anything wrong with calling this person {f:5:Beatrice}."
"...We probably met at the very end.
 ...Met with the Golden Witch."
"That\'s why I kept telling you {f:5:Beatrice} exists.
 It all went bad because no one ever believed.
 Uu!
 Even one of my witch friends says miracles won\'t happen if you don\'t believe!
 Uu!"
"That\'s right.
 {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama is generous to those who respect her."
"......I feel as if, despite the fact that horrible incidents kept occurring one after the other, Maria‐sama wasn\'t in danger from {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama until the end."
"Maria did believe in {f:5:Beatrice} from the very beginning.
 ...But then, so did Kanon‐kun and the others, so how do you explain why they were all killed?"
"......{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama probably had her reasons."
"If the epitaph poem represented {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama\'s resurrection ritual, then she needed many sacrifices.
 ......He must simply have been designated to be one of those."
"...Shannon‐chan, you met a horrible end...
 At the very least, I wish your death could have been more peaceful and pretty."
".........Umm, well, ...it\'s not like it hurt...
 Besides,
 as you can see, right now, I\'m perfectly fine, so don\'t worry."
Shannon proved this by stroking her cheek which had been crushed during the story, and everyone laughed out loud, smiling.
"Well, it feels a bit weird saying this, ...but I was sure this story would be in the standard mystery genre.
 I\'m a little surprised to find out that it\'s fantasy.
 After all, a story revolving around an inheritance, set on a Western‐style mansion shut away on an isolated island, ...I thought that was the classic formula for mysteries."
"......Uu.
 It\'s not fantasyyyy!
 {f:5:Beatrice} "exiiists"!
 Uu."
".........Yes, we know.
 {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama does "exist"."
"That\'s right.
 ......{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama does "exist"."
"...I hate to admit it, but I\'ve got no choice.
 Because it\'s obvious that a 19th person, a witch, was involved...!"
"She pulled off many things that would be impossible for humans.
 During the story, we thought of all kinds of things, trying to deny that."
"...But now I can say it clearly.
 Each one of them, all of them, were crimes impossible for a human.
 ......Those crimes would be impossible to carry out unless it was the witch {f:5:Beatrice} using all of the power magic could provide."
"The culprit was a witch.
 That point is perfectly clear.
 Long live {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.
 Hahahahahaha."
"Uu.
 Everyone believed.
 I\'m happy.
 Uu!"
"......Gods and witches might seem terrifying to people who are frightened of them,
 but I think they must have affection for those who believe in and respect them."
"............I think it\'s just as you say."
"So, now we\'re all done with playing with murder cases.
 Now\'s the time to pull ourselves together and try hard to solve the riddle of the epitaph, just like {f:5:Beatrice} said, right?"
"Uu!
 Agreed!
 {f:5:Beatrice} will definitely be happy."
"Hahahahaha...
 We all ignored that letter during the story, after all."
"......Even though it was thrust right in front of us, we almost completely ignored it.
 I kind of feel sorry for {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama."
"I have a memo with the epitaph on it!
 Let\'s all solve the puzzle, let\'s all solve the puzzle...!"
"This story probably went wrong ever since that time."
".........That may be so.
 Maybe we should have tried solving the epitaph\'s riddle from the beginning, like {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama said."
"Well, it\'s a little late now.
 Even so, let\'s try solving it now and see if the witch forgives us.
 Let\'s go, let\'s try to solve the riddle of the epitaph.
 ......Here we are, "Behold the sweetfish river, running through my beloved home of old"..."
As Maria put her notebook on the table, and opened to the page where the epitaph was written,
 everyone peered closely at it, and had fun and lively discussion as they started guessing this and that about the riddle.
Surrounded by the smell of the black tea and the freshly baked vanilla cookies, they spent the time comfortably and happily......
"..................Wait a second, you guys."
Battler said, in a tone that ruined the mood.
His expression looked a little unhappy.
{n}What could he not like about all of this fun?
"...I\'ve been listening to you guys, and—why did you all stop thinking?
 Why are you so sure that the witch was behind all of this?
 ...Don\'t you realize that stuff like that doesn\'t exist?"
With just those words, ...the happy atmosphere of the tea party disappeared in no time at all.
George and Jessica.
 And Shannon and Kanon.
 And Maria.
......All of them stared blankly, wondering why Battler was saying such weird things.
Even the foolish and arrogant Battler noticed he had said the wrong thing.
"...W‐.........well, come on.
 Isn\'t it clear that these crimes were impossible for a human?"
"Y‐yeah, yeah!
 ...None of the cases would have been possible for a human."
"That\'s right...
 After all, wasn\'t it full of things that you couldn\'t explain using humans...?"
"...I don\'t understand what you\'re saying, Battler‐sama."
"I, I\'m the one who doesn\'t have a clue what {i:you guys} are talking about!
 Isn\'t it obvious that humans committed these crimes?
 There\'s obviously no such thing as witches, right...?"
"Th‐...then...
 ...What about when I was killed in the storehouse, and something horrible was done to half of my face?
 ......If the culprit was human, how could they have accomplished it...?"
"...Well...
 ......I mean...
 It\'s hard to imagine how they could\'ve done something that awful."
"But that was the rose garden storehouse, right?
 I\'m sure there were plenty of weird tools in there.
 Don\'t ask me, but...they could\'ve used some electrical tool like a grinder or an electric saw, couldn\'t they?"
"...............Th‐
.........that\'s......
...umm..."
"Okay, Battler...
 Then how do you explain Grandfather\'s disappearance from the locked room of his study...?
 Grandfather disappeared all of a sudden even though the door was sealed, remember...?"
"We talked about that during the story, too.
 It\'s not impossible that Grandfather used some trick to fool the receipt.
 It\'s also possible that he went out the window, or fell out the window, and Aunt Natsuhi locked it from the inside.
 I could think of a bunch of tricks you could use without relying on magic...you see?"
"............Th‐
......that makes sense, but........."
"In that case, Battler‐kun,
 how do you explain the way my parents were killed in the guest room?
 The door was sealed by the lock and the chain.
 Naturally, the windows were sealed too.
 How would you suggest a human could have killed my parents?"
"...Well,
 ......you\'re right, we did have to leave that trick alone during the story.
 Anyways, there\'s a good chance that the culprit had the key at least.
 And it was possible to look in through the crack of the door that the chain allowed."
"......This is extremely far‐fetched, but it is possible that some device was used through that crack.
 ...Or maybe they brought something out through the crack...?"
"......Hmmmm, well, even though chains are incredibly simple, they\'re a big factor in constructing a locked room...
 .........But authors have done almost every possible locked‐room trick there is to do by now.
 If you bought just a few locked‐room mysteries from some bookstore or other, you could probably find some trick that would fit perfectly."
"......Anyways, I can\'t think of one now...but I can state for certain that a human could manage it somehow if they tried hard enough."
"Isn\'t that argument horribly irrational...?
 It\'s just ridiculous to claim that it\'s possible for a human to do something, even though you can\'t explain how..."
"......Why is that ridiculous?
 Why did all of you stop thinking?
 Even if it looks impossible, it has to be doable.
 Doesn\'t it always work like that?"
"Battler, you\'re the one being ridiculous.
 ......If you think a human could\'ve done it, try explaining how.
 You can\'t, can you?"
"And just because I can\'t explain it, that immediately makes the culprit a witch?
 With that argument, all of the unsolved crimes in the world could be resolved by saying a witch is the culprit!"
"......Battler, you\'re sidestepping the issue, and you aren\'t explaining anything.
 ...We are saying "A human can\'t do it.
 Therefore the culprit is something that isn\'t human.
 And that something is a witch."
 And yet you keep arbitrarily deciding that witches are impossible even though you can\'t explain anything."
"......Kihihihihihihihihihihihi, it\'s almost like humanity was during the dark ages.
 Like those fools who claimed that the Earth couldn\'t possibly be spinning,
 that the heavens had to be spinning around the Earth, even though they couldn\'t say how."
"...............Th‐...that kind of argument kinda pisses me off.
 So this is basically what you\'re trying to say.
 ...If I can\'t explain how a human could do it,
 ...then I must accept that the culprit is the witch, {f:5:Beatrice}?"
"............It\'s not like we\'re forcing you.
 We were just wondering on what basis you can say such nonsense."
"N‐...nonsense...
......
 ......H‐...hey, is what I\'ve been saying really that weird?!"
"Am I the one who\'s crazy?!
 You guys are really starting to freak me out!"
"......Battler‐sama.
 When I died in the boiler room, I was killed by a 19th person who shouldn\'t exist."
"...Can you explain how a human could have done that?
 At that time, the locations of the 18 were well known.
 Even so, I was killed."
"We talked about that in the story as well...!
 Kumasawa baa‐chan, for example.
 She said that she followed right after you\'d headed down into the boiler room, but for all we know, that might\'ve been a lie."
"She might\'ve entered the boiler room with you and caught you by surprise!
 Or maybe, when you stepped into the boiler room, you activated some kind of trap, one that might have been set up to hit you with one of those icepicks."
"After all, the stink of Grandfather\'s body was coming from the incinerator.
 Someone was bound to come, so all the culprit had to do was set up a trap, and it would be more than possible for them to stay away from that place and create an alibi for the time of your death...!"
"......You talk about a trap in the boiler room...but what kind of trap?"
"That\'s right.
 After that happened, we all immediately ran over to the boiler room.
 But we didn\'t find any kind of weird device like that!"
"......That is correct.
 Battler‐sama, what kind of trap do you claim I was killed with...?"
"Well,
 .........I don\'t know that.
 ...But anyway, they must have pulled off some kind of trap, or maybe someone is lying, or...
or what about this?!"
"Kanon‐kun, what if the whole thing was just you playacting?!
 Th‐that\'s it, you were playacting!!
 Auntie Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi were also playacting.
 They made the locked room themselves, and were only pretending to be dead!"
".........Battler...
 .........Has your...
head been...
feeling alright......?"
"......Umm, .........should I bring some cold drinks...?"
"D‐don\'t look at me with those pitying eyes, I\'m not saying something that crazy...
 I\'m just pointing out possibilities that could have been used as tricks, alright?"
"Look, isn\'t one of the clichés in mystery stories that the victims aren\'t really dead?!"
"Clichés...?"
"O‐okay, so.
 When Kanon‐kun was killed, we really did know for sure where the rest of us were.
 And let\'s assume that Kumasawa baa‐chan wasn\'t lying."
"But that only holds true for the survivors.
 ......If the culprit pretended to be dead, placed themselves together with the real victims to hide themselves, and then acted on their own later, then everything would be explained!"
"............I guess...
 Are you trying to say that Auntie Eva or one of the rest of them was the culprit...?
 But Doctor Nanjo confirmed everyone\'s death as a doctor, remember?"
"......That\'s right.
 Doctor Nanjo checked all of the victims.
 ...Battler‐sama, for your theory to work, wouldn\'t Doctor Nanjo have to be one of the culprits too?"
"Uh, yeah, that\'s right!!
 Once you consider that Doctor Nanjo might have been one of the culprits and faked the proclamation of death, the whole story changes...!
 See, that\'s also a cliché in mystery novels, isn\'t it?!!"
"......But Doctor Nanjo was also killed..."
"Umm, .........about that...
 ...That\'s right, Doctor Nanjo faked his death!"
"I mean, there wasn\'t anyone except Doctor Nanjo who could examine corpses properly, and everyone was really confused then anyway.
 We didn\'t have any spare time to check and see if he still had a pulse!
 With this theory, any one of the dead people could have been walking around!"
".........I think that it would have been hard for the six of us who died in the beginning to do that...
 ......After all, the shutter was closed, ...and there was a padlock that couldn\'t have been opened from the inside..."
"Yeah.
 Mom was holding onto that key.
 So was Mom one of the culprits too?"
"...Aaaaaaah, wait a sec, ...
maybe it was impossible for the first six, but in the case of Aniki\'s parents, the door was only locked on the outside.
 So they could have opened it from the inside...
 ...That\'s right, after we left the room, maybe they jumped out the window and got to the boiler room first!"
"Is, ......is that too much...?!
 Or maybe Doctor Nanjo made a mistake when examining the corpses?!"
"Look, he said it himself, right?
 He said that there\'s a very high probability of making a mistake when examining corpses!
 They disguised it well, or prepared a substitute corpse or something, and faked their own death!!
 Let\'s leave the method or trick they used for later...and...you see, it\'s not that hard to deny a 19th person existed!"
"Much less a {i:witch}!
 At least that much is completely impossible!!"
"............I don\'t know why you\'ve been trying so stubbornly to say that one of us is the culprit.
 Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi, in other words, you want to suspect one of your relatives...?"
"That\'s not it...
 It\'s just, uh, I can\'t easily accept that a 19th person existed...and even if one did, I think we should construct our argument from the point of view that the culprit was a human—
witches are something you only start talking about in desperation, at the very end, after everything else has been disproved, that\'s what I\'m trying to say."
"I mean, come on, there\'s no way witches exist, right?!
 Why have you all just been casually accepting that the culprit was a witch?"
"I think it\'s great how your family love makes you hate the thought that someone close to you is a murderer.
 But is it alright to just brush things over like that?!
 Don\'t you want to find the detestable culprit who killed so many people?!"
"Aniki, you want to avenge your parents, don\'t you?!
 Jessica, you want to avenge Kanon‐kun, and Kanon‐kun, you want to avenge Shannon‐chan, right?!
 Shannon‐chan, you should at least want to know who it was that killed you."
"Why have you all totally surrendered and decided that the culprit was a witch?!
 What\'s wrong with all of you?!"
The foolish and short‐tempered Battler tried to force his ignorance on the others by yelling at them.
...However, everyone just looked at him pityingly, silently watching over him.
Then, the wise Maria laughed, and pointed out Battler\'s mistake for him.
"...............Kihihihihihihihihi.
 ...We\'re just astounded.
 ......All you\'ve been doing is repeating this nonsense, thinking you\'ve figured something out, Battler."
"......So what?
 And?
 How would a human do it?
 Concretely?
 Whenever we ask you those questions, all you say is "I just can\'t think of anything now" or "with some kind of device" or something, using abstract words to run away and evade the topic."
"......In fact, I want to ask {i:you}, Battler.
 Why don\'t {i:you} believe in {f:5:Beatrice}?
 She "exists", so why don\'t you believe?"
"Because she doesn\'t "exist"!
 Witches don\'t "exist"!!
 There\'s no way!!"
......He was almost like a stubborn child refusing for no reason.
The pitying gazes quietly blanketed Battler, but they didn\'t reach his stubborn heart.
"............You\'re acting just totally like a kid who can\'t have his way..."
"......Battler‐sama.
 I understand your feelings, but..."
".........{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama does "exist"."
"Battler‐kun... Why don\'t you believe?
 Look at how much circumstantial evidence there is."
"I don\'t accept the argument that if I can\'t explain it it\'s all the witch.
 If you don\'t know how a light bulb shines, if you don\'t know the principle, does that mean it\'s all magic?"
"It doesn\'t, does it!
 There\'s nothing that can\'t be explained without magic!!
 All of this about witches and magic is just abdication of thought!
 You just surrendered and gave up because you don\'t understand what happened!
 I\'m right, aren\'t I!"
".....................Ki‐hihihihihihihihihihihi.
 ...Well, I\'m not surprised,
 ......but it looks like you\'re the only one who\'s not going to believe no matter what."
"......If even a single person doesn\'t believe, the "miracle" won\'t occur.
 ......So, if you don\'t rethink your ignorant theories, the miracle, ......the magic won\'t be completed."
"Heheh...
 Nowww I see.
 ......I finally figured it out.
 ...So in other words, you guys want to get me to say that the witch exists, don\'t you?
 If everyone accepts this lie, it will become "the truth".
 ......That\'s what this is all about, isn\'t it?!"
"......Well, too bad.
 This is the one place I\'m going to have to say too bad, that\'s no goddamn good at all. I refuse.
 ......{i:You guys are all pressing me, and that is exactly why it\'s no goddamn good.}"
".....................Why?"
"Sorry, but why don\'t you let me flip over the chessboard one last time...?
 If you want to force me to accept that there\'s a witch, there\'s a really easy way."
"......And it\'s not the roundabout way of saying "humans can\'t do it so it must be a witch"!
 All you have to do is actually show it to me, the way a witch did it with magic."
"Furthermore, what Maria said earlier is what will really dig her grave.
 ......You said that if even one person doesn\'t believe, a "miracle" won\'t occur."
"But real miracles happen whether people believe in them or not!
 Even if I alone don\'t believe!!
 So any miracles or magic or witches that exist only because I believe in them are downright lies!!"
"................................."
The uneasy mood following Battler\'s ignorant rant...
was thoughtfully blown away by a very refreshing and light laugh.
Whose laugh...?
 Battler was surprised by that voice which he had never heard before.
When he looked at George and Jessica, at Shannon and Kanon and Maria, he noticed that they had suddenly gone respectfully silent.
"..................{f:5:Beatrice}."
".........Wonderful.
 ...I haven\'t been able to meet such a charming human for quite some time."
"Wh‐
..................who...
......are you..."
"......So you don\'t even know the host of the tea party to which you were invited.
 ......Simply wonderful.
 *cackle*cackle*...!"
"...You are graced by the presence of the Golden Witch who has lived for a thousand years, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama."
"I am most honored to see you, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama..."
"......Please forgive Battler‐kun\'s ranting."
"Th‐this guy\'s just stubborn, and, umm, he still doesn\'t understand the situation he\'s in......!"
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*...
 It is fine.
 ......After a thousand years, most witches get tired of living.
 Once in a while, it is nice to meet a man with backbone such as yourself."
"...............It is quite an honor to be present when {f:5:Beatrice} shows herself, Battler."
"......Heh,
 .........heh‐heh‐heh‐heh...!!
 Now this...
 ......This is some shit.
 ...Are you really that desperate to make me believe that a witch,
 ...that a 19th person is the culprit...?"
"This is starting to get interesting...!
 And it\'s no goddamn good...!!
 You must be an illusion of the witch {f:5:Beatrice} who\'s asserted by Maria and the others."
".........And only when everyone believes in your existence will you finally be allowed to exist.
 ...You\'re that kind of a fictional being, right?
 That\'s why you want to make me believe too.
 {i:You can\'t exist, because I alone don\'t believe in you}.
 .........Isn\'t that right?!"
".........Your power of understanding isn\'t bad for a common mortal who knows nothing of magic.
 .........I see, it seems that you were born with a strong magic‐resisting power."
"......The natural enemy of us witches.
 ...No matter how much we tip you upside down and shake you,
 {i:you will never believe in us}.
 {i:Therefore, magic will fall short against you}.
 ...That attitude of yours makes a great deal of sense.
 *cackle*cackle*...!"
"I\'ve got no clue what you\'re saying, ihihi!
 It\'s very kind of you to go to all of the trouble of showing yourself to us,
 but I don\'t believe you exist in the slightest."
"It\'s true that many strange things happened during those two days.
 Like Maria said earlier, even though I think that all of the tricks could be explained, I still can\'t lay out the practical details of each one.
 But that doesn\'t mean I\'ll surrender."
"I\'m different from the rest of them, see?
 I\'ll never argue that it was the work of a witch just because I can\'t explain it."
".........My interest in you grows deeper.
 It will be worth my time to break you..."
"......You\'re just the kind of man I\'d love to force into praising my name......
 You\'re just the kind of man I\'d love to force into kissing my toes.
 ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"
"Talk all the nonsense you want...!
 I deny you exist.
 All of the events can be explained with "human tricks"...!!
 There\'s no room for even a speck of magic or witches!!"
"Wonderful!
 ......This is the perfect form of diversion from a thousand years of boredom."
"Then let me ask you.
 A short while ago, you said that using the crack in the door would be sufficient to kill Eva and Hideyoshi, right...?
 Explain how you would do that using your human tricks."
"......Heh.
 Suddenly jumping right into the toughest part, are you?
 ...Does that mean that this is the trick you\'re proudest of?
 Miss {i:Real Culprit}?"
{f:5:Beatrice} shook her golden pipe,
 and seven colors of gentle smoke trailed out of the end.
...The smoke quickly obscured the surroundings,
 ......and they were suddenly in the hallway of the mansion.
In front of their eyes, a slightly opened door, secured by a chain...
Yes, it was the entrance to the room where Eva and Hideyoshi had been killed.
"......N‐nice trick..."
"Now then.
 Show me what you would do through this small crack, "Battler"."
"Erk............
 ......Th‐they probably had some device to shoot those "icepicks".
 If they used that......"
"How would you aim at Eva over on the bed when you can\'t see that far through this crack?
 ......And how would you reach Hideyoshi, in the bathroom with the door shut...?"
".................................Dammit.........
 ...There is a crack...
 There should be some way......"
"*cackle*cackle*.
 If you can\'t think of one, allow me."
"......Oh?
 Go on, how would a great witch do it, then...
 C\'mon, let\'s see your little trick..."
"............Battler, you\'re being rude to {f:5:Beatrice}..."
"It is fine, quite fine.
 What a charming man.
 ...It will make it all the more enjoyable to break him."
"......Heh!
 You really want to make me kiss your toes that much...?!
 Only if I surrender!
 But watch... I\'ll definitely expose this trick, and then I\'ll make you kiss my ass instead!"
"...............*cackle*.
 What a charming man.
 I shall remember that promise.
 ...Weak witches kiss the behinds of demons to gain power.
 Because there is no greater oath of total submission.
 It is words like those that give me the desire to subjugate you.
 .........*cackle*cackle*...!"
Paying no mind to Battler\'s crude ranting, {f:5:Beatrice} once again waved her golden pipe.
......Yes, for that golden pipe was her precious magic wand.
"Come, arise, children.
 I am the guide of Purgatory.
 Wield the seven stakes, which forgave the deadly sins."
Guided by those magic words, which sounded like a psalm, seven stakes gathered.
{n}...They were the stakes of the seven demons symbolizing the deadly sins of sinful people.
"Beelzebub and Asmodeus.
 Come, forgive their sins.
 Release the spirits of the sinners...!"
"Wha...?!"
The stakes of Beelzebub and Asmodeus responded to {f:5:Beatrice}\'s call.
The two demonic stakes burst into motion like billiard balls struck by a cue, and were sucked in through the crack of the door.
Then came the sound of them deflecting repeatedly off the walls of the room, making a sound like a woodpecker.
And finally, a pleasant sound could be heard.
......It was a small, satisfying sound, like the one heard when someone is chopping firewood and the falling ax neatly and easily slices through the wood.
It was the sound of the two stakes burying themselves deep into Eva and Hideyoshi\'s foreheads.
"............Right through the middle.
 Want to see...?"
They had definitely heard two sounds like someone\'s forehead being split open.
Battler wasn\'t permitted to see it, since he was on the other side of the door,
 but those two had died again, and this second time, they lay not an inch apart from where they had lain the last time, with the exact same blood spray as before.
"Y‐............you must be crazy...
 Th‐......this is insane......!
 Y‐you can\'t kill people with this insanity!!!"
"I most certainly can.
 ......I can kill them just like this...!
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*!"
Suddenly, they were no longer in the hall, but seated at the tea party they had started from.
......Everyone but Battler was sitting meekly, ......but Kanon was moaning, fresh blood dangling from his mouth.
{n}Such bad manners for a tea party.
Satan\'s stake was buried deep into Kanon\'s chest.
"..................u...
...............gah...
......"
"Ka‐......Kanon‐kun......
Kanon‐kun!!
 Daa......damn iiiiiiiiiit!!"
Battler was the only one getting agitated.
George, Jessica, Shannon—everyone else was meekly hanging their heads like students being told off by their teacher.
"...Kanon, you were captivated by a trifling anger and tried to disturb my banquet.
 ......Your deadly sin is being easily captivated by anger.
 Cleanse yourself, regret, and do it over."
"......{f:5:at}
......{f:5:rice}......
......sa...ma..............."
"B‐...{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama...
 Please, forgive him...
 I think Kanon‐kun has repented enough......!"
"Wonderful.
 I am generous to those who respect me.
 ......*cackle*cackle*...!"
"Cut the crap!!!
 Don\'t think for a second that this piss‐poor show of theatrics will convince me of your sorry existence!
 Like hell you\'re a thousand‐year‐old witch!
 Your tricks aren\'t a thousand years old, at best they\'re the accumulation of a hundred years of clichés that the mystery world created!"
"They\'re not magic!!
 No way are they magic!!
 All of these crimes can be explained with "human tricks"!!"
"*cackle*cackle*!
 You would explain my thousand years with a hundred years by humans...?
 Good, good, that\'s why I like you...!"
"...............Foolish Battler...
 Kihhihihihihihihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi...!"
"......Stop yourself, Battler‐kun...
 {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama is someone you can\'t...
go...against......"
"............nn...
......u...
............u..."
Shannon started moaning, holding her cheek.
{n}...Maybe she had a toothache.
But it didn\'t look anything like a toothache.
{n}......A slight redness spread across the cheek Shannon was holding.
It looked like that redness was causing Shannon unbearable pain...
She started to press her nails into her cheek, and drops of sweat appeared all over her body...
"...Shannon...
Shannon...!!
 Hang in there...hang in there!"
"What\'s going on?!
 Damn it, what the hell is that red stuff...?!"
It expanded rapidly, covering half of Shannon\'s face...
...Then, the stupid dunce Battler finally realized...
"Ple‐please, Battler‐kun...!
 Please believe in {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama...!
 I beg you...!!
 Aaaaaaah, because you won\'t believe,
 because you won\'t believe, aaaaaaaaaah...
the magic is,
 ......the magic is wearing off!!!!!!!!"
For the first time in his life, ......Battler heard that sound, like a pomegranate splitting.
The red spray even landed on Battler\'s face...
How sad—Shannon\'s face had been split in half, ...and her last horrible moments in that storehouse had been repeated once again.
"U...uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, Shannon, Shannon!!
 Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!"
"G...ghhhkkk, damn you, damn youuuuuuu!
 Stop it, stop it, stop it!!
 Don\'t humiliate the dead, don\'t humiliate the deeeeeaaaaad!!"
"Uuuu......gah.........eeeggh!!"
 This time, red patterns began to spread across George\'s entire body...
 It was like the beautiful cloud drawn by milk when it is poured into black tea.
 They slowly spread out and extended across his entire body.
......As they grew more saturated in color, they seemed to give George increasingly greater pain.
Looking at those bizarre patterns, ......Battler was petrified as he frantically thought with his pitifully clumsy imagination...
about the nature of the strange deaths that George and the others had experienced...
Before long, ......that redness reached the nearby Jessica as well......
"Gah,
 .........ee...
......ack...
.........hh!!"
"St‐stop stop stop!!!
 What did Aniki do,
 what did Jessica do,
 just STOOOOOOP!!!"
"Ba‐
......Battler......
 ......Don‐
...don\'t let the witch...
break your spirit......!
 ......Deny her,
 erase her...
 As, ......as long as at least one person denies her,
 she\'s an illusion that can\'t exist......!
 Uuuuughhh, gghhh!!"
"A‐are you OK, Jessica?!!
 Whah, A‐Aniki?!?!"
George was no longer shaped like a person.
 ...He looked like the pile of leftover meat after the good, delicious meat has been scraped off to be cooked.
...The only traces left of his time as a human were the shape of his lower jaw and rib cage.
And it was clear that Jessica, who was covered with a steadily strengthening redness, was approaching the same fate.
"............Uu.
 ...Battler.
 ......Quick, believe in {f:5:Beatrice}...
 .........If you don\'t,
 .........everyone\'s magic...
......will wear off..."
"Ma‐Maria, it\'s all over your body, too......!!!"
"I resurrect all the dead with my magic.
 ......But as long as you don\'t believe, that magic will hold no true power.
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*!
 But I\'m sure that a man of your caliber won\'t be broken by something like this, right...?"
"Ba‐
...Battler......!
 We...
...didn\'t want to doubt our friends...
 We refused to face reality,
 ...and gave in to the witch......!
 But...
I know you...
 ......I know you won\'t...
...give in to that witch......!
 Geh...
ggghh...
......gggggghhkkkkkkk!!!"
"Jessica, JESSICAAAAA, waaaaAAAAAAAaaaAAAahh!!"
How sad—Jessica met the same end.
{n}...Just like George, she ended up like a butcher\'s leftovers.
Broken apart, melted, and all mixed up, so you couldn\'t tell which was George and which was Jessica anymore.
"...............Battler.
 Don\'t cry.
 ...{f:5:Beatrice} will resurrect the dead over and over.
 So there\'s nothing to be sad about...
 ......So,
 ............even if we die, we\'re still...
......just......
fine—"
The redness began eating into the whole of Maria\'s body...
 When he saw this, the foolish Battler screamed out loud.
"You bitch, you won\'t get away with this, I\'ll never forgive you!!
 You call yourself a witch?! You call this magic?!
 I\'ll deny you with every last fiber of my being...!!
 I don\'t care what happens, there\'s not a chance in hell I\'m ever gonna accept you!!
 If you want me as an enemy that bad, I\'m gonna make sure you get what\'s coming to you!!"
"I\'ll get you for this, you\'re gonna pay for this, you\'re going to fucking pay!!!!
 You\'re gonna regret making Ushiromiya Battler your enemy!!
 I\'ll deny you no matter what!!
 Every last impossible thing, I\'ll explain it all with "humans"!!!
 I\'ll erase every cell of you from this world!!!"
"You! You speak well, "Battler"...!
 That\'s the kind of thing that can divert me from my thousand years of boredom!"
"Come, explain.
 Try explaining it all with your so‐called "human tricks"!
 And learn how lowly humans are!!
 Let\'s see you try to use what humanity has built up in a hundred years to oppose my thousand!!
 It will make forcing you to submit all the more enjoyable...!!"
"So tell me, "Battler"!
 What about Maria\'s letter?
 How the six were killed?
 The shutter?
 The receipt seal?
 The locked room with the chain?
 Kanon in the boiler room?
 Genji and the others in the parlor?!
 Natsuhi\'s suicide?!
 The riddle of the epitaph?!
 The location of the hidden gold?!"
"Come, Battler, why don\'t you show me the power of "humans"?!
 Fuhahahahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!!"
"OoooooOOOOOOooooooooooOOOOOOOOohh!!!""...What sort of tea should I prepare next?
 You have free choice of any brand that ever was throughout the ages."
"......Dried plum tea.
 ......Those dried plums that go for 200 yen a pack."
"*cackle*cackle*...!
 ...For a thousand years I have been fond of black tea, but I did not know of such a thing.
 ...I will never tire of living in this world."
"...............Beato.
 You don\'t have to display such hostility.
 ...I am just a wandering witch.
 I didn\'t come with the intention of violating the rules of your territory."
"...*cackle*cackle*, there is not even a sliver of hostility.
 ...I am just terribly concerned about seeing that the legendary witch, Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}, is well attended to."
".........You misunderstand.
 I am powerless.
 Before a witch such as you, with the dreadful power to kill a person a hundred times over, I am completely powerless."
"That a "powerless" witch like you possesses a power that none can approach is what is truly terrifying.
 After all, you fended off that Great Witch, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}, as a lone piece."
"......I only won an endurance contest.
 She simply got tired."
"That is not what Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} said, though.
 ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*, too much humility can be unseemly, Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}."
"......That girl has a dreadful power.
 ............The power to kill a person "without fail".
 However, there is no such thing as "without fail" in this world.
 Just as, no matter how many times you divide 1, you can never make it 0."
"That girl has the power to bring that closer and closer to "virtually zero", and give rise to a "virtually absolute certainty".
 ......I hope I never have to fight such a terrifying witch again."
"However, you have a power that manifests without fail "except for zero".
 ......Although you say there is no such thing as "without fail" in this world, you possess an infallible power yourself.
 ......How very terrifying, *cackle*cackle*cackle*...!"
"......The power to kill a person "endlessly"...
 ...I think you\'re the more terrifying one."
"Such jests.
 ......From your point of view, mine is but a trifling power.
 The phrase "flattery will get you nowhere" was made for this situation."
"......Call it payment for my stay here.
 ...I am a fleeing traveler who crosses the {ruby:kakera:fragments}, continually running from boredom.
 ......I simply came around because I\'d heard that you\'d started something interesting.
 Rest assured, I will leave of my own accord as soon as you start to bore me."
"*cackle*cackle*...!
 I am deeply and humbly delighted to have the great Lady {f:5:Bernkastel} as an observer.
 *cackle*cackle*!
 And so, your impression?"
"............{f:5:Lambdadelta} is terrifying because of her cruelty; however, she was a girl I could understand.
 ...You do seem to possess affection, but I can\'t understand you at all.
 That\'s why you\'re much more terrifying than her."
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!
 I am fickle by nature.
 Do forgive me.
 ...Besides, I believe you also enjoy trusting your fate to the roll of fickle dice—is that not so, Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}?"
"......When I roll the dice, I have a roll I clearly want to get.
 Unlike you.
 You, on the other hand, anticipate all outcomes."
"And, whatever the roll might be, you\'re never disappointed.
 Whatever roll the dice show you, you are satisfied "without fail".
 .........In that sense, you far surpass me."
".........You\'re one I really don\'t want to fight with.
 Inside of you, there\'s nothing but zero.
 That\'s why I can\'t win against you with my power.
 ...The worst matchup.
 ......Perhaps {f:5:Lambdadelta}, on the other hand, has a good matchup against you.
 Since she would likely be able to kill your "endlessness"."
"*cackle*cackle*, *cackle*cackle*cackle*!
 ......Truly, tea is best drunk in the company of a witch.
 It\'s never boring.
 *cackle*cackle*!"
"......Good to hear.
 Boredom is the sole poison that can kill me.
 ......So, don\'t kill me, alright?
 Lady {f:5:Beatrice}, Endless Witch."
"If such is your wish, I shall show you an even better time."
"......In that case, wouldn\'t it be best if I brought the next chessboard in right away?
 It seems that the next tale would do more for you than a refill of tea."
"................................."
"Just wait for a moment.
 ......*cackle*cackle*!"
............Something troublesome seems to have taken a liking to you.
I\'d really like to lend you my power, but as you just heard, that girl\'s power and mine have a very bad matchup.
 Unfortunately for you.
But you really are pitiful, so I\'ll help you out just a bit.
First of all, about that girl.
She does have an existence that goes by the name of {f:5:Beatrice}, but that doesn\'t necessarily mean that she is "a woman with an individual body".
Do you understand what I mean?
 In other words, she\'s not some {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.
 Her existence is a personification of the rules of this world.
To beat her, you have to expose the rules of this world and unravel them.
This can be likened to learning the rules of chess by watching a few games.
First, take a good look over the chessboard.
And notice the movements and roles of the pieces.
Then, look for the conditions required to win at her game.
When you\'ve managed to reveal all of these things, her heart will be exposed.
After that, you can rip it apart or crush it as you please.
......I am being quite generous.
 Back when I was once human, it took me a hundred years to realize even this much.
This is my meager farewell gift to you, the pitiful one captured by Beato. It is like a single spoon.
A spoon can be used for more than just drinking soup.
You can use it to dig through the prison you\'re locked in, or as a weapon to gouge the witch\'s eyes out.
......Of course, you can also use the spoon to continually sip the watery soup inside your eternal prison.
......Don\'t get the wrong idea—I have no intention of becoming your ally.
I do feel empathy for you, but I won\'t help you.
...It\'s like how someone sitting in front of a television cannot reach the characters on screen no matter how much they yell at them.
{a:c:
THAT\'S HOW YOU CAN TELL I AM A WITCH, YOU SEE?}
I intend to enjoy the endless tales that Beato is going to weave until I tire of them.
 But I\'m sure that alone won\'t hold my interest.
......That\'s why I\'ll lend you my power.
 It\'s all so that I don\'t get tired of this.
I am the cruelest witch in the world.
No matter who the opponent may be, I\'ll absolutely make them surrender.
...Even if that\'s {f:5:Beatrice}, the Endless Witch...
You are my game piece.
 Give it your best shot.
I\'ll give you advice sometimes, out of her sight.
Don\'t bore me, okay......?
*giggle*giggle*giggle*......
