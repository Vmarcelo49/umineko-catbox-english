The vase was very, very beautiful, rich with history and value.
Even as young as I was, it still forced me to take a deep breath when I witnessed its beauty.
Of course, it was one of Grandfather\'s favorite collection pieces.
So that I didn\'t accidentally destroy its fragile beauty,
 I was always strictly ordered never to touch it.
......But that just made me want to touch it.
You could almost see right through it, and yet it was so elegant; it appeared so weightless, and yet it had an indescribable presence.
...I wanted to see what it felt like to touch a vase like that.
However, ...just as Grandfather had said, it was something that must not be touched.
This much beauty arises precisely because it must never be touched.
It was a beauty that could only dwell in something so fragile it would break at a touch.
Which is exactly why, if it were to be touched by my impudent finger, it would oh so easily—
Just like an enjoyable morning dream fading into nothing as you wake...
......it vanished, fell, and broke into smithereens.
I realized that, because of my own foolish curiosity, I had done something that couldn\'t be taken back.
No matter how much I regretted it, no matter how much I apologized.
{n}The broken vase would not return to its original form...
I would probably be scolded by Grandfather.
{n}Probably very harshly.
Frightened, I ended up breaking into tears and sobbing...
As I did, I noticed something............beautiful.
 Lightly dancing golden butterflies...
were coming towards me.
The beautiful butterflies began to gather, one at a time, glittering fantastically with glowing golden powder.
Oh, it\'s {f:5:Beatrice}.
{n}That reliable Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice} had arrived.
The butterflies gathered one after another, grouped together, and there, became her form...
She was always on my side.
{n}Whenever I was in trouble, she would always appear and help me.
"Good day to you, princess."
"{f:5:Beatrice}!
 ......uuuughu, hic, hic...!"
"Oh, my...
 Why are you crying so on a day so perfect for a tea party, my princess...?"
"...I broke Grandfather\'s precious vase...
 Uugh... Grandfather will get mad at me.
 ...I don\'t know what I should do...
 hic..."
"That is indeed worrying.
 I believe the Master greatly treasured this particular vase.
 ......Hohohoho, it\'s terrifying even for me to think about what kind of punishment you\'ll receive."
Grandfather was a very frightening person.
And once he told you something, if you failed to follow it, he would become mad with a rage that would make even the fallen angels in hell quiver.
I was intimately familiar with that, which is why I couldn\'t do anything but shake like this and cry...
"I hold no magic to scoop up your fallen tears, princess,
 but if you want magic that will make it possible for you to avoid being scolded by the Master, I might be able to do something."
"R‐really...?"
"If you will believe in my power, princess.
 The basis of magic power is the power of belief.
 ......Miracles will only appear before those who strongly believe."
"I, ...I believe...
 I believe in your magic, {f:5:Beatrice}.
 So please fix this vase.
 Please...!"
"If that is what you want, princess.
 ......Very well, then leave it to me."
When she extended her index finger, a golden butterfly softly landed there, and changed its form into her favorite magic wand.
Even that was enough to give me a small glimpse at {f:5:Beatrice}\'s wonderful and great magic power.
She pointed her wand at the broken vase, and, just like a child\'s lullaby, she began speaking the magic words...
"Come, try closing your eyes.
 And try to remember.
 What form did you have?
 It was surely a very, very beautiful form.
 Please, show me that form one more time..."
Were they words, or was it a song?
No, it was surely magic.
After all, can\'t you see? ...The pieces of the vase are gathering together in no time at all,
 ...and softly returning to the place where they had been displayed, ......returning to their original beautiful form.
"......Incredible..."
"See?
 Now it\'s back to normal.
 This way, you will be able to avoid being yelled at by the Master."
"{f:5:Beatrice}, you sure are incredible.
 It was no trouble for you to repair a broken vase."
"That\'s not true.
 Returning something broken to its original form is a very, very difficult thing.
 With my magic, I could do no more than make it remember what it was, for the time being."
"......?
 But, the vase really turned back to the way it was, right...?"
"That\'s right.
 But that doesn\'t mean that I caused the vase to avoid its fate of being broken.
 I did nothing but make the broken vase remember how it was before it broke for the time being.
 Magic power that can repair a broken fate to its original form is at a very high level that even I have yet to reach."
At that time, the high‐pitched scream of a servant could be heard from inside the mansion.
When I went to see what had happened,
 ......I noticed that several of the servants had gathered, and were cleaning up the remains of the broken vase.
From what they said, it seemed that a black cat had sneaked in from somewhere, climbed up on the vase, and toppled it over.
I understood the meaning of what {f:5:Beatrice} had said.
...At the time that I broke the vase, "the vase had been broken".
{f:5:Beatrice} had shown me that the vase had been restored, but that had been a temporary thing.
 It didn\'t mean the fate that "the vase had been broken" had changed.
As a result, ......the vase had remembered its true fate, and "broke".
{n}But I hadn\'t broken it; instead, it had been a cat which had snuck in...
That\'s right.
 {f:5:Beatrice} hadn\'t said "Let\'s mend the vase".
She had said she would make it so that I didn\'t have to be punished.
The fate of the vase breaking hadn\'t changed, but the fact that I had broken it certainly had...
{f:5:Beatrice} had skillfully saved me from danger with that magic...
"It is very easy to break something.
 Just like how you, princess, did not require magic in order to break the vase."
"...Fixing something is very hard...?"
"Yes.
 So much so that you were at a loss at what to do and started crying."
"......So it\'s easier to use magic to do horrible things?
 To break,
 ......to kill is very easy,
 ......but fixing and reviving things is very hard, as you say..."
"......That\'s right.
 With magic, it is much easier to do things like breaking and killing.
 Therefore, weak witches who lose to temptation become intoxicated with that power which they can easily obtain, and neglect their real magic training."
"......Real magic is the power to repair, to revive.
 To call back happiness which has disappeared, to call back love which has gotten cold.
 And it can call back a forgotten smile to a princess\'s face."
"Then, ......{f:5:Beatrice}, does that mean that since you could fix the vase, you are an incredible witch?"
"My days of training are far from over.
 After all, I couldn\'t make the vase forget its fate for even an hour.
 If it had been my master, who taught me magic,
 I\'m sure that she would have been able to restore the vase to its original form forever."
"If it broke and broke, she could fix it over and over again...?"
"Yes.
 When one reaches that level, they are possessed of endless magical power.
 That is the endless level that all witches should strive to reach.
 As a sign of the highest respect to those witches, we call them..."
"An Endless Witch..."
"That\'s right.
 ......To witches holding the power to mend something endlessly, the concept of breaking doesn\'t even exist.
 They are released from all of the sadness caused by losing things and are promised eternal bliss."
Certainly, the human world is full of sadness caused by separation and loss.
To escape that sadness, people pray to God, and ask for the power to withstand the sadness, believing it to be a test...
In other words, a human\'s life is a journey, searching for a way to withstand sadness.
In that case, a witch who could revive all things would be freed from all sadness in the world.
 ......In other words, it is eternal bliss...
"I wonder......if I could become a witch like you, and gain eternal happiness."
"You, princess...?
 Hoh‐hoh‐ho... That would be a long, long, difficult path, you know?"
"I want to be a witch.
 ......I want to be happy.
 I want to be your disciple."
"...............
 Do you have even the slightest doubt in that feeling?"
"No.
 I want to become a witch too."
"......All right.
 Then, until you get tired of it, princess, I will allow you to be my disciple.
 ...Will you call me Master?"
"Yes, Master."
"That\'s a good answer.
 Then from now on, learn the depths of magic along with me.
 I am also in training.
 Let us both learn magic the right way, and do our best to reach that blissful level."
"Yes, Master...!"
"........................
 ...Ah, a dream.
 ......That face brings me back..."
Endless Witch, was it?
A name that I had yearned for in the past as the highest achievement...now just another one of my titles.
No, you can even call it a name.
"...Every once in a while, it\'s nice to feel some satisfaction from that name.
 Isn\'t it something that I gained as the result of many days of training?"
"...It\'s a little bit of a waste if I don\'t feel some gratitude for it every once in a while.
 ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*."
I shook my head lightly.
If it is called the highest level, that means that there is nothing higher.
{n}An eternal dead end, the beginning of eternal boredom.
"Master said it once.
 That when one is released from all sadness, it is the same as eternal bliss.
 ......Which is why I think...
Master {i:couldn\'t reach that level}."
Eternal bliss means eternal boredom.
{n}...That\'s the beginning of eternal torture.
But perhaps all things depend on your point of view.
Eternal boredom is the same as a sketchbook that doesn\'t run out of pages.
 It means you can draw whatever you want, can put in as much effort to enjoy it as you want.
Boredom is the worst poison that kills all witches.
......To the Great Witches who hold the title "Lady", this is frighteningly true.
{n}It is the eternal poison that tortures them because of the eternal bliss that they have reached...
"Now that I have earned the name of Endless Witch, I truly wish to speak with my master again.
 ......Was the result of our training really "happiness"?
 And I want to talk with her about what true "happiness" is."
― Training has no end.
 When you think you have reached the eternal level, that is the time to regret your immaturity.
......As if in answer to my own words, a memory of her saying something like that entered my mind.
"*cackle*cackle*, hahhahahahahahahahaha...
 I see, ......I am immature, am I?!
 How nice, how nice.
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!"
Some painfully shrill laughter could be heard.
It was from my furniture.
 ...Did they break their toy again?
"{f:5:Beatrice}‐samaaa.
 This guy\'s stopped moving agaaain."
"Even though I haven\'t played enough at all.
 What a pathetic man."
"I hadn\'t even played at alllll!
 Let me play, let me playyyy!"
"Be silent, you filth!
 No matter how well {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama fixes him, he just breaks right away, because you all devour him like starving dogs."
"You broke him the most, Satan‐nee.
 \'Cause you don\'t know restraint."
"My apologies, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.
 Please forgive my cretinous younger sisters."
"Fix him quicklyyy!
 I\'m next, I\'m neeext!"
"Can you not be silent, shut up!!"
"""""""Eeek!!"""""""
Just from that single yell, the noisy Sisters of the Seven Stakes disappeared and hid.
They just mess around, having as much fun as they want breaking him.
{n}They only come to me to clean up afterwards.
{n}...Good grief, my furniture doesn\'t let me get bored.
What remained after the pieces of furniture hid themselves...was just the sloppy mess that was all that remained of the broken toy.
It had no form anymore.
"...Even I find it hard to recall his original form when he looks like this.
 It\'s better to make him remember for himself.
 ......Oh, well."
I waved my golden pipe.
And I told.
 I chanted.
 I made it remember.
"......Come, try to remember.
 What form did you have?
 ...After all, right now, you look like nothing but a huge lump of scrap meat to me."
"I\'ve no idea which parts are the arms and which parts are the legs.
 If you don\'t remember for me, I won\'t even be able to recall your face.
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*!"
By the power of the magic, the pitiful pieces of meat began to remember what their form had been.
Who was connected to who.
 Where was joined up with where.
That\'s right, just like that.
...No, no, you should be a finger on the left hand.
 And you, the right hand.
 That\'s it, good, good, *cackle*.
"...Good morning.
 Feeling awake, Ushiromiya Battler?
 How truly ironic that being awake is even more like a nightmare."
".........*cough*, ...*cough*...
 .........eck, ...owowow......"
"If you would just accept that I am a witch, you\'ll quickly awaken from this nightmare, and I\'ll send you to heaven.
 I am the king of Mount Purgatory.
 There\'s no way out of this hell without my approval."
"Heh, ...heheheheh.
 You call this hell? That\'s no good.
 Yeah, that\'s no goddamn good at all."
"The pain of death, which humans only have to taste once,
 has been given to you more times than I could count with all of my fingers, and yet, ...how can you keep talking like that?
 *cackle*!
 That is why I never tire.
 I never tire of you."
"Yeah, I\'m not tiring either.
 I mean, I get to pick and choose from those busty babes with dazzling asses in my harem.
 Thanks to that, I\'m not getting tired at all."
"*cackle*cackle*, *cackle*cackle*cackle*!
 I am glad to hear it.
 Otherwise I too would be bored.
 So, my furniture.
 I\'ve fixed him, so you can play as much as you want."
"Thank you very much!
 Kyaha, dibs!"
"Didn\'t I say you\'re done, you\'re done, I\'m next!
 Back off, waaah!"
"Huhuhuhuhu.
 Wonderful, isn\'t it, Battler‐kuuun?
 You\'re so popular, aren\'t you?"
"It\'s hard being a popular guy.
 Get in line, you beasts."
"If you stopped acting all tough and started being honest with yourself, this would be much easier on you."
"It\'s alright like this.
 His screams feel so much better this way."
"Alright, let\'s not break him easily this time.
 Well?! Do you hear me?!"
"You aren\'t in control!"
"So, Battler‐kun.
 Let\'s continue where we left off, alright?
 After locking Jessica‐chan\'s room with the master key, how did they return the key to the pocket of the corpse which was inside the room?"
"......For example...
 ...That\'s it, they used a fishing line or something, and just the key went back into the room through the crack of the door..."
"Kyahhahahahahahaha!!
 Wronnng!"
"So naive.
 {p:1:Of all of the doors that exist on Rokkenjima, none has a crack through which a key can slip}."
"He got it wrong? He got it wrong?!
 Right, this time me, my turn!
 Wherrre should I strike!"
"Me, back of the hand!"
"Gh...!!"
"That\'s meeeean!
 Then, the back of the other hand!"
"Gwoaaahhh...!!"
"I\'ll take the tip of the nose!"
"Ga...gagah......!!"
"Why, why, let me do it too, let me strike too!
 Waaah!!"
"You\'re just slow, Levia‐nee, "you snooze you lose" has always been how we\'ve done things!
 Then, I\'ll take the top of his foot!"
"Ugwaahh......!!"
"Waaah!!
 Me too, me toooo!
 Fine, I don\'t care, I\'ll take his shoulder!"
"Ga...hahh......!!"
"Keh...
 You\'re sisters, right? Be nice to each other. ...
...Gwaaa, ......oh, .........hh..."
"......How can you withstand that?
 Why haven\'t you realized that your false courage actually makes us more excited?"
"Too bad.
 False courage and being stubborn are my specialty.
 No matter how you all try to speak in riddles, I definitely won\'t accept witches and magic...!"
"Even though you can\'t explain anything with human tricks?
 Are you a moron?!
 Know your place!"
"It\'s alright, we don\'t have to force him to accept it.
 Any moment now he\'ll break down crying with the desire to accept it.
 Even now, he really wants to kneel down on the ground pitifully and beg our forgiveness!"
"Ugaah, guahgehgehgyahh...!!"
"Aahhhh, he\'s broken already!
 {f:5:Beatrice}‐samaaa!"
"......Dear me.
 Since they know that I can revive him over and over, my pieces of furniture don\'t even hesitate to break him.
 How troublesome."
Endless rebirths give me free reign over endless deaths, too.
 Before the Endless Witch {f:5:Beatrice}, all death and life has no meaning.
Even death can\'t serve as the key to escape from my cage.
"So, Battler.
 Remember your original form once more.
 I\'ll toy with you over and over again!"
"I see, I see, it truly is pleasant to have a toy to play with for all eternity.
 ......I see, could this be the endless bliss witches gain at the endless level?"
"I see, I see.
 This certainly is a pleasant bliss.
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!
 Wahhahahahahahahahahahaha!!
 I\'ll revive you over and over, kill you over and over!"
"Now then, what kind of murder spree shall I unleash on the next game board?
 Come, bring the new game board. Why don\'t we begin the next game, Ushiromiya Battler!!""Sheesh.
 Aneki\'s hatred of cigarettes is a real pain in the neck."
"Sorry.
 She\'s been grumpy since last night.
 Think you could let it slide?"
Rudolf and Hideyoshi went out onto the deck, and took out some cigarettes.
Eva had always hated the smell of cigarettes, but when she was in a bad mood, she got even more oversensitive.
The two of them had attempted to spend some relaxed time smoking until they made it to the island, but they had gotten yelled at and chased out onto the deck.
Hideyoshi tried to use his lighter, but it didn\'t go well with all of the strong winds on the deck.
{n}Rudolf took out a Zippo with a stylish gesture, and let Hideyoshi borrow the flame.
"When did you start smoking, Hideyoshi nii‐san?"
"Just after the war.
 In the beginnin\', I was rollin\' \'em.
 Then I started usin\' what I was sellin\'.
 Wahahahahahahaha."
"So you were already smoking when you met Aneki.
 I\'ll bet she\'s always telling you to stop."
"I never listened to her, so she\'s already completely given up on that.
 Wahaha, looks like men\'ve gotta be stubborn."
Hideyoshi laughed heartily, but Rudolf chuckled.
After being scolded by Eva and told to smoke outside, they had dejectedly fled to the deck together.
 There was almost no doubt he was under her thumb.
"...She isn\'t usually so short‐tempered.
 ......Nah, she\'s usually a more gentle, quiet woman.
 Every year, she changes when this day comes."
"Is that so?
 To me, she looks just like the Aneki we\'ve all known for so long."
"......That\'s right.
 She goes back to bein\' Eva of the Ushiromiya family.
 ...But, that\'s different from the Eva who\'s with me."
"..................
 Well, I can understand why she\'s grumpy.
 ...This family conference is going to be a pain."
"......Sure is.
 ...That plan to threaten money out of Krauss nii‐san.
 It\'s a family conference only in name, really it\'s just a fight between siblings."
With the family conference ahead of them, the three siblings excluding Krauss had made a secret contract.
Each of them had a pressing situation to deal with, and urgently needed a lot of money.
And the only one who could help them was Krauss, who spoke for the Ushiromiya head, since Kinzo was shut up in his study.
They had long felt that Krauss had started taking advantage of Kinzo\'s loss of interest in his own wealth,
 and was embezzling that wealth for his own use.
When everything had been going well for the siblings, even though they had found it detestable, they had pretended not to notice,
 ...but now that they needed money, they couldn\'t just quietly accept that.
Eva had called Rudolf and Rosa into an alliance, and they were planning to exploit that knowledge in order to draw money out of Krauss...
".........Rudolf‐kun, both you and I are company presidents.
 We are responsible for the livelihood of our employees."
"Rosa is a president too.
 Well, as a hobby."
"That\'s right, sorry.
 ......In short, all of us are bearin\' some burden."
"...Now that I\'ve thrown the gauntlet down in front of the executive board, I gotta bring in the money, even if it means I have to grovel or even drink mud."
"Same here.
 ...I can\'t betray my employees who\'ve trusted me and followed me for so long.
 ......That\'s why I gotta get some money out of Krauss nii‐san, even if I have to grab him by the neck."
"Aneki has always been at odds with Aniki.
 ...And now she has to have a full‐on confrontation with him.
 That\'s probably enough to make her grumpy."
"So, Eva has always been on bad terms with Krauss nii‐san, then...?"
"She doesn\'t talk to you about it?
 Definitely, yeah, in a really big way."
"She won\'t tell me about the past even if I ask.
 ......She probably doesn\'t want to remember."
"...Aneki has always been smart and shrewd.
 Her grades were good too.
 Compared to that, Aniki was just average.
 ...Her just being there beside him should have been enough pressure, but Aneki kept boasting about it and driving Aniki into a corner."
"......Silly girl...
 Why be openly hostile like that and drive him into a corner?
 That\'s not bein\' shrewd."
"Hahaha, seriously."
".........Aneki regretted being born a woman.
 ...She probably couldn\'t forgive Aniki for getting to succeed the head just because he was a man.
 ...So she\'d always take every opportunity to boast to Dad that she was superior."
"Father really is an old‐fashioned person.
 His values discriminate between men and women.
 ...You think that Father disliked Eva a bit, since she likes to make herself conspicuous...?"
"..........................."
"Don\'t you think that schooling for women is like sugar in black tea?
 Without it, it is bland, but too much of it ruins the tea."
...Since you can still drink black tea without sugar,
 it was exactly the same as saying that study was unnecessary for a woman.
Those infuriating words were ones that my older brother had abused me with when I had been in despair, wanting to go to college but denied by Father.
I had protested that advancing to college was essential if I was to acquire the education and class befitting the eldest daughter of the Ushiromiya family.
But the replies I received from Father and my brother were, in summary, exactly the same.
"How conceited for a woman."
Since the time I was born into the Ushiromiya family, I hadn\'t taken that name lightly even once.
 And furthermore, nor had I ever taken lightly Father\'s name, Ushiromiya Kinzo.
It was an old family with a long history, but it had lost all its wealth and its business in the Great Kanto Earthquake, and almost sank for a time.
 Then Father, with his ingenious talent, had taken control, and revived it to be even greater than it had been before.
I hadn\'t forgotten even once what it meant to be the daughter of that great Ushiromiya Kinzo.
Therefore, I had always made every effort to become worthy of that name.
Class worthy of the Ushiromiya family.
 Schooling.
 Manners.
 And leadership.
Even if I was far from reaching Father\'s level, I deepened my knowledge in economics and finance, and tried to improve myself so that I could help out with that at any time.
......However, in the end, there never came a time when Father acknowledged that.
To Father, a woman was only meant to support a man, and nothing further than that was permissible.
I wonder when it was that I understood that.
{n}......I probably understood ever since I was a young girl.
...But to truly accept it, I had to wait until I had grown up.
Compared to my own effort, you couldn\'t have said that Krauss, as my older brother by two years,
 tried at all to become deserving of the Ushiromiya family name.
Ever since we were young, my brother kept saying that it was natural that he\'d succeed Father, just because he was born a man.
...He kept repeating that, as though it were an absolute gap between us.
I couldn\'t stand it.
 Even though I always got better grades than my brother,
 even though I became class president while he was stuck as vice‐president of his class,
 ...even so, my brother was considered to be the appropriate person to succeed the Ushiromiya family, just because he was a man.
Of course, you could get away with gender discrimination in those days.
{n}No, it was even considered a virtue in those days.
It was a time when women were looked down upon, and it was said that when a woman is born, she is to obey her parents; when she gets married, she is to obey her husband; and when she gets old, she is to obey her children.
But because that way of thinking existed, I wanted to overturn it.
{n}......Innocently, I kept trying to prove that I was the most fit.
......However, eventually, I realized that all of my efforts were doomed from the beginning.
"Don\'t you think that schooling for women is like sugar in black tea?
 Without it, it is bland, but too much of it ruins the tea."
"...What do you mean by that, Nii‐san?"
"In the same way that there are things that only men can do, there are also things that only women can do, are there not?
 I think things like giving birth to children, raising them, and supporting their husband can only be done by women."
"Are you trying to say that there\'s no need for a woman to do things like work and study?"
"I wouldn\'t go that far.
 Unschooled women are tiring just to talk to.
 ...However, women who are too smart are even more tiring.
 I think that a woman like you, who vehemently asserts herself, would cause her future husband a lot of trouble."
"Are you trying to say that a woman must marry and stay in the shadow of their husband?
 That\'s none of your business!"
"I admire you as my little sister for feeling that you should respect Father and become a proper daughter for him.
 Even I can respect that."
"Disgusting.
 What is this {ruby:neutral/polite "I":"watashi"}?
 You\'ve always used {ruby:rough/casual "I":"ore"}.
 Are you already pretending to be the head?"
"It was decided that {i:{ruby:watashi:I}} would succeed the head from the beginning.
 And yet you seem to be laboring under the illusion that you can become the head, and have just been making useless and reckless attempts to do that."
"Reckless attempts, you say...?!
 Is my saying that I want to go to college really that odd?!"
"Yes, it\'s odd.
 Indeed, you are the eldest daughter of the glorious Ushiromiya family.
 Eventually, you will bear the responsibility of that family crest, and be wed to the partner who is most valuable for Father."
"...However, what will be demanded of you then is not an excess of knowledge.
 It is gentle feelings to care for your husband and ability in housework, and it is a humble demeanor that will support the master of your household.
 You are completely lacking in all of those things.
 In the end, is that really proper for a daughter of the Ushiromiya family?"
"I have no intention of being a secluded daughter!
 I just want to become the best person who can help Father with his work!"
"In which case, should you not be aiming to become worthy as a daughter of the Ushiromiya family...?
 What is it with you?
 Even at this age, you still act like a man, you are careless with housework and cooking, and you never wear any makeup to please men.
 Recently I\'ve heard that you\'ve even been training to learn how to brawl."
"Th‐that\'s rude!!
 It isn\'t brawling, the martial arts are the perfect training for the mind.
 And at the proper time, I can act like a woman well enough!!
 What are you trying to say?
 That women should be slaves who work for men, that women must not step out in front, is that what you\'re trying to say?!"
"It isn\'t elegant to admit that,
 but in order to correct your mistake, I think that a few unpleasant words are necessary.
 So let me say it plainly.
 Women exist to serve men.
 And men exist to cultivate women.
 A woman\'s job is to protect a man\'s back, to protect their house and raise their children."
"Normally, they don\'t have to be told that to realize it.
 They realize it by themselves.
 ...But no matter how old you get, you haven\'t realized that about yourself.
 So as your brother, I will clear away that misunderstanding for you before you exit this house into society.
 You should thank me."
"Th‐that is an insult to all women...!!
 No, ...wait, ...I, I have never thought of myself as a woman, I\'ve never depended on anyone because I\'m a woman!!"
"How am I inferior to you, Nii‐san?!
 In grades, in accomplishments, I\'m better than you in everything, so how can you look down on me when you don\'t have anything I don\'t, except being a man?!!"
"It\'s about whether or not you know your place.
 Every day, I have been raised so that I would be prepared to be the next head.
 In the future, that will definitely be essential.
 But you are different.
 Even though you will marry and lose the Ushiromiya family name, you keep seeing this illusion that you don\'t need to see."
"......What are you so unsatisfied about?
 Even if you were born as a man, it still wouldn\'t be you who would succeed the head.
 What\'s so unsatisfying that you keep attacking me?"
"What\'s so unsatisfying, you say?!?!
 Nii‐san, you are always, always,
 ......always always always...!
 You claim yourself as the successor, look down on me,
 ......and despite that...
......urrrrrrrgggggggggg!!"
What\'s so unsatisfying, he says...?
A billion grudges, hard feelings, humiliations that I\'ll never forget crossed through the back of my mind.
And all of them built up at the same time, coming out of my throat as nothing more than a shameful moan.
"......What is all this noise.
 God isn\'t the only one who values silence."
"Father."
"Father!"
Our sibling fight was probably overheard.
{n}Father entered with a clearly displeased face.
"Krauss.
 Are you fighting with your siblings again?
 Why do you not have the dignity to lead your siblings?
 How shameful!
 You are a joke of an eldest son!"
In a flash, he struck Krauss\'s face.
...I prepared myself to be struck in the same way, but I wasn\'t hit.
"M‐......my apologies,
 Father."
"Dignity isn\'t the only thing that you lack.
 There\'s much more.
 You\'re immature in everything!
 And even so, you pretend like you\'re an adult!
 Realize that it\'s a hundred years too early for you to talk like that, and devote yourself to your studies!
 Don\'t make me lament my son\'s incompetence any more...!"
"Yes.
 ...I will continue to strive so that I can become a person worthy to succeed you, Father..."
It was as if those words were directed at me.
Even when he was being yelled at by Father, he was still bragging to me about how he was special,
 ......about how he was the successor.
I just couldn\'t stand it, and finally spoke what was on my mind.
Even though I realized that this was improper for a person of the Ushiromiya family.
"Father...!!
 Please tell me, how am I inferior?!!
 Until today I\'ve tried so hard, studied so hard to become a person who would not shame your name...!"
"Please, tell me, in what way am I inferior...?!
 How can I improve myself so that you will accept me...!!"
"Are you still talking about that?!!
 How many times do I have to tell you?
 I have no expectations for you whatsoever!
 A woman should just learn cooking and sewing, like a woman!!
 You have none of the necessary attitude of a woman!
 I can\'t sense any of the disposition needed to serve a husband, the heart to devote yourself to a man!!"
"What good are you as a woman!
 Do you realize that you are a daughter of the Ushiromiya family!!
 And yet, the only thing you want to learn is how to act like a man!
 Your duty is not to act like Krauss!!
 Do you even understand your own duty?!!"
"A‐as a person of the Ushiromiya family, I won\'t embarrass your na—"
"That\'s it, right there you\'re already wrong!!
 Your duty is to marry {i:out} of the family, and bring me a man who is profitable to me!
 And then devote yourself to your husband, be fruitful and multiply!
 Be a good wife who brings praise to your husband\'s family!!"
"What can you do that is capable of pleasing a man?
 Do you think you can make tea?
 Do you have any talent in cooking?
 You have nothing!!"
"All you have done is to try to act like Krauss!!
 Krauss will succeed the Ushiromiya family!
 If you are unsatisfied with that, then you are disobeying me!!"
"Are you saying that you won\'t even listen to what I say, even though you\'re my daughter!!!
 Get out!!
 You\'re disinherited!!
 I won\'t let you use the name Ushiromiya!!
 Disinherited disinherited!!
 Uuug, *cough*cough*!!"
"Father, stay strong.
 Please calm down.
 ......Genji‐san, could you bring some water?"
"......Yes.
 Immediately."
"Eva, leave this place.
 He doesn\'t mean what he says.
 I will calm him down."
"*cough*, *cough*cough*!!
 Disinherited, if you won\'t listen to me, you\'re disinherited!!
 *cough**cough*, uug, *hack*cough**cough*!!"
As Father struggled with a fit of heavy coughs, my brother patted his back.
...As if that were naturally his duty.
{n}It was so vexing for me then to let him monopolize that duty.
If I approached Father carelessly, I would probably be hit again.
...However, I fearlessly tried to approach Father\'s back.
Genji blocked me...
"......Eva‐sama, it would probably be better if you stepped outside for now.
 The Master is not in a good mood today."
"B‐but......"
"*cough*cough*!!"
"Why are my children so incompetent?!
 Krauss is lacking in dignity, Eva never moves on from being a stubborn tomboy!!
 I have no manly son, not even a womanly daughter!"
"Where did I go wrong raising them?!
 Why Genji, when and where and how did I go wrong?!!"
"......My lord, you have done nothing wrong.
 Krauss‐sama has grown into a sturdy son, and Eva‐sama into a lovely daughter.
 You haven\'t made any mistakes..."
"In what way!!
 In what way is {i:she} lovely?!!
 Far from a lady, she\'s always acting like a man!!
 *cough*cough*cough*!!
 Disinherited, disinheriteddd!!
 *cough*cough*!!"
"Father, I was just warning Eva about that very thing.
 Eva, too, promised that she would have a change of heart and begin acting like a lady.
 Couldn\'t you postpone that for just a little longer?"
"Lady, my foot!!
 *cough*cough*!!
 Disinherited disinherited... *cough*cough*, uugg, *hack*hack*!"
Go quickly and I\'ll handle this for you.
Krauss gave me a look telling me that...
......Did I take the wrong path, just like Father and my brother had said?
They were right that I had never studied how to be a lady.
{n}...Everything I had learned was because I\'d hoped that I could help Father someday.
.........Wait, was that really the case?
Hadn\'t I always held a growing sense of rivalry with my brother, with whom I\'d had a bad relationship since I was a young girl,
 and wasn\'t I just trying to get the better of him by stealing his position as successor to the head?
Every time, my brother told me that men should be manly and women should be womanly.
I had been tormented by this unreasonable discrimination because of my sex, something I was born with and couldn\'t do anything about.
I had resisted, had endeavored to study until today so that I could prove that I wasn\'t inferior, even though I was a woman.
...In that case, wasn\'t the basis of my love of learning just a boring inferiority complex toward my brother?
Father had expected me to be a lady with whom he could go out in public and not be embarrassed.
...Had I betrayed that expectation and earned grades to intimidate my brother just to clear away that pent‐up resentment from my childhood...?
"That\'s not it.
 You vowed to me that I would become the successor to the Ushiromiya family."
".........You........."
The one who came whispering to me.........was myself, born in my heart on the day I made that vow—myself on that day as a little girl.
...That\'s right.
 "She" was my only ally.
Whenever I was suffering, whenever I felt like I could take no more, she would always quietly appear and take my side.
Whenever I found myself with my head in my hands, stumbling over difficult problems, she would always appear and support me.
As I had grown and forgotten my time as a girl, I\'d also begun to forget my conversations with "her"...
"I, Ushiromiya Eva, will definitely become the head of the Ushiromiya family.
 And I\'ll triumph over that irritating, arrogant Krauss.
 ...On that day, we promised to do our best together to achieve that."
"......That\'s right. We promised.
 ...On that day, that I would become the successor to the head."
On that day, when I had been overcome with sadness, wondering why I was even alive,
 ...you appeared inside me, and lent me your strength.
"......I wanted Father to accept me.
 I wanted to get the better of my brother.
 I believed that, if I could do that, I could forever part ways with that wretched part of myself."
In those days, I had really believed that I had no other purpose in life than to be looked down upon by my brother.
...It\'s painful just remembering those days.
{n}The wound, the tear that split open in my heart...
"She" taught me how to sew up that wound...
I would change my anger into effort and improve myself,
 ......become a person more worthy to be head than Krauss was,
 and triumph over him by making Father accept me—the perfect revenge.
I knew more or less that a woman couldn\'t succeed the head.
But if I could become so superior that I could overturn that,
 ...then surely even Father would select me to be his successor.
If that happened, ......then I could have the greatest, ultimate, most perfect revenge against my brother,
 who always acted like it was completely natural for him to succeed the head...
"Right.
 If we do that, then the wounds in our heart will be healed.
 ......We promised each other that we would do our best until that day came."
"And yet, you\'re breaking this promise?
 Scum.
 Coward.
 Why not give up and die forever...?"
Even though she has the form of my young self, she is still another me.
 ...And she has a sharp tongue—after all, she\'s me.
"...It really makes me mad hearing that from myself.
 You have no right to speak of me like that."
"Then let\'s use that anger and learn from it.
 ......Changing anger into power is my magic.
 I\'ve saved you from several predicaments with that power, and allowed you to achieve things that should have been impossible for you.
 As long as you have my magic, there\'s nothing you can\'t do."
"......That\'s right.
 Anger has always been my driving force.
 I wonder when it was that I forgot that..."
"If you have remembered me again, that magic is ours once more.
 Come on, let\'s turn that anger into power, and endeavor in our studies even more, alright?
 I\'m sure that we still have a lot more studying that we need to do."
"Let\'s go to college, study more and more, get excellent grades, and drive Krauss into a corner."
"That guy makes a face as though we\'re nothing, but I\'m sure he feels pretty well cornered in his heart.
 If only he would just learn his place and die.
 If he did, we could become the head.
 Rudolf will be nice enough to decline.
 That kid can\'t go against us."
".........Stop that.
 ...Even if I study more, Father still won\'t accept me."
"Why...?"
"Father is telling me to be womanly...
 No matter how hard I try, as long as I\'m a woman, Father will never pass on the headship to me... even if I\'d been born before Nii‐san..."
"No matter how much effort I put in, ......I can\'t become anything more than a woman.
 I won\'t be accepted.
 I can\'t surpass Nii‐san, who doesn\'t try at all.
 I will always be looked down upon..."
"...Father and Krauss are the worst kind of male supremacists.
 I wish they\'d just fucking die already."
......She would curse in my place.
Words that I couldn\'t say carelessly, ...she would say for me.
...Even though I understood that she was just another part of myself inside of me,
 ...I felt like she was the only ally I had who would sympathize with me.
However, while sympathy might calm my heart somewhat, it wouldn\'t do anything to improve my current situation.
 ......In the end, she could only console me when I was dejected by reality, and for the amount of time I needed to accept it.
"......Thank you.
 That\'s enough, now.
 ...Now that it\'s come to this, I\'ll become such a good lady that I\'ll surprise Father...
 I\'ll find an excellent man that Nii‐san can\'t even be compared with—"
"No, that\'s no good."
"............"
"She" rejected my timid thoughts.
...I know why.
{n}......Because "she" is me, I know why.
"Father says, or at least {i:right now} he says, that he won\'t let a woman succeed the head.
 But that\'s never been anything more than a rule that Father decided on.
 Since Father decided on it, he can abolish it."
".........People\'s feelings can change many more times than there are grains of sand on a beach.
 Even if we don\'t prove that Krauss is a stupid man, Father will eventually realize it."
"...At that time, the ridiculous wall that separates man from woman will be demolished by Father, who set it up in the first place.
 That day will surely come."
"......How can you say surely?"
"Because that is my...magic."
"....................."
"If you\'ll just believe, this magic will surely create a miracle.
 ......The basis of my magic is nothing more than your believing heart."
"..........................."
If I can use that magic, ......then surely, until the day I die, I\'ll never have to doubt that someday I will become the head.
...But I don\'t know if that is the right thing for Ushiromiya Eva...
Shouldn\'t I aim to become the kind of lady that Father hoped for, someone he can take out into society and boast about?
Father might take a better view of me if I were reborn.
 ......Maybe my brother could find his own lifestyle, and I could find mine.
Besides, no matter what, I just can\'t imagine that my father, stubborn as he is, would not only allow a woman to succeed the head,
 but also skip my older brother and select me for the headship.
".........You don\'t believe?"
"U‐...um, I was...just thinking.
 .........Maybe I can\'t succeed the head, but, as a woman, I can have a child. And Nii‐san still isn\'t engaged."
"......If Nii‐san doesn\'t manage to have children, and I do, ...then wouldn\'t the next head after Nii‐san be my child?
 Wouldn\'t that basically...mean the same thing as stealing the headship from Nii‐san...?"
"............Are you serious?"
"Y‐...yes. I\'m serious.
 ......It will indeed be quite sad to throw away the determination from my years as a young girl.
 ...It will pain my heart to betray you, my younger self.
 ......But this way is the most realistic...!"
In that moment, my body changed, and I was no longer myself from back then, but as I am now: a "wife" and "mother".
Yes......this is a "dream".
 Even so, "she" still possessed the same ambition and desire as always, and she argued back, with her expression displaying clear displeasure at this change.
"Are you throwing away your dreams?
 ......And are you even throwing me away?"
"I\'m not throwing anything away.
 ......It\'s just that I\'ve become an adult, and the time has come for us to go our separate ways."
"That\'s right.
 You\'ve already become an adult.
 You\'ve even forgotten how to use magic.
 ......You are now the mother of a child.
 You\'ve forgotten the magic that can grant your own dreams, and are now pushing those dreams onto your son."
"...Even though you had your own life messed with so much by Father and Krauss, you\'re trying to push your dreams onto your son, and mess with his life too.
 ......Is that what being an adult is all about?"
"G‐George is my pride and joy, who won\'t embarrass me no matter where he goes...!
 The dream that wasn\'t granted me might be granted to George...!
 Jessica\'s grades and behavior aren\'t good at all.
 And she\'s a woman!
 If only Jessica would step down, George could become the heir...!"
My heart pained even as I said it.
Aren\'t I just forcing my own regrets onto George?
I don\'t have any right to disparage Jessica.
 And to hit her with the same words that had caused me so much suffering is just horrible...
...I understand.
 I understand...
Wanting to triumph over my brother was nothing more than my personal revenge.
{n}...I mustn\'t use George for that...
"......So I\'ll take revenge myself.
 I have a plan to cheat Nii‐san out of some of his money, with Rudolf and Rosa as my allies.
 I\'ll surely be able to get back at him.
 ...I mean, there\'s no doubt that Nii‐san is embezzling Father\'s assets..."
"...What a boring plan.
 Why don\'t you just give that up and cry yourself to sleep forever...?"
"..........................."
"We will become the head of the Ushiromiya family.
 ......Don\'t try to confuse that dream.
 So believe me that you can definitely achieve it.
 Believe in my magic."
"...If I believe, will the magic have power, I wonder."
"Yes.
 My magic can grant any wish without fail."
"..................
 ......I\'ll believe.
 ......I\'ll believe, ...so create a miracle with that magic...
 ......If you don\'t, ......the hole in my heart will never heal......"
"Yes.
 ......Then, listen well.
 To my magic words.
 ......And understand them. If we can solve the riddle, we can become the Ushiromiya family head.
 ......So lend me your ears and listen carefully..."
Behold the sweetfish river, running through my beloved home of old.
{n}You who seek the Golden Land, follow its path downstream in search of the key......
"Eva nee‐san.
 It looks like we\'re about to arrive."
As her shoulder was tapped by Kyrie, Eva jumped and awoke from her doze.
".........nh.
 .........Ah,
 ......I\'m sorry.
 I was half asleep."
"Sorry for surprising you."
"Auntie Eva, you were out cold.
 Did you get up early this morning?"
"......I suppose.
 How embarrassing, I must have looked quite disgraceful.
 I\'m sorry."
"Pretty impressed that you\'re relaxed enough to sleep, though?
 Not like Battler, he\'s been yelling the whole time about how he\'s gonna "falllll" and "drowwwwn"!
 Can\'t get bored with this dude around."
"Sh‐shut up!
 Everyone has one or two things they don\'t like...!"
Battler and Jessica went back out, squabbling merrily.
{n}Rudolf also made a face as if asking, "Are you alright?".
"Get ahold of yourself.
 When you see the faces of Dad and the rest, all that sleepiness\'ll go right out the window.
 Let\'s do our best to stay firm, alright?"
"...That\'s right.
 We have to stay firm, especially this year..."
"That\'s it.
 ...Let\'s tense up our assholes and do this thing."
Rudolf said these strict words in a small voice that only Eva could hear.
Failure would not be tolerated in this year\'s family conference.
{n}......All of their companies were hanging in the balance.
Even Rudolf\'s face looked a little tense.
{n}Eva\'s expression probably looked tense as well.
"Mother, I have our luggage.
 Let\'s go up onto the deck."
"...Thank you.
 You really are thoughtful, George."
"Why are you thanking me so suddenly?
 It\'s not like you, Mother."
"Evaaa, Geoorge.
 We\'ve arrived.
 Gather our luggage."
"Uu!
 Arrived, arrived!
 *giggle*giggle*!"
"Hey, Maria!
 You\'ll fall, so stop running!"
It seemed Maria was already getting excited.
 She ran circles around Hideyoshi, escaping from Rosa, who was trying to catch her.
"{e:070:.........belove..................key......}{e:100:"}
"What is it, Mother?
 ...Do you feel sick...?"
"George.
 Take the luggage and go on ahead.
 Your mother\'s probably anemic, so I\'ll lend her a hand."
"Really...?
 I understand, I\'ll go on ahead."
By looking at Eva\'s peculiar expression, Hideyoshi realized that it had not been a pleasant awakening, and made George go on ahead.
Rudolf\'s family and Rosa\'s family also went up onto the deck, leaving only Eva and Hideyoshi inside the boat.
Eva had a vague expression on her face, as though she still hadn\'t been able to escape from her daydream.
"..........................."
"...What\'s wrong?
 Why the meek face?"
".........I...wonder if I\'ve been using George as a tool for my own revenge...
 ...I wonder if my childish hostility towards Nii‐san has caused me to treat that boy\'s life like a toy...
 Aah, what have I done... What have I......!"
"That isn\'t true.
 George is our wonderful son, and he\'ll always perform admirably wherever he goes.
 Even if your own ends got a little mixed in, everything\'s turned out alright in the end, hasn\'t it?!"
"You haven\'t done aaaanything wrong.
 To the contrary, George is thankful for how you\'ve been strictly disciplinin\' him, right?"
"...Really?
 Hey, really?!
 I wonder, doesn\'t George think I\'m a horrible mother...?!
 Doesn\'t he, doesn\'t he doesn\'t he doesn\'t he?!"
"He\'s never said anythin\' like that, not even once.
 That\'s just your needless anxiety."
"Hideyoshi‐sama.
 Everyone has left the boat, you know.
 ......Oh, did you drop something?
 Shall I help you?"
Kumasawa had come to check on them when they hadn\'t come up to the deck.
Hideyoshi hid Eva behind his back so that her expression couldn\'t be seen.
"Yeah, sorry.
 My necktie pin just got a little crooked!
 We\'re alright, and we\'ll be out in a second.
 Wait outside for us!"
"Is that so?
 ......Hoh‐hoh‐ho.
 Then I will wait outside..."
From that almost incomprehensible excuse, Kumasawa realized that something had come up, and disappeared so that she didn\'t trouble them further.
If they stayed here any longer, they would probably make everyone else worry too.
"...It\'s about time to go.
 We\'ll make George and the rest worry."
"............Am I......really not despised by George......?"
"Yeah.
 Nothin\' of the sort.
 In fact, he\'s very grateful."
".............................."
"...Did you have a bad nightmare?
 Again?"
"..................
Yes."
Hideyoshi knew that it wasn\'t rare for Eva to be tormented by nightmares.
And they would always become more striking on the days leading up to the family conference...
Hideyoshi knew that Eva\'s relationship with Krauss was still so full of antagonism that it could even be called trauma,
 and that she still couldn\'t separate herself from how she\'d felt as a child.
"That was a dream.
 ...I\'m with you now.
 If I grasp your hand tightly like this, that dream\'ll go flyin\' away."
"Right?
 Look.
 Squeeeeze."
"......*giggle*.
 That hurts.
 ...Thank you.
 I\'m fine now...
 ...Let\'s get off the boat."
"Yeah.
 Let\'s get off the boat.
 Everyone\'s waitin\' for us."
"...Umm, ..................I\'m sorry."
"Hmm?"
"......I\'m sorry...
...that I yelled at you...
...about the smoke from your cigarettes just now......"
"C\'mon, you normally wouldn\'t apologize for that sorta thing.
 ...You go all frail after you\'ve had a bad dream.
 ...Don\'t worry about it.
 I was wrong for not realizin\' that the smoke was affectin\' you."
"............Have you...started to hate me...?"
"No way, no way.
 Wahahahahahaha.
 If I hated you after somethin\' like that, we would\'na lasted three days.
 C\'mon, stand up, stand up.
 Off we go, off we go."
"Hideyoshi‐sama, Eva‐sama.
 Is everything alright?
 Are you not feeling well?"
This time, Gohda had come.
 It looked like they had kept everyone waiting too long after all.
Eva also stood up without grumbling this time.
 ...She couldn\'t keep on forcing her bad mood onto her husband and causing him more trouble.
......Because that was not something a "good wife" would do.
"Is everything alright?
 If you are worried about your health, shall I call Doctor Nanjo?"
"Thanks.
 I\'m just a little anemic.
 I\'m alright now."
"Just her hormones.
 Don\'t worry about it.
 Wahhahahahahaha."
"For goodness\' sake...
 Don\'t say stuff like that in front of people, it\'s embarrassing."
"Ohhh, sorry, sorry."
Eva elbowed Hideyoshi in the gut.
 By that time, her normal expression had returned, which allowed Hideyoshi to relax a little.
The bright sunlight outside was almost enough to really make a person go giddy.
A small plank was lowered to get off the boat, and Gohda was waiting there, smiling and ready to lend them a hand.
"Please, Eva‐sama.
 Your hand."
"Thank you."
"Welcome to Rokkenjima."
{a:c:
Welcome back.}
"......Huh?"
When she left the boat, .........it seemed to Eva as though she had heard the voice of her young self saying welcome back.
No, it hadn\'t {i:seemed} that way.
{n}...Someone had {i:said} "welcome back" to her.
After becoming a shameless adult,
 ...the voice of her young self was distant.
"What am I living for......?
 ......What can I do...to release myself from this obsession......?"
Hideyoshi heard her talking to herself.
He drew Eva close to him by her shoulder, and just by his firmness, he communicated that there was no need to say anything more...
Maybe it was because the typhoon was getting closer.
 The lively cries of the seagulls, which usually greeted them when they arrived, couldn\'t be heard at all..."...Six years ago, you say?
 I mean, six years, that\'s like the whole of elementary school, isn\'t it?
 It\'s pretty unfair to ask me to remember, don\'t you think?"
"I agree.
 Especially since we were so young; we\'ve grown a lot in these six years.
 Actually, if we hadn\'t been introduced, maybe we wouldn\'t have been able to remember you."
"You think?
 I knew it was Battler right away.
 After he opened his mouth, I was even more sure."
"Uu.
 I met him for the first time.
 Don\'t know about six years ago."
"That\'s natural.
 You were only three, after all."
"When you say it like that, I\'m the same.
 I only knew Maria when she was three years old, and since she\'s grown so big, yeah, no wonder I didn\'t recognize her."
After lunch, we had all gone out to the beach to walk around, talk and take it easy enjoying ourselves.
Our parents appeared somehow on edge, and seemed to have things to catch up on, so we had decided to leave our seats.
...Just as you\'d expect, since it had been six years, the conversation focused on me.
"Still, you\'ve really gotten taller.
 I won\'t call myself short, but anyway, your height surprised me."
"That\'s right. I remember well what Battler‐sama was like six years ago, but I was surprised even so."
"Totally.
 I could never have imagined this from how Battler looked six years back."
"I\'m surprised at how everyone remembers so much about six years ago.
 My memory\'s all hazy."
"Not surprised.
 I mean, you seemed to take a while even remembering us.
 That hurts a bit, ya know?"
"Come on, this was six years ago, right?
 It\'s ridiculous to ask me to remember...!"
"...So, you can\'t remember things that happened six years ago very well?
 I can remember as clearly as if it was yesterday..."
"That\'s because your memory is good, Shannon.
 I bet you remember well what kind of things Battler‐kun did and said six years ago, don\'t you?"
"Come to think of it, that\'s right.
 Shannon\'s memory is surprisingly good when it comes to certain things."
"Uu.
 I\'m crappy at remembering.
 Remember fun stuff well but horrible at boring stuff.
 Uu."
We all laughed, saying that everyone was like that.
"Shannon.
 By the way, what was Battler like six years ago?
 Remember any interesting episodes?"
"Let\'s see.
 ......I\'m sure that he said something like this when he left.
 "I\'ll be back... <See you again>.
 I\'ll come for you riding a white horse.""
"Gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh,
 doooooooon\'t, so embarrassiiii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}iiing!!"
"Gyaaah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐ha!!"
"I bet he did, I bet he did!
 That\'s exactly what he was like, six years ago he was always full of those stupid lines!"
"Waaahahahahaha!!"
"Hahahaha.
 It really does sound like something Battler‐kun would have said back then."
"Uu.
 Embarrassing? Embarrassing?"
"......Yeah.
 Horribly embarrassing..."
"Maria, I\'m sure that when you are in middle school, you\'ll want to say embarrassing things like that...
 When that happens, write it on the back of some leaflet first, and read it three times before you decide to say it out loud.
 If you don\'t, you\'ll definitely regret it..."
"Still, everyone has to pass through that painful period...
 That\'s right, that\'s how you know your place, learn shame, and become an adult.
 Yes, this is a memory I want to disappear, the bittersweet kind of thing that everyone does in adolescence as they transition to becoming adults...
 Aaaaarrggh..."
You see, I tend to let my mouth run wild without thinking too much, so I don\'t remember all the details of everything I say.
But when the contents are recited back to me afterwards, it\'s always something extremely embarrassing.
In recent years, I have finally come to understand this weakness, and have been working hard to refrain from such careless outbursts, but......
...It seems I was just born with the habit of speaking without thinking, and there isn\'t a whole lot I can do about it.
"Shanno~n, do you remember any other embarrassing things?"
"Yes, well... I remember various other things, but...
......since it looks like the person in question wants to forget them, I think I will refrain from saying any more..."
"To be blunt, there\'s nothing else I remembe~r.
 Please don\'t remind meeee."
"...Uu.
 Shannon\'s bullying Battler...?
 Uu.
 Bad.
 Bullying is bad."
"Hahahahaha. She isn\'t really bullying him.
 Let\'s leave it at that, okay?"
"But Shannon, you\'ll have tell me all about it sometime Battler‐kun isn\'t around.
 It sounds pretty interesting."
"Yes, certainly."
"N‐noooo, you can\'t, Shannon‐chaaaaaaaaaan...!!"
For a while, George‐aniki teased me by pretending to ask Shannon‐chan for more of my embarrassing misspeaks.
George‐aniki was messing around teamed up with Shannon‐chan,
 ......but he seemed, how to describe it, very candid and frank.
He was always frank with his cousins, but he usually took on a reserved, gentlemanly attitude when he came in contact with the servants.
...When I thought about it, I got the feeling that he was acting a little overly familiar, which seemed slightly weird.
Maria started scribbling in the sand with a stick,
 and George‐aniki and Shannon‐chan joined in, which left me and Jessica off to the side, so I asked her secretively.
"......Hey, Jessica.
 Is George‐aniki, ......umm, going out with Shannon‐chan?"
"Ooooh?
 What the, how did you notice?!
 Battler, you\'ve got more of an eye for people than I thought."
"Huh, ...whaaaaaaah?!
 I was just kidding— They\'re actually going out?!"
"Shhh!
 Your voice is too loud!
 ...They are actually keeping it secret for now, apparently, alright?
 It\'d be better if nobody heard about it, especially Auntie Eva."
"I, I see...
 Love with a servant..."
"...Y‐yeah, but, since when?
 Wowww, a lot can happen in six years......
 But still, Aniki really is talented, and Shannon‐chan is kind and spirited...
 ......They might be a pretty good match."
Actually, six years ago, I remember taking notice of her just a little bit.
So that\'s how it is... She really fits well with George‐aniki... Nothing I can do about that.
 ...Goodbye, my fleeting first love of six years ago...
.........Which means that...my collection of embarrassing lines that Shannon‐chan just held back on...
...probably has something to do with that...
 Aaaaaaaaaaarrghh, I can\'t take it...
"How long have they been going out?"
"That depends on what you call going out, but I\'d say it\'s definitely been at least a year.
 If you count the time before either of them confessed, it\'d be several years, I guess."
Before I\'d realized it, the two of them had separated themselves from the group, and were walking down the beach, talking about something.
......They looked calm,
 and rather than a light relationship between two lovers, it looked like a more serious relationship, as though they were already engaged.
"......Six years...
 That\'s a long‐ass time."
"What did these six years mean to me?
 I\'ve just gotten taller.
 It was just a waste of time, six years I spent obstinately fighting with my dad."
"What about you, Battler?
 Have you gotten a girlfriennnd?"
"Hmm, I wonder.
 There\'s a lot of girls that I play with.
 But I don\'t have that "special one" yet.
 ......I\'m probably just a kid.
 I think it\'s more fun to be noisy with a large group of people than being alone with one person."
"Aah, that\'s so you, Battler.
 But take your relationships with your female friends seriously."
"Girls can be scary with their communities and their wrong impressions, okay?
 There could be some secret feud going on over you, and someone might be crying or being hurt without you noticing it, you know?"
"That\'s so weird.
 I think I got the same bit of advice from one of the girls in my class just last week.
 ......What\'s with that?
 Why can\'t we all have fun together?
 Do they all really want to find a special person that badly?"
"...It\'s probably because you\'ve never had a partner like that, Battler.
 Well, you\'ll probably run into a girl like that at some point.
 Just gotta wait it out!"
"What?
 It sounds almost like you\'ve already found a partner like that.
 What about you?
 Have you gotten a boyfriend?"
"Huh?!
 M‐me?!
 No, err, wahahahahaha......"
"Come on, that reaction\'s so easy to understand...
 From the looks of it, there\'s some boy who you\'re thinking about, but you haven\'t been able to confess that to him yet, something like that."
"N‐no, umm, that\'s not, umm, uh!
 C‐cram it, jackass, who cares about me...!"
"You\'re the one who brought up this subject, why do you have to go and get mad at me?
 Women are creatures who always ask questions, and yet, they almost never answer them.
 What cruel creatures, seriously."
"......W‐well, okay, umm.
 ...I did try...
...to confess once.
 Well, umm, I struck out pretty badly."
"Did they say "Sorry"?"
"No, umm, ......
...well, umm, it was really one‐sided and they were just, like, taken aback, I guess...
 It was like they didn\'t even view me that way."
"I can understand that.
 You talk just like a man.
 If you don\'t act a little more elegant, you won\'t be able to entice a man\'s heart, you know?"
"I‐i‐is it really...
 ......Is the way I speak...
...really that bad?"
"...Hmm?
 Well, uhh, how you talk isn\'t everything, but if someone like you, who usually talks badly,
 suddenly started making an effort to talk nicely, umm, that takes courage, and that might really get some guys\' hearts thumping, maybe."
"R‐really...?
 I see......
 ......Yeah..."
Jessica had suddenly started speaking meekly, and was faintly blushing.
...I see, even though her confession didn\'t go well, it looks like she still hasn\'t given up.
But yeah...I totally get that.
 After seeing how close George‐aniki and Shannon‐chan have gotten, it\'s no wonder she\'d start wanting a boyfriend.
Six years.
 ...Those six years of puberty are pretty important, and they go by so fast.
With the typhoon approaching, the clouds had grown steadily grayer, and yet, even so, I had this really refreshing feeling.
...Maybe I\'ll start thinking more seriously about the opposite sex, more than just the size of their boobs...
"By the way,
 I know George‐aniki is going out with a servant, Shannon‐chan.
 ......Not you as well, right?"
"Huh, ...eeeeeeh?!?!
 Wh‐wh‐wh‐wh‐why do you think that...?!"
"Come to think of it, that young kid Kanon‐kun, who greeted us in the rose garden.
 You covered for him quite a bit just considering he was bad at talking, didn\'t you?"
"N‐no, that\'s not...
 Wahahahaha, you\'re too suspicious...!!"
"Then tell me just this one thing.
 Right now,
 is the boy you\'re after somewhere within one kilometer?"
"W‐well, that\'s, umm, ...I, I, I dunno..."
Kanon‐kun is the only boy on this island now who could possibly become her boyfriend.
 So judging by her reaction, I\'m probably right on.
I don\'t think of the Ushiromiya family as a noble family, but...two people in love with servants...
 I\'d never have dreamed that two pairs of Romeo and Juliet would be right next to me...
Auntie Eva will probably become an obstacle to George‐aniki and Shannon‐chan\'s love.
If Auntie Eva learns that the partner of her only son, the apple of her eye, is {i:Shannon‐chan},
 she\'ll probably scream at her with cries of wretched servant, homewrecker, and so forth.
And a relationship between Jessica and Kanon‐kun would probably be just as full of difficulties.
{n}Aunt Natsuhi also seemed the type to be strict about that kind of thing.
......After all, Jessica\'s husband would probably become the head of the Ushiromiya family in the future.
 If that person had once been a servant working for the family, ......well, no doubt things would be complicated.
"Well, everyone finds their own way in love.
 Who cares, as long as you find someone you enjoy being with?"
"Being with someone doesn\'t require any permission as long as the two people accept each other.
 If you worry about your parents or your family, then you lose.
 Don\'t forget that.
 You can\'t go out with someone with half‐hearted feelings."
"...Heh...
 I can\'t believe you\'re saying something so philosophical‐sounding when you\'ve never ever been in love."
"Don\'t treat love like a matter of profit and loss.
 It\'s about <heart>.
 That\'s all I want to say.
 Well then,
 <see you again, have a nice day>."
"......Pf,
 ...wahhahhahahahahahahahahaha!!
 George nii‐san, Shanno~n, listen, listennn!
 This guy, he\'s said another one of those lines!!"
"I didn\'t say anything, I didn\'t say anything!!
 Waaah, don\'t make fun of me, don\'t make fun of me!!"
"I heard, I heard!
 <See you aga~in>, <see you aga~in>!!"
For a while, we forgot about the wind getting stronger, and played around on the beach.
......This meeting with my cousins, who had grown so much over these last six years and were thoroughly enjoying their youth, felt truly refreshing.
......It was a little late now, but I realized that I should have buried the hatchet a lot sooner, and returned to the Ushiromiya family...
"It sure is nice to spend time together as cousins every once in a while..."
"Uu!
 I like it with all the cousins together, it\'s funnn!"
"That\'s right.
 We\'re already old enough.
 It\'s not like we couldn\'t meet each other when our parents aren\'t around.
 ...It might not be a bad idea for just us cousins to meet up and play every once in a while."
"That\'s a good plan.
 Maybe we should set up something like that someday."
"I agree.
 I\'d like for us cousins at least to always be friendly with each other."
"Hey, hey, if you put the emphasis there, doesn\'t that make it sound like our normal families don\'t get along well?"
"Hahahahahaha."
George‐aniki and Jessica laughed, but it felt just a little strained.
 ...Did I say too much?
Judging by how our parents had made quiet expressions and tired faces every once in a while during the boat ride and at the airport, maybe that was something I shouldn\'t have said.
"...That\'s right.
 Just like Jessica said.
 Let\'s always be friendly with each other."
"Uu!
 Me too!
 Everyone friendly!!"
"That\'s right.
 Yeah.
 We\'ll always be together.
 We\'ll always be friendly."
"Heheh.
 Man, we\'ve been saying some pretty embarrassing stuff.
 I feel kinda awkward."
"But I think that is very important.
 It\'s very hard for people to always be friendly, let alone always be together, unless they wish for it."
"That\'s right.
 You really can\'t take everyone being friendly for granted."
"Uu.
 A witch I know said it.
 Happiness won\'t be granted unless everyone believes in it."
"That\'s true.
 Maybe some magic exists in the power of belief.
 If we all believe in that, I\'m sure it will bring us happiness."
"Alright.
 Now the next embarrassing thing.
 Let\'s all swear to believe together, alright?
 That we\'ll all always be friendly, that we\'ll always be happy."
Screw becoming like our parents.
Searching for each other\'s weaknesses, going after Grandfather\'s fortune, screw all that forever...
"Alright!
 We\'ll always be friendly and happy.
 And let\'s all believe that."
No matter how long it had been, or how much fun we were having, it didn\'t stop the dark clouds from approaching Rokkenjima.
......I wonder if the typhoon will pass and show us the refreshing sky before we leave this island.
Who gives a crap about what our parents are plotting?
{n}Who gives a crap about the inheritance and the honor of our old family?
We\'re so young, and renewing our old friendship.
{n}And every one of us believes together that we can all be happy.
So...
I want this day to end,
 without anything weird occurring,
 in peace and happiness,
 calmly...
No, ...not "I want it to end".
{n}......Please, let it end......!
"In your dreeeeeeeeeeeams!
 Kyah‐hahah‐hah‐hah‐haha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"
"Damn iiiiiiiit!!
 Don\'t show up, don\'t appear!!
 Damndamndaaamn!!"
"Sorry to keep you waiting.
 The new game has finally been prepared."
"Come, let us begin this tale of tragedy!
 Come to me, rain, winds, typhoon!
 Cut this island off from the real world!!
 Throw Rokkenjima into another world, into the netherworld, into a world of fantasy!"
And so, the tale repeated for the third time.
However, before the Endless Witch,
 what point was there in counting one, two, three?
There was probably no point at all.
After all, this tale of fantasy would be repeated endlessly, until the match was settled, and either Battler or the witch surrendered.
And the sky grew dark and cloudy, the rain and wind were summoned together and became a typhoon...
And Maria could be seen in the rose garden, paying no mind to the rain that had started falling,
 going around in circles, searching for that single rose which she had surely marked......
".........Not here...
 Not here......
 The rose we marked,
 ......my rose isn\'t here...
 ......Uu.
 ............Uu!!"
Maria definitely remembered it.
That rose had been in the flower bed right here.
 And yet, it wasn\'t.
She didn\'t know what to do with her irritation at not being able to find something which should have been there,
 and, moaning bitterly, she couldn\'t help but keep going back and forth in circles around the same spot.
She was acting almost as though she would be able to see it if she looked at a different angle,
 but try as she might, there was no way she would find something that wasn\'t there...
The wind grew increasingly stronger, and the rain turned into cold, large drops.
{n}There was no way Maria wasn\'t bothered by this.
However, if she couldn\'t find her rose here, it would surely disappear forever.
...Maria believed that.
 That feeling spurred her on to keep searching for a rose that she had no chance of finding...
Just then, the cold drops of rain that were tormenting Maria were suddenly blocked.
"..................Uu?"
Maria raised her head.
 ...When she did, she saw that an umbrella was opened there, protecting her from the rain...
And the one holding out that umbrella was...
......the witch she admired, {f:5:Beatrice}.
"{f:5:Beatrice}...!!"
"What are you doing so frantically in the middle of all this rain?
 You could catch a cold like this.
 Even witches have to care for their own health."
"My...
 ...My rose...
 I can\'t find it...
 ......Uu.
 No matter how many times I search,
 ......even though it was definitely here,
 ...can\'t find it..."
Maria told {f:5:Beatrice} about how there had been a slightly unhealthy, pitiful rose,
 and that she was sure they had marked it.
"Hohoh.
 And you can\'t find it.
 .........If you are a witch apprentice, you should use magic to search for the rose.
 I believe that as long as you search with merely your eyes, it won\'t be nearly enough."
"......Uu.
 ......Can\'t find it.
 ...I did my best, and tried to search with magic, but can\'t find it..."
"While this is certainly ideal for practicing your magic, it might be a little too much for you with all of this wind and rain.
 ......Allow me to lend you some special power.
 Concern for one\'s disciples is also among the duties of a master."
"Tha‐...thank youuu.
 {f:5:Beatrice}!!"
Maria\'s face, which had been full of sadness until just now, split open into a grin.
Maria knew.
 She knew that there was nothing {f:5:Beatrice}\'s magic couldn\'t do.
So she was sure that {f:5:Beatrice} would easily be able to find the rose that she couldn\'t find herself...
{f:5:Beatrice} closed her eyes lightly, acting as though she was listening for something in all this wind and rain.
 Then she heard it, opened her eyes, and spoke.
"............Hmm.
 All things in this world are transitory.
 It is unfortunate, Maria.
 ...It seems that your rose couldn\'t withstand all of this wind and rain."
"Uu......
 Then, my rose is.........?"
"It was uprooted by the wind, and is no longer of this world."
"..................Uu......"
What {f:5:Beatrice} had said was certainly plausible.
 ...There was nothing odd about the flower being broken off at the stem in this strong wind.
...However, Maria couldn\'t accept this, and bitterly gave a low‐pitched moan...
"...............No."
"Hoh?"
"......No no no!
 It\'s my rose!!
 My rose has to come back!
 I\'ll bring it back to life with my magic."
"{f:5:Beatrice}, teach me how to revive a rose with magic...!!"
"Ha!
 It\'s much too early for an apprentice like you to learn the hidden art of Endless Magic.
 Know your place."
"..................Uuuu."
Maria wiped the tears from her eyes, full of regret.
Seeing that expression, which so invited pity, {f:5:Beatrice} shrugged her shoulders and chuckled.
"Very well.
 I will lend you power for the hidden art that can revive a rose."
"Really?!"
"Yes.
 ......Well then, concentrate the power of your heart.
 Close your eyes, forget the rain, forget the wind, search for the soul of the wandering rose with the eyes of your heart."
"......Uu."
Maria closed her eyes.
{n}Then, she repeated {f:5:Beatrice}\'s poem‐like words...
"Come, try to remember.
 Rose, what form did you have?"
"...Come, try to remember.
 Rose, what form did you have...?"
"Don\'t look.
 Don\'t listen.
 And believe.
 ......Release the power of your soul from the cage of flesh that imprisons it.
 ............That\'s it.
 ......Good..."
Around Maria, who was concentrating her power, her eyes tightly shut, small golden butterflies began to dance.
 ......Was this the manifestation of the magical power Maria held?
"Lost soul of the rose.
 Gather into one, and remember your form.
 ......Come, gather, remember..."
The glitter of the gold butterflies began to strengthen, and their numbers increased; then, {f:5:Beatrice} raised a finger up to the skies, and they began to gather at the tip of that finger...
This was the miracle of the golden magic...
And the gold butterflies began to condense into a single dazzling grain of gold.
 ......It was a single seed, glittering gold.
It sat on the tip of {f:5:Beatrice}\'s finger, budded into a golden sprout, and opened into a golden leaf.
 It then slowly fell from that fingertip, sank into the mud of the flower bed, and began to grow steadily...
...Maria, who admired magic and witches, must have really wanted to see this fantastical sight.
However, as an apprentice, Maria was still not qualified to see it.
...No, she was probably afraid that, if she opened her eyes to look, the power of her heart\'s concentration would be interrupted, and the magic would be lost.
Therefore, it was {f:5:Beatrice}, the one permitted to lay eyes on that golden miracle,
 who was the one and only witch, and the master of many miracles...
Then, the fully grown rose bloomed, creating one golden flower.
And when {f:5:Beatrice} poked it with her finger in just the right way,
 the gold‐colored sparkles scattered, just as if a golden soap bubble had popped, and what remained was a single beautiful rose.
"...Mmhm.
 It looks like you\'ve remembered a splendid rose."
"......However, if we just leave it mixed in with these other roses, you won\'t be able to tell it apart.
 Shall I perform one last service?"
{f:5:Beatrice}, for the sake of her cute apprentice witch who was moaning even more now in concentration,
 decided to cast one more little spell.
She snapped her fingers, and a single gold butterfly appeared, fluttered around, and landed on the flower that had just been revived.
Then it suddenly burst open and disappeared, becoming golden lace and marking the rose...
"That is sufficient.
 ......Maria.
 You may open your eyes now."
".........Uu?
 Where\'s the rose?
 Not here.
 Not here."
"Not over there, over here.
 ...Look.
 I have marked it with golden lace."
"Wow... You did...!!
 Awesome awesome awesome awesome!!
 Thank you Beato, thank you Beato!!
 I want to become a witch quickly, a Great Witch like Beato!!"
"And you can.
 Long ago, I too wished for that innocently, just as you do, and I have attained that level."
Maria was ecstatic over the revived rose, clapping her hands and jumping around in joy.
...Watching that, {f:5:Beatrice} also smiled, looking fairly pleased.
Now, if I try, I can break or repair any soul, not just that of a rose, and kill and revive as I please.
So, the barrier created by the storm has closed Rokkenjima off from the real world.
Now is the time for the Golden Witch, the Endless Witch, {f:5:Beatrice} to descend.
{f:5:Beatrice} pulled from her pocket an envelope with the family crest, the One‐winged Eagle, and gave it to Maria.
Maria frolicked around at being selected to be the witch\'s messenger.
"So, Kinzo.
 I\'ve come to join in on your fun once again...
 My preparations are already complete.
 What about you?
 I assume you have prepared enough coins to bet in tonight\'s game...?"
"Naturally, I am fully prepared, {f:5:Beatrice}...!!
 I have prepared pieces in abundance.
 I am ready both physically and mentally!"
"So, let me pay the ante.
 All that you have given should be returned to you in the end.
 Now, take it!!"
Kinzo flung the window of his study wide open, took off the reasonably large golden ring which had been on his finger,
 and threw it into the darkness of the raging wind and rain...
That ring was struck by lightning, and after twinkling gold for an instant, disappeared.
Kinzo watched it go, grinning broadly and fearlessly.
"I don\'t see myself losing.
 You are mine.
 Forever!!"
The ring that Kinzo had thrown became a single gold butterfly, and fluttered around in the wind and rain.
It headed for the rose garden, almost as though it was being guided there.
It then found the figure of the Golden Witch, and fluttered down......
When it arrived right in front of {f:5:Beatrice},
 it burst in a flash of gold, and returned to its original form of a ring, flipping up into the air.
It seemed as if it would simply fall back down into a puddle of water, but suddenly it stopped in midair.
 ...Almost as if some transparent person had caught it.
Somehow, this seemed unexpected even to {f:5:Beatrice}.
However, she soon realized what—who—it was, and grinned broadly at it.
As she did, the figure of the person who had caught the ring began to fuzzily appear...
It was the figure of a young man wearing a butler\'s uniform embroidered with the One‐winged Eagle crest...
There was no man like this among the servants who served the Ushiromiya family.
{n}Even so, {f:5:Beatrice} laughed as though it was someone she remembered fondly.
"Ronove, is it.
 ......It\'s been quite some time.
 It seems that you have remembered me.
 You always were a man who was serious about loyalty."
"It has been a very long time since you last corresponded...
 There has not been a single day that I, Ronove, have forgotten that I serve you, Milady."
"Indeed, I was more fearful that you had forgotten about me, Milady.
 I have, after all, known you to be quite forgetful."
"*cackle*cackle*...!
 I see, yes, it seems I do forget easily.
 I couldn\'t even remember your wry speech until I heard it again."
"For you, Milady."
With an exaggerated yet elegant gesture, he bowed respectfully,
 and held out to {f:5:Beatrice} the Head\'s Ring that he had just caught.
"It is the Ushiromiya family Head\'s Ring, returned to you from Ushiromiya Kinzo.
 It is now, once again, in the possession of its master."
"Indeed.
 The proclamation by Kinzo that the game has started.
 I acknowledge receipt."
"So, how would you like to play tonight?
 Shall I prepare the roulette immediately?
 Or shall I prepare some black tea first?"
"Both sound attractive, but for now, I suspect I need you to greet someone.
 I am quite sure that man has his mouth hanging open and can\'t shut it.
 Right, Battler?"
"Greetings.
 Allow me to introduce myself.
 I am called Ronove, and I serve at the side of Milady {f:5:Beatrice}.
 It is truly a pleasure to meet you."
"See?
 His mouth\'s hanging open and he can\'t shut it, right?
 *cackle*cackle*!"
"Isn\'t that obvious, another incomprehensible guy\'s just appeared!!
 I grumbled that goat‐headed people would start doing the Bon dance, and then goat‐heads started showing up in swarms,
 and since then, not only have those seven sexy‐assed babes appeared, but now even a butler has goddamn shown up!!
 It doesn\'t make sense, cut it out!!"
"By the way, Battler.
 Did you notice?
 Have you realized that your meeting him...is a true "Devil\'s Proof"?"
"A, a Devil\'s Proof...?!
 What do you mean...?"
"He may not look like it, but this guy is a genuine demon, with his name amongst the 72.
 In other words, I\'ve brought a demon right in front of you, which truly proves that they exist."
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!
 Ronove holds a noble rank in Hell, the 27th highest‐ranked Great Demon.
 He\'s a pretty useful man.
 I summoned him at high cost and made him serve me."
"It is an honor to be introduced to you.
 While my name is amongst those of the nobles of Hell,
 I now serve as the head furniture of {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, vulgar {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} and Great Witch from whom even demons would flee in fear."
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*. He\'s a very useful man, but he is impudent with his words.
 It\'s slightly frustrating that he sometimes forgets to respect his master."
"There is nothing in my contract regarding the way in which I must speak.
 Would you like to change that contract?"
"It doesn\'t bore me, so it\'s fine.
 *cackle*cackle*!"
{f:5:Beatrice} turned her back to him, cackling.
After bowing once to her back, Ronove turned back to Battler and stuck out his right hand, showing off an innocent smile.
 Normally, this would mean that he was asking for a handshake.
"......Wh‐...what is this supposed to be?"
"I am also one who has been subjected to Milady\'s whims.
 In that sense, I am sure that we could become good friends.
 This is a handshake of friendship."
"......Of course, it does not mean that you will be entered into a demon\'s contract, so rest assured."
"Sorry, but I\'m right in the middle of a big fight with your master.
 I only shake hands with an enemy after one of those situations like you find in teen dramas, when we\'ve beaten each other up in a rainy schoolyard and are all worn out.
 Remember that."
"I see.
 Then, to shake hands with you, Battler‐sama, I must create a fitting atmosphere in a suitable location,
 and we must exchange body language and sweet words that ring true to the heart.
 I will find a suitable opportunity to prepare such a location."
"I too looove those kinds of situations, you know?
 Pu ku ku ku...!"
Laughing tauntingly, Ronove whispered that to Battler, with his face so close that their noses were almost touching.
Battler, his face turning red after getting so close to another of the same sex, pushed him away.
"Y‐you\'re a creepy bastard...
 I see, just right for Beato\'s butler..."
"It is an honor to receive such words of praise.
 I am very confident in my tea brewing abilities, so please look forward to tea time.
 Baking cookies is one of my hobbies, so I encourage you to have high expectations for the teacakes and such."
"Just what I would expect from a pair of the same gender.
 You\'ve started to get along well very quickly.
 I\'m jealous."
"My, my.
 I apologize most humbly for making you jealous, Milady.
 I will not stealthily snatch your guest away from you."
"Well then, I will leave for now to greet the rest of the furniture and inform them that I have retaken my post as head furniture.
 Please forgive my short absence."
"Mmhm.
 Only the common goats and the Seven Sisters used for the ritual have manifested themselves.
 You will be able to finish up greeting them with ease."
"Oh?
 Those lively Seven Sisters are here?
 I wonder whether those naughty girls have grown a little more graceful?"
"......Ihihi.
 If that\'s graceful, I\'d have to doubt the definition of graceful."
"Is that so?
 It seems that you have already enjoyed some playtime with the Seven Sisters."
"Judging by your expression, it seems that they are just as naughty as they were before.
 Even though I am always telling them to act more fitting as a group of those who serve {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.
 What troublesome kids..."
"If that\'s your problem, don\'t worry.
 They actually act perfectly fitting for their master..."
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!
 You have started to grow some guts!"
"However, to have a conversation is to acknowledge the person you are talking to.
 Now that you have started to respond to my idle chatting, that is proof that you are gradually starting to accept my existence."
"Heh.
 That\'s because, even if the sun starts rising from the west, I will definitely, definitely‐definitely, never accept that you\'re a witch.
 Maybe if you start crying and kissing my shoes, I might be willing to have a more constructive discussion."
Even if Battler was bluffing, he still spoke forcefully, a fearless expression on his face.
The witch and her butler snickered together, realizing that their guest had regained more than enough of his willpower to take on a new game,
 and that the preparations were complete...
After Ronove exchanged a few words with {f:5:Beatrice}, he bowed silently to Battler, scattered into gold butterflies, and disappeared.
"*cackle*cackle*.
 It is truly pleasing when everything gets so lively."
"......How boring were those days when I was trapped alone on this island, unable to regain my power and without anyone to talk to."
"......I get how that creepy‐ass guy is really fitting as your butler."
"...But tell me.
 Why has that butler only appeared now?
 You said something about how only the goats and the seven stake chicks had manifested themselves.
 What did that mean...?"
"Hmm, yes.
 You still fight it, but I am a fully fledged witch.
 I am in contact with a good many nonhuman entities in the netherworld."
"I\'m sure.
 None of your contacts are halfway near decent.
 First some goat monsters, then those sexy‐assed babes, and this time a demon butler\'s showed up.
 ......I don\'t want to say it, but there better not be more and more of these weird guys to come..."
"Hahahaha!
 How much furniture do you think I have serving at my great golden mansion, how many demons do you think visit me there?
 They will keep coming.
 They will appear in any number."
"When the door to the Golden Land is opened, I will call back all of my furniture, and build my new castle here on Rokkenjima.
 Then I plan to invite all of my old friends, and we will drink and dance together for three days and three nights."
"......I do also plan to invite Kinzo\'s family, of course?
 You too, if you wish.
 *cackle*cackle*...!"
"......So let me get this straight.
 Since you\'d lost your power, for a long time, you couldn\'t summon them."
"...And your magic power has been recovering gradually, so you\'ve become able to summon more and more monsters.
 Is that what you\'re trying to say?"
"It is as you say.
 You have managed to avoid taking that final step off the cliff,
 but your heart is already wavering, and you are unable to deny that I am a witch.
 That wavering in your heart has slightly restored my power as a witch."
"So are you saying that creepy butler appeared...
...because I started to surrender?"
"That\'s right.
 Bit by bit, you are surrendering to me...!
 You submitted to me so much in the last game that you received all of that humiliation, did you not?"
"Your back was truly pleasant for throwing my feet up on, I\'ll have you know.
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"
"...D‐
......dammit.......
 ...I thought that, as long as I didn\'t accept you, I\'d be able to keep on going.
 ...But it seems apparently I was mistaken."
"That\'s right.
 The closer you get to submitting, the more the game will swing in my favor.
 Isn\'t chess the same?"
"In the process of cornering each other\'s kings, we have traded several pieces.
 It is true that I have yet to corner your king."
"......However, you have your hands full just enabling your king to escape, and have lost several important pieces to me, and conceded a large advantage.
 It is only natural that further advances will lean in my favor."
"..................Damn........."
"As we continue, you will probably still succeed in frantically avoiding my checkmates, if nothing else.
 ...However, as you do, I will steal your important pieces from you one by one.
 In the end, you will have lost everything but your king, and you will receive a true checkmate, from which you will be denied any form of escape."
"......You were talking big last time, weren\'t you?
 Something about how, since you would never accept me, this would be eternal torture that would torment me.
 Only witches who have reached the endless level can talk about eternity.
 You have never possessed that qualification.
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*, hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐ha!!"
"Kinzo‐sama has already publicly displayed the location of the hidden gold within the epitaph under my portrait.
 The rules apply equally to all who can read the epitaph.
 If you discover the gold, I shall return everything to you."
"Tonight, I ask that you enjoy your battle of wits with Kinzo‐sama to the fullest.
 I sincerely pray that this night will be both intellectual and elegant.
 {nobreak:—{f:5:Beatrice} the Golden}."
When Maria finished reading the letter that {f:5:Beatrice} had handed her, everyone was at a loss for words for a while.
And then, they all broke the silence at once...
"R‐Ridiculous.
 What a worthless, vicious prank!"
"I agree wholeheartedly.
 There is no way that Father would give up the Head\'s Ring.
 {f:5:Beatrice}?
 Ha!
 What a transparent prank, hoping that bringing up that name will have us running around like headless chickens."
"Come on come on, who\'s the one behind this dessert packing a little too much punch?
 I\'ll applaud and admire you if you come clean now.
 Rosa?"
"O‐of course not...!
 I wouldn\'t pull a prank assuming Father\'s name!"
"Then Aneki?!
 Aniki?!"
"Me?!
 Don\'t be absurd!
 It was you, wasn\'t it?!
 Only you could plan something this vulgar!!"
"Are you trying to mock me?!!
 I\'m the one who wants to question you!
 Who is behind this ill‐natured prank?!"
Krauss beat the table and stared at everyone.
...Since that included the children too, he scared them greatly...
"...A letter from a mysterious person who claims to have been given full rights to Father\'s assets.
 And if you think about how this family conference is all about discussing that,
 ......I think it\'s too hasty to call this just a prank."
"I wouldn\'t be so sure.
 It really might be one of Father\'s vulgar pranks...
 He might\'ve planned this to shock us a bit, since we\'ve been discussin\' the distribution of his inheritance without him..."
"If Dad was the one who planned this,
 ......then we can\'t take what Maria‐chan just read aloud as a joke, right...?"
"......That\'s right.
 If you interpret the contents literally, ...then this is a test from Father.
 The epitaph of the witch has been displayed in the hall for quite some time now, so that any one of us could solve it.
 There was plenty of notice.
 So he\'s saying that the first person to solve it will be handed the headship along with all of his wealth, right...?"
......See? Our magic worked......
"Ridiculous, there is nothing of the sort!!
 It is an unshakable fact that my husband will become the successor to the Ushiromiya family headship!!"
"This letter is the very thing that shakes it!
 This letter is a message from the person who was given full rights to {i:all} of Father\'s wealth!"
"Nii‐san\'s right to become the head has returned to a blank slate.
 The person who solves the riddle,
 ......the person who finds {f:5:Beatrice}\'s gold will become the next head of the Ushiromiya family!!"
"Ludicrous...!
 Are you going to trust the meaningless words in that letter?
 That the seal was the real thing?
 How can we possibly trust that!!"
"Then let\'s try going to ask Father directly!
 We aren\'t at the level where you can get away with saying that his mood\'s bad or that he\'s not feeling well, you know?!"
"The sealed wax clearly shows that this letter was from Father\'s representative!
 If you doubt that, then show some proof, Nii‐san.
 Prove that this letter is not an expression of Father\'s wishes!!"
"V‐very well.
 It is just as you say.
 It no longer matters whether Dad\'s in a good mood or not...
 Let us go up and ask him directly."
"Let\'s do it.
 We\'ll ask Dad directly.
 Dad is to blame too here, why did he have to choose such a roundabout way?
 Well, that is a little like him!"
"I, I wonder if it\'s alright to talk like that, taking it for granted that it is Father\'s letter..."
"Stupid Rosa!!
 Isn\'t it obviously Father\'s letter?!
 That letter was Father\'s!!
 Isn\'t it obvious that he\'s giving the four of us an even chance to become the successor?!!"
"Idiot, die, you useless woman!!"
Rosa really is dumb.
 Why doesn\'t she just give up and die forever...?
"I, I\'m sorry...!
 Th‐tha‐that\'s right...
 I\'m sorry..."
In the beginning, the adults had all doubted the authenticity of the letter,
 but after just now realizing that this was a once‐in‐a‐lifetime chance for the three siblings other than Krauss in the struggle for the inheritance, Eva had changed her position, and had claimed that the letter was authentic.
Rudolf and Rosa also realized that, and agreed.
"Good gracious!!
 How could adults like you take such a worthless prank this seriously...!
 Even though I am not Father, I understand well his exasperation!!"
"Whoa whoa whoa whoa!
 Natsuhi‐san, won\'t everythin\' be fine if we just ask Father...?!
 Everything\'ll be fine if Father simply mentions that he doesn\'t know about the letter!"
"Nii‐san.
 Take responsibility, and just get him to say that he doesn\'t know about the letter.
 This isn\'t a time to get scared just because he\'s in a bad mood, you know?!"
He\'s still scared of Father at his age, what an idiot.
 Why doesn\'t he just give up and die forever...?
"R‐right!
 Let\'s get this situation painted in black and white.
 He\'s probably eating in his study right now.
 I think it\'s time we had him rest his chopsticks for a moment...!"
"It\'s decided.
 Let\'s go!
 Kyrie, wait here for a while.
 We\'ll go to check whether it\'s true or not and come back quickly."
"......Thank you.
 I will wait patiently for Gohda‐san to bring the dessert."
The four siblings, Natsuhi, and Hideyoshi all stood from their seats forcefully and flew out into the hallway with a clatter.
Afterwards, the only ones left were the children, stunned completely speechless; Nanjo, who looked uncomfortable;
 and Kyrie, shrugging her shoulders.
Maria, who had been at the center of all this turmoil, looked a little scared at the adults\' sudden change.
...However, judging from her appearance,
 she didn\'t look like she realized the full significance of what she had just read out.
"...What in the world......was that all about...?
 I don\'t friggin\' get it..."
"......Shitheads, every last one of them.
 Do they really want the inheritance that much...?!"
"............Everyone,
 this is our parents\' problem.
 It has nothing to do with us.
 So you mustn\'t worry about it."
"Yeah, if only it was that easy...
 ...They were so blatantly..."
"I thought they were better than this...!
 Showing off their greed...!"
"Uu!
 Everyone has to believe together we\'ll be happy!
 Uu‐uu!"
"...That\'s right.
 We all did promise.
 Come on, Battler‐kun, Jessica‐chan, you too..."
"............Haah."
"......I feel like crap..."
We couldn\'t accept it at all, but we laid down our arms for the time being.
...We had known vaguely how filthy the family conference was going to be this time.
 ...However, after that six‐year blank, I couldn\'t help being shocked...
Seeing that the children were completely dejected, Doctor Nanjo cleared his throat uncomfortably.
"...It\'s an adult discussion.
 It has nothing to do with all of you young people.
 Let us forget about it."
"I would if I could, okay...!"
"I know that it\'s hard on you.
 But please, forget it for now, for their sakes."
"...All of your parents are fighting frantically to make your futures just a little brighter.
 Please, don\'t look at your injured parents with those cold eyes when they come back."
".....................
 Even on your request, Kyrie‐san,
 ......that\'s a hard one."
"If we could be that cut and dried about it,
 ......we wouldn\'t be kids in the first place....."
"Uu!
 Everyone happyyy!!
 Can\'t get daaaark!!
 Belieeeeve!
 Unless we all believe we can be happy, the happiness will get away!
 We all have to believe!
 Uu‐uu‐uu!!"
"......That sounds good.
 I\'ll believe too.
 We can be happy."
"Uu!
 Auntie Kyrie, thank you!!"
"Battler and Jessica onee‐chan, you believe too!
 {f:5:Beatrice} is always saying that magic won\'t have any power if you don\'t believe.
 Uu!"
Kyrie‐san rose from her seat quietly, went over to Maria, and crouched down so that their eyes met.
"......Uu.
 You believed, Auntie Kyrie.
 Now, Battler and Jessica onee‐chan have to believe."
"They\'re both strong people.
 They\'ll feel better soon and do that for you."
"Yeah."
"More importantly,
 ............I want you to tell me."
When Kyrie‐san said that, Jessica, George‐aniki, Doctor Nanjo and I all listened closely.
...It looked like our parents\' minds had been filled by thoughts of Grandfather and the inheritance problem,
 but we wanted to ask Maria about something simpler.
"Uu?
 What?"
"Who gave you that letter, Maria‐chan...?"
"{f:5:Beatrice}!!"
"The witch drawn in that portrait...?"
"Uu!
 She gave me this letter and an umbrella!
 And she used magic to fix my rose that was broken!
 {f:5:Beatrice} is an awesome witch who can do anything!!"
"............Could you tell us about it in a bit more detail...?"Without even being allowed to wait for dessert, we were chased out of the room.
I heard that, in the end, our parents were unable to get Grandfather to respond.
...Well, I\'m not sure I should be saying this, but I feel like Grandfather deserves a pat on the back.
He had to be feeling pretty satisfied with the shock his strange letter had given to his children, who had all been so infatuated with distributing the inheritance while he was still alive.
I too felt like our despicable parents had gotten what they deserved in all of this confusion.
......But I couldn\'t really say that I was feeling great.
{n}I felt all sulky.
Grandfather hadn\'t entertained them for a moment, but he also apparently hadn\'t denied anything about the letter.
Grandfather\'s name pops up several times in the witch\'s letter.
If Grandfather knew that someone was stealing his name, then considering his character, he would probably be mad with rage.
But even though Grandfather now knew the contents of that letter, he had coolly ignored it.
In this case, did that count as a silent yes?
Auntie Eva and Dad had been trying to interpret the letter in their favor, their greed clearly visible.
It wouldn\'t have mattered so much if that was all, but the adults had then started focusing on Maria, who had received the letter.
 They kept pounding her with questions about who had given her that letter.
Maria repeated over and over again that she had gotten it from {f:5:Beatrice}, but there was no way a mysterious person like that could be mixed in with the others on this island.
...After all, this is a small island where no one lives except the Ushiromiya family.
Maria kept repeating that she had gotten it from {f:5:Beatrice}, no matter how many times she was asked.
It seemed that the adults felt that she was trying to trick them, so they didn\'t hold back, and questioned her until she broke out in tears...
By the time Maria was released, she had cried herself to the point of exhaustion.
Our parents ordered us to go to the guesthouse and take Maria with us,
 then shut themselves up in the dining hall, and started getting louder and louder as they discussed the inheritance.
It seemed that, because of that strange letter, the possibility had arisen that Uncle Krauss\'s ability to become the next head could be returned to a blank slate,
 and in exchange for accepting him, my dad and the rest were trying to swindle Uncle Krauss out of a lot of money...or something like that.
Jessica and I, both astonished, were happy to move over to the guesthouse.
We didn\'t want to be under the same roof as those filthy adults, their heads so filled with thoughts about money.
George‐aniki pleaded on behalf of our parents, saying that he wanted us to understand them.
...I understood his reasoning.
 No matter how filthy this talk of money was, it wouldn\'t go away if you just closed your eyes to it.
But even so, how could they so blatantly degenerate into such money‐grubbing demons...
Maria had cried herself dry, and was hiding in her bed.
 She hadn\'t even twitched for a while, so she was probably sleeping...
".........Who in the world gave that letter to Maria‐chan?"
"George nii‐san.
 You mustn\'t ask that anymore.
 If Maria says she got it from {f:5:Beatrice}, can\'t we just leave it at that...?"
"I mean, we don\'t want to make her cry any more than this."
......That said.
 Even we felt a confusion that we couldn\'t clear away.
"There are only 18 people on this island now.
 The thought that, in the middle of all this rain, an unknown 19th person gave Maria‐chan that letter, and is now hiding somewhere,
 honestly doesn\'t seem realistic at all."
"Probably...Shannon or someone put on the dress from that portrait, and skillfully planned this ahead of time with Maria."
"...Although of course, as soon as Maria saw that dress, that might have been enough on its own to convince her that it was {f:5:Beatrice}."
"Maybe it doesn\'t really matter who handed her the letter.
 The important thing is who sent it."
"...The point is that Grandfather wanted to cause an uproar by assuming the name of the witch.
 Seriously, that old geezer\'s good at riling people up."
The truth was probably that our occult‐loving Grandfather was playing around,
 by choosing a dramatic way of handing the letter over to Maria, who shared the same hobby as he did.
......Paying no heed, though, to the trouble it would cause Maria, or the rest of us.
"Seriously. Messing around with Maria\'s pure heart...
 It doesn\'t matter who handed the letter over.
 Maria says that she got it from {f:5:Beatrice}, so let\'s treat it that way."
"I agree.
 Let\'s do that.
 To Maria‐chan, {f:5:Beatrice} is kinda like what Santa Claus is to most kids."
"Whether it be a non‐existent 19th person or Santa Claus,
 as long as we accept that they exist, they will at least "exist" inside Maria.
 ...I see, it\'s important to lie to a child to protect their dreams."
"............Hmm?
 What\'s up, Jessica?
 Are you still angry?"
Jessica had her hand on her chin, as though there was something that she just couldn\'t understand.
When I called out to her, she came to her senses.
"Aah, ......sorry.
 Well, ......actually,
 ......I was wondering if it was possible that Maria actually met {f:5:Beatrice}."
"...What do you mean by that?
 Are you saying that there\'s a 19th person on this island?"
"If we take what Maria‐chan said to heart, then we do arrive at that answer."
"No, that\'s not what I mean.
 ......I\'m talking about the story that someone we don\'t know has been living on this island since long ago."
"Living, you say. Where?"
"...In the forest."
The adults were gathered in the dining hall, spending a very long time continuing the discussion that had been started by {f:5:Beatrice}\'s letter...
Krauss strongly claimed that the letter was a simple prank,
 but he couldn\'t overturn the claim that Kinzo\'s failure to deny the letter was answer enough.
Judging by Kinzo\'s character, if he knew that a letter had been written by someone else in his name, he would be mad with rage.
Since all of the siblings knew that, Krauss had no choice but to withdraw his claim.
Without even having to summarize it, the contents of the letter were simple.
The person who solved the witch\'s epitaph would receive the headship and assets.
This did a lot of damage to Krauss, who was thought to have been guaranteed the succession,
 and for everyone else, who had given up on that long ago, it was better news than they could ever have hoped for.
However, there were some points that worried them.
"The person who solved the epitaph" was not limited to a member of the Ushiromiya family.
Taken literally, anyone, no matter how doubtful their origin, could succeed to the Ushiromiya family.
And furthermore, this meant there was a chance that all of the Ushiromiya family\'s assets could be stolen by some unknown person.
In that sense, it was definitely not a situation where anyone could lower their guard, even the siblings other than Krauss.
Had this letter come from a saboteur sent by Kinzo who called themselves {f:5:Beatrice}?
 ...Or was this the scheme of some unknown person trying to steal the Ushiromiya family\'s wealth?
 They still didn\'t know the truth.
...But they could say one thing for certain.
Maria had received this problematic letter...
today,
 on this island.
In other words, someone who was planning something related to that letter was on this island today.
......Was the person who set it up Kinzo, one of the four siblings,
 or maybe some unknown person?
No matter how much they suspected each other, they couldn\'t reach a conclusion.
After getting tired of bickering with each other,
 they finally reached the extremely obvious conclusion that doubting each other was just a waste of time...
"......We\'ve made no progress.
 We\'ve just been wasting time."
"That\'s right.
 Now that you realized it, we won\'t have to waste so much."
"It is not certain that Father is the one who sent the letter.
 My husband has merely had enough of you being unable to hold a conversation."
"Which one of us can\'t hold a conversation?
 You keep yelling at me every time I say something.
 Do you truly think that such shameful behavior is fitting for a member of the Ushiromiya family?"
"Give it a rest, Eva.
 You too, Natsuhi‐san.
 That topic\'s finished for now."
"Sh‐shall we all cool our heads off for now?
 Let\'s have some cool drinks brought over."
"That sounds good.
 It would probably be wiser if we cooled our heads.
 Baby, don\'t you want to go for a smoke, too?"
"...Aneki looks like she\'s in a bad mood.
 So I\'ll pass on that smoke.
 But I agree about the cool drinks.
 Rosa, have someone bring some water.
 A whole pitcher."
"Alright..."
Rosa headed over to the extension telephone in the corner of the room and called the servant room.
 She then passed on what Rudolf had told her to the person on the other end.
The vicious bickering up until now vanished like it had never happened.
{n}That silence continued until Gohda finished setting the table and retreated from the room...
".........Is there anything else that you require?"
"No.
 Please leave us."
"Yes.
 ...Then if you will excuse me.
 If you need anything, call me at any time."
After listening to the sound of Gohda\'s footsteps disappear off into the distance, everyone took a deep breath at the same time to break the tension.
"...It sure is raining hard.
 I wonder if our witch, this 19th person, is taking shelter in the arbor in the rose garden about now?"
"...I wonder.
 ......They might be able to avoid the rain, but it would be quite cold."
".........A mysterious 19th visitor.
 Sounds pretty interestin\', just like a mystery novel.
 Normally, in that kind of story, it\'s a safe bet that the person doesn\'t exist, that one of us 18 would be fakin\' it."
"...I suspect Genji and the others.
 We should have found any excuse we could to dismiss all of the servants of the One‐winged Eagle."
"Come now, don\'t say that.
 We must be grateful for their long years of service.
 ...Of course, we can\'t let our guard down."
"So, then, you also agree that whether or not Father was behind this,
 the person who handed Maria‐chan the letter was a servant?"
"Indeed.
 After all, we were all being "friendly" in our big happy circle the whole time until dinner, weren\'t we?
 All of us siblings have alibis.
 Only a servant could have handed Maria that letter."
"...But all of the servants...
said that they were too busy with the bed‐making to have any spare time during which they could have gone to Maria in the rose garden...
 ....................."
"Hey hey, what are you trying to say then?
 You aren\'t saying that the witch of the forest {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama came over and actually handed Maria‐chan that letter, are you?"
"Ahahaha.
 Rosa, you used to believe so much that it really frightened you, right?
 You don\'t mean to say that you still believe at this age?
 The witch of the forest."
......If she did exist, I\'d love for her to appear.
{n}But no matter how much I wished, she didn\'t appear before me even once.
 She didn\'t save me from my crisis...
"O‐of course not...
 I just thought that since all 18 of us said that we didn\'t do it, there might really be a 19th person..."
"That can\'t be. In the first place, we were the only ones who came on that boat.
 We didn\'t see any mysterious stranger ridin\' with us.
 You don\'t think that they might have swam across this rough sea, right?
 I can\'t really imagine that.
 Wahahahahahaha."
"......Logically that\'s true.
 It is difficult to imagine that there\'s a single hidden and uninvited guest on this isolated island...
 ...However,
 .........it looks like some of us still can\'t bring themselves to discard that possibility entirely, doesn\'t it?"
Hideyoshi had laughed it off, saying that there couldn\'t be a 19th person,
 but Kyrie had sensitively picked up on the delicate atmosphere among the four siblings.
Just by common sense, there couldn\'t possibly be any uninvited guests on this small, isolated island.
How on earth would they get here, and from where, and where would they be hiding themselves?
{n}And why wouldn\'t they appear openly, even though they had sent a letter in their own name?
 ...None of these could be explained.
But considering that none of the four siblings had joined in on Hideyoshi\'s laughing,
 they seemed unable to completely deny in their hearts the possibility of a 19th person...
"Kyrie‐san.
 I would like to make this clear: we don\'t remotely believe in that fairytale about the legend of the witch."
"......Another topic to insult Father, is it?
 Simply mentioning that is a betrayal against him."
"*giggle*giggle*.
 Well, yes.
 ......However, this is Father we\'re talking about.
 It is possible that he......you know...?"
"...............I, ...I don\'t know anything......"
"What\'s this, what\'s this?
 Why\'s everyone gotten so gloomy...?
 What are you talkin\' about?"
"...You\'re sayin\'...the legend of the witch isn\'t a joke, ...but a fact?
 That\'s ridiculous!"
"Hahahaha.
 Of course, nobody believes in some witch riding a broom and flying in the sky.
 ......But, the woman in that portrait,
 ...{f:5:Beatrice}, may really have existed on this island."
".........Hideyoshi‐san,
 it looks like we aren\'t talking about a witch, but something a little simpler.
 ...Let me see if I have this correct."
"You all suspect that Father had a mistress named {f:5:Beatrice} living in secret somewhere on this island.
 ......Is it something like that?"
"Father is a paragon of a man, a model of self‐discipline and restraint!
 It is completely inconceivable that he would bring something so filthy onto this island...!"
Natsuhi snapped at her immediately, but it looked like the four siblings, including her husband Krauss, didn\'t think that way.
...On the contrary, it appeared that they thought Kinzo was exactly the kind of person likely to attempt such a stunt.
The existence of a mistress who had Kinzo under her spell...
had been whispered of since the very beginning, when he had built the mansion on this island......
"......I\'m sorry, Natsuhi‐san, I know how much you respect Dad, but that rumor\'s been around for a long time.
 Dad prepared this island by himself, and built everything."
"...It\'s been suspected from the beginning that this mansion might have some hidden tricks or secret rooms known only to Dad,
 and it\'s also always been whispered that hidden somewhere on this island, there might be a secret mansion none of us know about."
"Yes, it has.
 This island might look small on a map, ...but it\'s quite large for just the Ushiromiya family to live on."
"......So people have wondered whether he might have built a secret mansion somewhere in the uncivilized forest for his mistress to live in?
 That\'s a rather large‐scale story."
"In the beginning, we used to say that it might be somewhere inside this mansion.
 ......That there might be a hidden basement, with a fabulous hidden room, where the witch in that portrait was secretly hiding."
"...After seeing that intricate auto‐lock on Dad\'s study, it isn\'t too hard to imagine, right?"
"......Indeed, Father did spread the rumor that he hid a large amount of gold in some secret place, protected by some secret mechanism.
 It would not surprise me to find there existed some hidden room inside this very mansion that none of us knows about yet."
"When Mother was alive, she would often scour the entire mansion searching for it when Father was absent.
 ......Mother also suspected what Rudolf just said.
 She believed that there was a hidden door or stairway somewhere, and that his blonde‐haired mistress was hidden behind it."
It\'s hard to believe, but there are some actual examples in other countries of people cheating with someone over a period of several decades by making them live in a hidden attic room.
And this was Kinzo, with a mansion this extravagant.
{n}......There was endless opportunity to suspect the existence of hidden rooms...
"The legend of the Rokkenjima witch,
 ...from what I\'d heard, it was just a fairy tale made up to prevent children from entering the uncivilized forest by scaring them.
 ...But it\'s starting to sound like there\'s a little more to the story."
"Well, yeah.
 As you know, this is a lonely island without anything but the Ushiromiya mansion on it."
"When Rosa and I were little brats, on stormy nights, we were so scared by the sound of rustling trees we could hear from the forest.
 We had this crazy delusion that something weird might be looking out at us from between those trees.
 It\'s only natural for any brat to think something like that."
"...But some people heard Rosa and me making those claims, and weren\'t happy to dismiss it as a kid\'s delusion.
 ...Isn\'t that right, Aneki?"
".........Yes.
 Nii‐san and I thought that by coincidence you might have spotted Father\'s mistress, who had been living in secrecy on this island, as she went out for a walk when no one was looking.
 Of course, Mother did too."
"...Among the older servants too, you often heard that ghost story about how the witch of the portrait wanders around the mansion at midnight.
 Outwardly, I laughed that off as just a ghost story, but on the inside, I suspected very much that it referred to the existence of a hidden mistress."
"In that case, .........you\'re sayin\' that the existence of a 19th person...
might not be completely ridiculous?
 ...That they might actually be somewhere around here......?"
".........Sounds like a case of that "Devil\'s Proof" Rudolf‐san is always talking about."
"...It might be possible to prove that there is a 19th person, but it\'s impossible to prove that a 19th person doesn\'t exist.
 ......Should we continue this discussion assuming that there is a person named {f:5:Beatrice} hiding somewhere on this island......?"
"As the first step in crisis management, that\'s the right way.
 ...It\'s probably way more prudent to say she might exist, rather than thinking there\'s no way she does."
"I, ...I see.
 Sorry, I was a bit careless...
 Rosa‐san, sorry for laughin\' just now..."
"Huh, ...ah, ......it\'s alright, I don\'t mind."
Hideyoshi apologized deeply for not being conscious enough of danger, despite calling himself the president of a company.
Silence fell again.
By preparing for the existence of a 19th person,
 they were accepting that some unknown person was hidden on this island.
And since this person might have something bad planned for them,
 it was only natural that it came with a certain degree of discomfort...
"......In the past, Father would sometimes suddenly disappear without telling anyone where he went.
 After all, he is a person who appreciates silence.
 It was not out of the ordinary for him to shut himself up in some archive after purposefully not telling anyone where he was going."
"......However, after the witch theory began to be refined into the theory about his mistress, it was eventually whispered that he was secretly going back and forth to see her."
"Mom was completely overridden with doubt in her final years.
 Sometimes, she\'d suddenly start making a racket and asking the servants to look for Dad immediately, saying it was an emergency."
"......Yes, that did happen sometimes.
 Mother was always doing things like that in her later years, and that frightening atmosphere still hasn\'t gone away.
 ...I can say it for certain now.
 She was a person to be pitied."
"So then, ...what were the results of those large‐scale searches of the house?
 Did they find anythin\'?"
"No.
 Not on a single occasion did they even find Father, let alone any hidden rooms.
 And every time, after a lot of time had passed, he would suddenly show up somewhere.
 Then he\'d say that he\'d been taking a nap in some archive or that the wind had called him down for a walk on the beach."
"...But it was always some place where the servants had already looked.
 ......We never knew where Father had gone."
"By that time, Father was already famous for his adoration of the occult,
 so some of the servants exaggerated, saying that he might have turned into butterflies and danced around the rose garden."
"So in short, Father frequently disappeared, and no one knew where he went."
"Yeah.
 Since we couldn\'t find him no matter how much we looked inside the mansion, we grew increasingly of the opinion that Dad might have gone somewhere outside it.
 But there isn\'t much to speak of in the area outside the mansion.
 ......Which leaves only the expansive forest."
"And if you tie that in with the legend of the witch from the forest, you get a theory like this:
 Dad had actually built a hidden mansion somewhere in the forest,
 inside of which a mistress by the name of {f:5:Beatrice} lived, and he sometimes went to see her."
"...I was also young at the time.
 At one point, I became intent on catching Father cheating, and I tried to follow him when he went outside."
"...I failed, of course.
 Every time Dad went outside, he was oddly intent on staying out of sight, and was extremely cautious that he wasn\'t being watched.
 He was like that to a very odd extent."
"But that actually made me sure.
 He must have been going out for some reason that the members of his family couldn\'t know about."
"And that would be going to meet his mistress.
 Probably tryin\' to avoid being seen."
After seeing Hideyoshi nod and say "yes, yes" as though this was quite obvious, Eva got a little sullen.
"...Well, anyway.
 This island was like a sketchbook in which Father, with his Western obsession, could draw out all of his dreams.
 ......Everything about this island was exactly how Father wanted it.
 It wouldn\'t be odd at all if there were some hidden mansion for his mistress to live in..."
Eva\'s words spoke for what all of the siblings had come to think.
For a while, the room returned to silence again, and everyone listened to the sound of the wind and rain...
......Was there a hidden mansion on this island, and had Kinzo\'s mistress been living there in hiding for a long, long time......?
Every one of them had thought that they were being too suspicious, and had refrained from saying it for the longest time, but...
......it had been a common opinion that everyone shared.
Kyrie, who had been listening the whole time with her eyes closed, spoke to no one in particular.
"...How long has this rumor about Father\'s mistress been around?"
"As soon as we moved to this island, so about thirty years ago."
"Think about it, it would\'ve been impossible for him to have a hidden mansion constructed once we came here.
 People and materials would have to be going in and out.
 We\'d have found out in no time."
"So, if this was possible, it would have had to have happened before we moved here.
 ...It probably could have been built along with this mansion when we were still living in Odawara."
"It\'s probably appropriate to assume that he had the plan laid out from the beginning to set up a double life with his family and his mistress.
 And his relationship with that mistress probably went back to the days when we lived in Odawara."
"Probably.
 If, as Father says, she is the source of the vast amount of gold that he used to gain the funds which resurrected the Ushiromiya family,
 we could probably conclude that they had a close relationship since Odawara at least."
"......A relationship trusting enough for her to lend him a vast quantity of gold.
 I can\'t even imagine how old that relationship must have been."
".........Most likely, she gave Father some invaluable advice for achieving success in business.
 It\'s natural to think that, out of a sense of gratitude for that, he described it as if this person had given him gold."
"If you think about it that way, it\'s obvious that they would have a close relationship after that.
 Rather than a debauched relationship with a mistress, it was probably a relationship of gratitude to the person who saved the Ushiromiya family from crisis."
"......That way of looking at it might have some sense to it too.
 But, even in that case, isn\'t building a hidden mansion and havin\' her live in it going a little too far?
 Doesn\'t that mean that there were some emotions in play beyond gratitude?"
"Well, this is all speculation.
 ......In the first place, no one has ever found that hidden mansion."
"...Aniki, you\'re planning on expanding this island into a resort, right?
 You might stumble onto it by chance in the process, who knows?
 Maybe you\'d even unexpectedly find some gold there, too."
"...Hahahaha.
 Do you think Rokkenjima is Treasure Island or something?"
"Don\'t play dumb.
 ...Although you say that you\'re opening a resort, we know that it\'s just a cover for a full‐scale investigation of the entire island, okay?
 Although, it sounds as if, due to all that trouble and confusion we were talking about earlier, you haven\'t been able to carry it out, of course?"
"I don\'t know what you\'re talking about, but you misunderstand.
 It is perfectly natural that investigating this island would be the first step in turning it into a resort."
Krauss tried to play dumb, but it was plainly obvious to his siblings, who knew him so well.
...Krauss was definitely sure of the existence of a hidden mansion.
And under the pretense of opening a resort, he had been investigating the island in detail, searching for a clue as to the location of the hidden gold.
They couldn\'t tell whether that conviction was just him over‐thinking things, or whether it was based on some physical proof.
......However, if Krauss, with all his guile, was convinced,
 then the other siblings were similarly convinced that there must be a sufficient basis for it...
"......The story about a witch livin\' in a forest is straight out of a fairy tale,
 but a story about some blonde‐haired girl livin\' secretly in a mansion no one knows about in the middle of a forest...isn\'t much better."
"Certainly.
 Taken on its own, the setting sounds just like some kind of children\'s story.
 You like those, don\'t you, Rosa?"
"......Huh, ......w‐...well, yes..."
"When the mansion was built on this island, Father was at the height of his prosperity.
 With his money, he could probably have obtained anything, made any of his delusions real.
 ...A mansion in the forest where a witch quietly waits...
 ......It sounds like the kind of setting Dad would like."
"......Doesn\'t it?
 Like something from the occult or a fairy tale.
 ...It feels like Dad would be into that."
On this island, which the Ushiromiya family had lived on for thirty years now,
 a hidden mansion that no one knew about had been quietly built, and within, there lived a witch known only by her portrait...
Even this hard‐to‐believe story...
might not be completely delusional considering all of Kinzo\'s strange habits and his vast wealth...
"......It might not have been impossible for Father to build a hidden mansion to satisfy such a dream."
"......However, let\'s be realistic.
 Would it be possible to house his beloved woman in that hidden mansion for decades without it becoming inconvenient...?"
"......Well,
 if there was love, it could have been possible, right?"
"Think about the facilities needed to let his beloved woman live healthily.
 ......And how Father would do it.
 For example, even if it was on a small scale, it would have to be an intricate and pleasant residence."
"And, in terms of upkeep, it would need:
 electricity,
 gas,
 running water.
 As well as possibly some people to help her.
 Even providing for her meals would be quite difficult."
"She would need clothes and makeup, daily necessities.
 ...The needs of a woman aren\'t simple.
 ......Would it be possible to maintain all of that without any of the family or the servants noticing?"
"............When you say it that way, it sure sounds like a weak point in our theory.
 ...But that isn\'t enough to get rid of my feeling that Dad might have been able to pull it off anyway.
 ...After all, it is Dad."
"That\'s right.
 ...It is Father."
"When Father had something he wanted to succeed in, he would succeed no matter what.
 ...Saying that it would be difficult for a normal person and is therefore impossible...doesn\'t apply when it comes to Father."
"Yes.
 You should never underestimate Father.
 ......Dad\'s madness can\'t be understood by normal people."
I wouldn\'t put it past {i:the} Ushiromiya Kinzo.
...As long as that word could accompany his name, a considerable amount of credibility dwelled in any story, no matter how absurd.
However, that didn\'t shake the importance of what Kyrie had said.
This was different from stealthily raising a kitten in a cardboard box and keeping it a secret from your parents.
Taking care of a person in secret over a period of thirty years would be an incalculably massive task...
"......The legend of Father\'s gold started before he gained possession of Rokkenjima.
 That would mean he and his mistress go back over thirty years..."
"How old would that make her?
 In the worst case, she could be as old as us or older, right?"
"...By that age, the body starts to break down.
 I don\'t care what the mansion\'s like, I couldn\'t call livin\' in a place where people\'s eyes can\'t reach, almost as though she were under house arrest, agreeable..."
"That\'s right.
 ...If what Father told us about {f:5:Beatrice} is true, then that relationship has lasted for over thirty years."
"......She might have been a charming young woman at the time, but it is probably appropriate to think that she\'s now an old bag like us.
 I can easily imagine that, given the contents of that letter."
"You should talk.
 *cackle*cackle*."
Krauss laughed, as though blind to his own shortcomings.
Of course, Eva was offended, but she didn\'t strike back.
"Quit it, Aniki.
 ......So if everything we imagine is true, she should want to throw out her chest with pride and join in on Dad\'s inheritance problem."
"I mean, ...there\'s a good chance that this love was mutual, unlike with Mom.
 She might have been aware she was his mistress, and yet at the same time, felt a kind of pride as his real wife."
".........That is an insult to Mother."
"Yeah, sorry.
 ...But everyone knows it was a political marriage decided by his elder relatives.
 ...Because of that, we can be sure that it wouldn\'t be odd for Dad to have a mistress."
The family sank after the Great Kanto Earthquake, and Kinzo was set up as the Ushiromiya family head against his will.
However, in the beginning, he was influenced strongly by the elder relatives, who treated him like a puppet while they pulled the strings.
He wasn\'t permitted to decide anything by himself, not even his marriage partner...
......And by his meeting with the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice} in those unhappy days,
 Kinzo\'s Legend of the Gold was quickly embellished into something dramatic.
In other words,
 ...it could mean...
 that Kinzo met with a woman he really did love.
If she also knew his whole story,
 then even if they weren\'t marriage partners, it wouldn\'t have been odd for her to consider herself his true wife, inside her heart.
...And now, the person registered as his true wife was already dead...
"...In which case, she might be fully intending to encroach on not just the rights to his assets, but the battle over the headship as well."
".........I see.
 I\'m starting to see the purpose of this letter.
 The headship to the one who solves the epitaph\'s riddle...
 So that\'s what it means."
"Even if that mistress obtained a rank within the Ushiromiya family, since she is not a direct relative of Father, she would be inferior to even the children.
 ...In other words, she would be right below Rosa in rank.
 That\'s not a good position to join the battle for the headship."
"So that\'s it.
 ...If someone can solve the witch\'s riddle, they will receive the headship regardless of rank.
 In other words, it is the most advantageous condition that {f:5:Beatrice} could get, since she had no chance whatsoever."
The revival of the Ushiromiya family had been made possible by the gold {f:5:Beatrice} had bestowed.
 ...In other words, the credit belonged to her.
She had built that wealth together with Kinzo, so it was natural that she would have thought of herself as the one who should inherit it...
 It would also be natural for her to despise the thought of giving a single cent to the children of the wife Kinzo had never loved.
"H‐how incredibly impertinent...!
 Even if this mistress actually existed, for her to fight over the rights to the head\'s inheritance would be an outrageous action far above her place!
 What disregard for her own place...!"
Natsuhi turned red, her fist quivering.
...There were also complicated circumstances behind her entry into the Ushiromiya register.
{n}Those who knew that understood more or less why she was so angry for the sake of Kinzo\'s dead wife.
"...Well, thanks to her outrageous action, we now all have an even chance, right?"
"And also, Father has given that outrageous action his silent approval.
 ......Will the person who succeeds the Ushiromiya family be his mistress {f:5:Beatrice}, or one of us, who he may not love, but who do carry his blood?
 Maybe he wants to make us struggle over that to see who is worthy."
As Eva giggled roguishly, Krauss shrugged his shoulders and looked away.
"......However, since it was the other party that brought up this condition,
 I wonder if that means that the other party has a significant advantage."
"Tha‐that\'s a point, too.
 ...In the first place, if {f:5:Beatrice} meant that letter literally, then she\'s Father\'s alchemist.
 In other words, she\'s the manager of his gold.
 It wouldn\'t be strange at all if she knew where it was hidden, would it?!"
"What a bad joke this is.
 It\'s like she\'s givin\' us a riddle that she knows the answer to!
 She\'ll probably show up rudely, say "hey, here\'s the answer, I\'ll take the headship now",
 and snatch everythin\' away from us!"
"........................
 ...That\'s right.
 The one who sets a riddle always knows the answer.
 There\'s a good chance that this is all a trap to steal everything from us."
"...If you think about it like that, don\'t you start to doubt whether she really has the gold in the first place?
 Why would she tell us about it?
 All she\'d have to do would be stay silent and embezzle it."
"You\'re right.
 ...Doesn\'t make much sense."
Indeed, it was just as they said.
If the epitaph showed the way to where the gold was hidden, why would she challenge them to try to solve it?
 If they actually did solve it, wouldn\'t the gold all be stolen...?
Could it be that this person was trying to stir the siblings up so that they tried to solve the epitaph,
 and would then snatch it up before they did solve it...?
 That was a very reasonable guess.
"............No,
 if you flip over the chessboard, there might be a pretty good chance that they actually do have the gold."
"How can you be so certain?"
"...Wait, Aneki.
 ......Kyrie, please keep talking.
 Why do you think that?"
"After all, do they really think that just telling us the answer to the riddle in the witch\'s epitaph,
 would seriously be enough for us to hand over the headship of the Ushiromiya family?
 That we\'d be so impressed at the answer to the riddle that we\'d just give up?"
"......Well,
 ......that\'s true.
 If they think we\'d just give up after bein\' told the answer to the riddle,
 that we\'d just say "here you go" and hand it over, they\'ve got another thing comin\'."
"Of course.
 The headship of the Ushiromiya family is not something that can be handed over so easily!"
"That\'s it exactly.
 No matter how one‐sided a game {f:5:Beatrice} proposes, and even if she splendidly shows us the answer,
 there\'s no way that we\'ll obediently hand over the headship."
"......In other words, unless there is something that forcibly compels us to play this game under fair conditions,
 this game won\'t function as a game."
"That\'s right.
 ......Unless the losers are {i:forcibly compelled} to hand over the headship, the game doesn\'t work."
"And what would this compelling force be?
 Would they bind us in chains and threaten us into handing over the headship?"
".........I see.
 I get it.
 ......They would just have to do something which would make us willingly give up the headship.
 I see.
 ...Then, yes, certainly, {f:5:Beatrice} would have to be in possession of the ten tons of gold...!"
"R‐right, I get it too!
 In other words, ...it\'s a trade, right?!"
"Huh?
 Wh‐what do you mean...?
 A trade?
 Trade what?!"
"The Ushiromiya family headship for the hidden gold.
 ...{f:5:Beatrice} surely plans to tell us the location of the ten tons of gold, and use that as a bribe to gain the Ushiromiya family headship."
"R‐ridiculous!!"
"They want to trade the succession to the glorious Ushiromiya family for...m‐money?!
 Blasphemy!!
 Blasphemy against the Ushiromiya family!!"
"......Listen without getting mad.
 ...About how much wealth does this glorious Ushiromiya family have right now?
 Are we really that affluent?"
"Th‐the definition of affluence is not dependent on property.
 It is about heart!
 Of what relevance is our financial situation to—"
Krauss interrupted Natsuhi as she started to go on emotionally.
In this situation, the more she went on and on emotionally, the worse it would actually sound for them.
".........Myself aside, I have heard that the rest of you are in pretty unfavorable situations right now."
"Ohhh, really?
 I\'ve heard that your financial situation is extremely unfavorable, actually?"
"Repeatedly exchanging collateral for new money to gamble with.
 Repeatedly dabbling in gamble after gamble, unable to accept your losses.
 ...If you want to talk about our state of affairs, not one of us here is as impoverished as you, Nii‐san."
"How much have you lost, Nii‐san?
 You have no talent!"
"W‐who are you saying has no talent?!!
 And impoverished, you say?!!"
Natsuhi became indignant once again, but Krauss raised his hand again and interrupted her.
"......It seems you are making a small mistake.
 Business is not something that can be judged based simply on progress.
 When someone conducts business with a view to the long‐term as I do,
 it may sometimes appear at a glance that they have suffered some significant short‐term losses."
"Aniki,
 we\'ve been collecting evidence.
 Now is not the time to be putting up a front."
"......So this is what Kyrie is trying to say.
 ......Every last one of us is stuck for money.
 And {f:5:Beatrice} has ten tons of gold."
"......As the only person who knows the location of the ten tons of gold, {f:5:Beatrice} is planning on using it to force us to sell the position of family head.
 ...About how much is ten tons of gold worth?"
"As a rough estimate... 2 billion yen?
 .........No, 20 billion yen.
 If she threw that much our way, we would be jumping with joy to accept her as the successor to the head."
The scene returned to silence.
Even the rain and the wind sounded louder.
 ...That was probably also the sound of the windstorm that disturbed the insides of their minds...
"............Y‐...you must be joking.
 ...The thought that just because she tossed me a little money...
......I\'d give up the family headship to some woman of doubtful origin......"
"Don\'t talk stupid...!
 You weren\'t even going to succeed Father as head in the first place...!
 We have nothin\' to lose and money to gain.
 Sure, we\'ll have to calculate our profit and loss, but it\'s somethin\' worth listenin\' to...!"
They knew that much of the Ushiromiya family assets had been eaten up by Krauss.
The dregs that remained of that inheritance...versus the "compensation for being accepted as the head" that {f:5:Beatrice} would pay.
It was a shame, but honestly, the former was less enticing than the latter.
"...Well, it probably wouldn\'t end up as four equal portions.
 Since Aniki would be giving up his position of successor, his portion would have to be larger.
 ...Makes me feel kinda jealous, you know?"
"................................."
"Dear...!
 The amount of money isn\'t the problem, right?!
 Your cowardly younger siblings are trying to sell the glory of the Ushiromiya family for money!
 Why aren\'t you displaying your dignity as the eldest son?!"
".........Natsuhi.
 Stay quiet for a while."
"Dear?!?!"
"......This is a dizzying proposal.
 ......We were each planning on getting 250 million yen out of Aniki.
 If the witch would treat us with even ten percent of those ten tons...
......ummm—"
"That\'s 2 billion."
"...Yeah.
 That would mean she\'s treating us with ten times our original goal.
 That alone would be more than enough for us.
 ......It\'s not like I have any attachment to the Ushiromiya name.
 I\'d be happy to sell it off..."
"Even if the full ten tons might be a bit much to expect,
 .........I see, it would still be an attractive prospect for us.
 ...We were trying to form an alliance among the siblings to kick this outsider called {f:5:Beatrice} out."
"......But, if this is her plan,
 ......it will tear apart the unity between us.
 ...Yes, by this point we can state it clearly.
 ......The goal of {f:5:Beatrice}\'s letter was to disturb our alliance."
If the three younger siblings, who were never going to have any connection with the succession of the headship in the first place,
 were paid enough money to satisfy them, they would happily accept {f:5:Beatrice} as the next head.
So every obstacle to her headship would be removed except for Krauss.
In that case, the negotiations would be one‐on‐one between her and Krauss.
He tried to look strong, but Krauss\'s financial and political situation was extremely weak.
{n}...He did bluff in front of his siblings, but on the inside, he was probably thinking that it might be alright to enter negotiations depending on the sum of money involved.
In order to bury his losses, Krauss had taken advantage of the fact that Kinzo had shut himself up in his room, and had embezzled Kinzo\'s personal assets.
Therefore, when Kinzo died and the inheritance was distributed, Krauss would be held to account for that.
But if he gave up his seat as the head to {f:5:Beatrice},
 she would also receive the rights to the assets, and as a result, the distribution of the inheritance to the siblings would not occur.
......In other words, Krauss\' embezzlement might not have to be made known to the other siblings...
Of course, the siblings were frightened of Kinzo, but it was doubtful whether they still actually respected him as a father.
By this time, they each had their own families, their own wealth, and their own lives.
If they were paid enough money in exchange for Rokkenjima, the wrecked remains of Kinzo\'s dreams,
 ......there was a significant possibility that they would relinquish the Ushiromiya family name......
In other words, {f:5:Beatrice}\'s victory was already guaranteed in this "game".
Not as the winner of "{f:5:Beatrice}\'s game",
{n}...but as the winner of "Kinzo\'s game".
...Kinzo had put up the epitaph.
{n}And to this day, no one had been able to solve it.
So {f:5:Beatrice} had "solved" it.
In other words, this is less of a game and more like {f:5:Beatrice}\'s declaration of victory...
However, Kyrie still felt something was slightly out of place.
If this was a declaration of victory, {f:5:Beatrice} would only have to display the gold openly, and state that she would buy the family headship.
And yet, even at this late stage, she was explicitly telling the siblings to try to solve the epitaph.
 Why had she set up this "new game", where she agreed to hand over the all of the gold and the right to succeed the head to the person who solved the epitaph?
Kyrie tried flipping over the chessboard several times.
{n}...Searching for the best strategy that might have guided {f:5:Beatrice} to this line of thinking.
...In the end, ...she reached a single conclusion.
"...............Arrogance,
 ...perhaps?
 Or maybe,
 ......she\'s playing......?"
"...What are you talking about?"
"The witch sent us a letter of challenge, telling us to try to solve the epitaph.
 She might be taking us lightly, thinking we could never solve it.
 ......However, there should be at least an extremely small chance that we will solve it."
"After all, we have here four of Father\'s children by blood, right?
 Four people related by blood to the questioner, who, if they tried frantically to work together and avoid having those assets stolen from them,
 might come across the answer of the riddle by chance."
The reason the witch had a superior position on the negotiations compared to the siblings was that only she knew the location of the hidden gold.
But if that hiding place was exposed to someone other than her, the witch\'s superior position would crumble.
"In short, {f:5:Beatrice} gains nothing but risk by writing this witch\'s letter of challenge."
"......Of course, it might have had the effect of splitting apart the siblings\' alliance,
 but if that was her only goal, why would she take this risk, however slight it might be......?
 I think that\'s reckless."
"...But if you keep in mind a certain type of emotion, it becomes possible to understand that risk."
"..................
 ...And you\'re saying that\'s arrogance?"
"Yes, that\'s right.
 ......When people have an overwhelming advantage, they tend to get arrogant.
 And when they do, they sometimes deliberately take on a small risk, to show off that advantage to the losers."
"......A moderate amount of risk adds a little spice to the joy of victory.
 Nothing is as boring as a victory without risk."
"...............I understand that.
 I also like that sort of thing.
 ...I understand well."
"I tried thinking of a few other plausible explanations for the true motive behind {f:5:Beatrice}\'s letter,
 ......but I think that this really might be the truth.
 ......The emotion hidden behind that letter...
......was arrogance."
"............Arrogance."
"She\'s trying to throw her weight around, looking down on us, as if there\'s no way we could figure out such a difficult epitaph.
 ...It might even be possible, if surprising, that the epitaph wasn\'t written by Father, but by her."
"......Fine by me.
 ......Solve the riddle of the epitaph, she says?"
If only I solved it, I would be made the head, right...?
...I\'ll solve it...
 I\'ll accept the witch\'s challenge.
As if my other braindead siblings could solve it.
I\'ll solve it by myself, and then I\'ll prove that I am the one who is fit to succeed the Ushiromiya family......
"I\'ll take that challenge.
 ...I will...
solve the riddle......""...I see...
 So, not a witch, but a mistress by the name of {f:5:Beatrice} did exist on the island..."
"......So there can be more than 18 people!
 Which means I can defeat that line of reasoning which says that, if it was impossible for all 18 people, it must be a crime involving magic.
 ......That\'s some big information."
"Excuse me.
 Battler‐sama, would you care for some black tea and cookies?"
Beato\'s butler, who called himself Ronove, appeared out of nowhere in particular.
Placed upon the silver tray that he held was a plate filled with delicious‐looking, steaming black tea and cookies.
...I really don\'t like this guy\'s smile.
{n}For some reason, it doesn\'t look like a smile used to warmly greet a guest.
{n}It feels like he\'s making fun of me for some reason.
...I don\'t know whether he really takes me for an idiot,
 or whether it\'s just a joke or something, but it\'s really irritating me.
"......I don\'t want any.
 I\'m busy right now.
 Leave me alone."
"Oh, my.
 That is a shame, when the cookies have turned out oh so very delicious.
 Cooked so wonderfully it is a shame to waste them on a simple {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}, truly wonderful cookies."
"I\'ll eat some when I feel like it.
 Set it down somewhere over there and get out of here."
"Will that be acceptable?
 Then I shall do so.
 You may eat them when they get cold and stale, and then regret as much as you like that you did not eat them when they were freshly baked."
".........You really are annoying.
 ...Well, you\'re a lot better than that Beato, who keeps doing that creepy cackle right next to my ear."
"Oh, yes, yes, that is quite true.
 There are times when Milady\'s laughter becomes quite undignified.
 Every time I hear it, I think of my noble rank,
 and struggle to comprehend why I must have such a person as my master.
 Pu ku ku ku..."
"......Man you\'re weird.
 If you don\'t like it, then couldn\'t you just not work for her?"
"To continue serving despite that is furniture\'s joy.
 One could not serve as furniture without such an attitude."
"......Let us set that aside.
 How has the game been proceeding?
 Just now, I believe I heard you say that you had found some good information, and were quite pleased by it.
 Well now, I wonder what your shallow wit has thought up."
As Ronove made fun of me and giggled,
 he followed my earlier words to the letter and placed the black tea and cookies somewhere arbitrary nearby.
"......I imagine it is because you have gained increased confidence in the existence of a 19th person?
 Would you be gracious enough to allow me to hear your opinion?"
"..................
 ......Yeah, sure.
 I\'m just going to say it again in front of Beato anyway.
 No reason to hide it."
"......Alright.
 It looks like there\'s a hidden mansion somewhere on this island, and that Grandfather had his mistress living there.
 In that case, the question that\'s been torturing me, about whether there are 18 or 19 people, can be easily resolved."
"Although you deny witches,
 you hold a double standard by refusing to seek a culprit among the 18, and have driven yourself into a dead‐end."
"...The easiest way to deny the witch would be to doubt one of the 18.
 ......It\'s not so easy for every one of the 18 to have an alibi.
 You always find at least one person with a fragile alibi.
 ......I could probably continue to deny the witch forever if I just used that person as a sacrifice."
"However, I will steadfastly refuse to do that!!
 Yeah, that\'s no good, that\'s no goddamn good at all!
 Every one of those 18 people is either a parent, a relative or a cousin to me!
 And those reliable servants, who are sometimes serious and sometimes funny.
 I won\'t let myself use any one of them as a sacrifice!!"
"In the past, my resolve wavered.
 That\'s how Beato hit me where my heart was weak."
"......Accepting and understanding your own weaknesses.
 That is not something which can often be accomplished.
 Battler‐sama, you are using this theory about a 19th person as a spear.
 ...Or should I say, a shield?"
"In any event, unlike how unprepared you were in the games up until now,
 let us call the fact that you now have a compass bearing on how to fight...a dramatic leap forward.
 With this, you need not doubt any of the 18 you love and respect,
 and can easily suspect a 19th person, and pursue your theory that the culprit is a human."
"That\'s it exactly.
 Like in the first game, when Kanon‐kun was killed in the boiler room,
 ...and a bunch of other places,
 there are countless tricks I can use without hesitation if a 19th person existed."
In the very first game, Kanon‐kun had been killed in the boiler room.
One might think that he was attacked by Kumasawa‐san, who had gone down into the boiler room with him,
 or maybe that someone who had appeared to be dead earlier was actually faking,
 and had ambushed Kanon‐kun in the boiler room.
 Either way, it was a move that forced me to suspect one of the 18.
However, by simply proposing that a 19th person exists,
 there\'s no longer any need to suspect one of the 18 for that murder in the boiler room.
"In short!
 "Impossible for any of the 18 = The culprit is a witch"...
 is an equation that I can now deny."
Using this argument, we can take, for example, the question which has been raised once again in this game,
 "who gave Maria the letter?",
 and come up with an easy explanation.
 Even if all 18 people have alibis,
 I can easily explain everything by saying that a 19th person visited her and gave her the letter.
".........Hmm, hmm.
 I think that is quite a good move.
 How would I strike back?"
"......Battler‐sama, despite your understanding, there are still plenty of weak points.
 Perhaps the "18 people attack" will be an effective move.
 As an attempt to judge how strong your defense is, it may be interesting to attack from that angle again."
"Then how would you do it,
 demon butler...?!"
"......I believe it would be appropriate to attack this 19th piece that you have played.
 Battler‐sama, have you ever met this 19th person?
 May I ask you for some proof that this 19th person exists?"
"How naive.
 Of course, I knew you\'d probably try that move...!"
"My, my.
 Please respond to it."
"Witches and demons and the like...
 There\'s no move more appropriate for you than this one.
 ......And that is—"
"The "Devil\'s Proof"!"
When we humans are accused of something, we always counterattack by saying to show some evidence.
 Because that\'s a human move.
But I\'m fighting with a witch.
{n}I\'m taking part in a battle with someone who isn\'t human!
And some moves exist which can only be used in a game against a witch.
{n}There are cheap moves!
And that\'s what this "Devil\'s Proof" is.
{n}Therefore, evidence is unnecessary!
Let\'s take the assumption that there is a hidden mansion on Rokkenjima separate from the Ushiromiya family mansion,
 and that a woman named {f:5:Beatrice} is living there.
In order to prove this, one must find this mansion and actually bring {f:5:Beatrice} out of it.
That\'s called actual proof in the human world.
However, if we follow the rules of the "Devil\'s Proof", you can\'t disprove that she exists, even if there\'s no evidence that she does.
Because it\'s impossible to prove that something doesn\'t exist.
......That\'s right, this "Devil\'s Proof", which tormented me so much before, I\'ve finally managed to use to my own advantage.
Those guys were always trying to force me to accept the existence of the witch by using the "Devil\'s Proof".
That was because, in response to Beato\'s professions that witches do exist,
 I physically could not offer any proof that "witches don\'t exist".
That is why I have been subjected to this nonsense that witches exist, and why I have been unable to counterattack.
And that\'s why I\'ll flip over the chessboard right now!
If I can\'t disprove that witches exist, then that means,
 if I suggest that a 19th human exists, you can\'t disprove that either.
In other words, the enigmatic mistress in question is craftily hiding herself, so it\'s perfectly natural that you can never find her no matter how hard you look.
So you can\'t say that "The 19th person can\'t be found = The 19th person doesn\'t exist".
Therefore, it is impossible to disprove a 19th person.
{n}Beato used the "Devil\'s Proof" to make denying her existence impossible,
 but this time it\'s become my weapon.
If we can get away with this argument, then never mind a 19th person,
 this island could be full of people we don\'t know about,
 and even if there are ten or a hundred of them hiding, she still can\'t disprove that they exist.
In the last game and the one before that, among the murder scenes that showed up, there were several that were extremely intricate and must have taken a lot of effort to set up.
It\'s very difficult to imagine that a single culprit could have set all of those up.
However, if not just a 19th person, but ten or a hundred people were hidden somewhere, that wouldn\'t be any problem at all.
If they all split up the work, they could handle any job in a short period of time.
Of course, doubts will naturally arise at whether a large group of people like that could sneak around the mansion without being noticed,
 but those are all settled by the "Devil\'s Proof".
Because not seeing or not noticing a hundred people inside the mansion does not disprove that they were there.
Even though I\'m saying it myself, it\'s such a stupid argument that it makes me wanna throw up!
 However, it\'s because it\'s such a dirty‐as‐hell move that makes it the perfect one to use against a witch.
Well, we\'re only imagining here,
 ...but the thought of about a hundred suspicious men wearing goat masks hiding in the shadows......
 That goes beyond "funny", makes me think of cockroaches.
If you see one, it means there\'s a hundred hiding in the shadows.
"......Well, I do think this is a ridiculous argument that\'s horribly twisted.
 If my opponent was human, I\'m sure they\'d yell at me like I was out of my mind."
"......But my opponent is a witch.
 And after all, that is the kind of competition we\'re having, isn\'t it?
 I\'ll use any kind of reckless argument to explain it using humans, and deny the witch!!"
"......Anyway, with this move, I\'ll never again have to doubt any of the 18 who are close to me.
 I will never again repeat the defeat I suffered last time...!!"
"......I see.
 You have learned from your defeat last time.
 That is good.
 It is no surprise that by the third game you have become quite devious."
".........You first strengthen your own defense.
 That is truly a solid first step.
 Quite a spectacular move, I think."
"Well, even if we do assume that there is a 19th person,
 there are still a few tricks left that I can\'t get past no matter how many humans I add, like the number of master keys.
 ...Still, it isn\'t bad as a first step, for the time being."
"This is your trump card, the important piece known as the 19th person.
 ......You countered my move of asking for evidence by using the "Devil\'s Proof".
 ......A good skirmish."
"Although I have no excuse for making moves by myself when Milady is absent,
 .........I find that I too have become slightly interested.
 ...I wonder if you would permit me to make yet another move on Milady\'s behalf?"
"......Go for it.
 I don\'t care if you\'re a witch or a demon, I\'ll take you all on!"
"The move that you made, the "Devil\'s Proof".
 It is a specialty of us demons, but there are also various other moves available to us.
 ......Do you know of a move called "Hempel\'s Raven"?"
"Hempel\'s Raven...??
 What are you talking about?"
"...*cackle*cackle*.
 Ah‐ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hah‐ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hah‐hah‐ha...!"
Just then, ...aah, that laugh, which gets on my nerves every time I hear it, started echoing around.
The room was filled with dazzling golden butterflies, and in the center of that whirlwind, the Golden Witch appeared.
"Why, if it isn\'t Milady.
 Good morning."
"I thought you might be doing something interesting while I was away."
"......‘Hempel\'s Raven’, was it?
 What an amusing and nostalgic move.
 To think the day would come when it would be introduced to Battler.
 It\'s a classic move to use against the "Devil\'s Proof"."
"......Ronove, I will make this move.
 Do not get in the way of my fun."
"So you\'ve finally shown up, you guffawing witch.
 I see you still have that undignified laugh.
 ......This guy was talking behind your back just now, telling me about how your laughing lacks class.
 Right?"
"I am offended.
 Is that true?"
"By no means.
 I have only words of the highest heartfelt respect for Milady;
 why would I speak such gossip?"
"...I can\'t believe you can say that so brazenly.
 Doesn\'t look like we\'ll be getting along well together..."
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*.
 Well, that is fine.
 Let us return to the conversation.
 "Hempel\'s Raven" is used to show proof using the contrapositive."
"......Essentially, it is a move like this:
 What must you do to prove that ravens are black?"
"Huh?
 What are you talking about??
 Prove that ravens are black...
 ...Wouldn\'t you just have to catch the ravens and check to see if they\'re black?"
"That is right.
 You must simply prove that "if it is a raven, it is black".
 And do you see that, if you prove that "if a bird is not black, it is not a raven", you would reach the same argument?"
"If you go throughout the world and examine all birds that are not ravens, and prove that none of them are black,
 then as a result, you can claim that "therefore, birds that are black are ravens".
 This is called an argument by the contrapositive.
 ...Is that difficult for you?"
"Yeah, no kidding.
 ...I have no idea what you\'re saying."
"Battler‐sama.
 What about this example?
 Let us say that you have two boxes, and one of them is the winner, with a cookie inside.
 Of course, the other one is the loser, and is empty."
For example, let us say that we have two boxes here,
 one being the winner with a cookie inside, and the other being the loser, which is empty.
Now, it holds that "if there is a cookie inside, it is the winner",
 and at the same time, it also holds that "if it is not the winner, there is no cookie inside".
When such a relationship exists, we call the latter the contrapositive...
When "if A then B" is true, then at the same time, "if not B then not A" is also true.
"...Well, that\'s obvious.
 If the one you picked was the loser, then you would automatically know that the other one was the winner."
"...In other words, if you choose the box at random, whether it\'s the winner or the loser,
 you\'ll be able to figure out which box has the cookie in it after your first move."
"That is correct.
 If the cookie is in the box you open, then the "Devil\'s Proof" is satisfied.
 You can prove directly that "this box is the winner = this box has a cookie in it"."
"However, if the box that you open is empty, then the reverse, "Hempel\'s Raven", is satisfied.
 Because then, it holds that "this box does not have a cookie in it = this box is not the winner"."
"And that means, as long as we accept the premise that there are no more than two boxes,
 the contrapositive shows that the other box is automatically the winner."
"......Well, I think I\'m starting to see your reasoning.
 Only poison can stop poison, and only twisted logic can stop twisted logic."
"...Then what?
 How does that overturn my claim that "no doubt there is a 19th human hidden on this island,
 so even if all of the 18 people have alibis,
 that does not amount to an acceptance of witches"......?"
"Very well.
 I will tell you my move.
 First of all, you are stating that "if the culprit is not among the 18, then the culprit is a 19th person"."
"*cackle*cackle*!
 ...So if you use the contrapositive, it ends up like this.
 In short, "if the culprit is not a 19th person, then the culprit is one of the 18"!"
"Whaah?!
 What the, what does that mean?!"
"All I have done is turn your move on its head.
 It shouldn\'t be that difficult to understand.
 Ronove, explain.
 It seems your cookie‐in‐a‐box analogy from before will be easy for Battler to understand."
"Then forgive my presumption.
 Allow me to explain using my earlier example once more."
Allow me to repeat once more my earlier story,
 about two treasure chests, one of which has a cookie in it.
In this situation, one of the boxes represents "the 18 people", and the other box represents "the 19th person".
So the cookie would represent the "culprit".
Battler‐sama, you open the 18 box.
{n}Because the cookie is not there,
 you have proven from the opposite direction that "therefore, the cookie is in the 19 box".
In that case, if we reverse things further, we can also say the following.
Namely, if it was first shown that the 19 box was empty,
 it would prove in just the same way that "the cookie is in the 18 box".
Battler‐sama, this move you played in order to avoid having to doubt any of the 18,
 has in fact been used against you to launch the "18 person attack"...!"
"......Huh,
 ......what did you say........."
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!
 If I go first and prove that the inside of the 19 box is empty,
 automatically,
 you will be forced to accept that the cookie is in the 18 box.
 All you have done is say this the other way around, you see?"
"So, ......that move that I was so confident in, ...was actually a double‐edged sword?"
"That\'s right.
 Your move to explain everything with a 19th person carries the risk that, if it is thwarted,
 you will be forced to accept that you can only explain things by using the 18."
I see...
 "Hempel\'s Raven".
{n}......So this is a countering technique?!
...Wait, if I really think about it, this countering technique is far more disadvantageous for me than for her.
The problem is in thinking about it like a cookie.
{n}If I imagine that just one of the treasure chests is a "losing" chest with a bomb in it, I can begin to understand it quite well.
And if I think of it not as two treasure chests,
 but as 18, one for each person, plus one more for the 19th person,
 for a total of 19 boxes, it gets even easier to understand.
First of all, one of the premises established by the human culprit theory was that the bomb would definitely be in one of those boxes.
Because I hadn\'t wanted to place that bomb in any of the 18\'s boxes, I had used the "Devil\'s Proof",
 and created the 19th box so that I could throw the bomb in there.
 ......That much was alright.
But Beato had struck back like this:
If, then, the 19th box was empty inside,
 that would automatically mean that the bomb was set in one of the other 18 boxes.
If I could examine the contents of each of the 18\'s boxes,
 and show that the bomb was not in any one of those boxes,
 I would be able to safely show that the 18 people were innocent.
If that was possible, I would be feeling confident!
However, in reality, that\'s as close as you can get to impossible.
The police wouldn\'t come here in this typhoon.
{n}There would be no scientific investigations, no autopsies, no nothing.
{n}In short, I can\'t show anything decisively!
It\'s impossible for me to find any proof other than simply gulping down whatever alibis each of the 18 give.
In that case, I have to confirm their innocence both personally and perfectly.
Like staying with someone the whole time, never letting them out of my sight for a second.
If I do that, I can probably be sure of that person\'s innocence,
 and that the bomb is not in that box.
...However, in reality, something like that is impossible!
{n}In other words, I have to expend an incredible effort just to check the contents of one box.
And there are 18 of them!
 In other words, unless I bind all 18 of them in chains and watch over them,
 it\'s impossible to prove that all of them have empty boxes.
However, Beato only has to open one box, the 19th box,
 and show that it is empty, to prove that the bomb is in one of the other 18 boxes.
 (Furthermore, there\'s no need for her to show {i:which} of the 18 boxes has the bomb!)
I have 18 times more work to do to explain my pet theory than Beato does for hers......
"Just as you know from the "Devil\'s Proof",
 there are many cases in this world where refuting something would take a vast amount of effort that is impossible in practice."
"However, "Hempel\'s Raven" turns that problem around, and makes it possible to prove things easily!"
"By using "Hempel\'s Raven", various reckless arguments become possible to prove."
"......For example, let us say that I make the proposition "All humans except me are foolish".
 Normally, in order to prove this, I would have to examine all of humanity except myself and show that they are all foolish."
"...However, in reality, it would be impossible to investigate billions of people.
 It is exactly the same kind of effort you would need to open all 18 boxes."
"*cackle*cackle*!
 However, by using "Hempel\'s Raven", the contrapositive of that proposition would change it as follows."
"Essentially, take this "All humans except me are foolish", and to use your style of phrase,
 flip over the chessboard, and you merely need prove that "not foolish = me".
 ......And what do you think that means?"
"*cackle*cackle*!
 As soon as I know the fact that "I am wise",
 I finish proving in an instant that every one of the billions of people in the human race is foolish.
 In less than a second, I can finish proving that the entire human race is more foolish than me!!"
"It\'s the strongest and fastest QED in the world.
 This...
is "Hempel\'s Raven"!"
"Wha‐.........what a ridiculous argument.........!!!"
"It is a very, very convenient move.
 Not only demons, but gods also use it.
 When you propose "blessed = God\'s servant",
 the contrapositive is "if a human is not a servant of God, then he must not be blessed"."
"So in order for servants of God to prove that they are granted fortune by their divine protection,
 they only have to prove that those who don\'t receive that divine protection suffer misfortune."
".........Therefore,
 by bringing misfortune down upon those people who don\'t believe in their own god, they prove their own blessedness."
"It takes an enormous cost to give humans happiness.
 ...However, the necessary cost to bring humans misfortune is much cheaper."
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*.
 So by using "Hempel\'s Raven", gods can actually give believers the joy of divine protection at the lowest cost."
"Y‐......you demon.
 It\'s a demon\'s argument...
 ...That\'s messed up...!!!"
"It seems that we\'ve gone off‐topic.
 Let us return to it."
"I have finished describing the move for my counterattack.
 ......The counterattack to your claim that "a 19th person is the culprit; therefore, the 18 are innocent and the witch doesn\'t exist" is:
 "In that case, if I can prove that the culprit is not some 19th person,
 do we agree that the culprit must either be one of the 18, or a witch?".
 I await your answer."
For a while, I just stood there, shocked, completely forgetting to close my mouth...
Just when I\'d thought that I\'d got my own back on them by using their favorite move against them,
 the counterattack to that had been this reckless argument that I could not even have begun to imagine...!
Was it really...impossible...?!
To continue denying the witch on an island with no more than 18 people,
 and yet still believe in the innocence of those 18 people...
 .........Was that just a delusion?!
 Was I just trying to escape reality?!
Not yet...
 ......Don\'t give up this struggle yet.
Who cares about "Whoever\'s Raven"?
{n}They\'re just trying to speak in riddles by bringing up some weird bits of trivia...
I had used the "Devil\'s Proof".
{n}Don\'t feel doubt in something once you\'ve used it.
{n}Believe in the spear you\'ve lunged forward with.
Apply even more force......and gouge it in......!
"......The game is still in the opening.
 Do you already intend to spend this long thinking?"
"........................
 Ah,
 ......wait a sec,
 I want to be sure."
"While yes, I did use the phrasing of a "19th person" to make it easy to understand,
 if I can use the "Devil\'s Proof" to raise the number of people above 18,
 then what I mean is an unspecified large number of extra people—you don\'t know if it\'s ten or a hundred."
"{i:Always one more than you assume}.
 ...Understand?"
She had returned my twisted logic with something even more twisted.
{n}So the only thing that could counter that would be even crazier twisted logic...!
"Hmm, I see.
 .........Even if I somehow prove an alibi for the 19th person,
 as soon as I do, you will think up a 20th person, and claim that they are the culprit.
 By repeating this infinitely, you would make it so I kept searching for their alibis for all eternity."
"......I see, I see, *cackle*cackle*!
 Just like a demon king summoning a plague of locusts.
 I wouldn\'t expect anything less from Kinzo\'s grandchild.
 It looks like you have been gifted with a talent in summoning."
"......In short!
 It is impossible to continually prove an alibi for the "X" existing outside of the first 18!
 ......How do you like that, Beato...?!
 Now that I know we\'re having a battle with twisted logic, I won\'t lose!"
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!
 How foolish...
 Who do you think I am?
 I am the Endless Witch, the Infinite Witch!
 For you to challenge me at infinity is absurd.
 Having control over infinity means also that I am able to kill infinity."
"......When your 19th person folds, you will call a 20th,
 and when your 20th person folds, you will call a 21st,
 and when your 21st person folds and your 22nd person folds,
 you will call a 23rd, a 34th, a 64358223579673204th,
 you think you can trifle with me for all eternity?!"
"I laugh at "infinite regress",
 the {i:infinite} doesn\'t affect me!!"
"Hoh, well then, how will you kill my "infinity"? Just try and show me!!"
"
{p:1:I have the power to speak the truth in red}!!!"
".....................!!
 .........Here it comes............"
"When I speak in red, it contains absolutely no illusions.
 If I say once in red that there are no more than 100 people on this island,
 you will no longer be permitted to create a 101st person."
"*cackle*cackle*!
 Come now, Battlerrr.
 What truth shall I tell in red this time?
 Where shall I strike for the kill and force you into hopelessness?
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*!
 Come, show me your usual frightened face......"
".............................."
"..................What?"
"......Ihihihihi."
"...Why...are you laughing...?"
I wonder what kind of creepy look I had on my face as I laughed right then.
{n}That red sure is scary.
 ...Every time it jumps out, I\'m driven into the depths of hopelessness.
But......I had already realized it.
{n}...There was no need to be unnecessarily afraid of the red.
".........You\'ve brought out your secret weapon again.
 So...?
 What and how will the great {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama speak in red this time?"
"......Hoh.
 What do you mean by this?
 Suddenly looking so relaxed..."
"Sorry, but I\'ve been waiting for you to take out that blood‐red treasured sword.
 ......Let\'s see, what will you proclaim in red this time?"
"You aren\'t going to say "the culprit was one of the 18", are you?
 Let me warn you, that would be self‐destruction, remember?
 That would be the same as throwing away your own witch theory yourself.
 A complete resignation."
That\'s right.
 The red isn\'t always necessarily to Beato\'s advantage.
 On the contrary, if she used it the wrong way, it\'s dangerous enough that she could bring about her own death.
 If she used it carelessly and said something which ended up denying herself, that would be exactly the same thing as self‐destructing.
"Of course,
 it would also be sad and difficult for me to accept if you told me in red that one of the 18 was the culprit.
 ......No matter who the culprit actually was, it would surely bring me some tough emotions..."
"But before that, it would mean your defeat!
 Saying in red that the culprit is a human is equivalent to your proclamation of resignation!!
 If you want to strike me a blow so badly you\'re prepared to die at the same time, I think that\'s a pretty interesting move.
 However, this battle will end in my victory!!"
{f:5:Beatrice}\'s red was truly her secret weapon, her treasured blade.
 The things she spoke in red would become solidified as the truth, and no amount of evidence or counterarguments could change them.
They had cut me down to size many times now, rending in two any supports my heart had to lean on.
However, if she used it carelessly, then I could also find a little information about the truth.
...In the last game, especially during the chapel\'s locked room trick, I had taken advantage of that,
 and had once closed her in almost completely.
But she was also pretty sly.
 She had learned from experience, and since then, had started using discretion in the timing of the red...
This feeling of tension was almost literally like a battle with real swords.
...This was a battle of high intelligence.
{n}......No, not of intelligence.
{n}It really was twisted logic.
This was the world\'s craziest and worst battle of twisted logic...!!
"So, now it\'s your move.
 ......That\'s right.
 To use your "Hempel\'s Raven",
 first, you\'ll have to confirm in red how many humans there are other than the 18."
"And after that, if you proclaim in red that none of the people in that group are the culprit,
 ......that\'s right, that might be a fatal wound to me."
".........I\'m surprised that you no longer have even an atom of fear for that red which you feared so much...
 You\'re quite sturdy."
"Unsheathe it.
 Your treasured blade.
 ......A single perfect swing, and you might be able to break me this time, who knows...?"
"......*cackle*cackle*cackle*.
 ...Interesting.
 I wouldn\'t have it any other way..."
Agitate her.
 Provoke her.
{n}Drive her into a corner to make her speak in red...
Of course her red has always cut right through my only threads of hope.
 But......don\'t be afraid of that.
On this island overcome with falsehoods and illusions, the only thing I can trust...
is the information that she speaks in red.
It is my only way across the chasm of Hell.
 Just a single tightrope.
Her merciless blood‐red blade is the only way I can survive.
...This isn\'t just walking on a tightrope, it\'s literally like walking on the edge of a blade...
Of course I\'m afraid.
 In terms of her contrapositive, my victory condition—the denial of the witch—meant that the culprit was a human.
But I didn\'t want to search for the culprit amid the 18.
...Therefore, I held on to a weak point, since I had to deny the witch and the 18 at the same time.
 Since I had been unable to understand that last time, that was where she had hit me, leaving me tattered and defeated.
......But that\'s alright.
{n}Let her hit me.
 Let her attack.
 No problem...
Someone said it once in an old sword‐fighting movie.
{n}That "a good fortress has one, and only one, intentionally weak point".
The enemy would gather there.
 They would be lured there.
{n}And that would be where the actual battle took place.
...As long as I understand my weak points,
 and as long as she wants to attack those weak points,
 ......it\'s as if I\'ve induced her to attack there...
Carefully judge the distance from your enemy, ...and retreat step by step.
 Make them draw their sword first.
The more she recklessly flourishes that red, the more chances I\'ll have to strike back.
Don\'t be afraid of the red.
{n}Keep the pressure on, so that she is forced to refute with the red......!
No matter how oppressively she speaks in red,
 ......yes, that red itself is the same as fresh blood spurting from her wounds.
"Come on.
 ...What\'s wrong?
 ......First of all, why don\'t you tell me in red how many people are on this island total?
 If you don\'t, your raven can\'t cut me up......!"
".....................Hmph.
 ...How surprising that you can be this desperate and yet this difficult.
 ...One cannot make light of someone putting their life on the line, no matter what the era."
"......It\'s no surprise you\'re Kinzo\'s grandchild.
 The more cornered you are,
 ............the bolder you become!"
"...Ihihihi..."
Ronove cleared his throat.
"You appear to be at a standstill.
 That black tea I worked so hard to make is getting cold,
 Milady."
".........kh."
Ronove, who was supposed to be her ally, roguishly rushed her next move.
Beato smiled back, probably intending to demonstrate that she was still relaxed, ......but she couldn\'t hide the sweat building up on her forehead.
By now she had completely lost that relaxedness which had allowed her to turn her nose up at her worthless opponent.
Of course, she probably wasn\'t really cornered by something like this.
 ...She was just...being cautious.
Until now, I had been inexperienced.
{n}I didn\'t have a good grasp on how to fight, and I was underpowered as an opponent.
However, now that we had reached the third game, she realized that I was starting to become skilled,
 and she had grown more cautious, thinking every move over carefully......
Sure, that\'s just fine, {f:5:Beatrice}.
{n}And sorry to have kept you waiting.
{n}Are you happy now...?
"......Now things are starting to get interesting, right......?
 Hihihihi!"
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!
 ...Battleeeeerrrrr......"
"This isn\'t going anywhere...
 Then, should I just dive right in and go with the usual?"
"......Hoh.
 The usual, you say.
 ...Then by all means.
 If I don\'t hear that, I guess I just won\'t get the sense that we\'ve started..."
The first move was mine......
"Here I come, Beato."
"Repetition requested.
 ......‘There are only 18 people on this island’."
"....................."
"...If I hear you say this in red, I will have no choice but to doubt one of the 18.
 ......Since it could no longer be the work of a 19th person, all doors will be closed to me."
".........But I believe that the culprit is definitely not one of the 18!
 There\'s no way that any of those 18 could commit such brutal murders...!!"
"....................."
"I\'ll say it again.
 Repetition requested!
 "There are only 18 people on this island"."
"..............................
 .........I decline.
 I won\'t say why."
Whew...!
 I had avoided what would have been the worst red for me.
If she had repeated that,
 I would have been faced with those two worst choices of accepting the witch or suspecting one of the 18,
 like last time all over again...
But Beato had not proclaimed my ultimate and greatest weakness in red.
She had declined to repeat it—even though there was no reason why she shouldn\'t have struck—even though it was a weakness she should have been drooling at.
She hadn\'t sliced me up with red by using that move, which should have been as good as forking a rook and the king...!
......This was a big sign of my advantage.
That\'s right.
 The culprit isn\'t one of the 18 people.
{n}I won\'t doubt anyone...!
And since the culprit isn\'t a witch either,
 .........it means that a 19th person exists on this island.
And that\'s you.
A person who, as Grandfather\'s mistress of thirty years,
 has been living secretly in a hidden mansion in the forest for a long, long time.
The {i:human} {f:5:Beatrice}.........!!
"That\'s right.
 You aren\'t a witch or anything like it.
 ......You\'re just a human...who\'s been living on this island in hiding for several decades...!"
".........*cackle*cackle*.
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*...
 ...Did you just call me, the Endless Witch who has lived for over one thousand years, a mere human?
 ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"
For a while, {f:5:Beatrice} continued to laugh unpleasantly, gloating or maybe spiteful.
"...Are you ready? I\'ll keep going.
 ...Again, repetition requested."
"‘There are at least 19 people on this island’!"
".............................."
{f:5:Beatrice} fell silent once again.
The feeling that confirming the number of humans on this island...
might possibly stand to give her some large disadvantage,
 was probably making her extremely cautious.
The red had already become a foothold for my counterattack.
 With that in mind, the red had become a risk for the witch.
But if she couldn\'t repeat this, her "Hempel\'s Raven" wouldn\'t work.
In order to break my "Devil\'s Proof",
 first, the existence of and number of people outside the 18...
needed to be confirmed in red.
That\'s right.
 She couldn\'t break the existence of a 19th person unless she used red.
I had {i:closed Beato in}, giving her no choice but to speak in red...!
There really was...
.........a way to fight,
 ......in this witch\'s game!
"It\'s alright to decline.
 ...If you can\'t say it in red, then that will mean the total number of people on this island will be 18+X."
"......That X is a pretty huge piece to allow me to have on the first move, isn\'t it?
 After all, from then on, all of the tricks with the basis "it was impossible for any of the 18"...
will become explainable with a human X outside of the 18 people.
 ......This is a huge piece that can break open any locked room hinging on everyone having an alibi...!"
It was just like...
a bishop in chess, which can cut a thin line through enemy forces as long as there\'s a slight gap.
 It only exerts an effect over squares of the same color, but it has a great ability to control the board.
"..............................
 ..................kh."
It looked like Beato also well understood her current plight.
She couldn\'t just let such an important piece go, especially this close to the beginning of the game...
If she pulled out her red treasured sword, it wouldn\'t be that difficult to save that piece.
......But Beato was completely aware that I was expecting it.
 She was afraid that a careless red truth might end up strangling her own neck...!
Because, ...in the first place, a witch was something which should be {i:denied} in red.
Believe.
 Don\'t doubt!
 Witches don\'t exist!
{n}Something like that can\'t exist in this world.
They can only exist in the cracks in reality.
...They are a fragile existence, curled up in these cracks, frantically trying to protect themselves from the brutal winds of truth,
 and they can only barely exist like a mirage by surviving on falsehoods and fantasy.
In other words, the red, which only witches can use, is the very reality by which they risk denying themselves.
......The more they brandish their red words...
the more they begin to lose, bit by bit, that crack in reality inside which they can endure.
That is why they don\'t want, through the red,
 ......to carelessly lose that crack in reality which is based on fuzzy information, or in other words, fantasy.
Because they understand that they would be gradually cornering themselves.
Of course, she would never admit it.
Because, if she did,
 it would be the same as admitting that she is something that can\'t exist in this world, like an imaginary number.
Don\'t be afraid.
 Stay strong...!
{n}She knows this deep down, and better than anyone.
That her red treasured sword can\'t easily be used without considerable resolve...!
"...What\'s wrong.
 I\'ll say it again.
 ......Repetition requested!"
"‘There are at least 19 people on this island’!"
"........................
 ......Hmh.
 ...I decline."
At the end of a long, long time spent deliberating,
 ......letting a single deep breath escape, she quietly proclaimed her refusal.
......I had thought that she\'d use it.
But Beato refused to speak in red, even though it would cost her victory in the opening part of the game.
"You declined, yes......?
 Which means that, from now on,
 I can create as many fictional character Xs outside of the 18 as I want...?"
"Do as you wish.
 ...I have declined your repetition.
 Isn\'t that enough for now?
 ......The reason I declined was...
......
 ...No, I will not reveal that for now.
 You will know soon in any case."
"...Ihihi.
 Still acting tough, I see..."
"......Red that I deliberately don\'t use is in itself a fitting use of red.
 You called it my red treasured sword.
 A pleasant analogy.
 I will use it too.
 ......A treasured sword is at its best when it is sheathed.
 In fact, there are times it can instill even more fear because it is sheathed."
"That\'s right.
 ...As I fight, I always have to keep in mind when you might turn everything over with those red words.
 It\'s some pretty serious pressure."
"......And there are times when having a repetition declined makes things harder for me.
 ...Those times, I can\'t tell whether you can\'t repeat because my guess was right,
 or whether you\'re just misleading me and letting me think whatever I want."
"...In that sense, yes, I see.
 A sheathed treasured sword."
"............What does it matter?
 If I\'m going to push you off a cliff anyway, I might as well let you climb a little higher first.
 ...We have still barely begun.
 Much is left to come..."
"I\'ll resign from this challenge.
 ...Go and get drunk on your faint victory for now.
 ......Only for now."
That bitter comment did, in fact, appear to have marked the end of the game\'s opening battle.
 Even so, I couldn\'t relax my guard at all.
...I was unable to relax my feeling of tension until I was greeted by the sound of Ronove\'s applause...
"......Spectacular, Battler‐sama.
 I suppose we could say that this game has started with at least the opening unfolding to your advantage?"
"No idea...
 I still don\'t know whether this piece was something I tore from her with my own hands,
 or whether she guided me into taking it."
"......After all, knowing you...
you probably know that I\'m being led into a trap, and that clapping is just a barefaced lie, right...?"
"How could you think that?
 I am innocently celebrating your ability that has enabled you to take one shot at Milady, though granted it is only the opening.
 ...After all, Milady is a person who is quick to become arrogant.
 I believe that a little stimulation such as that makes for a good medicine every once in a while."
"...This butler of yours sure has a vicious tongue..."
"Isn\'t that so?
 Sometimes he enrages even me."
"My, my, how incredibly rude of me."
"Well then, Milady, Battler‐sama.
 Would you care for some more black tea?
 The game has still barely begun.
 Please leave any tea or pastries that might adorn this game to me.
 Please, do not hesitate to advance further in the game."
"I will.
 Let\'s move forward.
 Now is when it really starts."
"............Hmph.
 Very well.
 Let us advance the clock.
 Ronove, black tea, please."
"Certainly.
 What about a cookie?"
"No need.
 Give it to Beelzebub to keep her happy.
 ............Remain silent for now."
While listening to the sound of the demon butler pouring tea, the witch closed her eyes slightly and fell into silence.
......For some time, she was deeply lost in thought, but eventually a roguish glint came into her eyes.
"Very well.
 ............Why don\'t I inform you now why I declined to speak in red for the first move."
"......What...?
 Bring it on.
 Show me what you\'ve got."
"*cackle*cackle*...
 It really is a big piece that you\'d hate to miss."
"......It may be hasty, but allow me to move.
 I won\'t use red, but from here on, Rosa will explain on my behalf.
 Listen."
"Of course, I agree as well.
 You too, right, Rosa?
 ...............Rosa?"
"Huh, ah, sorry...
 M‐me too.
 I agree."
".........What\'s wrong, Rosa‐san.
 ...You\'ve been really quiet for a while now.
 Are you feelin\' sick...?"
From the beginning, Rosa had never been one to willingly cut in on the siblings\' fights.
...But even so, she seemed unmotivated,
 and had said almost nothing at all during this night\'s conference.
The whole time, she had been hanging her head, and appeared to be thinking of something else...
"You\'ve been in a daze for a while now.
 Do you think you can protect the inheritance like that?
 You are also the mother of your child, so get a stronger hold on yourself."
"I, I\'m sorry......"
"I imagine you woke up quite early this morning?
 If you feel sick, you shouldn\'t overdo it."
"......The beds have been prepared in the guest rooms.
 How about taking a rest?
 I will guide you."
"No, ...I\'m fine.
 Thank you."
"...What is it?
 Is there something you\'re worrying about?"
".........No, not really........."
"Are you sure...?
 It feels like your mind has been elsewhere this whole time.
 ...I wonder if that has anything to do with what we\'ve been talking about...?"
At those words, everyone stared at Rosa together.
As if in response, Rosa\'s shoulders quivered.
Apparently Kyrie\'s guess hadn\'t been wrong.
{n}...Nor did Rosa deny it...
"..................No, umm...
 ................................."
She swallowed whatever it was she had been about to say, and went silent again.
By now, even the other siblings were also beginning to realize that something about her demeanor was different from usual...
"What is it?
 ...You\'ve been weird for a while.
 Do you have something on your mind...?"
"All of us\'ve just sworn to remain united, haven\'t we?
 Don\'t be all unfriendly now, worryin\' by yourself.
 Let\'s talk it over."
"......Rosa.
 Tell us."
Pressed by the men one after the other, Rosa made up her mind, and nervously began to open up...
It was almost...
as though she was trying to confess to some modest prank which had inadvertently brought about a serious situation...
such was the atmosphere in the room.
"No, umm......
 ......Th‐this mistress of Grandfather\'s, this {f:5:Beatrice},
 ......is she really, um,
 .........still alive, I was wondering..."
"Huh?
 Obviously she\'s alive.
 She\'s sending letters to us, what more do you want?"
"Whether she\'s healthy or not is a different story though.
 The lovely woman in that portrait must be getting up there in age by now."
"I\'d think she\'s healthy.
 People who are crafty when it comes to money are healthy no matter how old they are!
 Evil plans might even be the best rejuvenating agent.
 Wahahaha."
"......She can\'t be...
......alive."
"Huh?
 ......What did you just say?"
"{f:5:Beatrice} is...
...dead...
 .........I,
 ...I killed her...!"
"Wh‐......what did you say......?!"
"...Wh‐...what do you mean, Rosa...?!"
"B‐but, it\'s not like I was the one who kill—
 ......But, but I was the one that brought her to a place like that!
 ...I really did kill her...
 I tried to make myself believe it was a dream!!"
"......But......it really wasn\'t after all!
 Which means this is......a letter from {f:5:Beatrice}\'s ghost!!
 Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"
It was so sudden that everyone was lost for words.
 Rosa kept on talking, unable to stop, holding her head as her hair flew all about...
"Please, calm yourself...!
 Rosa‐san...!"
"I, I have absolutely no clue what\'s goin\' on...!
 Already dead?
 What do you mean...?!"
"......I think it means two things.
 First, ...its literal meaning.
 ...And second, it substantiates that our earlier guess was correct."
"Which means......
 .........Rosa, ......you have met with {f:5:Beatrice}?"
"I, I\'ve never heard Rosa speak about that once.
 ...Rosa, when was it?
 When could you possibly have met {f:5:Beatrice}?!"
"Long ago!
 Long, long, long ago!!
 We had just moved over to the island and I was young!!
 It wasn\'t my fault, it\'s not like {i:I} killed her...!!
 Uuuuuuuuughhhuuu!!"
"...Calm down!
 Nobody\'s blaming you for anything, alright?
 First, drink some water.
 Okay?
 Natsuhi‐san, the pitcher, please."
"Y‐yes.
 .........Here you go, Rosa‐san.
 Please, calm yourself......"
".........................................."
Until Rosa was able to regain her calm amidst her ragged breathing, ......no one was able to speak a word..."......{f:5:Beatrice}.
 I have been calling to you for a while.
 Did you not hear me...?"
"......Hmm.
 Were you?
 My apologies.
 I was lost in my thoughts.
 Forgive me."
"The weather is pleasant.
 ...I see, I can understand how the weather has stolen your heart.
 Will you drink your black tea here...?"
"...............Who...am I?"
".................................
 ......I will bring some black tea now.
 Wait here for a while."
"Forget about the black tea.
 Talk with me."
"......Very well."
Kinzo had used the excuse of going to bring some black tea to try and interrupt the conversation for the time being.
 ...But his attempt had been very transparent.
I sat in the garden chair, and beckoned Kinzo to do the same.
{n}Kinzo sat down heavily, exaggerating his age.
For a while, we sat, appreciating the silence...
"......Who am I?
 To this day, no one has answered me this question.
 ......For some reason, everyone averts their gaze and evades me."
"........................"
"......I have known you for a long time.
 I think of you as my best friend, even as a father.
 ......That is why I want so much for you to tell me.
 You must know.
 ...Who I am."
"..................
 ............Why do you worry about something like that?
 You are {f:5:Beatrice}.
 The master of this mansion, is that not so?
 ......What more could you want to know?"
"............I do not know."
"What\'s this?
 ......Don\'t you even understand yourself what it is you want to know?
 That is baffling.
 In my younger days, I sometimes found myself wanting to play in the maze of thought that has no exit.
 Maybe that is what your worries are..."
Kinzo laughed as though it was a trivial matter.
 ...However, I couldn\'t help but feel that this behavior was nothing but another attempt to force me to stop my further questioning.
"...........................
 ...Hmph.
 ......So not even you will tell me that...after all."
"There is nothing to tell.
 You are {f:5:Beatrice}.
 Isn\'t that more than enough?"
"......No, that\'s not it.
 ............What I wish to know is not my name.
 It is...
who...
I am."
"......Who am I, what am I?
 ...How long have I been here, ...and how long will I continue my days here?"
"........................
 ...I really should bring some black tea.
 Do you not think it a waste of all this fine weather?"
"................................."
".........What is this all about...?
 Somehow, it looks like the story of your past, right?"
"It appears so.
 ...To think that we would go this far back..."
"Wondering who you were...
 ...It looks like you had some pretty high‐minded worries."
"......That is to be expected.
 At the time, I was unable to understand who I was,
 or why I was alive."
"Well, in puberty,
 everyone is captured by those philosophical worries, wondering what meaning there is to their life, at least once.
 Doesn\'t this just mean that you had this kind of charming period once in your life?"
".....................
 ...I had been in that mansion since the time I was born.
 And I lived only inside the mansion.
 Of course, I was able to go out into the garden, but the area around the mansion was surrounded by a very tall fence, which I was unable to leave through,
 and I would be told severely that I mustn\'t leave."
"......I could walk freely throughout the mansion and the garden,
 but my desire to take just one step outside those of my own accord was never granted."
"...............What do you mean by that?
 ...Are you trying to say that, for as long as you can remember, you were always a bird in a cage?"
"......I thought that was just how things were.
 After all, I had been living like that as far back as I could remember.
 I didn\'t even think to question it."
"What in the world............are you?"
"That\'s it.
 That is what I also hoped to know."
"............Heh.
 I\'m sure you\'ll say something like "I wasn\'t a human, I was a witch", right?"
"No, that\'s not correct.
 Not {i:yet} correct.
 ......Or, should I say, it was {i:once} correct.
 ......I was constructed by Kinzo, a human built by a human.
 ...No, maybe I should call it a cage made of flesh."
"What\'s that supposed to mean...?
 ...This is starting to sound weird."
"......You probably won\'t believe it anyway.
 Listen first.
 .........I was a great witch who had lived for one thousand years.
 But at some time, I was summoned by Kinzo,
 ...and by his hidden arts, I was bound as his prisoner for eternity."
"............Never heard that before.
 From what we hear in the Ushiromiya family, you were summoned by Grandfather,
 made something like a devil\'s contract with him, and gave him the gold."
"Yes.
 That is correct.
 ...Then I was supposed to hide myself until the contract was over.
 But, .........well, it\'s tough being a popular woman.
 .........By some turn of events, Kinzo fell in love with me."
"...Grandfather\'s nearsightedness must have gotten pretty bad.
 With astigmatism too, ihihi.
 To fall in love with you, of all things."
".........Hmph.
 Well, to me it was supremely annoying."
"...However, the power of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s is a frightening thing.
 He exhibited fearsome power and rooted me to this place.
 ...He said I wouldn\'t be freed until I nodded my head in agreement.
 ...Such an overbearing man."
"Isn\'t that awesome.
 Everyone knows Grandfather\'s obsessed with the occult, but...
...who knew he had the power to root down the Great Witch {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama."
"......Heh, ridiculous.
 You think I\'d believe such a weird story?"
"...As I thought, you don\'t believe."
"All I believe is the fact that you lived in this hidden mansion in the middle of the forest.
 You are the 19th person on Rokkenjima, right?!"
"......Indeed.
 Just as you imagine, this is deep in the forest of Rokkenjima.
 A hidden mansion not to be found from the outside world.
 Its name is {ruby:Nine Birds\' Retreat:Kuwadorian}."
"......Come to think of it, I heard that the guesthouse\'s real name was {ruby:Visitor\'s Retreat:Toraian}.
 ...I see, the naming sense is similar.
 ......So, you were Grandfather\'s lover, who lived here in secret.
 Isn\'t that right?!"
"Lover isn\'t the right way to say it.
 ......You should probably call it Kinzo\'s unrequited love.
 I spoke of it just recently, correct?
 He fell in love with me of his own accord.
 He then courted me, but I rejected him."
"......Then, I was shut up in this hidden mansion.
 .........No, I shouldn\'t say that I was shut up in the mansion.
 ......It would be more correct to say that I was shut up in this body."
"............I have no idea what you just said at the end there."
"You will just make fun of it and not listen, right?
 After all, you say that you don\'t believe in witches or magic.
 If you have no ears to hear what I tell you,
 saying it would be the pinnacle of foolishness."
"...........................
 ......I\'ll decide whether I believe or not.
 ...After all, if I don\'t hear it, the story won\'t move on.
 Tell me.
 ...The story of your past."
"Alright.
 .........I refused Kinzo when he courted me, but he was not a man to lose heart just because of that.
 He wanted to get my consent no matter what.
 He shut me up in this mansion, and spent an eternity trying to win my heart."
"...He really is overbearing.
 No one likes a man who can\'t take a hint, right?"
".........*cackle*cackle*.
 Regardless of whether I responded to his courting or not,
 to make a man so desperate for me was...well, as a woman, it wasn\'t unpleasant."
"......However, I never nodded my head.
 I tried what I could to escape his restrictions,
 but that barrier was firm, and I couldn\'t break it."
"......And then?"
"After trying to resist in various ways,
 I eventually reached the conclusion that, to escape from Kinzo\'s barrier, I would have to throw away my body of flesh.
 ......The physical body is a vessel which carries many restrictions in terms of magic."
"Throw away your body of flesh......?
 What\'s that?
 Something like an out‐of‐body experience?"
"Well, if you want to think of it that way.
 However, I am not a spirit.
 Even though I am a witch, in the beginning, I was born with a human\'s body of flesh.
 So for me, throwing away that physical body,
 while it didn\'t mean the same thing as death, did require a corresponding level of resolve."
"So in other words,
 ......you made up your mind that you couldn\'t be released except by suicide, is that what you mean?"
"It wasn\'t suicide.
 It was nothing more than throwing away my body of flesh.
 ......Of course, becoming nothing more than soul is a precarious situation.
 When the soul leaves its body of flesh, it is constantly exposed to the strong winds of the sun.
 It was not easy even for me to maintain myself and avoid being scattered by them."
"It was a final measure that I wanted to avoid if I could.
 However, there was no other way to break through Kinzo\'s barrier."
"......*cackle*, after all, I am a free spirit.
 I couldn\'t stand being kept in a cage until Kinzo\'s life was over."
I couldn\'t understand this story Beato kept going on about, about throwing away her body of flesh,
 as anything more than suicide.
Grandfather persistently courted her, and to escape from that,
 ......she chose her own death...?
"...............So you\'re saying you committed suicide?
 What are you saying?
 Isn\'t that you, sitting carefree there in the garden chair?"
"......That\'s right.
 That is the new cage I was given by Kinzo."
"............Cage?
 You mean this mansion?"
"No.
 I mean my body, relaxing in the garden chair over there.
 .........After I became a soul and tried to escape,
 even then, Kinzo had no intention of allowing me to escape."
"...Yes, indeed, he is a frightening person.
 Normally, seeing the woman of your one‐sided desires take her own life should be enough to bring anyone to their senses, even if their love was a hundred years old.
 ......I suppose it makes him somewhat of a mage after all.
 ......*cackle*."
"Don\'t try to speak in riddles with that incomprehensible witch‐girl talk.
 ...In short, what are you trying to say?"
"That Kinzo didn\'t let me escape even after I became a soul.
 ......Human emotions are terrifying.
 That he would be able to exhibit this much power..."
"Tying down a spirit of the dead...
is not a level readily attained, even for a mage seeking that as his specialty.
 Because I knew that, Kinzo\'s fearful magical power shocked me then for the first time."
"............Then Kinzo seized my soul and brought me back.
 However, a cage to hold a seized soul cannot be made, not from iron nor from lead.
 ......There is but one exception."
"............What?
 You aren\'t going to say it was a magical cage or something, are you?"
"Wrong.
 That body of flesh over there, just like yours or mine.
 ...Only a cage made of flesh and blood can tie a spirit down to this world.
 ......Kinzo shut my soul up once more into a cage of flesh built to be exactly like me."
".....................
 ...So in summary, is it something like this?
 Grandfather persistently courted you, you started to hate it, and you committed suicide,
 but you weren\'t clever enough to finish the job?
 ...Damn, you really took a roundabout way to say something like that."
"No, that\'s wrong.
 My soul was shut up in the seed of a homunculus,
 and I was born out of a test tube."
"Huh?!
 Ridiculous...!
 That\'s goddamn impossible and you know it!"
"Kinzo accomplished even the miracle of creating life.
 And only to shut my soul up in that cage.
 ......That he would show such magical power simply because of his own love...
 A thoroughly terrifying person."
"Aah, okay, it\'s really gotten to the point of ridiculousness now!
 Say whatever you want.
 I won\'t believe a word of it.
 Just do what you like, for hell\'s sake."
"...............mh.
 ...What is this unpleasant attitude?"
"Heh,
 in the beginning, I showed a little interest, thinking there might be some huge hint hidden,
 but the more I hear, the weirder this story starts to get.
 This is supposed to be a game about denying witches,
 but I get the feeling that I\'m suddenly being made to just swallow a witch story."
"Sorry, but I don\'t feel like listening to this any more.
 Just keep rambling on to yourself as much as you want.
 I\'ll just be here digging out some earwax or something."
".....................
 ......Hmph."
When I started showing a cold attitude, Beato acted unusually discouraged.
Of course, her expression was still brazen...
but I had the feeling that I was able to catch a glimpse of loneliness because I hadn\'t found the story of her past interesting,
 in that really easy to understand expression of hers.
......For some reason, that slight reaction made her seem pitiful,
 so even though I kept my couldn\'t‐care‐less attitude, I decided to humor her slightly.
Damn it, even though she\'s an irritating witch, I\'m still weak against her because her chromosomes are XX...
"......Well, I have absolutely no desire to believe you, but,
 ............keep going.
 I\'ll listen to your story in place of cookies."
"So you treat the story of my past like cookies.
 ......You think that if you abuse me like that, I will just casually tell you...?"
After I made fun of her, Beato reacted a little sensitively.
It looked like, even though making fun of people was her specialty, she was horrible at being made fun of by other people.
Just then, my cup of black tea suddenly made a sound, surprising me.
"......Milady\'s soul was seized and breathed into a cage of new life.
 In other words, Milady received life as a human once more."
Before I had realized it, the demon butler had appeared and taken my cup, and was adding more black tea to it.
"Ronove.
 That is enough of that story.
 He says that it is too ridiculous to listen to.
 I now also feel ridiculous and have no intention of speaking."
"Some new cookies are currently being baked.
 I thought that, until then, the story of Milady\'s past would be a perfect substitute.
 Pu ku ku...!"
"I, ...I already said that I\'ve had enough of talking about me!
 You are both unpleasant people.
 I\'m leaving!
 Ronove, leave as soon as you are done serving.
 No idle talking with Battler."
"Certainly.
 I will make an effort."
Beato\'s confusing female short temper took hold of her, and she turned her body into gold butterflies, scattered, and disappeared.
After that, only Ronove and the scent of the black tea were left...
"......I feel kind of bad for making her angry."
"It appears that you are aware of it, so there is nothing more to be said."
"Wait a second.
 Weren\'t you the one that pushed her over the edge?"
"Pu ku ku ku.
 My, whatever could you mean?
 Would you care for some sugar and milk?"
"...Just milk will be fine.
 ............And I also want some cookies."
".........You are aware that baking the cookies will take some more time?"
"There\'s a substitute, you said?"
"......Certainly.
 If you would listen quietly, I will continue the story."
"She said something about a homunculus.
 ...I know a bit about that.
 It\'s that thing, right?
 A manufactured human created with alchemy or something?"
"Yes.
 Milady\'s soul was shut up in a homunculus, and she was revived into this world, receiving life again as a baby.
 ......However, because she was a baby,
 even if Kinzo tried to profess his love to her, it would be useless."
"........................
 .........You aren\'t saying...
......Grandfather shut that baby up in this hidden mansion,
 until it grew to reach the same age?!"
"Yes.
 That is what I am saying.
 However, while her soul was the same, a human spirit receives a strong influence from its vessel.
 Milady lost all of her memories of the past, and grew up as a very normal human girl."
"And you\'re saying......that\'s the Beato sitting in the garden chair?"
"Yes.
 That is correct.
 She grew to be completely identical.
 However, she did not possess her power as a witch.
 ......I must stress that Milady was a human."
"................................."
Beato, who was sitting in the garden chair, looking up at the sky, asked that same question again.
She asked who she was.
...The meaning of those words was finally starting to click.
 She couldn\'t understand why she was living here, all locked up.
Grandfather had seized {f:5:Beatrice}\'s soul, shut it up in a body of flesh,
 and then shut that up in a hidden mansion.
However, since she had lived here since the time she was born, she couldn\'t even understand who she was,
 or why she lived shut up in there...
......W‐...wait, wait.
{n}Who would take such a stupid story seriously?
Why don\'t I change my interpretation?
{n}...Essentially, couldn\'t it be something like this?
Grandfather met {f:5:Beatrice}.
{n}He then fell in love with her and courted her, but she didn\'t nod her head in agreement.
{n}And so he got angry, and shut her up inside this hidden mansion.
{f:5:Beatrice} tried to escape, but no matter what she did, she couldn\'t succeed,
 ......so she finally chose her own death.
......And then, .........hmm.
...Maybe there was a girl that looked just like {f:5:Beatrice}, ...no, a baby.
And Grandfather raised this child with care.
But maybe Grandfather didn\'t view this child as his daughter.
"Shut my soul up once more into a cage of flesh".
Those words probably meant...
...that he didn\'t view this kid as her child, but as her reincarnation.
 Maybe that\'s what it meant.
If you interpret it that way, even a story that weird might make a little sense...
...No no no.
 This might be some bullshit Beato cooked up to confuse me.
As if I could accept any of this...!
{n}In the first place, ...Kuwadorian, was it?
{n}There\'s no proof whatsoever that a hidden mansion actually existed.
Couldn\'t this be something she just fabricated on the spot?
"
{p:1:A hidden mansion called Kuwadorian does exist in the forest of Rokkenjima}.
 That is the place we were just talking about."
".........Huh?
 R‐...red?!"
Ronove used the red to say that Kuwadorian actually existed.
...Did that mean the same thing as the red Beato used?
"Even if I am not much of one, I am a demon all the same.
 ...Please keep this a secret from Milady, yes?"
"...Y‐......yeah!"
Beato, who knew I would try to trip her up, had grown extremely cautious when using red.
To think that Ronove could also use that red...
Of course, it\'s the red of a crafty man.
 I don\'t know how far I can accept it,
 but anyway, I might be able to get some hint out of it......
"So that Beato relaxing in the garden of Kuwadorian, ...and that conversation she had with Grandfather, were the truth?"
"Yes.
 It is the truth.
 In the past,
 {p:1:the pair actually had a conversation like that in this place}."
"Th‐thanks a lot.
 I\'ll ask for some more red.
 She said that she was born from a homunculus,
 but does that kind of unscientific, magical thing actually exist?!"
"I am unable to answer that question.
 The reason is that it would cause a stalemate."
"......A stalemate??
 What do you mean?"
"It\'s a chess term referring to a state in which, similar to a "perpetual check",
 any further progress in a game becomes impossible.
 This is the opposite of an endless repetition of moves,
 and refers to a situation in which all moves disappear, resulting in a kind of deadlock."
"In chess this would lead to a draw, just as if there were a perpetual check.
 ...However, there is no draw in the game between you and Milady.
 Therefore, I am unable to answer in red any question that would bring about a stalemate."
".........You\'re speaking in riddles by saying something I don\'t really understand,
 but when it comes down to it, you\'re just trying to trick me because you can\'t say in red that something magical like a homunculus exists, right?"
"If I were to say in red that "witches exist", what would you do, Battler‐sama?"
"...............mh.
 ......That\'s what we\'re having this big fight over whether or not to believe, right?
 If you told me that outright, there\'d be nothing more to discuss.
 It\'d be game over."
"If I said "witches exist" in red, you would have no room for argument.
 However, since the reason would never have been made clear to you, Battler‐sama, you probably wouldn\'t accept it.
 However, after being told that in red, you would have no room for argument and would not have been shown any proof."
"In this situation, Battler‐sama,
 even though you wouldn\'t be able to admit defeat, you would have no way to make a counterargument, and it would become a deadlock.
 Even though checkmate would not have been reached, no more moves would exist."
"Since you would not be able to make your next move, it would never become Milady\'s turn,
 and the game would stop there for all eternity.
 As a result, Milady would be unable to force you to submit.
 ......That would be a deadlock situation."
"In order to avoid that,
 I am unable to answer questions of this form in red."
"......So, to cut to the chase, you mean that questions that leave no room for discussion are prohibited?
 Well, that makes sense, I guess.
 If I was told "witches exist" in red, I\'d have to give up from the start."
"I am pleased that you understand.
 I believe we might be able to work together if you ask a question of a different form."
"......Can you respond to the repetition request she dodged?
 About the number of people on this island."
"If Milady held back on the request, then of course I cannot respond.
 As Milady\'s furniture, I am unable to act too forward."
Ronove made an exaggerated gesture, trying to act like a loyal retainer.
 This guy\'s so shameless.
"Tch.
 Just when I thought you might be useful."
"......I\'ll give up on that and search for a different question.
 ...That\'s right.
 I was forgetting to check something important.
 .........This is a story about Beato\'s memories, right?
 When did it happen?
 It couldn\'t be happening right now, right?"
"Correct.
 {p:1:This is the world of 1967}.
 It is the world of 19 years ago."
"............Hmmmmm..."
Let\'s go through the story one more time.
{n}I wonder if it couldn\'t be something like this.
Grandfather had a person with whom he fell in unrequited love, called {f:5:Beatrice}.
{n}And he confined her in this hidden mansion and continually courted her.
{n}But she was stubborn and didn\'t say yes.
Eventually, she grew pessimistic about being unable to escape from here...
and probably, committed suicide.
......And then,
 ......her soul was put in a homunculus and......
No, no, if I accept that, it\'s the same as accepting the witch.
I can interpret that part like this.
{n}She probably......left a daughter behind when she died.
That talk about the soul being put in a new body...probably meant...
that Grandfather raised that child believing it to be the reincarnation of {f:5:Beatrice}...
...In that case, Beato must have existed on this island for at least the last 19 years as the 19th person, and then...
...umm......
"......I\'m starting to get confused.
 ...In any event, none of this leaves the realm of guesswork.
 The only thing that I can definitely say in red,
 is that in 1967, in a hidden mansion on Rokkenjima, {f:5:Beatrice} existed as a human.
 That\'s all."
"That is correct.
 {p:1:In 1967, in a hidden mansion on Rokkenjima, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama existed as a human}."
"Oh, thank you.
 That really helps."
"Congratulations.
 With this, you have made clear the existence of the piece known as the 19th person.
 The 19th human outside of the 18 who you can blame, just as you longed for."
"......A sacrificial sheep that you can shift the blame of any crime onto.
 And you must be so glad that it is Milady.
 Pu ku ku ku."
Ronove laughed indiscreetly.
Somehow, I didn\'t like his phrasing, so I didn\'t feel like laughing along with him.
"......That\'s right.
 Auntie Rosa said it.
 ......‘{f:5:Beatrice} is dead’?
 "I killed her"?
 What does that mean...?"
"As for that, it may be faster to see the actual circumstances rather than listen to me tell you.
 Let us advance the clock a little more."
Ronove pulled a stylish pocket watch from his pocket, and made to wind the crown.
As soon as he did, I saw gold butterflies gather behind Ronove\'s back and take the form of a person.
...Was it Beato?!
 I quickly realized that it was someone else.
It was her.
 That oldest sister of the Seven Stakes, who loved tormenting me more than anything else.
......If I don\'t think myself lucky to see that sexy ass, I won\'t be able to play along with their torture game...
"Ronove‐sama.
 So, you were still here.
 This is an urgent call from {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama."
"My, my,
 what kind of urgent business could it be?
 ......It appears as though I have spent slightly too long chatting with you, Battler‐sama.
 Well then, Battler‐sama, if you will excuse me.
 Please continue to enjoy your game with Milady."
"Yeah, yeah.
 I\'ll enjoy it as best as I can.
 ...\'Cause the conversations are more lively with you than with Beato.
 And you use the red more graciously.
 Come talk again any time."
"............Battler‐sama.
 Despite how I look, I am Milady\'s furniture.
 ...I cannot do something that Milady does not wish.
 What I said in red was something that normally should have come from Milady\'s mouth.
 ...I did nothing more than announce the red truth in Milady\'s place as she sulked."
"So she really was sulking then?
 Ihihihi!"
"Pu ku kuku."
Seeing me and Ronove incomprehensibly hitting it off, that Seven Stakes chick cocked her head slightly.
"Ronove‐sama.
 We are keeping {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama waiting.
 Let us hurry."
"Yes, I will come immediately.
 Well then, Battler‐sama, I shall see you later.
 ......It appears that we have finally started getting along.
 As I thought, I have the feeling that we can become good friends."
"If by that you mean partners at gossiping behind Beato\'s back."
"Ronove‐sama!"
"Yes, yes.
 Then, if you will excuse me."
Maybe it was because she really didn\'t like seeing him act friendly with me, or maybe it was because she had really been told to hurry.
The Seven Stakes babe bellowed sharply at Ronove, and he laughed foolishly and disappeared, as if running away...
"......Hmph.
 How could I, the eldest sister of the Seven Stakes of Purgatory, be called on for this level of work!
 ...{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama could easily have told one of the younger sisters, who look like they have so much free time, for something like this. Sheesh...!"
"Why so grumpy, girl?
 If you\'re hungry, eat a cookie or something.
 Why don\'t I give you the last one?
 Ihihi!"
"......Hummmmm?
 How thoughtful.
 Then, shall I take one?"
I lightly pushed the snack plate with the last remaining cookie on it over to her.
"Thank you"
As though coming as a replacement for the period at the end of the sentence, a sharp sound pierced the table...
The nails on three of her fingers had sharply extended, and were stuck...
a hair\'s breadth into the gaps between my fingers on the hand I had used to push the plate.
......It had happened in an instant, ...so for a while, I didn\'t even realize that her fingernails had grown.
The tips of those sharp nails were like blades with a red manicure.
......The spaces between the bases of my fingers prickled.
......Those razor‐like blades were sticking sharply into the back of my hand, and into the spaces between my fingers...
By those three blades, my carelessly outstretched right hand was not even permitted to shake, and all I could do now was allow a single line of cold sweat to drip down.
"............Wowee.
 ...Isn\'t it about time you cut your nails, babe?"
"Lucifer.
 ......That is my noble name.
 Honored furniture serving {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, and the eldest sister of the Seven Stakes of Purgatory."
".........I\'m not like my disgraceful and cretinous younger sisters.
 If you don\'t show the proper respect, you will regret it."
"...How would I regret it?
 I don\'t have a clue."
".........Heheheheheh.
 Stupid kid.
 ...Do you really want me to play with you that much?
 You really can\'t get me out of your mind?"
"I\'ll thrust my stake deep, deep into you and make you really enjoy being gouged, got it......?
 Hehehe{0}he{0}heh{0}heheh{0}he{0}hehehhh......!"
".........You bitch.
 One day I\'ll push you down and say that back to you."
"Oh, really?
 I\'ll be looking forward to that, then?
 Ehhehe{0}heh{0}heheheh......
 ...Ahhahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!!!"
Rosa eventually regained her calm.
The men wanted to hurry her into talking faster, but Kyrie intervened.
...If something like she had just mentioned really had happened, ......it was an abominable past that she wouldn\'t want to remember.
After taking several deep breaths with her hand over her chest, it seemed that she had more or less gathered the resolve to talk...
"......How old was I then, I wonder...
 ...Probably...middle school, or... ...I don\'t remember well.
 Anyway, I think I was about that old..."
"Which means... Maybe about twenty years ago?"
"Back then, my grades weren\'t very good, and Mother was always angry at me.
 ......I was trying to do my best in my own way,
 but I couldn\'t respond to Mother\'s expectations at all..."
"......Mother was always very strict with Rosa.
 I sympathized with her at the time."
"Hmm.
 You say that even though you were always talking behind her back."
"Would you give it a rest, Eva.
 So?
 Where did you meet {f:5:Beatrice}, Rosa‐san?!"
"Hideyoshi‐san, you mustn\'t rush her now.
 ......It\'s alright, Rosa‐san.
 Tell us at your leisure."
".........Thank you.
 ...It was a day when I had been scolded particularly harshly by Mother."
Even though my tutor had promised to keep it a secret,
 ...apparently, they told Mother all about how I had complained.
Mother scolded me horribly, saying that I was a disgrace to the Ushiromiya family.
......Of course, I was doing the best I could.
But I had none of Krauss nii‐san\'s dignity,
 I couldn\'t get excellent grades like Eva nee‐san,
 and I had no leadership like Rudolf nii‐san.
...I never stood out, didn\'t particularly excel at anything,
 and I almost wanted to ask myself why I had even been born into the Ushiromiya family.
I didn\'t know why I had been born.
{n}...On that day, I had the experience of my mind going blank for the first time......
For the first time since I was born,
 ...I realized that in addition to facing or surrendering to my problems,
 I had the third choice of running away.
Even though I say run away, there was no way I could have left Rokkenjima and gone somewhere else.
But, anyway, I wanted to run away from the mansion and the way I was at the time.
......In a way, it was like running away from home, or maybe a half‐hearted suicide...
"......I wanted to disappear.
 Or maybe it was that child‐like form of resistance where I tried to make my parents worry by disappearing..."
".........I thought childishly that if I went into the center of the forest, I could escape from the Ushiromiya house,
 or maybe I could get back at them by getting lost and making them worry."
"So then, ......you went into the forest that you\'d been told not to go into?"
"......Yes.
 After reaching the beach, I followed alongside the ocean.
 ......I didn\'t have any particular reason,
 ......but I felt that, if I went around to the opposite side of the island, there might be a place there that no one knew about,
 which might become a hidden house just for me."
"Starting by the beach, it\'d be impossible to go all the way around.
 It becomes a cliff partway, right?
 There\'s no way you could pass that way."
"...Of course.
 So, I kept going wherever I could, and kept going deeper and deeper in.
 ......It was a horrible forest without any paths, but that was comforting to me then.
 ...If I could make it through such a dangerous forest, then it would be that much greater of an escape from the Ushiromiya family,
 ...which made me feel good."
".........How shameful.
 If you were scolded because of your grades, all you had to do was work harder."
"You mustn\'t say that.
 Doesn\'t Rosa have her talent as a designer instead?"
Literally this could be taken as him covering for Rosa,
 but everyone knew that Rosa\'s company was not making any profits.
"Quit it.
 Now isn\'t the time for sarcasm.
 ......And then you arrived there by coincidence...?
 ...{f:5:Beatrice}\'s...
hidden mansion."
Rosa nodded weakly......
"About how far did you walk.
 Could you show it to us on a map...?
 Natsuhi‐san, is there a map of this island?"
"No, not right here and now..."
"That would be impossible.
 I was just walking randomly.
 Even if you showed me a map, I wouldn\'t know.
 ......And twenty years have passed since then.
 I probably couldn\'t reach it again even if I went into the forest..."
".........Hmmmmmm..."
Several people let out dejected sighs.
It was vividly clear that in their haste,
 they had thought that some hint related to the witch\'s epitaph, or maybe even the gold itself, might be resting there in that hidden mansion.
"The only part of Rokkenjima that got made ready for development is the area around the mansion.
 ...The rest is completely uncultivated, and it would probably take considerable effort to survey the entire island."
"But just knowing that it actually exists is helpful.
 It would take some money, but if we enlisted an aerial photography company to investigate,
 or asked the contractors who constructed this mansion about what happened at the time,
 we could probably find some way to search for it."
"Yes.
 ...There should be more ways to do it now that there isn\'t a question about whether it exists or not."
"......Mmhm.
 It is probably worth investigating right away."
"We will do that investigation together as siblings.
 We won\'t let you do it alone, Nii‐san."
It wasn\'t certain that the gold was hidden in that secret mansion,
 but it seemed that the fireworks between Krauss and Eva had already begun.
"Give it a rest for now, you two.
 ...Rosa, please continue."
"..................Yes."
Blindly, randomly, I kept running, on and on.
Suddenly, it felt like I had come across something like an animal trail.
I had no idea how far I\'d walked, and I was very tired,
 so by then, I was just naturally taking the easiest path to walk on.
As I did, .........suddenly, right before my eyes, a very, very tall fence appeared.
It was a fence wonderfully adorned in a gothic style.
For an instant, I spun around, thinking that I might have returned to the original mansion.
Of course, there were fences around the mansion to stop us from entering the forest.
 But this fence was decorated differently, ......and most of all, it was very tall.
It probably reached a full two stories up.
It was covered with ivy, and created a mysterious, solemn atmosphere...
At the time, ......I believed the legend of the witch of the forest, {f:5:Beatrice}.
I had been told that she was frightening,
 but some of the servants told me that she would sometimes help you if you respected her.
......Since I had started to lose confidence in how my life was going,
 I believed that the only way I could be saved was by receiving her help.
So that\'s what made me think it.
 ......I believed that this was the fence of the mansion of {f:5:Beatrice}, the witch of the forest.
I thought that if I could meet with {f:5:Beatrice}, she would definitely save me.
So I thought I would try to go in.
But that fence was very, very tall, and it didn\'t look like I could go over it.
So I decided to walk around it.
{n}I thought that if I did, I would eventually reach a gate.
But it wasn\'t that easy.
 The fence had a length to match its height, and no matter how far I went, I didn\'t reach a corner.
It might have been enclosing a very massive area,
 ...or maybe it just felt that way because my child\'s legs made it difficult to walk in the forest.
Anyway, because I couldn\'t find a gate for a while,
 I started to feel sad, as though the witch had rejected me...
As I did, I eventually came upon a large tree, whose twisted root had bent the fence.
I might get my clothes dirty, but if I crawled, it looked like I would be able to sneak in...
".........And that was the hidden mansion?"
"I don\'t know whether it was the hidden mansion we\'ve been talking about...
 Still, at the very least, it wasn\'t a place that we know of."
It wasn\'t as though I came out into a garden as soon as I passed the fence.
{n}I had to continue through a lot more uncultivated forest after that.
And then......the forest suddenly opened up.
 And what appeared there was an unbelievably...
.........fantastical scene.
To think that Rokkenjima, where I had believed no one other than us lived,
 ...had been hiding such a wonderful mansion...
A beautiful flower garden spanned the front of the mansion.
{n}It was a flower garden of a completely different design from the rose garden we know so well, and was very lovely.
Of course, the mansion was also wonderful.
...It was one or two sizes smaller than ours,
 but it was a very elegant, and yet lovely mansion.
Then, ...............I saw her.
{n}I saw her sitting in a garden chair, positioned to give a view of the flower garden, wearing an elegant dress.
It was that black dress embroidered in gold that we would later know from that portrait.
......I hadn\'t seen an elegant dress like that except in fairy tales and on the stage of musicals.
...That a person would be wearing it as their normal clothes... That in itself seemed quite fantastical.
That magical scene was enough to make me lose my sense of reality.
If someone had told me then that it was a dream,
 I might have nodded obediently, and waited to wake up in my bed...
Since, in my shock, I had forgotten to hide myself, she eventually noticed me.
At first, her expression was quite listless,
 but when she noticed me, her eyes opened very wide.
...It was only natural—a guest that she didn\'t know had suddenly appeared.
I automatically bowed my head, feeling that I should greet her and apologize for entering without permission...
"............Who are you?
 A new gardener?"
Those were the first words she said to me.
{n}...That calmed me down a little bit.
{n}Because I realized that she could be talked with.
Because I hadn\'t been turned into a frog just by meeting her eyes, like the terrifying witch in that fairy tale.
"......I,
 ......I\'m sorry.
 ...I shouldn\'t have entered the garden without permission..."
"........................
 ......Who are you?
 Name yourself."
"I, ...I am Ushiromiya Rosa."
"......Ushiromiya.
 .....................Hoh.
 ...So you are one of Kinzo\'s family."
"Huh?
 Ah, ...yes!
 I\'m Kinzo\'s daughter.
 G‐good afternoon...!"
I was just a little surprised.
{n}...After all, Father was a great man feared by everyone.
And she had referred to him without using honorifics.
{n}So she quickly became frightening.
...After all,
 if she could refer to my fearsome father that way, she must be a witch with incredible power.
After staring at me curiously, she beckoned me to come over to her.
And I obeyed, although filled with belated trepidation.
{n}......After all, I thought I really might be turned into a frog.
...And the closer and closer I got, the stronger that fear became.
After all, ...I said it several times already, but,
 ............that woman and her dress and the flower garden and the mansion,
 ......that entire harmony was so fantastical and beautiful that it seemed separate from reality.
It surely wouldn\'t have surprised me even if she was actually a witch...
And I was truly lucky.
{n}She didn\'t turn me into a frog.
As I awkwardly stood there stock still, she motioned to an open chair, and urged me to sit down.
"Sit.
 Welcoming and speaking to those who visit this garden for the first time is my only pleasure.
 .........That said, I have nothing else to find pleasure in."
As she said that, she showed an unhappy smile for just an instant.
Because I was full of a strange mix of tension and excitement, I rudely asked her a question suddenly.
"...Umm,
 ............are you the witch of the forest,
 ...{f:5:Beatrice}......?"
"Indeed.
 I am {f:5:Beatrice}."
"As I thought.
 {f:5:Beatrice} actually existed..."
"...Did she look just like the portrait?"
"......Yes.
 Exactly like the portrait."
"So she wasn\'t just...
...a witch from Father\'s imagination..."
"And then, what did you talk with her about?"
"...As she prepared some tea, she asked me various things about myself.
 ......First, she was surprised that I had come through the forest.
 It seems she believed that many dangerous wolves lived outside the fence."
"...So when I told her I had reached this place by going through the forest, she was very surprised.
 She asked how I had managed to escape from the wolves—did I give them biscuits and they let me go?
 Or did I cover myself in a magic cloak, or...
 Those kinds of things, I think."
"Wahahaha.
 ...That sure sounds like a witch.
 What an interestin\' person."
"Quiet, honey.
 ............It was a long time ago,
 but didn\'t Father threaten us, saying that wolves lived in the forest, so we shouldn\'t get close to there?"
"Yes, there was a time like that.
 Ridiculous.
 Even though Japanese wolves went extinct long ago.
 What a childish trick."
"I don\'t remember, though...?
 Did Dad really tell us something like that...?
 It was the witch of the forest, right?
 I don\'t think I\'ve ever heard about wolves."
"You were still in elementary school.
 Don\'t you remember?"
"You actually went and replied that you\'d want to try petting the wolves.
 So Father immediately gave up the wolf story and changed it to the story about the witch.
 Such obvious lies, ahahahahaha."
"Hahahaha.
 At the time, the witch story had a much more immediate effect on you, Rudolf, than the wolves.
 I remember it well.
 Don\'t you remember those nights when you clung to my back?"
"...*giggle*.
 I see, even Rudolf‐san used to have that cute period."
"Oh, put a lid on it.
 I was just a kid."
"......Well, anyway.
 If Father was the one who shut {f:5:Beatrice} up in there, it makes sense that he would use the same wolf story.
 To him, the vast forest of Rokkenjima was a wall that shouldn\'t be crossed,
 dividing his two incompatible worlds: the Ushiromiya family and his mistress\'s mansion."
"If you think about the height of that fence, it does seem that Father had turned the whole area, garden and all, into a giant jail cell.
 ......Just like a national border dividing his two separate worlds."
"...Forget the wolves, were there any kinds of stray dogs there at the time?
 It could have been a fence to protect against those."
"There are no wolves or stray dogs on Rokkenjima.
 Just as Nii‐san and Kyrie‐san are saying,
 that fence was probably a border between us and {f:5:Beatrice}."
"However, if she innocently believed the story about the wolves, that\'s pretty...naive.
 That\'s nothin\' like the way I\'d imagine a witch."
"......That\'s right.
 I also sensed that.
 ...She was very pompous, just like my image of a witch,
 ...but she was somehow very childish, and...
...how should I say it, too honest?
 ......She gave me the impression that she didn\'t know anything about the world."
"If I had to describe it, ...it was almost as though she had come from a fairy‐tale land.
 ......She was a truly mysterious person."
"......What happened after that?
 ...Did you end up talking about Dad at all?"
"Yes.
 Once every few days, sometimes on an arranged day and sometimes suddenly,
 Father would appear casually, and they would drink tea together, or take a walk together or something, she said.
 And that, by coincidence, she was by herself on the day I visited."
"I see.
 Truly a mistress, then.
 ...My, my.
 I don\'t know how much younger she was, but... not bad, Father."
"......I remain firmly convinced that it was not an indecent relationship."
"Gosh, you are an idiot. There\'s no way a lover\'s meeting between a man and a woman wouldn\'t have {i:some} sensuality.
 What happened next?
 What did you talk about after that?"
".........Because I had introduced myself, I then asked her about herself."
"...When I did, the atmosphere quickly grew depressing.
 ......How should I say it, she seemed very listless and lonely.
 ...It was the same expression as the one I had first seen on her face."
"Well, that\'s because she was his hidden mistress.
 If she just walked around wherever she liked, she might have been discovered by Mother.
 ......I\'m sure the situation was almost like house arrest."
"Even though she had beautiful clothes, a beautiful mansion, and a garden, she must have felt very constrained.
 No surprise she felt it hard.
 .........And then?"
"There was definitely something on her mind.
 ......I remember getting the impression that it wasn\'t something that I could resolve just by talking to her,
 and feeling very sad about it as well."
".........She seemed to have forgotten that I was even there.
 ...She was gazing vaguely off into the distance, and was silent for a long, long time."
"...I thought that I must have said something wrong,
 ......but it didn\'t seem to be the type of atmosphere where I could offer words of apology...
 ......So, I too remained silent for a long, long time, until she remembered that I was there..."
When she did, ......she muttered unexpectedly.
".........Are there really no wolves beyond the fence?"
"...Hmm?
 Y‐yes.
 I\'ve never seen wolves even in a zoo."
"What is this "zoo"?"
"Ah, ...it\'s a place where they keep all kinds of animals.
 They\'re full of rare animals like elephants and giraffes and pandas."
"..............................
 ...Are there no wolves in a zoo?
 Then, umm, ...that might not be scary."
"Even if there were wolves, all of the animals are put in cages, so it\'s safe.
 So you can feel safe as you look at and learn about them."
The witch of the forest, of all people, was for some reason scared of and didn\'t like wolves.
I remember it looked pretty comical.
"..................
 ...How does that differ from myself?"
"............Huh?"
She didn\'t even know about zoos.
I explained how fun zoos could be,
 but it was very difficult to get a person like her, who had never been to one, to understand...
Quite the opposite, as I explained it to her, her expression grew increasingly dismal.
...She couldn\'t see the difference.
It seemed that, although this mansion surrounded by a high fence appeared at a glance to afford her a completely provided‐for life of comfort,
 she couldn\'t see how she was different from the animals shut up in cages...
"Who am I?
 ......Everyone calls me {f:5:Beatrice}.
 ...And that does certainly seem to be the name of a great witch, as you say."
"......But that is not me.
 I cannot use any magic.
 ......I simply have the soul of that witch sealed inside my body."
"..................?"
There was definitely something mysterious about her.
 It wasn\'t just that she was somehow at odds with the world,
 but it seemed that she truly believed that a thing called magic actually exists.
I think she talked about various weird things, but I don\'t remember the details.
All I thought was:
 ......this might be a pitiful person.
She was unable to leave this mansion of her own will, a prisoner without even realizing it.
......And she didn\'t know anything about the outside world, didn\'t even understand who she was.
......She probably vaguely understood herself that she was pitiful.
But since she didn\'t know anything, it seemed that she couldn\'t realize that this was unhappiness.
Nee‐san, long ago, when I told you that I felt sorry for a bird in a cage, I remember you said this to me.
"A bird that only knows the inside of a cage doesn\'t long for the outside".
But she wasn\'t a bird.
{n}She was, ultimately, a human.
Even if she had never been outside the cage, she understood that it wasn\'t the whole world.
So,
 .........I invited her.
"Do you want to try...
...going outside the fence?"
".........Th‐there really aren\'t any wolves?"
"There aren\'t.
 You\'ll definitely be safe."
"..............................
 ......I want to leave.
 But the gate is always closed."
"There\'s the place I came in through.
 There\'s a crack you can slip through."
"......If we go through there, is there a world outside?"
"Yes."
"........................There really aren\'t any wolves?"
"*giggle*.
 No, none at all."
".............................."
I had only planned to invite her for a short walk,
 ...but she kept looking over her shoulder at the mansion, as though she were seriously deliberating over something.
Then I learned what she was preparing herself for.
"...............I...have had enough of this place.
 ......I want to go...outside.
 And I want to know...who I am, what\'s happening in this world,
 ...and the purpose for which I was born."
I didn\'t know what her life had been like until then.
It was probably something that she couldn\'t express easily.
If it was harsh, she just had to say that she wanted to escape.
{n}If it was sweet, she just had to say that she would stay.
To liken it to something,
 perhaps it was similar to how a hot fireplace on a winter day makes the air get thicker and thicker, giving you a headache...?
Even though you know that you shouldn\'t keep things the way they are, you still need the courage to open the window and be tormented by the cold wind...
She was starting to realize that she couldn\'t stay there forever.
She was starting to realize that she had to go outside sometime.
But, since she didn\'t know about the outside world,
 to take that first step outside must have required an unimaginable amount of courage...
And she had taken that into consideration, and resolved herself.
She had put that resolution to go outside into words, for what was surely the first time in her entire life.
...I hesitated slightly.
{n}It had been decided that she would live here by Father.
{n}It was as if she were Father\'s beloved bird in a cage.
If I just let her escape,
 ......wouldn\'t I be harshly scolded by Father...?
"I want to see."
".........Hm?
 See what?"
"I want to see...a zoo."
".....................ah."
I was just a little surprised when she finally showed me a very soft smile.
That might have been...
an inner peace, coming from her newfound readiness to venture out from her cage.
A soft smile which I wouldn\'t have imagined could have come out of that dark face...
"......When I speak with you, I keep hearing about things I don\'t know.
 ...I don\'t know about this thing called school, nor about zoos.
 I don\'t know about movie theaters.
 I don\'t know about amusement parks."
".........And I think, from the bottom of my heart, that I want to know about them.
 ...Will you take me there?"
"Huh? ......Y‐yes."
...I was nervous about how I would do it and keep it a secret from Father,
 ...but her face looked so happy, so I went along with her and nodded.
But it seemed that the meaning behind my vague expression was not communicated to her.
It seemed that she believed that I would really take her to all of those places if we left.
She was pure and genuine.
 ......She had probably never been tricked by anyone.
 No, ......maybe it should be said that she hadn\'t been taught how to doubt.
Her face was somewhat radiant, and yet pathetic.
{n}...I wanted to somehow grant her modest wish.
"I...have had enough of {f:5:Beatrice}.
 I want to know who I am.
 I want to start out as a new human, not {f:5:Beatrice}."
"So, I want you to take me from here.
 .........I don\'t need tea anymore.
 I don\'t need this dress.
 I won\'t meet with Kinzo again.
 ......Please, take me from here.
 Rosa."
However, that responsibility was one that a child such as me couldn\'t possibly bear fully.
But her serious gaze and her brilliant smile,
 ...almost as though an evil spirit had lifted from her,
 ......made me feel a little courage start to rise up inside myself.
This was definitely something that would get me in a lot of trouble.
{n}......But it was definitely the right thing to do.
I don\'t know how it will turn out, but......
 ......I\'ll take her out.
Of course, I won\'t be able to ask help from Father, and not Mother either.
.........Should I talk to Onii‐sama or Onee‐sama?
{n}No, what about that reliable Genji‐san, or...
that\'s right, what about Kumasawa‐san, to whom I can always talk when I\'m in trouble.
I\'m sure they\'ll be able to do something.
Anyway, for now, I\'ll take her out of here.
{n}Because this is no longer a place where she wishes to be.
......And so, I took her to the crack in the fence and led her outside.
She was all nervous, checking to make sure there were no wolves around,
 but after that fear disappeared,
 she seemed somehow to be having fun even just walking around this dense forest.
Every time she found something, she would ask me about it.
{n}And they were all really minor things.
......What\'s that flower?
 What\'s that leaf?
 And that sound?
 And that smell?
It was really like...the inside of that fence had been her entire world.
So, to her, who had stepped {i:out} of the world, this was.........
......You know, it\'s strange.
In the beginning, when I first saw her, I thought that she was the absolute incarnation of a witch relaxing by a witch\'s mansion.
But now it was different.
 Or actually, the complete opposite.
......She had gone out of a world she had believed to be finite, and was full of joy at realizing for the first time that the world was endless.
So everything she saw was new.
{n}......It was almost as though she was the one who had been thrown into a fairy tale.
If she was Alice, then I felt almost like a rabbit holding a watch......
To her, it was probably a really fun walk, filled to the brim with excitement.
 ...But as for me, the truth was, I was completely bewildered.
......After all, I had walked randomly to get there.
{n}So there was no way I could have known the way back to the mansion.
There were no lights in the forest, and I hadn\'t brought a flashlight.
{n}I realized that it would be terrible if it got dark while we were still like this, and grew impatient.
She was too innocent,
 and apparently, she couldn\'t understand at all how frightening it would be to face the night inside the forest.
But I was the one who had brought her outside.
{n}...Somehow, I had to take responsibility, and resolve this situation.
So I thought.
 ......That for now we should just go out to the sea.
{n}If we then followed the coast around, eventually we should definitely be able to make it back to the mansion.
However, that was much more of a problem than I had imagined.
{n}...After all, I didn\'t have a map or a compass.
There was no way I could walk in a straight line through an uncultivated forest, and I had immediately lost my sense of direction.
I already had no clue which trail I had come by, and was completely lost...
At this rate, night would definitely fall before I even knew where I was walking.
But I didn\'t have the luxury to complain.
Because that woman following behind me was so innocent and having so much fun.
 ...Therefore, for the sake of her smile if nothing else,
 I absolutely had to guide her out of this forest.
Gritting my teeth so that I didn\'t show her a troubled face,
 I pushed my way onward through the pathless woods.
And, although we had various troubles, we were lucky enough to make it to the sea...
At that time, I still didn\'t even have a clue where I was on the island,
 but for the time being, I was just a little reassured, realizing that if I just went around this way, I would surely be able to return to the mansion.
Of course, although I said that we reached the sea, we were on the top of a rocky cliff.
 The beach was far below us.
I was tired from walking around the forest for so long,
 so I thought that even though it was a rocky beach, an open area would probably be much easier to walk in.
So I planned to somehow go down the rocky cliff.
{n}...It did look pretty dangerous, and I wondered if there was some other way.
However, {f:5:Beatrice} agreed with my plan without any doubts.
......Even though she was probably older than me,
 ...she obeyed me truly obediently, almost as though she were some kind of chick who believed I was a mother bird.
I searched to see if there wasn\'t some place where I could go down the cliff.
 ...Then I found a place where the cliff had crumbled into a slope.
.......It looked a little dangerous,
 but if I went down on both hands and both legs, like I was crawling, I thought it would probably be okay.
"......Let\'s go down here.
 It\'ll be dangerous if you aren\'t careful,
 but for now, if we go down to the beach and walk along it, I think we can avoid getting lost any more."
"Mmhm.
 If you will do that, then let\'s go.
 I find this getting lost to be fun also.
 I\'m very happy."
.........She really had no sense of danger.
{n}There was probably no mistake that she had lived a life without discomfort.
Even though she knew it would get dark when night fell,
 she couldn\'t imagine how dangerous the inside of a forest could be without a light.
Furthermore, it seemed that she couldn\'t grasp at all how dangerous it might be if she fell from the cliff.
I warned her once more to be careful.
I cautiously examined the place where we could go down.
{n}...It looked......pretty high up.
{n}I think it might have been about ten meters down.
If you looked at it from the bottom up, it would probably have looked shorter than the roof of the mansion.
 But looking from the top, it felt almost like staring down from the Tokyo Tower\'s observation room.
But {f:5:Beatrice} still appeared to be completely without fear.
 ...It felt as though she had never even been taught that high places were dangerous.
......No, maybe she truly believed that she was a witch,
 and that she could fly, so there wasn\'t anything dangerous.
"Please be careful.
 ...It\'s pretty...high."
"Mmhm.
 I will be careful.
 I see there\'s a beach if we go down there.
 Is there an aquarium there?"
"No, there are no aquariums on this island.
 But I think there are lots of fish in the sea."
"I see.
 So there are fish.
 Are there, ...umm, whales and dolphins and penguins, like you talked about?"
"No, you would have to go to an aquarium for those.
 ......And there aren\'t any aquariums unless you leave this island."
"Is that so?
 ......But I look forward to it.
 What kind of fish are whales?"
"Umm, ...they\'re really big fish and...huh, aren\'t they mammals?
 And they spit out seawater."
"Hoh.
 Then the dolphins?"
"Umm, they\'re really smart fish and...{0}huh...{0}aren\'t they also mammals?
 They\'re really smart and they can be taught tricks and stuff."
"Hohhoh.
 Then what about penguins?"
"Umm, ...huh, weren\'t they birds...?"
"What\'s this?
 Didn\'t you say that there were fish in aquariums?"
"Ummm, ummm...
 Well, um, there isn\'t only fish, they\'re full of all kinds of things that live in the ocean."
"Hohhoh.
 I am really looking forward to that!
 .........nn—"
{a:c:
Wa, hyaa.}
She made...some might have described it as a funny,
 ...rushed and short voice,
 ...no, probably it was a scream, I think.
She suddenly made a sound like that.
......Her body separated from the cliff, and gently fell down.
I immediately thought to say to her.
{n}"How many times did I warn you to be careful!"
......It was the thought of a child.
 It was how a child immediately gets mad when something happens, trying to show that they are not at fault.
Of course, I said it too.
{n}Are you alright?
 How many times did I warn you......
"...............So,
 ...after she fell from the cliff,
 ...what happened?"
"..........................."
"......What happened to her?
 ...Rosa."
Rosa fell silent.
 ...Her gaze fell to her feet, ...as though she were seeing through the floor to some disgusting memory...
"She...died, right......?"
Eva\'s brutal words were the ones that Rosa had most wanted to avoid.
And when she was hit with them, ......she screamed in resignation.
"Yes, she died!!
 It was a rocky beach, many sharp and dangerous rocks lay exposed!!
 Her eyes were still open, the blood kept pouring out... Suddenly a red carpet was spreading out...!"
"I spoke to her, shook her!!
 But she refused to respond, not even a blink, ......no, she wouldn\'t even close her eyelids!!"
"It was my fault!
 She was wearing a dress, remember?!
 Even though I knew that her outfit was difficult to move in, I said that we should go down the cliff!!
 She was incredibly innocent, so she obeyed what I said without any doubts...!!"
"......How long do you plan on remaining dead?
 Open your eyes already.
 Honestly, just turning into a lump of meat without me."
"I was just flirting with your friend the sexy‐assed chick.
 ......More importantly, what is all this?"
"Mmm.
 It is as you see.
 ......I missed my footing, fell down,
 {i:and died}."
"What did you say...
 .........Even though you appeared as the 19th person,
 ......you say you died......?"
"Don\'t mess with me, that can\'t be...!
 Auntie Rosa was a kid, and she was panicking.
 It\'s not like there was a doctor.
 She probably made a mistake, thinking you were dead, and you probably, umm, ......were in a state of apparent death, or something, but actually alive.
 Right?!"
It can\'t be.
 She\'s obviously alive.
{n}Otherwise, she wouldn\'t be here in front of me, right...?!
...The kid‐aged Auntie Rosa was shaking {f:5:Beatrice}\'s body, crying.
I too stared into that face,
 ...............but her eyes were still open, and it really was a corpse.
...I wanted to brush it off with something vague like a state of apparent death,
 ......but from any angle, there was nothing "apparent" about it; ...she really didn\'t look anything but dead...
{f:5:Beatrice} had fallen upside‐down from a cliff of that height,
 ......and her head had smashed against the pointed tip of those sharp rocks.
............You would die, wouldn\'t you,
 ......from that height,
 ......on those rocks......
But I can\'t accept that...
No matter how dead she looks, ......she has to be alive...!
 And she became this damn irritating witch!
 That way, all of the inconsistencies fit.
She\'d been confined by Grandfather in a hidden mansion the whole time.
And then to avenge herself, she planned out her revenge,
 ......and would go on to commit a number of atrocious murders!
Auntie Rosa probably just mistakenly thought that she was dead.
 But she was really alive, and as soon as Auntie Rosa left, she miraculously started breathing again.
......And then she somehow lived until today, and would open the curtain on the scene of her revenge.
Otherwise, the facts don\'t fit together!!
"......I won\'t let you trick me so easily.
 Can you repeat it in red?!
 That she died for certain!!
 She has to be alive, right?!
 It\'s obvious!!"
"How does {i:that} look like {i:being alive} to you?
 {p:1:She\'s definitely dead}!"
".................................mgghhhh..."
My theory that the 19th person was Grandfather\'s mistress, who was a human {f:5:Beatrice}, broke down.
...I thought I had managed to segue from a defensive position into a counterattack, but......
"......Then, ......who are you?
 You just died, this very minute!
 You aren\'t going to say that you revived yourself with magic, are you?!"
"*cackle*cackle*.
 I think that I\'ve already explained it, though."
"......The me that is lying over there definitely has my soul,
 but that body was nothing more than a cage of flesh tying me to the physical world.
 And that cage of flesh was thus broken.
 ......Do you understand what that means?"
"...............I don\'t have a clue anymore.
 ......Keep having fun with your witch‐girl talk.
 I\'ll listen instead of eating a cookie!
 What the... It\'s empty.
 Hey, could I get some more black tea?"
"*cackle*cackle*!
 Ronove.
 Our guest wants some black tea."
When Beato clapped her hands, Ronove appeared.
......Butlers sure are convenient.
"A refill, is it?
 Certainly.
 How much shall I pour you?"
"Well, I\'ve got more than enough to go with it.
 Half will be fine."
"Filling it to the brim regardless is the English custom."
Even though just enough to wet my throat would have been fine, he filled it to the top with tea.
I turned my back to Beato, sipping it in silence...
"Wait... Open your eyes...!!
 {f:5:Beatrice}...!!"
Rosa shook me,
 ............no, shook the corpse that had once been me.
I watched over her from a short distance away.
Ah, ...so I fell from there and died.........
I believed that was true for a while.
 ...After that, I saw Rosa spend a long time beside my corpse, then watched her as she ran away.
......Eventually, I realized that I was a different individual from that corpse...
".....................That\'s right.
 I am......me.
 ...So, I have finally been able to escape from Kinzo\'s restrictions..."
Eventually, I felt the memory returning...
{n}The fact that I was an Endless Witch who had lived for one thousand years.
And then I remembered that I had been summoned by Kinzo, and for a long time, had been imprisoned by him...
While I had been imprisoned in a cage of flesh, I had completely lost my memory as a witch.
However, thanks to Rosa, if you could say that...
Thanks to my accidental but fortunate death, I had now finally brought myself together......
"......Rosa.
 You are probably regretting that you brought about my death.
 But as for me, I could even thank you.
 *cackle*cackle*...!"
Rosa was already nowhere to be seen.
 Had she gone to call a doctor, or had she escaped from a scene which had become frightening?
...That no longer matters.
{n}That soulless shell is no longer worth anything.
All that aside, ......how frail I am now.
{n}Even this glorious midday sun is agony to me now.
I destroyed my human form.
{n}Then I changed it to several gold butterflies.
......Yes, with my magic power as frail as it is now, this form is easier.
And to escape even a little from the light of the sun, I rode the wind and lightly passed over the cliff.
It will probably be somewhat cooler in the forest.
Anyway, I\'ll take some time to recuperate, and regain my original power.
......As I think of how I will pay Kinzo back for all he has done.
Dancing alone through the air, I looked down at the shore one more time.
On the rocky shore lay the figure I had once possessed, ......and that I would eventually regain.
To regain the form of that physical body I have thrown away,
 ...it will probably take more than one hundred, two hundred days.
...It might require one thousand days, or maybe even more.
However, I am the Endless Witch.
{n}The Golden Witch who has lived for one thousand years.
{n}Waiting any countable number of days is no problem at all.
*cackle*cackle*. Oh, Kinzo.
{n}You may regret that you are not here now.
{n}No longer will you be able to capture me.
{n}...*cackle*cackle*!
".........And then, you changed into gold butterflies, hid in the forest, and waited for your magic power to be restored? Is that what you\'re saying?"
"That is correct.
 I take this form to sneer at you, but normally, it is easier magically for me to keep my form as gold butterflies."
"Don\'t stress yourself and stay in an easy form.
 I wouldn\'t mind not hearing your irritating laugh."
"*cackle*cackle*.
 When I turned into butterflies and slipped into the forest, it was already no longer possible for Kinzo to find me.
 ......However, Kinzo was not about to stand there doing nothing.
 Still, he would be unable to immediately prepare a way to catch me."
"Therefore, he first moved immediately to prevent me from leaving this island,
 and to keep me from regaining my power."
".........My, my. All I can say is that Kinzo\'s tenacity does defy the imagination.
 ...It is pretty tough to be loved by someone like that.
 *cackle*cackle*!"
"A way to keep you from leaving after you became butterflies?
 What, did he put a bug net around the entire forest?"
"Indeed.
 He did the magical equivalent.
 .........Did you know?
 On the sea in front of the harbor floats a reef, on which sits a small shrine of Eastern magic."
"......Ah, that.
 It was gone this year, though.
 It was a small shrine built long ago by a mountaineering ascetic, right?"
"This island was originally an island of distortions.
 Magical beings and other beings of similar ilk were attracted to it.
 ......Milady herself is one of them, I imagine.
 How about some more tea?"
"*cackle*cackle*, please.
 ......They did harm to humans, and probably left several eerie legends behind them."
"That small shrine was built in ancient times by an Eastern mage who heard of them.
 A long time passed, and that power was lost.
 By repairing it, Kinzo restored this island\'s barrier, and once again tied me to this island."
"......Can Eastern magic work on a Western witch like you?"
"Normally the affinity is poor.
 However, for the purpose of sealing me there, in a way, it might have been suitable."
"If it was Western magic, I would have some knowledge.
 For any barrier, there would have been some measures I could have taken.
 But Eastern magic is outside my area of expertise.
 It was as if I had been given chopsticks instead of a spoon for some soup I was trying to eat."
"In a space strongly controlled by Eastern magic, Western magic loses much of its power.
 It would likely have taken her a thousand days to regain her power even under normal circumstances,
 and now it would take her much, much longer."
"......So you\'re trying to say that it took you twenty years to regain your power, and now you are revived, like this?"
"Those were horribly long years...
 I spent many days in the form of gold butterflies, found Kinzo\'s mansion, and watched over him every day.
 I lived through those days with no means to enjoy myself except to ponder how I would get back at him."
"......What was fortunate for me was that during those twenty years,
 Kinzo tried to use every magic to find and capture me, and failed in them all."
"A human cannot bring about miracles very many times.
 Even simply holding me captive for that long had been a miracle far above his place.
 It would be unthinkable for me to be captured like that multiple times."
".........Grandfather said something in the previous game.
 It was something like, magic dwells in probabilistic miracles."
"Mmhm.
 While Kinzo searched for a hidden art to capture me again, he ended up at that.
 ...............Then, he finally worked out the ritual involving the offering of thirteeen sacrifices to revive me again."
"Thirteen......sacrifices..."
"That is the witch\'s epitaph.
 It is a poem of sacrifices.
 ......Six people on the first twilight.
 Two people on the second twilight.
 And then five more people on the fourth through eighth twilights.
 A forbidden ritual, involving the offering of a total of thirteen people as sacrifices...
 Those sacrifices are chosen randomly, and the one holding the ritual, Kinzo himself, is not an exception."
"You\'re out of your mind...
 Are you saying that all of the gruesome murders that occurred on this island were all part of a weird ritual?!!"
I was vaguely thinking that this might be a possibility...
But I can\'t just hear that this is the truth from a witch and a demon and say "Oh, really?" and accept it!
"There are eighteen people on Rokkenjima.
 Thirteen are sacrificed; only five are left alive.
 Then I revive."
"......In other words, the odds that Kinzo will be able to meet me again are probably around one third.
 He bet his own life on those odds,
 wishing for a reunion with me for the last bit of his remaining life."
".........You\'re saying he gathered our family for the sake of that fucked‐up ritual?!
 Oh, yeah, real fucking funny!!
 Don\'t say stuff like that, damn it!!"
"It was according to the contract from the beginning.
 When Kinzo\'s life ended,
 all of the gold I had lent him, and all of the assets that Kinzo had created, were to be received by me."
"......Kinzo put me through a nightmareish ordeal,
 but thinking back on it now, it was an extraordinary period, even amid the past thousand years.
 After all, the natural enemy of a witch is boredom.
 To Kinzo, who offered me a chance to run away from that for several decades,
 yes, considering that among other things, I might have a slight debt to him."
"I decided to go along with Kinzo\'s game.
 And so, first off, Kinzo returns to me the Ushiromiya family Head\'s Ring.
 It is the house revived by my gold, you see."
".........Then I choose thirteen people arbitrarily as sacrifices.
 And as that unfolds, you people are thrown into total confusion,
 and show me various aspects of the fabric of human relationships as you stand against me, which gives me great pleasure.
 I really do like this game of Kinzo\'s!
 *cackle*cackle*."
"Aaaaaaaaaahh!!
 I definitely won\'t believe in that kind of magic story!
 ......Then who are you?!
 You fell off a cliff and died, dammit!
 Your soul slipped out, became butterflies, and went to the forest?
 That\'s all a load of bullshit!!"
"But you are here!
 Who are you?!!
 Aren\'t you the 19th person?!"
"That is true, I most surely am the 19th person.
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*!
 But it\'s no good, I\'m afraid...?
 It\'s no goddamn good at all!!"
"
{p:1:There are no more than 18 humans on this Rokkenjima}!"
"Wha, ...............what did you saaaaaaay......
 So you\'re saying......the X of the 18+X doesn\'t exist?!
 Are you saying the piece that I took...{0}{nobreak:the X}...{0}doesn\'t exist?!"
"Pu ku ku ku...
 That is what it means.
 You have my condolences.
 ...However, Milady, you truly are a fast worker.
 I thought you would let him flounder around a little more before turning everything over at the end.
 Well then, Battler‐sama, would some more tea be agreeable to you?"
"I, I don\'t want any, damn it!!
 I don\'t believe!
 The culprit can\'t be one of the 18!"
"Then, what the hell are you, why are you here?!!
 If the 19th person doesn\'t exist, then are you saying you\'re one of the 18 in disguise?!"
"*cackle*cackle*!
 For you, although you are reluctant to use it,
 doubting one of the 18 will serve as a final escape route, much like castling."
".........However, for me, the hard part is just beginning.
 You need only throw away appearances,
 and you can prepare a culprit freely amid the 18 people!
 Finding a route through those 18 pieces,
 in order to checkmate you and force you to accept me,
 .........will be truly difficult."
"Like hell I\'d do that!!
 I won\'t doubt any of the 18!
 I don\'t want to doubt!!
 Have I really been cornered here again...?!
 Damn it, damn it damn it!!"
"It looks like my game with you, which has lasted three rounds, is finally entering the endgame, doesn\'t it?
 There\'s nowhere to run anymore, you know?
 *cackle*cackle*!
 You don\'t want to doubt any of those beloved people in the 18, riiight? I can take that burden from you if you want?
 And yet, why do you refuse me?"
"They say you should play the opening like a book, the middle game like a magician,
 and the endgame like a machine.
 I\'ll corner you from here on.
 Slowly, carefully, ...surely.
 Or, on the other hand, would it be better if I pressed you all at once, as would be fitting for you?"
"That should suit you, let\'s do that.
 I already have a thorough knowledge of which methods of attack you cannot handle!
 *cackle*cackle*cackle* hihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi!!""...........................Now then.
 How will the game be resolved this time?
 ...You may submit, and you may resist.
 ......Either way, it will truly be an entertaining banquet worth betting my short remaining life on."
In his dimly lit study, which was occasionally brightened by lightning,
 Kinzo kept mumbling to himself, laughing to himself.
On the antique clock with an intricate design that was sitting on his desk,
 the two overlapping hands had begun to tilt to the right, and separate from one another.
The passage of time that had counted to 24 had returned to 0, and begun to start counting again...
"......The passage of time is a brutal thing.
 It drags itself all the way to 24 over the course of a day, and then returns back to 0.
 ......It surely managed to count to 23:59.
 However, was it ever able to reach 24:00?
 ......If you believe that it returns to 0:00 again without reaching it, how futile it seems."
No, is that not the same as a person\'s life?
 You live, aiming for a perfect 24, and in the instant you reach it, you return to 0.
People may praise the departed, saying that they did reach 24, but that is absolutely not 24.
.........It is nothing more than 0.
"I am different.
 ......I will reach 24 alive.
 Because that itself is the Golden Land.
 ...That is {f:5:Beatrice}\'s dwelling."
Kinzo had been fumbling around with some tarot cards for some time.
It looked as though he was trying to divine his own luck, his own propensity for victory, and doing it over every time he didn\'t like the result.
The most forbidden action in tarot reading is to try predicting the same thing twice.
It is a desecration to the result of the fortune telling,
 and also desecrates the existence higher than humans which delivers signs through the tarot cards.
However, Kinzo knew.
The reason the tarot cards shouldn\'t be used twice was that, since it was nothing more than a random number generator,
 it was natural that if you read them twice, a different result would appear.
......Therefore, reading twice was only forbidden to preserve the mystique of the tarot cards\' results.
...However, that didn\'t mean that Kinzo didn\'t take tarot reading seriously.
Kinzo\'s interpretation of tarot reading was done in a completely different way.
That was to repeat the reading, over and over, until he reached the result most favorable to him,
 without the slightest amount of compromise.
It would depend on how he defined the result most favorable to him,
 but if he demanded the best result in a strict sense,
 it would be the same as a simple roulette of luck, where he sought an arithmetic miracle.
......However, to Kinzo, who made miracles of numbers the basis of his magical power, this could become very much like a magic ritual.
In other words,
 until the result he desired appeared perfectly, he would repeat the tarot readings over and over, turning his labor, conviction, and the feelings of his heart into a prayer,
 so that when it reached heaven, the result would be sublimated—this was Kinzo\'s personal magical interpretation.
Therefore, even though the tarot cards Kinzo used were exactly the same as generally used tarot cards,
 the way they were used was completely different...
".................................
 ...Tonight, ......it refuses to go my way."
Kinzo stopped his hands for a second.
...It seemed the result he expected wasn\'t showing up.
On the contrary, many bad cards that shouldn\'t often appear were appearing repeatedly,
 and continuing to interfere with the miracle Kinzo wished for.
"..................Hmph.
 ...Is that how it is?"
It seemed that Kinzo had taken some kind of sign from this abnormal course of events.
But judging by the unlucky cards scattered over the desk, it was difficult to imagine that the sign had been a good one...
For a while, Kinzo closed his eyes tightly, pondering something.
Then as the thunder roared, he made up his mind about something, took the telephone receiver, and dialed.
"............It is I.
 Is Genji there? It is urgent."
"..................haah."
In front of the main entrance, Shannon was cooling her flushed face in the frigid air.
...She had thought...
...that George\'s proposal would surely come sometime.
It wasn\'t as if her heart had been unprepared.
{n}And she had nodded as an answer.
Had she been reckless because of her youth?
{n}Should she have thought about her future more seriously?
She found herself worrying that he might have thought of her as a cheap girl because of her immediate reply.
...Perhaps at least holding off until tomorrow morning would have given the impression of thinking more seriously?
Now that she had already received the ring from George,
 Shannon kept fidgeting in embarrassment, thinking she should have done this, should have done that.
As she did, she heard the sound of footsteps coming towards her, splashing through puddles.
Shannon immediately chased away the emotions welling up inside her.
"......Genji‐sama?
 Kanon‐kun too...!
 I, I\'m sorry, for not coming back right away, umm..."
She grew stiff, thinking that she would surely be scolded for spending too much time in her secret lover\'s meeting with George.
"Shannon.
 The Master has told us to come to the study urgently.
 Let us hurry."
"......Huh?
 Y‐yes, certainly...!
 What in the world...?"
"He said he had an ominous premonition.
 ......How selfish, when he was the one who chose to start this ritual."
"We will enter from the back, so that Gohda doesn\'t notice us.
 Hide your footsteps."
"Yes.
 .........Nee‐san, take care.
 You\'re so noisy."
Kanon was especially good at hiding his presence.
...Like he was a cat.
 He was able to suddenly be there without anyone noticing, and leave in the same way.
So, even if he were to step in a puddle,
 the sound he would make would be far smaller than that of the rain hitting the puddles...
Genji also had that ability.
 ...Well, in the first place, that was how the servants were supposed to be, even going by the name of furniture.
Just like how desks and closets go unnoticed by members of the family,
 the servants also treated being able to show up unobtrusively when they needed to as their greatest virtue.
In that sense, Shannon\'s footsteps still strongly asserted themselves.
...She was also trying to hide her footsteps,
 but compared to Kanon and Genji, well, you could say she was a little more lively...
Eventually they reached the back door, and the three of them entered the mansion.
Immediately, .........they thought they felt something.
It wasn\'t quite a sense of smell, ...rather, they felt it from the depths of their noses,
 ......and this hard‐to‐describe sensation, which you might call a sixth sense, allowed them to perceive that something was different than usual.
"............Genji‐sama."
"...Yes. We must hurry."
That perception caused them to feel that something tense was closing in on them.
Realizing that, the three of them dashed up the stairs, aiming for Kinzo\'s study, still hiding their footsteps.
When they dashed up the stairs, ...that smell of sweet poison particular to Kinzo\'s study reached their noses.
".....................hm."
"What is it, Genji‐sama...?"
"......The barrier is...dead."
"Huh?
 ...............Ah."
After hearing Kanon, she looked at the door to the study.
{n}A scorpion pattern was engraved on the doorknob.
A powerful magic‐repellent.
 The final barrier, which protected Kinzo himself.
It had been broken.
Of course, there was no change to the doorknob that the eye could see.
{n}However, they who could understand things that people couldn\'t perceive, were able to recognize the dramatic change...
"......My lord.
 My lord...!
 It is Genji.
 Please open this door."
Genji called in this way after knocking several times, but there was no answer from the study.
"Shannon, protect our backs.
 Kanon, search inside the room."
""Yes...!""
Kanon put his ear against the door, searching for a presence inside the study.
To protect the backs of the other two, who were watching the door, Shannon faced the other way, with her back to them, prepared for the unexpected.
"............The Master is here, I believe.
 ...However, it\'s too quiet."
"Then he is safe?"
"No.
 It is {i:too quiet}."
"...It............couldn\'t be..."
"My lord.
 Excuse us about the door."
Genji pulled a gold key out of his pocket.
{n}It was the only key to the study that existed, other than the one Kinzo held.
He stuck it in the keyhole, and turned it heavily.
{n}......At a glance, that would have indicated that it really was a strong lock.
However, the fact that the barrier had been destroyed...
meant that this door had long been wide open for anyone with magical power...
The lock made a heavy sound, indicating that the door had been opened {i:to humans as well}.
"......Excuse me."
As Genji respectfully bowed his head,
 and Kanon\'s sense of tension grew tighter,
 and Shannon acted nervous, they entered the study...
They immediately discovered Kinzo\'s figure.
......He was sitting in a reception sofa so that his back faced them.
Genji noticed the person sitting across from him, and again bowed deeply.
Kanon also noticed that person,
 ......and he didn\'t bow his head.
He went in front of Shannon and spread both arms, blocking the way to her.
So without even seeing that person\'s face, Shannon already had a good idea who it was...
"...So you have come.
 {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama."
"Genji, is it?
 You came very quickly.
 Yes, it is better when furniture answers its master\'s call quickly.
 Very different from this person."
"........................
 ......So Ronove‐sama has come as well."
Genji directed his greeting towards the thin darkness behind and to the right of {f:5:Beatrice}, where nothing appeared to be.
Even Kanon and Shannon couldn\'t have imagined that someone would be there.
......However, the darkness answered immediately, and praised Genji\'s eyesight...
"As usual, you don\'t disappoint.
 It has been quite some time.
 .........Dear me, you have gotten old, haven\'t you?
 Have you really reached that age?"
"I have lived a full life.
 ...It appears that your life has grown to be even more full, Ronove‐sama."
"Yes.
 Thank you.
 .........And Shannon, it has been a long time since I last saw you, as well.
 You have grown quite beautiful.
 And, it seems that you have grown quite strong.
 It is good to see."
"............Thank you very much."
"......Nee‐san, who in the world..."
"This will be the first time I have met you, Kanon‐kun.
 ......I have been entrusted with the position of {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama\'s head furniture. My name is Ronove.
 ......I am an old friend of Genji‐san\'s.
 I am also furniture, just like you.
 Although the master I serve is different."
The color of tension didn\'t disappear from Kanon\'s expression in the slightest.
......Serving under a different master, furniture could become kind, brutal, or anything else as desired.
...If he called himself furniture serving the hated {f:5:Beatrice},
 then surely he was a despicable being as well...
"*cackle*cackle*!
 It seems that I\'m completely despised.
 It\'s as though you hate everything to do with me."
{f:5:Beatrice} openly sneered at Kanon\'s hate‐filled face...
Then, Kanon finally observed.
{f:5:Beatrice} and Kinzo were enjoying a chess game, sitting in facing reception sofas.
But Kinzo hadn\'t even quivered.
 He was holding his head with both hands, his eyes closed tight, ...as he contemplated his next move.
......No, was he in anguish...?
".........My lord........."
"I have told Kinzo two things.
 There was good news and bad news.
 ......The good news was that he would have the fortune of being reunited with me before the ritual even ends.
 The bad news was that Kinzo had been selected for the very first sacrifice of the ceremony."
"*cackle*cackle*!
 There\'s absolutely nothing I can do about it.
 Because it truly was decided by the fickle roulette."
"...L‐liar.
 You just take pleasure in killing people......"
"Stop it, Kanon‐kun......"
"......So, Kinzo.
 Isn\'t it about time you decided to accept your loss?
 ......*cackle*, by this, our long lasting contest is resolved, right?"
"................................."
At a glance, you couldn\'t tell the current situation on that chaotic chessboard.
...However, judging from Kinzo\'s anguish and {f:5:Beatrice}\'s malicious relaxedness,
 it looked as though it was already decided...
"............It is unavoidable...
 ...Is this also entertainment?"
"It is to me too.
 ......Concluding my contest with you may bring a flood of emotions, but it has already surpassed love and hate.
 ...It was fun.
 Several decades that were not boring...!"
{f:5:Beatrice} advanced her queen, and made her final move.
......It was thus...
decided.
"Checkmate.
 .........This is a final tribute from me to you.
 Without reserve,
 ...sleep."
"Heheheh,
 ......fuhahaha,
 haah
hah
hah
hah
hah
hah
hah!!"
Kinzo suddenly stood up and laughed, like an opera singer facing a full crowd and spreading his arms,
 ...as though he had succeeded in a century‐long plan.
That laugh...
...spat crimson.
Crimson flames poured out from inside him,
 spitting even out of his mouth, ears, and nose, and all at once, his body was wrapped in hellfire...
But Kinzo kept laughing.
The more he laughed, the more the hellfire spewed from his entire body, and began to char him...
Those flames became a brilliant light,
 which dazzlingly shone on the various magic tools throughout the room, and made their distorted shadows dance across the walls.
...Those shadows looked like the dead in hell, in ecstasy over Kinzo as he burned...
And,
 for one who had made a contract with a witch,
 and who had reached the end of that contract,
 ...it was an extremely fitting end...
After laughing and howling in the roaring flames for some time,
 Kinzo flopped to the ground, as though he was a puppet whose strings had been cut.
Those incredible blazing flames disappeared as though they had burned up everything there was to burn,
 and afterwards, all that was left was a festering and burnt body that would make you want to avert your eyes...
".....................Horrible..."
"Hmph.
 You should talk.
 Even though you think that was a fitting way for him to die..."
"......Why have you shown yourself...?
 Do you have some business with us...?"
"Stop it, Kanon‐kun.
 ......You must not provoke {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama."
"It appears that you have completely terrified them.
 Pu ku ku ku."
"It seems I just can\'t get along with Kanon.
 A pity, I must say I quite like him myself...?"
{f:5:Beatrice} smiled broadly, or perhaps wickedly.
Kanon violently averted his gaze, obviously disturbed.
...His reaction was so different from what he had obviously intended that it made the witch and her butler laugh.
"Kanon.
 ......You stand in the presence of {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.
 Carefully consider your manner of speech."
"Oh, there is no problem, Genji.
 Let him say as he likes.
 I am gracious."
"......How are you gracious...!"
"I am always gracious to those who are about to die.
 *cackle*cackle*...!"
Kanon was brought to sudden realization by that creepy laughter...
{f:5:Beatrice}\'s reason for being here was not just to take Kinzo\'s life.
The first twilight required six sacrifices.
{n}Kinzo alone wasn\'t nearly enough.
{n}...And they had just nonchalantly come to this place...
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!
 Don\'t worry, Kanon.
 ......You won\'t be selected as sacrifices just because you came here.
 ......It was because you were selected as sacrifices that you were called here...!"
".........What.........!"
They instinctively figured it out immediately...
Six sacrifices were required for the first twilight.
{n}After Kinzo, how many more would you need to add up to six?
......In this mansion, the number 5 instantly made them think of the number of servants here...
"............Is that...what you desire?"
"Mmhm.
 ...Thank me, furniture.
 Your days of suffering have tonight finally come to an end.
 You should thank me, as I have come to tell you this."
".........Certainly.
 If that is your desire."
"...G‐
......Genji‐sama..."
Genji had agreed to the witch\'s heartless announcement in his usual manner, without raising an eyebrow.
"After the Master\'s death, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama is our master.
 Answering her demand is our final duty.
 ......Shannon.
 Kanon.
 You have done well serving until today.
 That hard work is now over."
"......As I expected of you, Genji.
 As fellow furniture, I think honorably of you."
"Shannon.
 ......Do you have any objections?"
"......No."
".........I heard that George‐sama gave you a ring.
 Even so, you have no regrets?"
"No.
 ......That blessing was more than furniture deserves.
 ...Just receiving the ring has already fulfilled my feelings."
Shannon had not yet reached as high of a philosophical state of mind as Genji.
 There probably really were regrets left in her heart.
 ...She probably wanted to spend a little more warm time with the person of her thoughts, George.
......But she released herself from that.
 She took a single deep breath, and from that point on, the expression she wore was blank.
"...............Very good."
"I am a little surprised that you have been able to calm yourself this much, Shannon.
 It seems that you have also come to terms with things as furniture."
"Won\'t you at least shed some bitter tears for not being able to spend a night with the man you love?
 What a boring woman."
"............
 .........This feeling cannot be understood by the likes of you, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.
 ......If you desire our lives, please accept them.
 We will solemnly carry out that duty."
"......Good.
 Well said..."
"Pu ku ku ku.
 Just the type of person {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama is bad with."
"Recently, this one has become quite detached.
 ...It seems that I tortured her too much last time.
 Speaking of which, didn\'t I do the same to Battler?"
"...Hmmm.
 Am I still soft?
 Or is my style of cornering them lacking?
 In any case, she\'s just no fun."
".........However, it seems that you will still entertain me, right?
 Kanooon?"
"............Kanon‐kun..."
".................."
Compared to the two who had attained a philosophical state of mind, ...there was a painful anguish on Kanon\'s face.
Kanon was still far too young to accept his demise without regrets,
 after being told of it by a suddenly appearing witch...
"......Kanon.
 I detest boredom more than anything.
 And it isn\'t interesting that those other two have obediently accepted their deaths.
 ......So I don\'t want you to betray my expectations."
"............Are you trying to make me your plaything...?"
Kanon realized that he was being provoked.
...However, no matter how much anger spurred him on, his opponent was a witch.
 He was furniture.
 He had no chance of victory from the beginning.
But the witch was expecting that he would struggle in vain and writhe around,
 and was looking forward to it...
......Just thinking about that was frustrating enough to get his blood boiling.
Was disappointing the witch by refusing to resist, like the other two,
 the only way he could strike back at her...?
"Eldest of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory, Lucifer.
 Arise."
"......Lucifer the Proud, right here."
"Kanon.
 It would be too cruel to force furniture to fight a witch.
 No matter how much anger spurs you on, you could hardly hold hope in a battle you have no chance of winning.
 Of course, a battle without a chance of success would be boring for me as well."
"......So, furniture against furniture.
 Why not resolve it with a battle between furniture?
 That should be enough to allow you some hope for victory, right...?"
"..................
 ...With all due respect, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.
 Is it truly possible that I could yield to this good‐for‐nothing furniture?"
"As if this cute kid would have any chance in hell against me...
 Eheh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eheheh."
".................................kh."
"Show me that you can defeat my furniture of the Seven Stakes of Purgatory.
 If you manage to come out the admirable victor,
 .........hm, let us see..."
"I will let you have free choice over the five people who will escape becoming one of the 13 sacrifices.
 I will unconditionally welcome the five people you recommend into the Golden Land.
 ...How about that?"
Kanon understood that he was being provoked.
{n}......However, the witch\'s condition was very tempting.
The evil ritual the witch and the rest were trying to carry out was, at this point,
 not something that Kanon cared about in the slightest.
......On the contrary, it was much more important for him to survive, be invited to the Golden Land,
 ...and have his wish granted by {f:5:Beatrice} there...
"You cried that you\'d had enough of being furniture, right...?
 I shall grant your desire.
 I shall give you that human body which you wanted so much that you cried yourself to sleep.
 What do you say...?
 Then you could be together with Jessica, right?
 Ooh, just perfect.
 You may include Jessica and yourself in the five you recommend for invitation to the Golden Land."
"......If you have some hesitation toward making only yourself happy,
 then you can add Shannon and her loved one, George, as well.
 If you\'re worried about duty, then you can also add Genji."
"Hoh!
 That\'s five people.
 Just enough room, Kanon.
 .........With this much of a reward, ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*!
 You won\'t let me get bored, will youuuu...?"
"......She\'s just playing with you.
 There is no need to listen to her."
"I, ......I\'m sick of this.
 Is this really what you want, Nee‐san?!"
{f:5:Beatrice} couldn\'t hide her evil smile at those words.
"I\'m sick of this.
 I want to be happy!
 I\'ve had enough of being furniture.
 I want to become human, ......and have normal love...!
 I want to know that...the ocean is blue, like you!"
"............How young.
 I\'m jealous."
"That\'s why I like the young ones.
 ......Genji, Shannon, stay back.
 Kanon, Lucifer, forward."
"As you command."
".............................."
"...Hehheheheheheheheheheheh.
 I don\'t like it.
 ...You know you can\'t win against {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama,
 but you look down on me as though you might be able to win against me...
 ......I {i:really} don\'t like it."
That was probably humiliating to Lucifer.
...But at the same time, she was also happy that she was so lucky to have this lovely prey all to herself...
".........Come, furniture of the witch.
 .........Don\'t think that you can look down on me forever...!"
"Come, now, Battler.
 It is time for another fun show!
 *cackle*cackle*!"
".........Damn.
 It\'s turned into something ridiculous again...
 Like I\'d ever accept that it\'s a magic battle...!"
"Look, look, don\'t turn your eyes away, look at it.
 Look look, look look!
 It\'s magic, it\'s furniture,
 no matter how much you try to deny me and magic,
 look look, look look look look!"
"All this bwaan bwaan, ka‐shing ka‐shing, right in front of your eyes, it was all for nothing, riiiight?
 Look look look look,
 stop thinking already,
 I told you magic exists!
 I told you this is fantasy!
 Don\'t close your eyes,
 look closely,
 look look look look look!!"
"Damn it, damn it damn it damn it...
 I won\'t accept witches, I won\'t accept magic...!
 But if it\'s as obvious as this, what the hell am I meant to say?!
 ...............Damn, damndamndamn!"
"Come now, don\'t turn away, look closely, alriiiight??
 Magic exists, it\'s fantasy, stop playing detective."
"I know all about it, the truth is you\'re awful at thinking about things, riiight??
 Just stop, just stoooop, *cackle*cackle*!
 Look look, obviously fantasy, obviously fantasy, kihhihi{0}hya{0}hyah{0}hyah{0}hyah{0}hyah{0}hyah{0}hyaa{0}a{0}a{0}aahhh!!"
"Shut up shut up shut uuuuuuuuuuup...!!!
 Don\'t talk to meeeeeeee...!!"
".........This guy\'s gotten obstinate.
 ...Get down on the ground right now and apologize for being so conceited that you thought you could "at least beat me".
 If you do, I\'ll spare you, alright...?"
"I\'ll spare you from having your skin ripped off while you\'re still alive,
 and being lashed all over your body as you squirm until you die.
 Hehheh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eheheh!"
"You\'re a cute kid, so apologize...
 If you do, you can spend your last moments in blissful, wonderful ecstasy as I gently, gently finish you off......"
"Be silent, furniture of the witch.
 ...I have no intention of speaking with you."
"S‐......so you say that you think nothing of me, do you...?"
"Hehhheh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eheheh, I don\'t like it, that disrespectful gaze of yours...
 I really don\'t like iiiiit!!"
"............Kanon‐kun..............."
"..........................."
"......Isn\'t he stronger than he was against Satan?"
"That is why humans are so frightening.
 Sometimes they even become witches, and treat demons as butlers."
"Pu ku ku ku ku!
 So, which should I cheer on?"
"...Are you...
......saying that this guy\'s on par with me...!"
".........Don\'t look down on me.
 As long as you have that pride, you can never win against me."
"Y‐y‐
...you speak of Lucifer, the eldest of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory, and say that I can never win?!
 H‐how...conceited!!"
"...Wha..............."
Kanon was desperately trying to stay alive, and he had the strong desire to become human.
But Lucifer didn\'t feel anything stronger than a slight desire to play.
......So, that reached its inevitable result.
 For the ability to yield such a result is the power of humans.
 ...The power of the heart.
"...............That\'s as far as you go.
 You can never win against me."
A glowing red trail extended straight out from Kanon\'s arm,
 ......pointing at Lucifer\'s throat, just beneath the tip of her chin...
"Wh‐
......what is this...?!
 How could I...
 ......There...must be some mistake..."
As she ground her teeth in irritation, she tried to deny the reality right before her eyes.
 ...But no matter how much she believed in her own superiority, it didn\'t change the facts right before her eyes.
"Hoh.
 ...Well done, Kanon.
 Wonderful, you haven\'t made me bored.
 ......How pitiful my furniture is in comparison.
 *cackle*cackle*!"
"......Lucifer.
 You are boring Milady.
 Was this opponent really too much for you to handle...?"
"I\'m disappointed, eldest of the Seven Staaakes.
 Kuhihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi...!"
That would have seemed like nothing more than a simple rebuke to an outsider.
However, furniture serving the witch knew what kind of severe treatment was promised by that rebuke,
 and understood what had been left unsaid...
"Uuuuuuuuuuuguuhhh!!
 You......good‐for‐nothing FURNITU{-}U{-}U{-}U{-}U{-}U{-}U{-}U{-}U{-}U{-}U{-}UURE!!!"
She howled.
 ...Abandoning her last bit of pride, she made her body explode, exposing her true form.
That form was a demon stake, which bounced and deflected off the walls all over the room...
"How could you shame me so much!!
 I\'ll kill you, kill you kill you kill you!!
 You slowpoke!
 Even though you can\'t even follow my movements anymore!!
 I won\'t play around anymore, I\'m seriously mad, I\'ll pierce your heart in one blow!!"
"I\'ll plow right through you, and make a fountain of bright‐red blood reach the ceiling!!
 DIIIII{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}IIEEEE!!"
"Ka‐Kanon‐kun.........!!"
With a speed exceeding even the limits that the human eye could follow,
 Lucifer went wild, and flew at Kanon\'s heart...
Lucifer confirmed that the sweet taste she could feel was definitely Kanon\'s blood.
...But she quickly noticed.
{n}...She hadn\'t pierced Kanon\'s heart...
"............Hoh.
 *cackle*cackle*!"
"This is why humans are frightening.
 ...Would you like some black tea?"
"I am fine for now.
 This is so interesting I don\'t need black tea...!"
"......K‐
............Kanon‐kun............"
"So arrogant......
 ......That\'s why you can\'t win against me......"
The floor was stained with dripping blood.
...It really was Kanon\'s blood,
 ......but it wasn\'t flowing out of his chest.
Kanon had sacrificed his own left hand to protect his heart...
Lucifer was arrogant.
Even though she had been given enough time to realize that this was an opponent capable of cornering her,
 even so, in her pride, she had believed that he was a worthless opponent.
 She had gotten careless.
......So just as she had announced, she had aimed for his chest, trying to pierce his heart.
Because she was arrogant, she hadn\'t even thought of aiming for somewhere other than the place she had announced.
...No, maybe she had thought about it a little.
{n}...However, her pride would not allow her to aim for a different spot.
Because she was...
......Lucifer the Proud.
Kanon, withstanding the pain,
 grasped the demon stake sticking deep into his left hand strongly with his right,
 ...and pulled it out......
The sound of breaking bones and even more blood dripping down could be heard.
{n}Shannon instinctively averted her eyes.
There was an air hole in the back of the pierced hand so big that you could clearly see through to the other side...
Kanon\'s face was filled with agony,
 ......but in this very moment,
 he had won, without a doubt.
The demon stake he was gripping with his right hand turned back into Lucifer again...
Kanon was now gripping exactly where her neck was.
".........Ga,
 ............gu,
 ..................h..."
"...I win.
 .........{f:5:Beatrice}."
Kanon didn\'t hold back at all with the hand gripping Lucifer\'s throat.
......She had challenged him again after their fight had already been decided.
{n}Kanon had no obligation to be considerate.
But even so, Kanon released the witch\'s furniture.
......Was it his naive humanism, his pity for another piece of furniture,
 or a final show of respect to the witch?
In any case, when she was released, Lucifer fell face‐down on the ground,
 and made as if to vomit, moaning over the pain in her throat...
"Spectacular, Kanon.
 ......Your great efforts have gone some way to proving Kinzo\'s research correct."
Ronove was clapping his hands.
...To Kanon, who had achieved a difficult victory, incurring a wound on his left hand that couldn\'t be closed, that applause seemed nothing but shallow.
"......All possibilities are hidden in the human heart, was it?
 .........My, my, this is why humans are frightening!
 Well done, Kanon.
 You are victorious.
 Spectacular!"
"......Haah,
 ......haah,
 ......haah......"
"Are you okay?!
 Kanon‐kun......"
Shannon ran up to him and wrapped a handkerchief around his left hand, which was still spraying blood.
"That was spectacular, Kanon!
 Truly spectacular.
 I was also slightly hoping for an upset.
 How truly wonderful you are as furniture not to let me down.
 *cackle*cackle*!
 I think better of you now.
 I honestly think better of you!"
"Y‐......you better not have forgotten our promise...
 {f:5:Beatrice}..."
"Mhm.
 Of course I have not forgotten.
 Witches and demons are admittedly unjust.
 However, we are much more noble than humans when it comes to our contracts."
"I will not go back on my word.
 I guaranteed that if you won,
 I would give you the right to decide the five people who will escape becoming the 13 sacrifices."
"......B‐{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.
 I haven\'t yet...lo—
higi!!"
{f:5:Beatrice} twirled her pipe, and heaven and earth turned over just for Lucifer.
......So as a horribly natural result, she "fell" onto the ceiling.
The ceiling doesn\'t seem that high to people standing on the floor.
{n}...However, people who fall on it upside‐down and head‐first surely don\'t feel the same way...
"Milady.
 Isn\'t this a little much?"
"*cackle*cackle*!
 That may be so.
 I suppose I will forgive her."
{f:5:Beatrice} spun her pipe again.
When she did, the magic that had been affecting Lucifer was released.
......So as a horribly natural result, this time with extreme legitimacy, she "fell" back onto the floor.
"Agah......!!"
"............Ku,
 ............u,
 ...{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama,
 ...f‐...forgive me............"
"What are you afraid of?
 I have already forgiven you, haven\'t I?
 *cackle*!
 So, Kanon.
 Shall we continue?"
".........Continue what?
 ...You aren\'t saying that you want me to finish her, are you...?!"
"Ah, no, no.
 It isn\'t over yet, right?"
".........What isn\'t?
 ...Stop dodging the question...!!"
"I did promise you, didn\'t I?
 If you could defeat my furniture, of {i:the Seven Stakes of Purgatory}, riiiiiiight?
 Come, arise, Seven Stakes of Purgatory.
 The six younger sisters of the worthless elder sister!"
""""""Kyahhahahahahahahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha!!""""""
With shrill laughing voices, the air split,
 and gold sprayed everywhere as the remaining six of the Seven Stakes of Purgatory showed themselves...
All of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory, only one of which Kanon had been able to defeat by sacrificing his left arm, were gathered...
By now, Kanon regretted his thoughtlessness in accepting the witch\'s challenge.
{n}...He had been foolish to assume that a game with a witch would be on an even footing......!
"............Laaame‐o.
 Onee‐sama, why are you crawling on the floor?"
"Y‐...you people...............
gh......"
"See, this is why Onee‐sama\'s useless.
 Even though she acts like she\'s so great as the oldest sister, that\'s just on the outside."
"Yeah, seriously!
 Lucifer onee‐sama, your disgraceful behavior will damage others\' opinions about all of us!
 Know your shame!
 You novice!"
"............Ku, .........gu......"
"Kanon‐ku~n, awesome awesome.
 But don\'t get cocky, okay?
 Lucifer onee‐sama just brags all the time, she\'s no big deal compared to the rest of us sisters."
"...That\'s why I\'m always saying Lucifer‐nee shouldn\'t do anything.
 It\'s alright if she just brags all the time.
 Because we superior ones always have to clean up the fighting scenes."
"What are you gonna do, Onee‐sama?
 We respect your pride,
 so we were planning on letting you challenge him again in that beaten‐up body without getting in the way..."
"......But Kanon‐kun sure is strong, right?
 Right now, no matter how much you struggle, there\'s no way you can win, right...?"
"......Y‐
.........you peopleee............"
"*cackle*cackle*!
 My, my, you sisters are always so lively.
 Is now really the time for discord?"
"Being a 7‐person unit is what makes you the Seven Sisters of Purgatory.
 Now play nice and execute the task I gave you.
 Swiftly, alright?"
"Come on, Lucifer onee‐sama.
 If you want to borrow the power of your little sisters...
 Say it, okay?
 We want to hear you ask us for help from your own mouth."
"Kh, ............you plan to mock me even more.........?!"
"‘I, the foolish—
weak—
ugly—
shaaameful!—
eldest sister Lucifer, beg my younger sisters to save me’.
 ......C\'mon, let\'s hear it.
 If you let us hear that, we\'ll save you.
 That\'s a deal, right?
 Everyone?!"
"......You.........
...b‐
......bitcheees......"
The Seven Sisters of Purgatory taunted their elder sister, calling her worthless.
 Verbally abusing her.
...Even Kanon, who had been fighting her for his life until a second ago, couldn\'t bear to look straight at it...
"A‐as i—
......as if I...
...could say...
...something like that......"
"Do it quickly.
 Obviously we won\'t get anywhere with you alone.
 Hurry up and slay Kanon as the Seven Sisters."
"Pu ku ku ku...
 Oh, what could be wrong, Lucifer?
 It is an order from Milady, you know?"
"............How cruel."
Lucifer ground her teeth over and over, hurled curses at her sisters, and then,
 ...............as she trembled all over,
 ......she answered her sisters\' request...
"...I, ............I, the foolish,
 ......weak,
 .........ugly...
 ...uuuu...!"
"Shaaaameful!!"
"Sh‐...shameful,
 ......eldest sister Lucifer,
 ......beg...
 .........uuuuuuuughhuhu!!
 Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...!!"
She was finally unable to endure saying those degrading words,
 ...and the girl bearing the name of Pride broke down crying.
However, the six younger sisters kept giggling coldheartedly.
"Heyyyy!
 Don\'t try to trick us by crying!
 You haven\'t finished saying iiiit!"
"That should be enough.
 Come, sisters, let us display our power."
"I won\'t be satisfied until I hear the whole thing, you know?!
 C\'mon, c\'mon, Onee‐sama, keep going!"
"That\'s enough!
 Come on, this shame has been brought upon all of us sisters!
 We won\'t let them return alive!"
"Alright, how should we play with this pitiful furniture?
 Any wonderful suggestiooons?"
"Meee, me!
 Beelze thiiinks...the seven of us shouuuld...get along and split Kanon up between us!"
"Good plan.
 ......That way all of the sisters can get along."
"Then I\'ll take the head!
 All of you can have the limbs!!"
"No no, noooooooooooo!!
 {i:I} get the heaaaad!!"
"You know there\'s no way there\'ll be any meaning to promises like that!
 It\'s obviously gonna be first one there wins!"
"Kuhihihihi!!
 Kanon‐kun, if you have a suggestion for how you\'d like to be killed, just tell us, okay?
 We Seven Sisters will kill you in an awwwwesome way!"
"...........................Damn......"
"......Aaarrrrrrgggh!!
 You\'ve shamed me so much!!
 Even slicing you into eight pieces won\'t be enough!!
 I\'ll slice you into a hundred pieces!!
 Here we go, everyone!!"
""""""Yeees, Onee‐sama!
 Kyahhahahahahahaha!!""""""
The seven of them burst at once.
{n}They had no desire to play or boast.
{n}This time, they would genuinely follow their master\'s order.
...Slay Kanon. Swiftly!
The Seven Sisters jumped around the room faster than the eye could see, deciding how they would kill Kanon.
They tortured Kanon with their cruel giggles, sometimes making a close pass at him.
...They kept scraping his arms, shoulders, and cheeks,
 carving red lines into his body...
At that time, Shannon dashed up behind him, holding on to him so that she blocked the way to his body at least a little.
"{nobreak:{m:-5:—}—}Kh......!!"
"Ah......?!"
At the same time, a red cylinder wrapped around the two of them, like a beam of light sent from heaven.
 That cylinder repelled the evil ones who tormented Kanon...
"Whaaaat!!
 That\'s cheeatiiing!
 This has nothing to do with youuu!"
"Oh, I know what this is.
 She must want to play with us."
"Kyahha!
 Then I\'ll take her!
 Aaall mine!!"
"{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.
 May we have Shannon as our prey...?"
"Hm?
 Aah, I don\'t mind, do as you like.
 It seems Kanon alone won\'t be enough to satisfy your gluttony."
"I am so very grateful.
 Come on, I\'ll make you regret coming out uninvited!"
"I\'ll turn you to scraps of meat so shredded you can\'t even tell who\'s who,
 mix you and mix you and mince you into hamburgers!"
"Idiot, breaking that barrier comes first!
 Do your job before you start worrying about food!"
""""Yees, Onee‐sama!!""""
"Gu......uuu......!!"
As a horribly natural first action, the Seven Sisters began to destroy the barrier Shannon had created.
...Shannon\'s barrier certainly was extremely strong.
{n}It was enough power to impress even {f:5:Beatrice}.
...It was strong enough that frail furniture would turn to dust just by touching it,
 and it was firm, like a tree with deep roots.
But no matter how big a tree gets, it will eventually surrender to a saw or a hatchet.
{n}For the Seven Sisters, "chopping down" Shannon\'s barrier, while it was a pain, was not impossible.
"Hnf......!!"
The sound, like beetles jumping around, grew even more fierce and filled the room.
They cut up and steadily eroded away that red barrier, as though with a hatchet, a saw, no, a chainsaw by now...
"............How foolish.
 You must have known that your barrier can\'t fully protect you from these girls.
 Why...?"
".........Because I can\'t just let it happen."
Shannon spoke back resolutely as she covered Kanon, who was already spent of all his energy and sprawled on the floor.
"If you hadn\'t barged in uninvited, I would have given you a sleeplike death.
 Why have you deliberately exposed yourself to the Seven Sisters?"
"......All death is not equal, you know?
 You realize an intense death tortures you even after you die?
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*!"
"............Go ahead, do as you like.
 Just like you do as you want, I have done as I wanted."
"........................
 ......Hmmmm.
 Somehow, you simply lack entertainment value recently, you know?
 The most interesting part about love is during the time when it\'s uncertain whether or not you will achieve it."
"After achieving it, a woman is like salmon who has finished laying its eggs.
 I have already tired of you."
"Thank you.
 No words I could hear from a witch would make me happier."
"......Hehehehhihihahaha.
 Then, at least in the end, show me a way of dying that will please me greatly."
"Seven Sisters, did you hear that?!
 Show me the limits of your brutality in the way you kill Shannon!!"
"...............Shannon..."
"......My apologies.
 In the end, I wasn\'t able to match up to your greatness, Genji‐sama."
".........You\'re an idiot, Nee‐san...
 If you\'d just left me be, ...then you might not have met this horrible..."
"No, it\'s alright.
 ...I was able to receive the ring from George‐sama, and live as a woman.
 I was able to protect you, and live as a sister.
 With this, my life is settled with no regrets."
"......Nnnngggggaaaaaaaaahhhh, you\'re pissing me off.
 That philosophic view is really irritating!!
 This is why you\'re furniture you don\'t even smell like a humaaaaaan!!"
"Look at {i:me}, {i:I} am human!!
 Don\'t spout off philosophical stuff like you\'re more complete than I am, you furnituuuuuuuuuuure!!"
"............How ugly.
 Is that regret your true form?"
"It\'s not a regreeeeeet, this is called LIVING!!
 You received a ring, so it\'s alright if you die, what?!
 Aaaaah, I can\'t understand it, not a clue not a hope, goddamn astonished, goddamn shocked, no goddamn good at aa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aalll!!"
"......Milady, I might suggest you are acting somewhat undignified."
"Shut up, furniture!!
 Shannooooonn, do you think I\'ll let you die easilyyyyyyyyyyy?!
 Now\'s the time to bite your tooooooongue!!"
"............How pitiful.
 If you can see yourself reflected in my eyes,
 then shudder at your own ugliness."
"Don\'t worry,
 I\'ll crush you mush you mash you up so you\'re even uglier, while you\'re still aliii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}iiive!!!"
At that time, .........Genji softly entered the red barrier.
{n}Maybe that barrier didn\'t block those without ill intent.
Then Genji...softly held Shannon from behind,
 ......and covered her eyes with his right hand.
"............Genji‐sama..."
"You have done enough now...
 .........Go to sleep before me."
"............Yes.
 .........Thank you very much, Genji‐sama..."
".........Mhm."
After that, Genji softly pressed his left hand against the area around her collarbone...
......As he did, from the area where that left hand pressed,
 ......a crimson stain gently spread out.
When Genji removed his hand,
 .........bright‐red fresh blood oozed out of there.
For just the very first instant, it appeared to be shaped like a crimson rose...
And when he removed the right hand that covered Shannon\'s eyes,
 .........there was a peaceful expression on her face, as though she was sleeping.
......And she fell softly,
 ...silently down,
 .........and slept.
Her soul had already been sent to a world where the malicious witch and her furniture could never reach her,
 no matter how evilly they tortured her...
{f:5:Beatrice} and the Seven Sisters were shocked by this scene.
{n}...Only Ronove had a mysterious expression along with his smile.
Then Genji leaned over Kanon, who was crouching on the floor.
".........You did well.
 You, too, should sleep now."
".................................
 ............Yes.
 Thank you very much, Genji‐sama."
Just as he had done with Shannon, after gently covering Kanon\'s eyes with his hand,
 Genji gently covered the area around Kanon\'s collarbone with his other hand.
......And when that was removed with the lightness of a feather,
 ...there was a crimson rose shape.
But that rose shape quickly turned into the stain of bright‐red blood pouring out...
"Wh‐
............what is...that......"
"......What a boring person.
 ...The fun of a balloon of life is in poking it with a needle and making it forcefully explode."
"Spectacular, Genji.
 ............You truly are furniture."
"......Thank you very much.
 ...Well then, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, Ronove‐sama.
 With this as my final task, allow me to rest."
"............Grr.
 You took what I was playing with.
 All of that thrashing and mashing I wanted to do to them,
 I hope you\'re willing to take all that instead??"
{f:5:Beatrice} faced him with an unsatisfied expression,
 but Ronove spoke quietly to Genji with a soothing smile.
"You have worked hard.
 You are my greatest servant.
 ......I shall bestow as a final gift to you a peaceful sleep worthy of all your labors until now."
"Wha?!
 Wait, what are you...!"
When Ronove snapped his fingers,
 ......as if Genji was a puppet that had crumpled from its strings being cut,
 ...suddenly, and yet gently...
He fell, sprawled on the floor, into a sleep that witches couldn\'t call him back from...
That was as filled with kindness as the sleep he had given Shannon and Kanon...
"......What was that, Ronove?
 ......What a boring anticlimax."
"Are you not a powerful Great Witch, Milady?
 Something such as this is not enough to pay attention to.
 ......It is not like you to allow the blood to rush to your head because of provocation from someone like Shannon."
"...........................
 ...hmph."
What was there that {f:5:Beatrice} didn\'t like?
{n}...Was she still unable to remove the thorn of Shannon\'s words?
Ronove laughed lightly, as though lamenting the complexity of the human and the female heart, and ordered the Seven Sisters to go.
......After all, there were still two sacrifices left for the first twilight.
The Seven Sisters cavorted as they disappeared...Gohda was doing the nighttime rounds.
There had never been anything on Rokkenjima outside the Ushiromiya family.
{n}So checking that the doors and windows were all closed had no real purpose.
However, ever since Natsuhi had scolded them saying that this was careless, the nighttime rounds had become part of the servants\' daily routine.
......The reason that Natsuhi had ordered this was the occasional disturbances of the witch.
Everyone who visited this island knew about the legend of {f:5:Beatrice}, the witch of the forest.
 This had become established as this island\'s characteristic ghost story.
Because of that, it was only natural that some people would occasionally say that, when they thought they were alone in the mansion,
 ...they had heard strange sounds, or seen the shadow of a person.
However, when that had created a little too big of a disturbance and reached Natsuhi\'s ears,
 she had made a fuss, thinking that some suspicious person might have been coming in and out.
Apparently, it was said that she had roused all of the servants and had them check throughout the mansion.
Because all of this uproar over the witch had happened before Gohda had come,
 he had only heard about it from the more senior servants.
Ghost stories like that could be found in any workplace.
 Even at the hotel Gohda had once worked at, and at the restaurant,
 there was never a shortage of those types of story.
So when he heard that story on this island,
 he smiled bitterly, thinking "ah, so they have that kind of thing here after all".
He smiled bitterly, but he thought when in Rome, do as the Romans do, and had not slighted that.
Gohda went along with it on the outside, but in his heart he thought it was a childish trick.
 ......At first.
"............This certainly is eerie.
 I see, I understand why the servants got in an uproar over this in the past."
He could understand that if someone, doing the rounds on an eerie night like this,
 saw a lace curtain waving in the breeze from a window which hadn\'t been closed,
 they might be tempted to believe they had seen a ghost.
"So there\'s a curse if you make fun of the witch of the portrait, huh.
 ......Seems like there were servants who got hurt really bad and quit, too.
 ...I\'d hate to be injured.
 I\'m already this old.
 Doubt I\'ll ever be blessed with a workplace this hospitable again...
 Aaah.
 Great witch of the portrait.
 I\'m really gonna work hard here, so please go easy on me."
Gohda prayed to the portrait, his hands together, as though he was at a Shinto shrine...
At that time, ...he thought he heard a sound.
The kitchen?
 Was that the sound of something metal falling on the floor?
Surely a mouse or a cockroach hadn\'t come out, and knocked over some of the dishes...
 No, no, how could that be.
 It was routinely and thoroughly cleaned!
Gohda thought that in any case he had better check what that noise had been, and entered the kitchen.
He turned on the kitchen light.
{n}......When he did, he heard a strange sound.
Clankclankclankclankclankclank.
......To a cook like Gohda, that sound seemed like the lid on the pressure cooker or something was shaking.
Of course, it couldn\'t be in use when no one was in the kitchen.
{n}If someone {i:had} been using the gas, what a dangerous thing to do, to just walk away from it.
...Just in case, Gohda decided to inspect the area around the gas range...
"...............What is this...?"
When he did, in the corner by the gas range,
 ...the pressure cooker really had been placed there, just as he had thought.
But the flame wasn\'t on.
{n}...And yet, the lid was clanking...
Was something fermenting and leaking gas?
{n}...How could that be?
 ......Then was there a mouse or something inside?
{n}...How could there be, ridiculous...
In front of people, Gohda acted as though he had a bold personality fitting for his build,
 ......but he actually had an unexpectedly timid side to him.
He was terrified to find out what might be inside, and he couldn\'t check it carelessly...
In his cowardice, ...he grabbed a nearby wooden pestle,
 and with a {i:clunk!},
 he tapped it a little strongly against the side of the pressure cooker.
When he did, the clanking sound suddenly stopped.
...He should have been relieved now that it had stopped,
 ...but the fact that it had stopped when he had hit it was even more eerie, and made him even more suspicious about what was inside...
"............nn, ...*gulp*.
 .........Strange phenomena do not exist in this world, no sirree.
 Yes, there\'s no such thing as witches, or magic, things like that can\'t possibly exist.
 All phenomena can be explained with science.
 ......As though monsters and witches could exist...!"
He repeated that many times, trying to build up his own confidence.
 ...It was quite comical how he looked completely different from what he was saying.
"Who would believe in a witch, who would believe in magic or curses...
 ......Come on,
 ......show me what you really are...!
 Take that!"
......He removed the lid of the pressure cooker.
And lying exposed there...
was the sparkling clean silver bottom of the pot.
......There was absolutely nothing frightening like he had imagined.
"...............Whew.
 ...Hahahaha, well, of course.
 ...There\'s no way there could have been anything inside."
By now, Gohda realized that he had been a coward.
......So while he still had some doubts about what had caused the lid to make that sound,
 ...he explained it away abstractly as some quirk of positioning or something, and decided not to worry about it too much.
Then he took the lid he had grabbed, ......and softly set it back down where it had been.
......It\'s alright, there won\'t be a sound.
 ......Obviously.
{n}As if witches or magic could exist...!
Clank.
 Clankclankclankclank.
"...............Huh...?"
Clank{0}clank{0}clank{0}clank{0}clank{0}clank{0}clank{0}clank.
CLANK{0}CLANK{0}CLANK{0}CLANK{0}CLANK{0}CLANK{0}CLANK{0}CLANK{0}CLANK{0}CLANK{0}CLANK{0}CLANK{0}CLANK{0}CLANK!
"Hii, ......HIIIiiiIIIIii!!"
All of the pots and utensils in the kitchen started clanking at once.
And it grew stronger still, until finally, it became so strong that the lid to one of the pots fell off...!
And, ......from inside that pot, .........a slender white arm slowly streeeetched out.
The lid fell off another pot, and another hand slowly streeeetched out,
 and anotherrrr,
 and anotherrrr...
"Hiiiiiiiii!!!
 Witches aren\'t, witches can\'t be reeeeeal!!
 I\'ll never believe iiiiiiiiiit!!"
When the number of arms grew to seven, a loud, shrill laughter split the air.
"What a letdown!
 It\'s a reeeeal letdown that a person who can make such delicious food is such a lightweight!!"
"If you don\'t need him, I\'ll take him, he\'s all mine!!"
"Wait, I said nooooooooooo!!
 I\'m gonna take him!!"
"Huh?!
 Wha, whaa?!?!
 HYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!"
""""Kyahahahahahahaha!!!""""
Come on, let\'s search, there\'s only one more.
{n}That old hag!
 Where is she?
{n}Not the mansion, maybe the guesthouse?
Kuhihihihi, you snooze you lose, right, you snooze you lose, right?!
Come on, search search, find her find her...!
Don\'t get noticed by the relatives in the dining hall?
Don\'t get noticed by the kids in the guesthouse?
Search in silence, kill in silence!
{n}After all, it\'s still just the first twilight!
She isn\'t in the guesthouse.
{n}But she wasn\'t in the mansion either?
Hey hey, I found her, I found her, she\'s in the rose garden.
{n}Why\'s she standing around there without an umbrella?
She\'s given herself up, all mine all mine all miiine!
{n}You slowpokes can just sit there and watch!
I told you, nooooooo, this one\'s miiiiiiiiiiiiine!!
Come on, if we take any longer we\'ll be scolded by {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama!
 Let\'s take care of it all at once!
"......................................."
Come on, found her, surrounded her!
 Come on, let\'s get along and do it all at once, okay?!
 Diiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiie!!!
".........Eeeh...?
 .........Huh?"
"Wh‐
......what is...
...this..."
"............Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho.
 What naughty girls.
 ...Could you be friends of that child...?"
"...What is with this............o‐old hag...?!"
"There\'s got to be some mistake!!
 One more time!!"
"......Why can she defend against us?!"
"Move aside!
 One more time!!!"
"............No matter how often you try, it\'s useless.
 This person...is good."
"...............I am waiting for that child.
 Would you mind calling for her?"
"D‐do you think we\'d be apprenticed to you like that?!"
"There\'s no need."
"{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama...!"
"............It was sufficient for even myself to manifest.
 ...I was sure that you would awaken."
"Ronove.
 It has been a long time.
 ......Yes, it truly has been a long time."
"This woman, she didn\'t use "sama" for his name......!"
"..................And...
it has been a long time for us also.
 ...{f:5:Beatrice}."
"Sh‐she\'s not even using "sama" for {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama..."
"Enough.
 Do you know who this person is?
 ......{f:5:Beatrice} was originally this person\'s name.
 I merely inherited that name from her.
 ......This person is my master.
 The Predecessor Lady {f:5:Beatrice}."
"The Predecessor...
...Lady {f:5:Beatrice}......"
Gold butterflies appeared in ones and twos from the garden of roses and began to gather around Kumasawa...
And after becoming a golden radiance and enveloping her, they burst and disappeared—and Kumasawa\'s form was no longer there.
...Instead, there was another Golden Witch, .........the one who had, in the past, explained to {f:5:Beatrice} the path of an Endless Witch,
 the only person {f:5:Beatrice} had called Master in her entire life.
Her hair was long, beautiful, and vividly youthful,
 and her figure in that elegant dress was unrecognizable as an old lady...
No, this looked like a completely different person than Kumasawa.
".........Well, well, Master.
 I never even dreamed the day would come that we would meet each other again."
"Yes, me too.
 ...Certainly, I never even dreamed that my sleep would be disturbed."
"Such a troublesome time for you to awaken.
 ......If you remained sleeping as usual, the first twilight could be finished without much trouble."
"...Or should I welcome you?
 ............I was just a little bored."
"......Just as usual, it seems you are toying with sinless people in a vulgar game.
 ......I believe I have taught you many times that the power of the Endless Witch must not be used to cause people trouble."
"Don\'t say that, Master.
 Isn\'t boredom our natural enemy?
 This is just a little spice to escape from that."
".........Tch.
 The more the corrosion advances, the stronger my power becomes, and the easier it becomes to call my minions.
 ...But who would have thought it would release the seal on you, Master, at the same time..."
"It was because I predicted that,
 that I slept very close to you like this.
 ......As I prayed in my sleep that I would not be woken again.
 ...Being reunited with you like this is a very sad thing for me."
"..................You\'re as cunning as always, Master...
 *cackle*..."
"Ronove.
 Have the furniture children step back.
 Furniture merely serves its master.
 The master is responsible for all of her crimes."
".........Certainly.
 Madam {f:5:Beatrice}."
"I have already surrendered that name to this child.
 ......Come now, step back.
 Furniture girls.
 ......For those who do not listen the first time, I say it a second.
 However, I do not speak it a third..."
"......Step back, Seven Sisters of Purgatory.
 If you get involved, you will be turned to dust..."
"B‐......back, everyone..."
Ronove and the Seven Sisters of Purgatory retreated.
After that, there was the {f:5:Beatrice} whose bold expression didn\'t falter,
 and the master {f:5:Beatrice}, who had given up that name, and wore a composed smile...
"Well then.
 ......Master.
 What tea shall I prepare for our long awaited reunion?"
"Let\'s see.
 This reunion was longer in coming than the visit of a comet.
 I will accept your hospitality.
 .........If there appear to be any issues, then my name and the title of Endless Witch,
 ......I will have them returned, understand?"
"*cackle*cackle*!
 So there\'s even a license renewal policy for the title of Endless Witch?"
"......As you say, Master.
 See how splendid your disciple has become,
 and see how far she has surpassed what you were long ago...!"
It looked like sparks exploded in the air between the two {f:5:Beatrice}s.
Just by glaring at each other, they purged all spirits from that space.
...As they watched, the Seven Sisters shivered.
 ...Because if they had retreated just three steps less than they had, they would already have been turned to dust by now.
"So, come.
 {f:5:Beatrice}.
 ...Surrendering my name to you is the only regret I have in my life.
 I will now correct that error with my own hands!"
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*...
 ...Tut tut tut.
 ......That\'s wrong, Masterrr.
 My only error...
was becoming your disciple to learn this trifling level of power, got thaaaat?"
"You call this magic?
 You call this being an Endless Witch?
 ......The power to notice, that\'s all it waaas!
 And you made suuuch a big deal of it.
 Your time is long past, Masteee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}eeer!!"
".........I,
 ......I, I don\'t have a clue what\'s going on anymore......!
 What in the world is happening right in front of my eyes...!"
"......Poor thing.
 It seems my disciple is causing you trouble.
 I apologize."
"Y‐...you... Who are you?
 Why did Kumasawa baa‐chan turn into an attractive lady like this?!
 I mean, who are you?!
 I don\'t get it?!
 What kind of special effects are these?!
 My head feels like it\'s gonna explode!!"
"I am the witch master of that child.
 My old name was {f:5:Beatrice}.
 When she succeeded me, I gave her that name, so I do not have a name."
"You already said it, but your disciple\'s being a real pain to me!
 Please, take responsibility and do something!
 No, wait!!"
"I don\'t believe in stuff like this!!
 As if witches and magic are real!!
 I won\'t accept this messed‐up battle!
 Damn it all to hell, what am I supposed to believe?!!"
"Hoh‐hoh‐ho...
 Just like you, hospitality with a very quick temper."
"...*cackle*cackle*.
 I\'d expect nothing less from you, Master.
 It looks like this level of magic is so insignificant to you, you can\'t even be bothered to open your eyes...!"
"Looks like it\'ll be impossible unless I\'m prepared to wreck the whole island, riiiiiight?
 Come, arise, Shoulder War Towers!!"
In response to {f:5:Beatrice}\'s summons, a terrific earth tremor split the rose garden.
And on either side of her shoulders, two massive War Towers sprouted and stabbed into the heavens.
 They stretched 100 {c:86Ef9C:merute} tall, and each one had over 360 ports.
They were War Towers of the gods\' army corps, which had not allowed the heroes of antiquity to invade their precincts, even as they banded together.
As {f:5:Beatrice} elegantly floated in the gap between the massive two‐headed towers, she looked down on her master, sneering with an absolute superiority.
With the two massive towers lined up behind her shoulders, the witch looked very small,
 like a butterfly dancing between large trees.
"Hihhyahhyahhyaaaaaa!!
 Don\'t think you can dodge it by turning into butterflies, alright?
 The density of the twin towers\' barrage wouldn\'t just make you a pinned bug collection, it\'d make you a madly stabbed pincushion, get it...?"
The towers\' more than 720 ports opened, and godly soldiers readied their multi‐shot ballistas.
"Does that conclude your turn?"
"Heh, {i:those} are your last words?!!
 OPEN FIII{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}IIIRE!!!"
Ballista shots numbering easily over a thousand were all fired at once, drawing a beautiful geometric curtain of death.
The boorish sound performed by those bowstrings was probably even deeper than the sound of Death swinging his scythe.
"Come, arise, Fallen Tower.
 Split the single language, and make known the sin."
The sky was stained an incandescent red, and from between the clouds, a blazing, massive tower fell upside down.
That massive falling tower and its rubble...
swallowed the thousands of ballista shots, so that not one of them could approach the body of the witch who had summoned it.
Yes, none can approach the mysteries of heaven.
{n}That was the truth of the Fallen Tower.
"As I would expect from you, Master!
 If you do something, you always do it big!!
 Kuhhuhu{0}hu{0}huhya{0}hyahya!!"
"My turn isn\'t over.
 Come, arise, Sons of Ivaldi.
 Bestow upon me a worthy spear!"
As the massive crimson tower that had fallen made a mighty gold‐colored explosion,
 from inside those flames, a spear showed itself, of such massive proportions that you had to look up to see all of it, much like a tower.
...It was too large for even a giant\'s hand.
It was a divinely beautiful spear of the gods, so massive that it gave the illusion that the tower which had fallen had turned into a spear of the same size.
 A spear of certain victory that no one could escape.
"It looks like your twin towers are useless.
 How foolish that you blocked off your means of escape on both sides.
 You can\'t defend against even a single spear!"
When she snapped her fingers in command,
 the massive tower‐like spear shot at {f:5:Beatrice} like a lightning bolt.
As the Golden Witch danced in the gap between the towers like a butterfly,
 it sliced straight through the air like a flash of lightning,
 aiming right for the very middle of the absolute center of her heart, with the most ultimate and extreme precision.
"Hah!!
 So, you use Gungnir in a place like this!!
 You really are incredible, Masteeeerrrrr!!"
"Explode, useless towers!
 Arise, Giant Soldier Battle Line.
 Fully block that divine spear with your shields and chests!!"
The Shoulder War Towers exploded in gold.
{n}They became several billion gold butterflies.
Those butterflies took the shape of seven massive armored soldiers.
Each stretched a full 50 merute into the sky,
 and they lined up in front of {f:5:Beatrice}, protecting their master and holding massive shields which towered like windmills.
Their massive size was evocative of a mountain range.
 The witch hiding behind them was like a small moon hiding behind the mountains.
Once in the past, when the massive shields these giants held had been readied by the whole giants\' regiment,
 they had protected King Wilhelm\'s castle not only from arrows, but from the wind and the rain,
 and when they had faced upwards and held their shields to the heavens, not a single raindrop had gotten through.
"Foolish.
 How pitiful is the witch who has forgotten her respect for the divine.
 Did you think that giants could defend against a spear of the gods?!"
"......Indeed.
 No matter how much human metal you are armed with, you cannot block a spear of the gods.
 A wonderful epaulette mate by Madam."
"No way?!
 {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama!!"
"Of course I haven\'t forgotten, Master!
 Come, arise, Hephaestus and his disciples.
 Bestow upon me a worthy shieeeld!!"
A golden whirlwind arose at the feet of the Giant Soldiers.
{n}It was a group of countless butterflies.
...They attached themselves to the massive shields like gold leaf, sparkling like they were a gold mirror.
That was the absolute defensive wall that the King of the Gods gave to the goddess.
{n}The Aegis Shield.
When the holy spear, which left a dignified tail behind it like a comet, crashed into the mountain range of that gold shield,
 there was a terrible thunderous roar.
 It was the creaking of the pillars that held up the heavens.
The Divine Spear spun around and around, sent flying in the direction the sun sets.
"Impossible...
 Sh‐she defended against the Divine Spear...!!"
"No, that is not correct.
 The holy spear avoided the impact.
 It is the law of the gods that an absolute spear and an absolute shield must not fight each other.
 Although in the end, it means the same thing as defending against it."
"..................Churlish fighting appears to be the only area in which your skills have improved."
"Or rather, it seems that you are still as bad as ever at this kind of game, Master.
 It\'s my turn to strike back.
 I shall follow the code and counter a spear with a spear."
The Giant Soldier Battle Line, which had fully blocked the Divine Spear, released their holy gold shields.
The shields fell to the earth, making the ground shake.
And then another gold whirlwind arose,
 and the seven gold shields changed their form into seven massive spears of lightning lying on the ground.
In unison, each of the giants lifted a leg high, and firmly stomped on the tips of the handles.
As the earth shook with a thunderous sound, the seven lightning spears spun beautifully and flew up above the Giant Soldiers\' heads.
...They covered everywhere in a spray of gold as they began to fall before the giants.
Each of the giants squared off, and with the force of their whole body, they kicked and smashed them into pieces.
Those broken pieces numbered exactly 30 each, and became lightning spears of exactly the same size as the original,
 which made 210 for all 7 of them; and all of those burst at once,
 each splitting into 30 thorns, so that there were 6,300.
They became a thundercloud barrage, drawing out a beautiful geometric pattern,
 and then each of those changed into three bolts of lightning, so that 18,900 thunderbolts shot at the Predecessor {f:5:Beatrice}.
"It\'s oveeeeer!!
 {f:5:Beatrice}‐samaaa!!"
"I would expect nothing less.
 ......From Madam."
Certainly, a bundle of almost 20,000 thunderbolts should have reduced the master\'s body to dust.
 But there was no impact.
{f:5:Beatrice} knew immediately that she had been fooled.
At that moment, from the direction the sun was supposed to set, she felt an impossible ray of sunlight.
A brilliant ray of light shone on her profile.
It was the figure of the master, holding aloft the spear of the gods that had supposedly been repelled a short while ago.
{n}...She bore a brilliant radiance like the sun on her back, and made it shine on the incarnation of darkness.
...{f:5:Beatrice}, watching from there,
 was trapped like a mouse in a cage, cornered in a dead‐end formed by the Giant Soldier Battle Line.
By now, the Predecessor {f:5:Beatrice} had seized a position directly alongside the Giant Soldier Battle Line.
"Now we are done playing, {f:5:Beatrice}...!"
".........H‐have I...
exposed my flaaaaank......?!"
Her bold expression hadn\'t faltered once before now, but now it twisted for the first time.
And faster than {f:5:Beatrice} could click her tongue, the Predecessor {f:5:Beatrice} released the holy spear.
In mid‐air, it sprung up into the air once more, and changed its form once again.
"Come, arise, Dvergar brothers.
 Bestow upon me the giant‐smashing Iron Hammer of Heaven!"
"Giant Soldiers, protect me!!!
 What are you doing, you slowpokes!!!"
By now it was no longer a spear, but the whirlwind of a massive hammer that raised a sound like a windstorm as it flew through the air.
It was the legendary hammer that had shaken the King of the Frost Giants.
{n}So the Giant Soldiers couldn\'t escape from that fear.
So no matter how much their master ordered them, they couldn\'t block the path of that hammer.
"Back rank mate!
 Rest in peace."
"...Damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit.........!!!"
Before the whirlwind of this massive chunk of metal, {f:5:Beatrice} was nothing more than a mere speck.
The instant the whirlwind started to suck {f:5:Beatrice} in, {f:5:Beatrice}\'s form turned into a massive War Tower.
The Iron Hammer smashed the War Tower, scattered tremendous amounts of rubble, but it did not reach she who had escaped behind it.
Furthermore, when the smoke started to settle, the War Tower had sucked in the massive Iron Hammer without crumbling, and blocked the way.
Even the giant‐smashing Iron Hammer couldn\'t break through the final tower protecting the witch.
However, this War Tower was in fact the witch\'s last trump card.
{n}It was a War Tower for dodging that could only save her from danger once.
But this tower was impregnable.
 No weapon could break through it.
Just then, the moon disappeared.
 As {f:5:Beatrice} hid in the shadows of the Giant Soldier Battle Line and the War Tower, she looked up at the sky.
When she did, inside the moon was the figure of a massive horse ridden by the god of war and death.
The Predecessor {f:5:Beatrice} rode the horse with him.
His cloak had blocked the moon and swallowed it in an eerie shadow.
{n}And the spear of the gods was in his hand once more...
It was, in other words, a godly knight who had jumped over the ramparts formed by the Giant Soldiers and the War Tower, attacking from the heavens.
"......*cackle*...
 You got meee..."
"Smothered mate.
 It was fun, {f:5:Beatrice}!"
"Uuuoooooo{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}oooo!!!"
The struggle to the death between the two witches with the same name...was resolved.
The spear that had been launched from the heavens pierced the ground.
The Giant Soldier Battle Line and the War Tower split up into countless gold butterflies, shrouding the area in a golden storm.
Then, the sound of thunder.
 ......And the sound of the falling rain and wind.
Suddenly, that place was the empty rose garden once more.
{n}...The butler and the rest were watching the two witches confronting each other.
.........But only {f:5:Beatrice} was different.
She had been pierced straight through by the spear, from the base of her neck and her right shoulder, to her left buttock,
 unable to even reach the ground with her feet,
 ...horribly exposed like a pitiful pinned butterfly, tormented by the wind and rain...
".........B‐{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama..."
".....................
 Truly...
she is a fearsome person."
"It is decided.
 {f:5:Beatrice}."
"......Ku,
 ......hihihihi,
 ......ouch...h..."
{f:5:Beatrice} wore a bitter smile of false courage,
 but a strand of blood dangled from her mouth, making her look even more pitiful.
"The title and power of the Endless Witch.
 You will now return them to me along with the name {f:5:Beatrice}.
 ...You are too immature to be called the Endless Witch."
"............Stop...
 Forgive me, Master...
 I was just fooling around, okay......?"
"I will take my name back from you.
 I will return you to your original form.
 Relinquish this power which is beyond you, and live a life suitable for yourself."
".........Come, try to remember.
 What form did you have?"
The Predecessor {f:5:Beatrice} began to recite the words of power.
{n}When she did, small gold butterflies gathered around the skewered {f:5:Beatrice}, and began to swarm about her.
Like butterflies sucking the nectar out of flowers...
{n}...they began to suck the magical power out of {f:5:Beatrice}.
And it seemed that it caused her intense pain.
{n}A cry of agony escaped from {f:5:Beatrice}\'s mouth.
She no longer had any power to resist it...
"Come, try closing your eyes.
 Try to remember.
 What form did you have?"
".........Come, {f:5:Beatrice}?
 Repeat it with me.
 Let us chant together.
 Then it will be over in no time.
 Let us end your pain as fast as possible."
"...Kuhihihi,
 ......ha,
 ...haha...
 ......You\'re right...
 How long has it been...
......since I chanted with you, Master......"
"Now, together.
 .........Come, try to remember.
 What form did you have?"
"......Come, try to remember.
 What form did you have...?"
When the two of them began to recite the same chant,
 more and more gold butterflies danced around, swarming around {f:5:Beatrice}...
".........It\'s alright, Milady.
 You will lose the fact that you are my disciple,
 but that will not change the fact that you are the lady I serve."
"...After that, I shall read a book for you again.
 I shall bake you apple pies again.
 Just like it was long ago.
 ......Come, try to remember."
"......Hahahahahaha...
 Yes, try to remember.
 ...Are you finally starting to remember...?
 ............Well, Master.
 Did you remember...
...that thing behind yooou...?"
"...What is this...?
 .................................This is..."
When the Predecessor {f:5:Beatrice} looked behind her,
 ............there was a creepy hedgehog crouching there.
No.
 ...It was...
...herself.
There was another Predecessor {f:5:Beatrice}, whose whole body was packed with ballista shots,
 ......lying there like a pincushion doll...
"......Come, try to remember.
 What form did you have?
 ......No, I suppose that\'s wrong."
"......Come, try to remember.
 How were you killed?
 ......Kuhihihii, kuhya{0}hhya{0}hhya{0}hhaa{0}a{0}a{0}aaahh!!"
The Predecessor {f:5:Beatrice} was shocked.
...Instantly, her form began to grow faint...
"This......
 ......When...did you............"
"In the beginning, I did not summon Shoulder Towers.
 They were Quadruplet Towers.
 Master, you nonchalantly stepped across the Seventh Rank Rook boundary of death created by the two hidden towers,
 which were lurking in the distance on either side of you."
"......It was bad manners for me to say "check" so late.
 Let me openly apologize.
 ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"
The battle had been decided at the very beginning.
 It had been over since the time the Predecessor had leaned forward, readying her holy spear to attack {f:5:Beatrice}, who had been wedged between her Shoulder Towers.
...The hidden towers lurking on either side had bathed her in a windstorm of ballista shots from 720 ports on both sides,
 pinning and killing her.
However, {f:5:Beatrice} hadn\'t wanted it to be resolved with that.
{n}She had wanted to make her master take her next move, and had continued acting as though the game was still on.
She had immediately revived her with the Endless power,
 ...and had made her continue the game as though nothing had happened...
Then the Predecessor slowly remembered that she had already been killed,
 ......and began to completely erase her form.
When she did, the spear which had pierced {f:5:Beatrice} also erased itself.
{f:5:Beatrice} finally fell and landed on her feet.
{n}...There wasn\'t even a trace of a scar.
".........It was fun,
 Master.
 If you want to play again, I\'ll revive you any time.
 And once we\'ve had some fun, I\'ll make you remember that you were a corpse again."
"Okay?
 I\'m fully obeying what you taught me, you know...?
 Didn\'t you say to always put a toy back in its box when you are done playing with it?
 *cackle*cackle*, hahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"
"......Was it...an easy victory?"
"You fool, it was a difficult victory!!
 ............If I hadn\'t tricked her with the Quadruplet Towers, I would have been the one to die!
 ......As I would expect from my master.
 .........But now I may feel proud."
"...Now, I have completely surpassed my master.
 Ronove.
 Make Master\'s remains a little better.
 ......I haven\'t lost my respect for her that much."
"Certainly.
 Tonight\'s first twilight became a little too riotous.
 It will require some cleaning up.
 It shall be handled immediately.
 Goats, it is time to clean up."
When Ronove snapped his fingers, blazing, sparkling eyes began to blink open in the shadows and darkness,
 becoming goat‐headed attendants, which appeared one after another, slowly out of the black.
One by one, they lined up behind Ronove\'s back, wordlessly standing at attention.
"What shall be done about the six bodies this time?
 Another locked‐room format?"
"......I am not in a mood to think now.
 I will leave it to you.
 ...An extraordinary locked room to torment Battler, if you would."
"Certainly.
 It shall be extraordinary."
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*, hahhhahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!!
 Allllright, where is Battler?
 Battleeeeer, did you watch my big momeeeeeeeeent??"
".........Damn iiiiiiiiit...
 After being shown that screwed up magical storm, what can I deny?!"
"Do witches exist, I ask?!
 After all those kabooms and kabangs,
 after being shown all that tremendous fantasy, what can I deny now?!!
 I don\'t get it anymore!
 It was like that last time too, but how can I deny that awesome, wonderful magical battle?!"
"I knoo~w, rii~ght?!
 After watching this, you can\'t talk your way out of it anymore, caaaan youuuuu???
 Alright, Battler, let me hear some ridiculous reasoning, kuhhi{0}hhyah{0}hyahhya!
 Uhhiehhiehhyaaahhh!!"
"Milady, your laugh is undignified."
"Oh, my apologies.
 But I am not to blame."
"After all, when Battler tightly closes his eyes, grinds his teeth and shows me that ever‐so‐bitter expression,
 it just automatically slips out of my mouth, you seeee...
 Kuhhihihhyahhyahaah!!"
"Come, Battler‐sama.
 Why don\'t you return to the table without losing heart?
 Milady is expecting your counterattack, you see...?"
"Fuck you!!
 How the hell can I make a counterargument?!"
"In the first place, this has all been fucked up since about the time that the tower sprouted up out of the earth!!
 Should I say that, actually, underground on Rokkenjima, there\'s a secret laboratory for massive transforming combining robots or something,
 and that by pushing a button, a strange tower sprouts up?!"
"Right, and then those huge giants must be robots,
 or maybe an evil secret association\'s mecha‐monsters?!"
"It makes no goddamn sense!!
 Don\'t talk to meeeeeeeeeee, uuo{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}o{0}oohhh!!!"
"C\'mon c\'mon c\'mon c\'mon, don\'t cry, alright??
 Kaboom, kabang, it\'s magic!!"
"If you want, I\'ll crush the moon and make comets fall like rain!
 I can even bury the whole island in those bouncy‐chested babes you like so much, seeeeeeeeee??
 Hihhihhihhihhi!!"
"Come come, look look look, my turn is over, seeeeeeeeee?!
 Show me your response, counterattack!!
 You can\'t, can yoooooouuu?
 I\'m a quadrillion percent sure that you can\'t!!
 You\'re useless against this, riiiiiiiiiight?
 You actually like this kind of fantasy, don\'t yooooouuu??"
"I know all about it, this kind of stuff\'s been going around everywhere lately hasn\'t it?!
 In manga and light novels, in anime and movies!
 Some teenage brat has a whole bunch of some strange special abilities, and there\'s all these kabooms and badooms with the fate of the world at risk!"
"You looove that too, don\'t you?!
 I know, don\'t hide it, you love it, right, hiihyahhyahhyah!!
 That thing that you love just displayed itself a little before your eyes, that\'s all, riiiiight?"
"Why do you believe it in manga and anime, but you won\'t believe in meeeeeeeeee??
 Believe, believe, believe it!
 You can\'t argue back, not after you\'ve been shown something like this, riiiiiiiiiiiiight?"
"C\'mon c\'mon c\'mon c\'mon, answer me,
 you don\'t need to think, you can just obediently say "I\'m sorry, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama"!"
"Come on come on try saying it, "I\'m sorry, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama", try saying it, say it say it, don\'t be embarrassed,
 kukikiki{0}kak{0}ka{0}ka{0}kah{0}hyah{0}hya{0}a{0}a{0}ah{0}ha{0}hha{0}hha{0}ha{0}hhha{0}hahhya{0}aahh!!"There was no way to notice the coming of morning without opening a window and looking at the cloudy sky, which had become a tiny bit lighter.
It wasn\'t a refreshing morning.
 All that could be heard was the sound of the rain, which had kept falling since last night, and the howl of the wind...
"......It\'s hard to imagine that it\'s morning.
 This horrible weather reflects our hearts."
"Then I\'d say it\'s pretty gentle, considering.
 We should count ourselves lucky it\'s rain that\'s falling and not spears."
"Wahaha.
 Whether it\'s rain or spears, bring it on, I say."
".........Is it already six o\'clock?
 Fuaaaaaa...
 Isn\'t this enough?
 Can\'t do much else until the mystery 19th person, {f:5:Beatrice}, takes action."
"That is correct.
 ......However, I believe we have thought of almost every trick they could use against us."
"Yes.
 As long as a traitor doesn\'t appear among us siblings, we should be able to deal with most situations."
"......Haven\'t we talked about this enough?
 We ended up staying up all night.
 ...I\'m tired."
"You\'re right.
 How about taking a little rest after eating breakfast?"
"...A good plan.
 Staying up all night is trying at my age."
As they all stretched, they enjoyed this unrefreshing morning as best they could.
"Let\'s go wash our faces or something.
 I probably look horrible."
"..................?
 What is that horrible stench?"
As soon as they exited into the corridor, Kyrie made an openly disgusted expression.
"...What\'s the matter?"
"Hey, don\'t you smell something awful...?"
".........Hm.
 ...What is this stench?
 It\'s unbearable..."
Because of that fuss, everyone stuck their heads out into the corridor.
{n}...It was a faint stench, but after the complaints, they clearly noticed it.
Each of them went into the corridor, relying on their own sense of smell to tell them where this strange odor was coming from...
"What in the world could it be?
 Let us have Genji deal with it.
 I believe he should already have arrived in the servant room to begin the morning preparations."
"Mmhm, please.
 It is difficult to imagine that Gohda, of all people,
 could be making a breakfast that would cause this kind of stench..."
Rudolf\'s group searched for the source of the smell, and determined that it was coming from underground,
 from the boiler room.
But the door was locked, and they couldn\'t check inside.
Meanwhile, Natsuhi\'s group were on their way to search for someone in the servant room, when they noticed something strange about the parlor.
"......What is this...?!"
"Wh‐what a horrible prank...
 Who would do something like..."
Drawn on the door to the parlor, in a paint that reminded one of blood, there was a strange...
magic‐circle‐like thing.
"No one has come to the kitchen yet.
 ......Wh‐what is...that?"
Eva\'s group, who had thought the smell had been coming from the kitchen,
 had returned, having observed that no one was there and that preparations for breakfast had not yet begun.
......And they noticed the unusual state of the parlor.
"It\'s no good, the boiler room is locked.
 Wouldn\'t it be bad if something\'s broken down in the boiler room?
 Was there a servant anywhere around?"
".........!
 Is that vulgar graffiti here too?
 There was also one on the door to the boiler room."
"What\'s that?!
 This creepy graffiti isn\'t just here, it\'s in other places as well?!
 Haha, you don\'t think that this is the witch of the forest {f:5:Beatrice}\'s declaration of war, right?"
Hideyoshi tried to make fun of it, but staring at this creepy magic circle while listening to the wind and rain really made it seem like it was a message from a witch.
...The dripping bright‐red paint made one think of blood, and it made things even more eerie.
Hideyoshi tried to open the door, but it was locked.
...As a general rule, the parlor was never locked.
{n}Someone had gone out of their way to lock it.
"......What does this mean...?
 Did someone secretly leave this graffiti while we were talking in the dining hall?
 On the doors to the parlor and the boiler room?"
"...I\'m sure the servants are behind this.
 We were together the whole time.
 We all have alibis.
 ......They probably did this prank on some strange orders from Father."
".........Considering the incident yesterday with Maria‐chan\'s letter,
 it\'s more than possible to suspect that the servants are acting on Dad\'s orders and planning something.
 ......Where the hell is everyone, anyway?
 They can\'t be playing hide and seek.
 Let\'s look for them."
"B‐...before that, I\'m worried about the children.
 They\'re alright, aren\'t they?
 I\'ll go and check, and while I\'m there, I\'ll see if there aren\'t any servants there."
"Then let\'s split up.
 While you go to the guesthouse to see how the brats are doing, we\'ll check around inside the mansion.
 .........I don\'t want to think about it,
 but maybe these creepy magic circles aren\'t just where we\'ve found them."
"......We might have become involved in a bizarre game of Father\'s.
 ...I will go to him and ask about the situation.
 ......Though I doubt he\'ll be good‐natured enough to listen to me."
The adults split up.
As a result, they confirmed that the four children were safe in the so‐called cousins\' room, on the second floor of the guesthouse.
It appeared that they had stayed up late last night playing.
{n}All of them were snoring loudly, so Rosa decided not to wake them.
Furthermore, Nanjo, who had returned early the previous night to rest, was also alright.
{n}It seemed he believed in the phrase "early to bed, early to rise", and had awoken refreshed.
During that time, Kyrie and Hideyoshi searched for the servants.
{n}But they didn\'t find them.
...The servant room in the guesthouse was also empty.
"......The children are alright.
 All of them stayed up too late last night."
"The servant room is empty.
 ...I looked at the shift chart, and the mornin\' shift was supposed to begin at six.
 They should have started workin\' by now..."
"The nap room was also empty.
 There were signs that the futons had been used, but they weren\'t warm."
"Y\'know what, I think Krauss nii‐san and the others might\'ve hit on it, don\'t you?
 ......This is probably a game planned on Father\'s orders.
 I\'d bet my bottom dollar, he left those creepy scribbles and hid himself somewhere,
 tryin\' to make us do somethin\'."
"......Are you saying that he\'s trying to see who is fit to inherit his wealth and the family headship?
 ...Isn\'t that a bit..."
"No...
 ...It might not be strange if Father was behind something like that."
"After all, Father loves big tricks.
 ......He might have had this plan brewing ever since that epitaph was hung in the hall."
"...In that case, I wonder whether he will make an announcement of the game or an explanation of it.
 ......It also seems possible that another envelope with the crest might appear, like the one handed to Maria‐chan."
"............You\'re right.
 Maybe Nii‐san and the rest have found that in the mansion."
"Doctor Nanjo.
 Have you heard anythin\'?"
"......M‐my apologies, I do not have any idea what is going on.
 And yet, ......yes, I see,
 I could easily imagine that Kinzo‐san is planning something big."
"...Why don\'t we go back to the mansion for now?
 Maybe they found somethin\' over there."
"If I will not be in the way, I will come too."
"I, I\'ll stay here.
 ...The children are sleeping upstairs.
 We don\'t know what\'s happening.
 We can\'t leave them alone."
"......Yes, you\'re right.
 I\'ll stay with Rosa‐san and watch over the place.
 Would you tell that to my husband?"
Rosa and Kyrie remained in the guesthouse.
{n}Hideyoshi went with Nanjo, and returned again to the mansion.
Meanwhile, in the mansion...
Unbelievably, ...or maybe we should say that bad feelings have a tendency to be right...
Rudolf\'s prediction was right on.
...Because the same magic circle graffiti that had been drawn on the doors to the boiler room and the parlor had been found in multiple other places throughout the mansion.
"Aniki...!
 How\'s Dad?"
"No, no good.
 There was no response at all.
 I did try putting my ear against the door, but I couldn\'t sense anyone."
"...I cannot find the servants anywhere.
 ...Where in the world did they disappear off to..."
"This isn\'t funny.
 Father and the servants are hiding, and there are strange magic circles all over the mansion.
 ......What in the world is happening...?!"
There weren\'t only magic circles on the door to the boiler room and the door to the parlor.
{n}There were also two on the second floor,
 and one on the third floor, for a total of five.
They were all the same magic circle, and all of the doors were locked, so they couldn\'t check inside.
"...Anyway, let\'s do something about the boiler room first.
 It would be bad if some kind of breakdown caused a fire or an explosion.
 ...So we need the key."
"I believe there was a key box in the servant room."
They fished through the key box in the servant room.
Because each servant individually carried their own master key around, those weren\'t kept here.
However, all of the individual room keys should have been here.
"............It\'s so packed with keys."
"...It isn\'t here.
 I\'ve looked and looked, but I can\'t find the key to the boiler room."
"Look, Aneki.
 ......Only the keys to the rooms with those magic circles drawn on them...
are just neatly missing."
"......It\'s true.
 ...How troublesome......"
"It\'s as though someone doesn\'t want us to go in the rooms with the magic circles.
 ......No, they went to all the trouble of making them obvious using the magic circles, so perhaps they do want us to enter...?"
"I think it\'s the latter.
 ...Breaking down the door is probably impossible, I mean, this isn\'t a movie.
 Smashing a window might work."
Krauss had a little trouble deciding whether this was a situation that called for smashing a window.
At that time, Hideyoshi and Nanjo returned.
{n}There was nothing strange in the guesthouse, and the children were safe.
{n}They told the others that Rosa and Kyrie had stayed to watch over the place.
"Good morning.
 ...I hear that something strange has happened."
"Good morning, Doctor Nanjo.
 ...I apologize for waking you so early in the morning."
"What is it?
 Didn\'t you find a letter or somethin\'?
 I was sure you would have found somethin\' like that by now..."
"......You\'re right.
 I also believe that this is a massive joke or game of Father\'s...
 But if that was the case, there should be some letter telling us about that.
 Like the letter that was given to Maria‐chan."
"What if the announcement of the game actually was Maria‐chan\'s letter?
 The details of the game—‘try to solve the riddle of the epitaph’—have already been shown."
"Then, what could the five magic circles we found in the mansion mean?
 ...And the missing servants."
"......Natsuhi nee‐san.
 How many servants were there total today...?"
"Huh?
 .........Genji, Gohda,
 ......five of them, why?"
"......Five servants.
 And five magic circles.
 ......It may be a coincidence, but it worries me."
"...Nii‐san.
 Let\'s break a window.
 We should check and see what\'s inside."
"............We have no choice.
 Do it neatly."
Krauss made his decision, and gave permission to smash a window.
And they decided that the first room they would break into would be the parlor on the first floor, where the windows would be easiest to reach.
They had hoped to peek in through the window,
 but the curtains were drawn, so they couldn\'t see inside.
Rudolf wandered around the garden, trying to find something that would be good for smashing the glass.
Eventually, he found a rock bigger than a fist, and came back.
"You don\'t have to smash the whole thing.
 Just open it enough so that you can reach the lock."
"Don\'t get your hopes up, alright?"
Rudolf raised the rock, and hit the glass with it several times.
Before long, he succeeded in skillfully opening a hole big enough that he could unlock it from the outside.
...Covering his hand with a handkerchief, he stuck his hand through that hole, and cautiously unlocked it.
"We should probably cover it with duct tape later.
 The rain\'ll get blown in."
When he threw the window open, the wind and rain made the curtains dance around violently.
 He swiped the curtain to the side.
...They could see the parlor they knew well.
They were a little relieved.
 ......Because they had thought that maybe, the room would be filled with more bizarre magic circles,
 or possibly the traces of some creepy ritual.
In any event, they didn\'t want to hang around out in the rain,
 so the six of them—Krauss, Natsuhi, Eva, Hideyoshi, Rudolf, and Nanjo—entered the parlor as a group.
"......It seems...that nothing in particular is out of the ordinary..."
".........mmh—"
"Wh‐what has happened, Shannon...?!"
"Wait, wait, are you alright?!
 What happened to you?!"
"Blood, blood!!
 D‐D‐Doctor Nanjo, take a look at this!!"
"Hey, Shannon‐chan!
 Are you okay?!
 Answer me!"
"Y‐you mustn\'t shake her...
 I will examine her condition now..."
She had been in the shadow of a sofa, so they hadn\'t noticed her until they entered the room.
Shannon was lying on the floor, her chest stained bright‐red with blood......
"He~~y,
 Battleeer, where are yoooou?
 Look, look, Shannon\'s corpse has turned up, see~~~?
 I won\'t bully you anymore, so come out."
"......Hmmmm?
 Oh, there you are.
 What are you doing, holding your head in a place like that?"
".............................."
Battler had his head pressed to the table, and was clutching it with his hands...
 His pitiful figure made it plainly clear that he didn\'t want to see anything, didn\'t want to hear anything...
Had he heard {f:5:Beatrice}\'s sneering voice?
...Could he not hear, or was he pretending that he couldn\'t hear?
 In any event, it was clear that he had closed up his heart like a shell...
"Pu ku ku ku...
 ......I wonder if you have tormented him too much, Milady.
 After showing him that much and demanding a counterargument,
 I can understand why he wants to mope around."
"Hey, Battleerr.
 If you can\'t argue back, resign, would you?
 It\'s your turn.
 If you don\'t make some move or pass,
 or else give up, we won\'t get anywhere."
"..............................et."
"......Huh?
 What\'s that?
 I can\'t hear you?"
"I said BE QUIET!!
 Aaaah, shut up shut uuuuuuuuuup!!
 Witches? Magic?!
 Can\'t you just do what you want, I don\'t believe, I don\'t believe any of it,
 damn it damn it damn it damn it damn it!!"
"Don\'t talk to me, don\'t show me anything, go away, go away, go the hell away!!
 Get your goddamned annoying face AWAY FROM MEEE{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}EEEEEE!!!"
"........................!!!"
{f:5:Beatrice} instinctively winced at Battler\'s sudden rage.
"......E‐even if you say that, um...
 If you don\'t finish your turn, then my turn won\'t come.
 I feel like saying, don\'t make me too bored—"
"You think I give a crap, be quiet, SHUT UP!!
 I don\'t give a damn about your game,
 I can\'t take this bullshiiiiit!!
 If your turn won\'t come until mine is finished, then you can just wait for all stinking eternity, can\'t you!!"
"Aaaah, I don\'t care I don\'t care I don\'t get it!!
 I won\'t accept witches or magic, I won\'t accept something that fucked up!!
 Uuooooooooooohhh, I said DON\'T TALK TO MEEEE{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}EEEEE!!!"
......I don\'t know what\'s what anymore.
{n}After being shown something that screwed up, how could I continue to resist...
I wandered aimlessly through the rose garden.
......It was raining and windy, but that didn\'t mean my body got wet.
 ...There was just a feeling of isolation as I wandered amidst the wind and rain without an umbrella.
"..................Maybe I...
lost to her game a long time ago."
...Actually, I wonder whether we hadn\'t reached a clear resolution in the previous game.
After all, I had submitted to her for a time.
{n}So the world had been tinted with witches and magic.
......Right now, Rokkenjima is a different world, where witches stride around openly and fire off strange magic.
...It isn\'t a matter of accepting it or denying it.
Maybe I had mistakenly assumed that I was playing a game on an even footing with Beato.
I had already been defeated in the last game, ...and this may just be the signing ceremony of my surrender.
Just now, a mighty battle had unfolded in this rose garden.
{n}I had seen it with my own eyes.
I kicked the ground.
 ......Obviously, the ground was hard.
{n}And a puddle splashed.
Several towers had split this ground, sprouting like high‐rise buildings.
......The more I kicked this ground,
 .........the more it felt like that really couldn\'t be possible.
But, because of that, I couldn\'t explain it with anything other than magic anymore......
"......I get the locked rooms with the key shut up inside,
 they\'re probably just an extension of what you always see in detective novels.
 ......But, ......that stuff, though...
 All that big flashy stuff......
 Damn iiiiit........."
"...............It seems that my disciple has caused you much trouble."
"...Huh?
 .........It\'s you..."
I was suddenly spoken to, so I turned around,
 ...and in the rose garden arbor,
 ......was the Predecessor {f:5:Beatrice}, who {f:5:Beatrice} had supposedly defeated a short while ago.
".........I was sure you\'d died.
 So, you were alive."
"No, I died.
 ...Now, I am nothing more than a captured chess piece loitering outside the chessboard."
"You\'re Beato\'s master, right?
 So, in other words, you\'re a witch too."
"......Yes, that is correct."
"Tch.
 So, in other words,
 ......that means witches really do exist?
 And I\'m not the one who can defeat her.
 That\'d be you, since you can use awesome magic, wouldn\'t it?
 ...I\'m just useless now.
 There\'s nothing I can do anymore..."
"............Oh, my.
 Have you submitted completely?"
"What do you mean, submit?!
 How the crap should I explain that?!
 Towers sprouting and falling!!
 Huge giants holding shields and throwing spears!"
"Aaah, just remembering it makes me feel like I\'m going insane, reasoning isn\'t worth a damn anymore, is it?!!
 We\'ve left the level of tricks and explanations with human culprits!!
 Aaaaaaaaaaahh, shit shit shit shit!!"
"Calm yourself.
 ......I am nothing more than a piece on that child\'s game board.
 After being removed from that board, I am no longer a being who can do anything."
"But you are that child\'s opponent.
 As long as you do not give up by yourself, you will always have the power to strike back at that child."
"Shut up!
 Weren\'t you also reciting strange spells and summoning towers and spears?!!"
"What do you mean, strike back?!
 Are you saying you\'ll teach me magic too, telling me to fight her in one of those massive magic battles?!!"
"......If you wish,
 I could teach you a bit about magic."
"Oh, just what I wanted!
 Please, give me some awesome magic to smash her chest in one blow...!!
 Hah, don\'t screw with me!"
"I hear that in Japanese magic, there is a ceremony to pray for rain.
 Do you know of it?"
"Rain ceremony?
 That thing where you throw stuff into the fire and offer a dance?
 ......That\'s not magic.
 The fire causes a thermal, and as a result, rain clouds gather.
 I\'m pretty sure that\'s an accepted scientific phenomenon."
"Oh?
 ...I had believed that it was a form of eastern magic,
 but it isn\'t magic?
 I had believed that people offered sacred fire to the heavens, as well as a dance of respect,
 so that your entreaty for rain would reach the hearts of the gods."
"Maybe people did that long ago.
 But most occult things like that have a scientific explanation."
"Why do things burn?
 Isn\'t that because phlogiston is contained in the material?"
"......No, things burn because of an oxidation reaction.
 Lavoisier abolished the phlogiston theory."
"Why does heat transfer through objects?
 Isn\'t that because caloric is contained in the material?"
"......I\'m pretty sure that was abolished by Joule.
 Heat is energy, not a substance."
"You have studied well.
 Your knowledge is correct."
"...It\'s just some random facts."
"Phlogiston, caloric, and eventually ether and God\'s love.
 ......All are powerless before a scientific explanation.
 In the past, I was told that an apple falls from a tree...
thanks to God\'s love, so that humans would be given food."
"Even gravity was explained by God\'s love?
 ...Well, that\'s probably a leftover from a period when religion rather than science was used to explain everything."
"That is correct.
 In the past, humans called the limits of their knowledge...
...no, ignorance itself, "magic".
 ...Just like the rain ceremony we were just talking about."
"Did the people of ancient times...
understand the science of fire giving rise to heat to cause a thermal which calls forth clouds?
 Even without understanding, they at least knew of the result."
"......That probably happened a lot.
 The wisdom of ancestors.
 Even without understanding the reason, through long experience, they knew that they would obtain that result.
 ...Phenomena whose principles they didn\'t understand were probably the same as magic to them."
Just like this person had just said, ancient people who didn\'t understand the principles had probably believed that,
 through the rain ceremony, their wish had reached the heavens and made the rain fall.
To them, that was certainly magic.
{n}As long as they didn\'t understand thermals...
"If you press a light switch, the light turns on.
 ......Children do not know the scientific principles behind why the lightbulb lights up;
 they press the switch knowing only the result.
 If they can obtain a result without knowing the principles, isn\'t that "magic" to them?"
"...............That\'s pretty interesting.
 ...Well, logically, that\'s true.
 ...For example, I don\'t have a clue why the Braun tubes in a TV show a picture."
"However, I think it\'s completely normal for things to be displayed on the TV.
 Even if I don\'t understand the principles behind Braun tubes, I at least know that "if I push the switch I can watch TV"."
"...It\'s exactly the same as having a rain ceremony without understanding thermals.
 ......In other words, if I don\'t know the principles, even TV is the same as "magic",
 no, could you say it is magic?"
"Do you know how Braun tubes are constructed?
 Have you ever taken one apart and looked inside?"
"......Nope.
 I think I read about it in a book or something once, but it was complicated and I didn\'t have a clue.
 I think that when electrons hit a fluorescent material, it creates luminescence or something like that..."
"That book was a fake.
 Actually, there are small people called gremlins shut up inside the Braun tubes,
 and they do their job with magic."
"Huh?!
 That\'s stupid, there\'s no way...!"
"How can you deny it if you have never looked inside a Braun tube?"
"......I\'ve never looked inside, but I can state with confidence that small people like that definitely don\'t exist!"
"Since there is no Braun tube here, that is impossible to prove."
"Y‐yeah, it is impossible to prove right this very moment,
 ...but later I can take apart a TV somewhere and show you, and instantly win the argument!"
"So, in other words,
 my "magic theory", that gremlins are shut up inside the Braun tubes and display the picture with magic,
 is impossible to disprove until we can verify the contents of a Braun tube, correct?"
".........Hmm,
 .........what the hell, one of those?
 Are you trying to say it\'s a "Devil\'s Proof"?
 That\'s your favorite trick, you witches."
"The "Devil\'s Proof" is sophistry exploiting the impossibility of proving a negative fact.
 However, it is different from what I am talking about with Braun tubes.
 That could be resolved just by taking apart a single television."
"......You\'re right.
 It really isn\'t a "Devil\'s Proof"."
"The scientific theory you propose, and the magical theory I propose.
 ...One of those is the truth.
 And which one it is can be ascertained as soon as you look inside the Braun tube.
 However, until the instant that happens, we cannot deny each other\'s theories."
"So, despite the fact that there is only one truth,
 until the moment you look into the Braun tube, two conflicting truths can exist at the same time.
 ......A bizarre space where two truths, of which only one is permitted to exist, may exist simultaneously."
Is the cat in the box alive or dead?
{n}If you open the box, you will know the answer.
 You will know the truth.
However, until you open the box, you can claim that the cat is alive, and you can also claim it is dead.
Each of the two parties makes a claim that according to them is the "correct" truth,
 and even though the two sides are conflicting, neither can win the argument as long as the box remains unopened.
In other words, two truths can exist at the same time.
Even though there can only be one cat in the box,
 it is packed with a living cat and a dead cat, in a strange parallel world.
That is what Rokkenjima is now.
......This island is now a different world where a science theory and a magic theory exist at the same time.
...To a resident of the world of science such as yourself,
 at a glance, it may feel as though this island has been sucked into a world of magic.
While that may be correct, it is not accurate.
Strictly speaking, it has moved from the world of science, to the midway point between that world and the world of magic.
So at a glance, it appears to you as though the world is tilted towards the magic side.
......But actually, this island is now in a perfectly impartial position with relation to the two opposing worlds.
"......I don\'t really get it...
 Midway between reality and magic?
 A perfectly impartial world?
 How\'s that?
 Hasn\'t everything been going really bad for me the whole time...?!"
"Then perhaps you could think of it this way.
 This is a trial.
 Think of it as a court where you and {f:5:Beatrice} are laying out opposing claims.
 We could describe it as a Braun tube trial."
"That child claims that there are tiny people inside the Braun tubes.
 And she explains about the lives of the tiny people, what they look like,
 what type of magical power they have, on and on.
 ......And you?"
"......Well, I study in a library, and argue back by explaining how Braun tubes are constructed, I guess."
"At that moment, both your claim and that child\'s claim exist in the court at the same time.
 ......If you lend an ear to that child\'s claim,
 you may hear it as though it were the truth. See it as though it were the truth.
 {i:That is precisely what you were shown}."
"..........................."
"At this moment, on Rokkenjima, witches and magic certainly might exist as truth.
 ...However, that world is an uncertain wavefunction, existing only until the moment that the cat\'s box is opened.
 All states can be justified simultaneously.
 However, there is one truth."
"That is collapsed by observation,
 and countless truths are weeded out to become one truth.
 It is like when, in court,
 the judge makes his judgment.
 The two truths from the prosecutor\'s and the defense\'s claims...
collapse by the judgment, and become one."
".........So to say it in your words,
 ......this island right now is the world right before looking into the Braun tube, right...?
 Therefore, neither the science theory nor the magic theory can be denied.
 ...And since they cannot be denied—"
"Both can exist as truth.
 That is why both witches and magic can exist.
 ...However, at the same time, your opinion which denies them can also exist simultaneously as truth."
".........It is a world where two conflicting things can exist at the same time.
 And, it is a world where the conflicting truths cannot disprove each other.
 .........Is it starting to make sense to you...?"
"..................In other words...
...no matter how much awesome magic Beato shows me...
...that is only a claim from the "magic theory", and it doesn\'t disprove mine."
"So, it\'s like, "no matter what kind of magic Beato shows me,
 in this world, that cannot become proof that magic exists"."
"That\'s right.
 That child will probably even try to explain an apple falling from a tree with magic.
 That child might shake her staff and pluck the apple with magic,
 and {i:claim} that she dropped it to the earth."
"However, that would be nothing more than another one of her claims.
 None of her claims can block your opportunity to make a claim.
 ......In that sense, this world is quite "impartial" to both sides."
".........I...get it...
 ......Still.
 By that argument, even if I show a sound argument with my "science theory",
 all it will do is collide head‐on with her "magic theory", and I can\'t win against her either.
 Furthermore, there won\'t be any final judgment unless we peek into the Braun tube."
".........Where is the Braun tube in this world?
 ...It means there\'s no reason for us to argue.
 ......Wouldn\'t it be alright if we just got along and peeked into the Braun tube?"
"If there really is a tiny person in there, I suffer total defeat.
 Otherwise, I win.
 ......Why do we have to hold this debate without looking into the Braun tube?"
"That itself is the "game" which that child has challenged you to.
 Perhaps, instead of a court, I should use chess as an example.
 Victory and loss is not determined by a judge.
 You who are fighting will decide it yourselves."
"......Can you win an argument with an opponent in a screwed‐up world where multiple truths can exist at the same time?"
"But do you not realize, in point of fact, you {i:were} beaten in an argument, and are sitting here right now submitting...?"
"...............Heh.
 ...Heheheh."
"That is all the advice I can give you now.
 If you wish, I can occasionally give you advice."
"......Sure.
 Thanks, that really helps.
 ......I\'ll avenge you."
"Hoh‐hoh‐ho, thank you.
 I am looking forward to it."
"What\'s your name?"
"...{f:5:Beatrice} used to be my name, but now that I have surrendered it, I do not have a name."
".........So, I shall take a temporary name.
 ......{f:5:Virgilius}.
 ...No,
 what about {f:5:Virgilia}?"
"{f:5:Virgilia}.
 Valkyria?
 Wasn\'t that the name of a legendary goddess?"
"No.
 It means the one who is a guide to {f:5:Beatrice}.
 ......I will guide you to that child who waits at the summit of Mount Purgatory.
 It should be a fitting name for that kind of guide."
"To think that I\'d accept help from a witch when I\'m trying to deny witches.
 ......I see.
 If this is a contradictory world where different claims can exist at the same time, that also works.
 ...Ihihi, it\'s almost funny."
"I am borrowing that child\'s words, but you truly are like a phoenix.
 ......Your will to fight has already been revived."
"...Come, if your heart is prepared, return to that child,
 ......return to the chessboard that child is sitting at.
 ......I look forward to seeing how far you can fight my disciple."
"Yeah, you just watch.
 ............I won\'t listen to her babbling anymore.
 I\'ll coolly fight to the end.
 I definitely won\'t get provoked by her anymore."
"Then let us return.
 To the seat of the battle."
"...Oh, ......oooh, Battler...!
 Where did you hide yourself?
 *cackle*!
 I thought the sore loser wouldn\'t show himself again, you see?"
"......Sorry to keep you waiting.
 I\'ve cooled my head a little."
"Aaand?
 Did you think of a response to that pleasant, thrilling, refreshing, highly acclaimed, wonderful fantasy battle between Master and meeeeeeee?
 Isn\'t that impossible to explain without fantasy?
 Hihhyahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaah?!"
"...Milady.
 You have only just promised to be kind and act refined, remember?"
"Ahhyahahahahaha, oops, my mistake.
 I just get in such a good mood when I see Battler\'s face, you see?
 C\'mon c\'mon c\'mon, c\'mon then Battler, that battle just now, how will you respond to it?
 Hmmmmmm?"
".................................
 ...Battle?
 Did something happen?"
"......Whaat?"
"Where in this rose garden.
 Where are all those spears and towers that you grew?
 Where have they all fallen to?
 ............They\'re not here, are they?
 ......In other words, this is what we see inside the Braun tube."
"......Inside the Braun tube, you say??
 *cackle*, what in the world are you talking about now...?"
"In this very moment,
 there is nothing at all in the rose garden.
 ...Sure, towers may have been sprouting with magic a short while ago.
 But that\'s only until we learn what\'s inside the Braun tube.
 ......It is your interpretation that it was a magical battle, and that\'s nothing more than a claim.
 And the fact that there\'s nothing at all here right now is the proof of that."
"This is how I argue back about that witch\'s battle just now:
 Right now, there isn\'t anything here, and that proves that nothing happened...!"
"..................
 ......Hahaha, hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐ha!
 You know, obviously I can\'t make a huge mess right on the first twilight, and I do like that rose garden, you see?
 To prevent any damage, I fought inside a barrier.
 So it\'s only natural that it wouldn\'t have any influence on reality."
"......That is your "claim"?
 Well, I guess that works."
"However!
 My claim that, at this point in time, there is nothing in the rose garden,
 and therefore there was no magic, has not been obstructed in any way!!"
"W‐wait, wait, can you deny my magic with that mess?!
 It is impossible to prove that magic "does not exist"!
 It\'s a "Devil\'s Proof"!!"
"The truth is this garden at this very moment!
 The instant you look inside, the tiny people inside the Braun tube will vanish.
 And there are no traces of magic here at all!
 So that battle between you witches {i:did not take place}!!"
"Wh‐
......what the,
 th‐that counter......?!
 That power,
 ...c‐could it be...?!"
"...Have you forgotten, Milady?
 It is the Multiplanar World Collapsation Technique.
 The power of a Finite Witch, which is the pair to the power of an Endless Witch.
 Only an Endless Witch would be able to understand it, and it causes the strongest effect for an Endless Witch."
"Sch‐‘Schrödinger\'s cat box’?!
 .........Th‐......that old hag of a witch...what an uncalled‐for hint!!"
"We\'ve lost time.
 With the five servants and Grandfather, there are six corpses!
 Let me check the scene.
 I\'ve been trudging along wasting time.
 From now on, I\'ll speed things up, okay?"
"Take a seat, {f:5:Beatrice}!!
 It\'s finally the first twilight, isn\'t it? Let\'s start the real thing.
 Show me what you\'ve got!!!"......The adults\' motivations aside...
{n}At least for us kids,
 these were supposed to be a fun couple of days where we cousins deepened our friendship.
However, when we woke up, there was an unbelievably cruel reality waiting for us...
"............hic, ......hic......!"
"................................."
George‐aniki and Jessica were crying over Shannon‐chan and Kanon‐kun\'s deaths.
......Right now, everyone who was alive was gathered in the lobby on the first floor of the guesthouse.
 And there were 12 of us.
...Unbelievable, right?
{n}There were 18 up until yesterday.
{n}...And in one night, a third of that number had lost their lives...
My agitation had finally settled down, and, along with my lack of sleep from being woken up so early in the morning,
 I was beginning to feel like this was just a little unreal.
......I want to think this is some kind of bad dream...
 My cheap escapism kept telling me that was true, over and over.
Maria had gone back to sleep in the sofa Auntie Rosa was sitting in.
...Rather than her having nerves of steel, she probably genuinely hadn\'t had enough sleep.
The adults were grasping members of Grandfather\'s collection...
of short‐barrel rifles.
...Apparently a remnant from the period when he was obsessed by westerns, there were four identical guns altogether.
Those had been split up between the four siblings: Uncle Krauss, Auntie Eva, my dad, and Auntie Rosa.
Paper boxes filled with bullets lay on the table, and the siblings were silently loading their guns.
".........It\'s a little scary.
 Even as I stand here touching this,
 I get the feeling Dad\'s about to yell "Don\'t touch that!" and hit me."
"Then aren\'t you lucky.
 ...No matter how much you touch it, you won\'t be hit again."
"............I can\'t believe it.
 ...That Father...
.........would meet this kind of end..."
"I did think that when it came to Kinzo‐san, he would probably not die normally in his bed,
 ......but even so, ......it is too horrible..."
"Hey.
 I wonder if that really is Father...?
 I\'m suspecting that it might be a different person\'s corpse as a substitute to trick us..."
"......No, without a doubt, that is Father.
 You saw his toes, right?
 In general society, there aren\'t many humans with six toes on both feet."
"But, ............we can\'t say that there are none.
 I\'ve heard that polydactyly isn\'t a rare disease.
 He was a man who liked big tricks, right?
 ......He might have prepared a body from somewhere that had the same number of toes on both feet."
"Preposterous.
 What would possess him to do something like that...?!"
"......I\'d agree if it was a normal person.
 ...But this is Father we\'re talkin\' about.
 You can\'t say for sure that what Kyrie‐san says is nonsense."
"............They say it\'s difficult to confirm the identity of a burnt corpse.
 However, there should be various ways to examine him from his teeth and his bone structure.
 If the police investigated, they\'d be bound to know whose body it was in an instant."
"The problem is that before the police, we need a telephone engineer."
"......The boat probably won\'t come in this typhoon.
 ...So, will it come tomorrow?"
"I expect that the boat will come again at nine o\'clock tomorrow.
 Then, I believe we will be able to contact the police."
"......Both us,
 and the culprit...
have been imprisoned on this island, then, until the typhoon passes."
.........Just from our parents\' conversation, you could probably figure out the general gist, but let\'s explain the situation anyway.
First, early that morning.
In various places throughout the mansion, a total of six corpses, of Grandfather and all the servants, had been found one after another.
First, Grandfather had been fed to the flames in the boiler room, and was completely burnt.
The servants were found dead, each locked in one of the various rooms throughout the mansion onto which magic circles had been drawn.
The cause of death for the servants was uncertain,
 but according to Doctor Nanjo\'s diagnosis, there was a high likelihood that they had been stabbed by something like a spear,
 ......or possibly shot by a gun.
That was why the adults had started arming themselves with the rifles.
And what made the situation even more chaotic was that the telephone lines were out of order.
 It was unknown whether lightning had caused them to break down or whether the culprit had destroyed them.
In any case, contact with the outside was broken off, and we couldn\'t contact the police.
So until tomorrow morning, when the typhoon would pass and the boat would come,
 we would have to protect ourselves.
After all, Rokkenjima was now isolated by the typhoon.
 And just like how we were stuck on the island, so was the culprit.
It seemed that the adults had stayed up the whole night, spending the whole time holding the family conference in the mansion\'s dining hall.
 And even so, this crime had occurred in the mansion.
......So right when the adults had been getting worked into a frenzy over money,
 the murderer had been killing under the same roof...
Aunt Natsuhi said that they were strict on locking the doors and windows at night.
{n}And yet, some suspicious person had entered the mansion.
...The adults had decided that the inside of the mansion was too large to be safe,
 so they had pulled out the guns and moved to the guesthouse, where we had been.
.........Which brings us to the present.
George‐aniki and us others begged to see Shannon‐chan\'s body,
 but the adults refused point blank, saying that we must not until the police arrive.
That wasn\'t just because they had sealed all the rooms to preserve the scene.
...After all, the culprit who had killed six people had wandered about that mansion.
To the Ushiromiya family right now, the mansion which should have been their home...
was like a danger zone that an unknown murderer had entered...
It makes sense, I mean, the mansion is vast.
 There are plenty of blind spots and dark places, and it\'s just too vast to guarantee absolute safety with this number of people.
In contrast, the guesthouse is a much smaller building than the mansion.
Two stories tall.
 Number of rooms...about ten?
{n}......Apparently, it had originally been constructed to serve as a boarding house for when the island was to be turned into a resort.
So it\'s easy to grasp the entire structure, and easy to guarantee safety.
{n}That makes it a good place to hole up in.
......And.
 There\'s an extremely high likelihood that this mass murder of six people is a "game".
Because the culprit had proclaimed that in a letter.
I heard that a Western‐style envelope with the family crest, just like the one Maria claimed to have received from {f:5:Beatrice} yesterday,
 had been found in the boiler room where Grandfather\'s corpse had been discovered.
This was what the letter said:
{e:070:So that there will be no misunderstandings.
{n}The game I seek is whether or not you can solve the riddle of the epitaph,
 not whether or not you can catch me.
{n}{n}If you do not solve the riddle of the epitaph, the pitiful sacrifices will further increase in number.
{n}It would be more wise to spend your time solving the epitaph than searching for me.
{n}{n}If no one can solve the riddle of the epitaph, no one will survive.}
{e:070:If a person appears with skill enough to solve the riddle of the epitaph, I will give them all the gold of the Golden Land,
 the Ushiromiya family headship, and all of my power.
{n}{n}I was the one who succeeded the Ushiromiya family headship from Kinzo‐sama.
{n}And I look forward to seeing who will receive the headship from me.
{n}{n}{nobreak:{m:-3:—}—}{f:5:Beatrice} the Golden.}
...This riddle of the epitaph was...that thing.
That strange epitaph written in the same place as the portrait of the witch, displayed in the hall of the mansion.
Grandfather was the one who ordered that it be written,
 and the person who solved it would, supposedly, be given the family headship or the hidden gold or something like that.
Ever since it was first displayed there several years ago, all the relatives, despite making fun of it in the open,
 had been secretly been challenging that riddle in private.
However, up until today, no one had solved it.
 We had once again been told to solve that unintelligible riddle, and this time, we had been threatened that if we didn\'t solve it, we would all be killed.
......If this wasn\'t a "game", what would you call it...
The bold opinion that we should search the premises for the culprit did come up once.
However, there was a good chance they were armed, and there wasn\'t necessarily only one of them.
And, ...while they might have been able to kill more than six people, they had {i:stopped at six}.
In the end, the opinion that we should avoid carelessly antagonizing the culprit,
 and hole up in a safe place while we waited for the police to arrive, won out...
After the adults had carefully checked that the doors and windows in the guesthouse were locked, they set up camp in the lobby.
And as they fingered their guns to distract themselves from the tension,
 their expressions showed that they were already fatigued from this long day, which had still barely begun...
There was nothing that I could do.
Now, all I could do was be taught how to use a gun,
 to prepare for the off‐chance that...something would happen which {i:led to an excess of guns}......
......That\'s the way.
 Just obediently stay there, {i:me and the rest of you}.
"...............Six people in the beginning again.
 And this time it\'s Grandfather and all of the servants put together."
"Most likely,
 that child has carefully studied your moves from the last game.
 And she placed the highest priority upon taking the pieces which she guessed you were most likely to first suspect."
"......That makes sense.
 ...Both last time, and the time before that,
 the servants who know everything about the mansion and who walk around with master keys were always highest on the list of suspicious people."
"......A good example in the last game is Jessica\'s locked room.
 If I had only accepted that a servant was the culprit, that wouldn\'t even have been a locked room."
"Therefore,
 ......that child went straight for them.
 She probably immediately went to block the way of escape that you would ultimately retreat into."
"Beato already proclaimed in red that there are no more than 18 people on this island.
 ...So basically,
 .........{i:she\'s saying "give it up"}.
 ......Now I have to suspect one of the 18."
"......That child will probably come at you by stealing the pieces for the 18, and descending as a 19th person who shouldn\'t exist,
 thereby making you accept that she is a witch."
"......That is because now that her intimidation strategy of trying to force you to submit by showing you magic has failed,
 she can only make a frontal attack."
"......Perfect.
 Bluffing won\'t work anymore."
"Be careful.
 Deception is a witch\'s strongest point.
 ...No matter what that child says or shows you,
 it definitely won\'t threaten the truth that you believe in.
 Don\'t forget that."
".........Sure.
 I\'ll be damned if the same moves are going to work on me over and over.
 .........Get out here, {f:5:Beatrice}.
 Let\'s get started!!!"
"I am already seated at the match table.
 My turn, too, is already complete."
"......Imagine that Madam would turn out to be our enemy.
 How unfortunate, Milady.
 ...Our moves will be read thoroughly."
"That is no problem.
 Master\'s moves are all outdated classics.
 There is nothing to fear."
"...What moves can you make beyond the classics I taught you?
 I am looking forward to seeing, {f:5:Beatrice}."
"......*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*.
 Is that alright, Battleerr?
 If a person who denies witches such as yourself accepts a witch as a strategist..."
"That stupid provocation is useless.
 This person is my advisor, no, my second.
 That doesn\'t change one bit that this is a fistfight between you and me."
"I understand.
 ......You\'re so wobbly that you probably need training wheels on your bicycle.
 Do as you like.
 Come, begin!!
 It is your turn!"
"Let\'s begin with the reconstruction of the crime scene.
 ......{f:5:Virgilia}, if you please!"
"The first body discovered was Shannon\'s.
 She was found in the parlor on the first floor of the mansion.
 The door and windows were locked, and a locked room was established."
"......Clarification request for Beato.
 Reconfirm the definition of a locked room."
"Mmhm.
 The term "locked room" refers to a room where the inside and the outside of the room are completely isolated from all travel between them.
 Of course, no form of intrusion or escape, nor even any interference is possible.
 That is comprehensive, including a denial of hidden doors, as well as all margin for interference from the outside."
"......Henceforth, this definition will be referred to as:
 "{f:5:Beatrice}\'s locked‐room definition"!"
"Confirming specifics.
 ......Define "margin for interference from the outside"."
"It refers to all types of direct interference from the outside, such as using a fishing line or a long, thin rod.
 In other words, you are to conclude that there is not even any gap in the doors or windows by which to use such tricks."
"I wonder about that?
 Even if there wasn\'t a gap, you should be able to interfere with radio waves, like with a remote control, right?"
"Very well.
 I add to this definition that it is impossible for radio waves and related methods of remote control to interfere."
"There\'s also an extension telephone in the parlor.
 A device linked with that wouldn\'t count as remote control, right?!"
"The phones are already out of order, damn you.
 ...Ugh, this is a pain.
 I\'ll include that too.
 All direct and indirect methods of interfering from the outside of the room to the inside of the locked room are impossible."
"What about a voice or a knock?
 Those should be able to interfere from the outside without entering the room, right?"
".........Even though it is a locked room, it probably isn\'t impossible for someone to knock or call out.
 Whether the room allows for human communication with the outside or not, it does not go against the definition of a locked room."
"In other words, you can\'t define it so that even methods of communication are interrupted?"
"That is the case."
"Understood.
 .........So, Shannon‐chan\'s parlor satisfies "{f:5:Beatrice}\'s locked‐room definition"?"
"That is correct."
".........Locked‐room definition understood.
 Continue, {f:5:Virgilia}."
"Yes."
".........Shannon\'s body was in possession of one master key.
 The relatives who discovered her collected this."
"Repetition request for Beato.
 How many master keys this time?"
"...Hmph. The same as last time.
 {p:1:There are five, one for each servant}."
"Which means this still isn\'t a locked room.
 There are still four master keys left.
 It just means that after Shannon‐chan was murdered, one of the other four keys locked it."
"That is correct.
 .........And, it wasn\'t only a master key that was found."
"Yes."
"......Alongside the body, there was a Western envelope with the family crest.
 Instead of a letter, the key to the second‐floor guest room was inside it."
"......The key to the second‐floor guest room...
 Am I fine to define that as the only key other than the master keys that can open the door to the second‐floor guest room?"
"Indeed. There is no problem.
 And, unlike the master keys, there is only one."
"In other words, in order to unlock a specific room, in addition to the five master keys,
 there is only one other key."
"......In other words, this is a message telling them to go to the second‐floor guest room next?
 So the adults moved to the second‐floor guest room?"
"Yes."
"The door to the second‐floor guest room was also locked, and a magic circle was drawn on it.
 ......The relatives unlocked it with the key they had found near Shannon\'s body."
"Inside the room, Kumasawa\'s body was discovered.
 The room was a locked room.
 That definition is based upon "{f:5:Beatrice}\'s locked‐room definition"."
".........Kumasawa was in possession of one master key.
 The relatives collected this."
"And like Shannon, there was a Western envelope discovered alongside her.
 Inside was the key to the third‐floor servants\' quarters.
 The relatives moved to the third‐floor servants\' quarters."
"And there was a magic circle on the door to the third‐floor servants\' quarters, and that door was locked?"
"Yes."
"Inside the room, Gohda\'s body was discovered.
 The room was a locked room.
 Based on "{f:5:Beatrice}\'s locked‐room definition"."
"Gohda was in possession of one master key.
 The relatives collected this."
"And just as before, a Western envelope with a family seal was discovered.
 Inside was the key to the second‐floor VIP room.
 The relatives moved to the second‐floor VIP room."
".........What is all of this...?
 What the hell are you planning...?"
"*cackle*cackle*.
 It isn\'t something worth glaring at me over, is it?
 It is a locked room, but there are still several master keys that can open it, correct?
 And I have even been dutiful enough to present you with the keys particular to each room in addition to the master keys."
"......I don\'t like how this is going.
 ......But I\'m starting to see how things will turn out.
 So it continues like this for all six people?"
"Yes, that is correct.
 Inside the second‐floor VIP room, Genji\'s body was discovered."
"One master key was collected.
 The key to the underground boiler room was discovered."
"They moved to the underground boiler room.
 Inside the underground boiler room, Kinzo\'s body was discovered."
"The key to the chapel was discovered."
"They moved to the chapel."
"Inside the chapel, Kanon\'s body was discovered.
 One master key was collected.
 The key to the first‐floor parlor was discovered.
 ......With this, our reconstruction of how all six bodies were discovered is complete."
"A supplement.
 Along with the key to the chapel, a letter was enclosed in the Western envelope found near Kinzo\'s body.
 The contents of the letter were as you saw.
 It further urged the relatives to solve the epitaph\'s riddle."
".........In that case...
 ...What\'s going on?
 If the last place, where Kanon‐kun was, had the key to the very first room, the parlor, where Shannon‐chan was...
 That makes six locked rooms, all tied together, right?"
"That is correct!
 The six locked rooms are all tied together.
 The keys to unlock each are all shut up inside the next room."
"In other words, the six locked rooms form one massive locked room,
 and all of the master keys as well as the individual room keys are shut up inside it...!"
"
{p:1:Furthermore, all of the doors and windows in the six rooms are normal}.
 {p:1:No device exists which can lock them without a key, such as an auto‐lock}.
 *cackle*cackle*, what do you think, it\'s beautiful, isn\'t iiiiiiiiiiiit??? Uhhyahhyahhyaaahh!"
"As I said, Milady, that is not dignified."
When Ronove rebuked her, Beato stuck her tongue at him shamelessly.
"Uhihihi, sorry, sorry.
 I just get in such a good mood playing with Battler."
"*cackle*, so, Battlerr?
 What is your move going to be?
 If you can\'t think of anything in particular, I can show you how I made the goats carry the bodies,
 and sealed all of the rooms with magic, if you waaaaant?"
"Do what you want.
 I\'ll listen respectfully to this "magic theory" that you assert.
 However, I can assert my "human theory", which is completely different from your claim,
 without any interference from your claim whatsoever."
"So, in other words!
 There\'s no need for me to listen to your bullshit!!
 Go wave your magic staff or whatever as much as you like and act out how you lock the door with your seven‐colored magic.
 And before long, I\'m sure there\'ll be people along to stand beside you, advertising their snake oil and all‐purpose kitchen knives!"
"{f:5:Virgilia}, reconstruct the crime scene!
 I\'ll search for a weakness!!
 Were they all definitely dead?
 If one of them is just playing dead, this isn\'t a locked room at all!"
"Nanjo checked that all of them were dead.
 However, due to the "Devil\'s Proof", it is impossible to deny the possibility of a wrong diagnosis.
 ......In other words, she cannot make the likelihood that Nanjo overlooked the fact that they were alive equal to zero."
"Here it is, that "Devil\'s Proof".
 But there exists a sword which can carve that up...!"
"Wh‐what are those people doing?
 ......Looks like they\'re having a good time leaving me out of the discussion.
 I am their opponent, right...?
 They could pay attention to me at least a little..."
"By nature, communication with the opponent is not necessary in order to compete in chess."
"......You spoke in riddles when you communicated outside your moves, Milady.
 ...Perhaps it has come to this because he does not want to be led astray."
"...............muu.
 ......For some reason, I can\'t accept it."
"You are challenging him to a chess match, are you not, Milady?"
"That\'s true, but...
...muu!"
{f:5:Beatrice} puffed out her cheeks, as though saying "I don\'t know why, but I don\'t like it!"
"Because the police have not yet arrived at the scene, the human side\'s ability to prove things is limited.
 For a strict confirmation of death, I recommend a repetition request."
"Alright, that\'s where I\'ll strike, repetition requested!!"
"‘The six victims are all dead’!!"
"......Milady, you have a repetition request waiting, you know?"
"Hey, enough lazing around!!
 Do you decline the repetition?!
 This is where our battle starts!!"
"Wha?!
 Owowowowoow!!
 *cackle*cackle*, sorry, sorry, that\'s fine, I\'ll respond."
"
{p:1:Kinzo, Genji, Shannon, Kanon, Gohda, and Kumasawa—these six are all dead}!"
"Why are you so out of it?
 ...Alright.
 So I\'ve drawn one out of you.
 That classic where they\'re pretending to be dead is the first to be denied."
"*cackle*!
 I won\'t go easy on you anymore, come at me how you like.
 I\'ll slice them slantwise one after another!"
"And again, repetition requested!
 No one is hiding in any of the six rooms!
 Show me that you can deny the existence of people we aren\'t aware of!"
"I\'ll respond."
"
{p:1:There is no one hiding in the six rooms}!"
"Alright.
 Now I\'m sure that it\'s only the six of them canned in there.
 And they aren\'t pretending to be dead."
"......What will you do, what will you dooo?
 There\'s already nothing a human could do.
 Obediently kneel and observe as I control the locks at will with my wonderful magic, alriiiiiiight?"
"Quit babbling.
 And another repetition request.
 "The six deaths were instant"!"
"Instant death?
 Hoh, what do you mean by that?"
"......It means there is a possibility that a single victim on the verge of death managed to escape into the room,
 and after locking it from the inside to create a locked room, they passed away."
"...Hm.
 A classic locked‐room murder.
 In the case that the victim is dealt a fatal wound, and is doomed to die at some later time,
 it is possible for the victim to hole up inside a room to escape the murderer,
 and then die after locking it, in which case a locked room could be constructed unexpectedly."
"In order to deny that possibility,
 you will need to proclaim that "the six died instantly" with the red truth."
"*cackle*cackle*!
 Very well, very well, I\'ll slay you with my red treasured sword!"
"
{p:1:The six died instantly}!
 By instant death, I mean that as soon as they were attacked, they became incapable of action."
"Well, death in its full meaning may have taken several seconds or even minutes.
 But in any event, it was completely impossible for them to take any action of their own will.
 In that sense, I can state that they died instantly!"
"...Everything up until now has just been checking for a classic locked room.
 My showdown with you over the locked rooms starts now, alright...?
 If the culprit isn\'t on the inside, they are on the outside.
 So they somehow killed them from outside the rooms."
"*cackle*cackle*!
 Have you lost your mind?
 Isn\'t it true that "a locked room = murder is impossible from the outside"?!
 Therefore, it\'s impossible for it to be anything other than a magical murder!"
"No, that\'s wrong.
 The right thing to say is "a murder really happened = it isn\'t a locked room"!
 No matter how much you speak in riddles, this definitely isn\'t a locked room!
 It\'s a sham that only looks like a locked room!"
"However, Battler‐sama.
 {p:1:Only the victims are inside the rooms,}
 {p:1:and no other people exist inside the rooms}.
 And by Milady\'s locked‐room definition,
 remote murders from outside the room have been clearly denied, have they not?"
"Wait.
 The definition of remote murders is vast, right?
 Sure, there\'s stuff like pulling a fishing line from outside the room and strangling the victim inside the room,
 but that\'s not all there is."
"For example......
a trap would make for an excellent remote murder!"
"A traap?
 Hoh, what is that?!"
"Just as an example, let\'s say they were instructed to enter previously decided rooms,
 and lock the doors from the inside to create a locked room themselves.
 A trap is set up in those rooms that they don\'t know about,
 and they are killed by that.
 ......How\'s that?! Now there is no contradiction!"
"......There is no problem.
 It corresponds to the existing state."
"...There is no problem on our side either.
 It does not conflict with Milady\'s locked‐room definition."
"Kuhhahhahahahahahahahaha?!
 What\'s with that stupid reasoning?!
 Nothing suspicious was found in any of the rooms, you know?"
"What form did that trap have?!
 Where was it hidden and how did it operate?!
 Explain that for all six people, in the parlor, the guest room, the servants\' quarters, the VIP room, the boiler room, and the chapel.
 Well? You can\'t, can you?!?!"
"Decline refutation!!
 There is no need for me to explain that!!
 And even so, it doesn\'t damage my claim!!"
"Wh‐what did you saaaaaaaaayy...?!?!"
"{f:5:Beatrice}, it is a "Devil\'s Proof".
 The fact that he cannot explain the form of the trap...
does not in itself disprove that there was a trap!"
"............Well done.
 While overbearing, a wonderful move."
"...Kh!!!
 This guy is getting completely used to this......!!"
"Check.
 It is possible to establish this locked‐room murder via a murder trap X that they couldn\'t find."
"......I‐I\'ll kill that check with the red truth!!"
"
{p:1:The six were not killed by traps}!"
"The definition of trap?!"
"Oh...
umm...
one of those!
 Something that activates when a victim gets caught in it by their own actions."
"Aaah... That\'s not all!
 Stuff that activates by remote control or by a timer,
 ......everything like that is also included!"
"Pu ku ku...
 All devices that can carry out a murder without the direct participation of the person who set it up.
 I believe that definition may be appropriate."
"H‐how\'s that?!
 I\'ve struck back!!
 As though I could let a human defeat this locked room!!"
"..................
 ............You\'re also frantic, trying to win, huh."
"...Whaat...?!
 What do you mean...?"
"......You\'re also frantically fighting to make me accept that you exist.
 Until now, I thought that I was just being toyed around with one‐sidedly by you."
"...But that was actually wrong.
 You\'re also frantically resisting my comeback, fighting to show that you exist...!
 Now,
 ...I finally really feel that\'s true."
This isn\'t torture inflicted on me about whether I\'ll submit or not.
"This is a fight between you and me on an even footing!!"
"......Alright, it\'s starting to get interesting, isn\'t it?
 Six people died in locked rooms, and no one else was inside.
 And there was no meddling from the outside, and also no traps.
 If I was still how I used to be, I would probably think this had to be the work of magic."
"......And if you had acted out some strange magic right about now, I\'d probably even have surrendered.
 .........It\'s that favorite strategy of yours."
"...You completely intercept all of my moves, and in the moment that I\'ve tried everything and fallen to my knees,
 when my heart\'s defensive power is at its weakest, you show off some strange magic and take the game all at once!!"
".........She has always had a short temper.
 She still has that bad habit of rushing things when victory is in sight."
"Pu ku ku.
 Because Milady cannot stand putting things off."
"Heeey, shut up, shut up!!"
"It is your turn, Battler!
 The "trap piece" that you advanced, I have cut down with red!
 What will you send out next?
 Show me what you\'ve got!!"
"Right!!
 Now that even traps have been defeated, at a glance, this looks like a perfect locked‐room murder.
 ......And that\'s why this is where I\'ll flip over the chessboard!!"
"...Here it is, your special technique!
 What exactly are you going to flip over, and how?!
 Try showing meeeeeeeeeeee!!"
"Yeah, I\'ll show you!!
 It\'s not about thinking how to kill six people inside locked rooms from the outside!"
"Yeah, that\'s no good, no good, no goddamn good at all!
 That\'s right, it\'s not about how to kill from the outside.
 It\'s about how they died inside the room and created a locked room!"
"......That\'s it, this is the answer!!
 If you assume that one of the six victims was the culprit,
 this locked room can be explained extremely easily!"
"Wh‐whaaaaaaat?!
 No way!
 I believe I clearly said in red that the six of them were dead......!!"
"Six people did die.
 Five were victims who were killed.
 If you assume that the other person committed suicide, you can destroy this locked room!!"
"......Certainly.
 If the culprit locked themselves in the final locked room,
 and threw away their own life, this locked‐room chain would be established."
"The culprit\'s suicide.
 ...Normally, it is an unthinkable move,
 but the argument that it doesn\'t exist because it is unthinkable,
 doesn\'t exist.
 ......And he has no responsibility to demonstrate a motive.
 A truly powerful move, which can only be used in a chess match against a witch...!"
"......Well, you cannot say for certain that there is no motive.
 ...For example, Kinzo had been pronounced as having only a short time left to live.
 The motive of using his own death as a message, not being afraid to lose his short remaining life,
 ...may not be impossible to attach."
".........Milady.
 It is our turn."
"H‐...hmm!
 To imagine that you would even trample on the dignity of the dead to create a culprit...!
 What a heartless, cold‐blooded man...!"
"Setting up the dead as the culprit.
 ...This move is worse than inhuman, and it\'s one you used to attack Kanon‐kun in the last game.
 ......I\'m taking a shot back at you with this move,
 as a tribute to Kanon‐kun for that time, even though the games are different."
"Just now, I have freed that Kanon‐kun from his regrets!!"
"Ku......kuuuuuuu......!!"
"You have no duty to hold back here.
 You should check whether suicide was not the cause of death for any of them.
 I recommend requesting a repetition."
"Right!!
 But suicide is a naive word that won\'t corner her!!
 Beato, this is the end!!"
"Repetition requested!!
 "The six deaths were all homicides"!!"
".....................That is painful."
"Uguu...!!
 ........................kh...ooohh...!"
"Hmmmm?
 What\'s wrong, six people were killed, right?!
 I\'m just checking the simplest premise we had at the very beginning, aren\'t I?
 Can\'t you repeat it?!"
"I......I decline to repeat.
 ...Th‐there\'s no reason in particular."
"Refusing to repeat this is the same as resigning, you know?!"
"Checkmate!!
 One of the six was the culprit, and they carried out a suicide after constructing the locked room!
 We\'re done!!"
"...W‐wait!
 No, umm, ......I\'ll say it, I\'ll say it!
 I\'ll use the red like you want!
 {p:1:None of the six committed suicide}!"
"How\'s that?!
 Are you satisfied...?!
 *cackle*cackle*, kakkakakakaka!
 I\'ve struck back, I\'ve struck back!!!"
"Heh,
 ......what the hell, so you can say it...
 ...But isn\'t that weird?
 Why are you so panicked...?"
"......I‐i‐it\'s your imagination.
 I am also frantic this time, you see?
 I don\'t have much leeway.
 Don\'t pay it any mind..."
"......The repetition you requested has been modified.
 Do not be fooled."
"..................kuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu..."
"Pu ku ku ku...
 It seems it was useless, Milady."
"Th‐that\'s right!
 She didn\'t say "the six deaths were all homicides".
 She changed it to "none of the six committed suicide"!
 Which means that one or more of the people was not killed by someone else and didn\'t commit suicide."
".........Aaaaaaaahhh,
 I\'ve got it, I\'ve got it!!
 This is the truth!"
"After culprit X, who lurks among the six, murdered the other five, they constructed a locked room.
 ......Then they planned to escape from or hide in that room by some method."
"However, {i:there was an accident}!!
 The culprit died from an accident that even they hadn\'t expected, and constructed a locked room that even they hadn\'t desired!!
 Now it\'s over, {f:5:Beatrice}!!
 Checkmate!!!"
"D......damn iiiit!!
 Did you think I would be cornered by something like that!!
 I would never scream my resignation over something like that!!"
"I\'ll slice up that foolish checkmate with my red treasured sword over and over again!!
 Among the six, there were n—"
"Mgmf?!
 Fugagaga, wha are you ooing, fugafuga!"
"My apologies.
 Our side requests some time to strategize.
 Please allow us a brief postponement."
"......It is a just request.
 I believe there should be no problem."
"Sure!! I\'ll allow that!
 I\'ve been given those a lot lately.
 This time it\'s your turn to use it...!!"
"Thank you very much.
 Come, Milady, ......this way.
 And let us quietly count to one hundred inside our heads."
"Fugafugafuga!!
 Hunoheh, huhnoheee!!
 Fugaa!"
As Beato grew thoroughly panicked and agitated, Ronove had quickly covered her mouth with his hand, and suspended the game.
He then pulled Beato away in the name of a strategy conference...
"......Damn.
 Curse that demon butler.
 When Beato got all hot, that was an ideal chance to corner her..."
Beato normally behaves elegantly, but she actually has a really short temper and gets mad easily.
......Her normal intelligence falls silent when she starts getting agitated.
"Ronove is composed.
 ...He probably gave that child some time to cool her head.
 ......That child was stubbornly trying to remove your check,
 and was going to easily let several large pieces go.
 ...After all, the first twilight is only a skirmish.
 ......That child mistook her timing."
"......So, what does it mean?
 Did I create a checkmate, or didn\'t I?"
"That child was going to proclaim it in red.
 It probably wouldn\'t have become checkmate yet.
 ......But, I imagine,
 that child will proclaim her resignation once she has cooled her head."
"...Surely not.
 Even though she hates losing...?"
"Yes.
 In a losing battle, it is essential to withdraw your troops as soon as possible to try to minimize your losses.
 ......The difficult part is measuring whether it is a losing battle or not.
 ...It seems that that child\'s butler calmly made that decision."
"......Oh well.
 In other words, she got away with only a second to spare.
 ......Looks like...
I won\'t be getting checkmate and delivering the final blow so easily."
"However, you should measure this as your victory.
 They seem to have just barely prevented a large loss,
 but without a doubt, you dealt considerable damage.
 ......I am sure you were able to understand well the depths of that wound by watching the way she panicked."
"Seriously.
 Ihihihi, it feels like she\'d start crying if I bullied her any more than this."
As we talked, Ronove returned with Beato, who wore a meek expression.
...She didn\'t have the same bold smile as usual, but it looked like the blood wasn\'t rushing to her head anymore.
".........Hey.
 It\'s your turn.
 Did you decide your next move?"
"I resign.
 ......For now, I will let you have your victory."
Beato told me that frankly.
{n}It seemed as though she had taken a far‐sighted view, as though saying "if you want to laugh, then laugh".
......It was a bit of a buzzkill, and I lost my desire to attack her further.
"Well, now that you\'ve resigned, in the end,
 all that means is that we\'re even, since my theory and yours can\'t deny each other.
 I\'ll treat it more like a tie than a loss."
"......I don\'t need your disgusting compassion.
 I say that this time, it is my loss.
 ...When you find a dog drenched with rain, are you inclined to whack it with a stick or something?"
"Nope.
 Unlike you."
".............................."
Even though she ridiculed me horribly when I showed signs of defeat, she was so pathetic when it was her turn.
I thought of her as a pretty unfair person, but I decided to act with dignity as a winner and accepted it.
......Beato had resigned.
{n}That was the only result of the first twilight.
{f:5:Beatrice} couldn\'t counter my move of "one of the six was the culprit,
 and that person died in an accident".
...No, she probably could have countered it, but because of some strategic decision, she had given up.
I felt less like I had won, and more like she had escaped me one step from victory...
In chess against witches, it is possible to battle onward solely using pieces called X which don\'t need explanation.
Thanks to the "Devil\'s Proof", I can create as many strange fictions as I want, and use them to fight in the argument.
...But that\'s only within the context of chess with a witch.
{n}......In our human world, such an abstract story can\'t explain anything.
The first twilight today was a chain of six locked rooms.
{n}...It certainly may be possible for a human.
Beato hadn\'t been able to completely deny everything.
However, I don\'t have a clue who committed the crime,
 why, and how they actually did it...
I shouldn\'t say this having won,
 ......but I get the feeling that I would have felt less muddled...
if I had just been told right out by {f:5:Beatrice} that it was completely impossible for a human.
Although I hide behind these abstract pieces called X,
{n}............I couldn\'t deny that some kind of unthinkable,
 creepy intention had definitely pervaded this mansion...The true enemy of holding a fort probably isn\'t the fear of unseen enemies.
 It\'s whether you can keep it going over a long period of time.
Maria had gotten bored and had started making a ruckus because she wanted to watch TV.
 Since there was no TV in the lobby, she decided to return to the cousins\' room upstairs.
The adults probably didn\'t want to leave Maria all on her own, among other reasons.
 They told all the children to go to the cousins\' room upstairs.
George, his heart wounded by the loss of his fiancée, had no willpower to resist that, and led the cousins upstairs.
At first, Nanjo had been reading a book in the lobby,
 but when he noticed that the relatives looked like they wanted to talk about something shady,
 he said "It seems I am in the way..." and returned to his room upstairs.
".........I\'m starving.
 And if I keep just sitting around, my drowsiness will be even worse."
"It\'s only natural.
 Because we didn\'t sleep last night."
"...We will probably end up barricaded here for a full 24 hours.
 It may be wiser to take naps in turn instead of over‐stressing ourselves."
"I agree.
 My husband and I will be here, so anyone who finds this difficult should rest without overdoing it."
"They might be expecting that, you know?
 They may not be able to defeat this many people, but if that number was reduced by a certain amount, they may plan to use that to their advantage."
"There are seven of us here.
 Two of us could rest for three hours at a time.
 ......It\'s a long time until tomorrow morning.
 We still have some energy now, but tonight\'s going to be tough."
"Sure will be.
 Anyone sleepy?
 Don\'t overdo it, rest."
Hideyoshi looked around at everyone to see who wanted to sleep first, but no one volunteered.
...Everyone was just as tired, but no one was bold enough to be able to sleep now.
 ......Their fear of the unknown culprit was just as strong as their sleepiness.
"......Nobody?
 Well, don\'t overdo it, everyone."
"If we get tired, we can think about it then.
 ......I certainly am tired, but I\'m not in the mood now."
Eva spoke sharply, and then read once more over the second letter from {f:5:Beatrice}, which had been found in the boiler room.
{f:5:Beatrice} had sent them two letters, and had repeatedly told them to solve the riddle of the epitaph.
And she had even provoked them by saying she would give up the inheritance, both assets and headship, if it could be solved...
Eva took out a notebook and opened it to a page with the epitaph copied onto it.
"............Is that the epitaph?"
"Yes.
 ......Although it\'s annoying to do as the culprit says,
 after all, we do have time to waste.
 I think it\'s the perfect way to stave off boredom."
"...Not a bad way to kill time.
 Why don\'t we challenge it together as siblings?"
"......Can I borrow that?
 I\'ll rewrite it just a little larger.
 Natsuhi‐san, do you have a slightly larger piece of paper?"
"There should be paper in the servant room.
 I will bring some."
Natsuhi immediately brought a B4 blank sheet of paper from the servant room.
Kyrie borrowed Eva\'s notebook, wrote out the epitaph on the paper, and laid it out on the table.
Straight away, everyone peered down at it.
{n}...A fence of people naturally formed.
"I\'ve heard about it, but...
...really, this is a tough riddle.
 I don\'t have a clue what it\'s talking about."
"At one point, I also did my best to challenge it, but I was just as clueless."
"If we did know, we wouldn\'t have come all the way out here with a plan to make money.
 After all, it\'s ten tons of gold."
"............This is the first time I\'ve read it seriously, but...
...roughly speaking, couldn\'t it be split into three parts?"
"...I\'ve been thinking this since last night, but you really do seem to be a good thinker, Kyrie‐san.
 It\'s possible that you could easily solve this riddle that we couldn\'t."
"Yeah.
 Kyrie\'s sharp.
 ......She might be able to tackle it in an interesting way if we don\'t give her any strange preconceptions."
".........Yes.
 Kyrie‐san.
 Will you let us hear your honest thoughts having read the epitaph?"
"I think it probably won\'t be very useful to all of you.
 You all give me too much credit."
"No way, anything that comes to mind would be helpful.
 Let us hear what you have to say.
 ......Because your hints always help me when I\'m worried."
"Oh, so they were helpful?
 It\'s nice to finally hear about this now."
"Come ooon, don\'t I always thank you?"
"You two do get along well.
 I\'m jealous."
"And the rest of us would also love to accept your hints.
 It\'s alright, we\'re just killing time anyway, so why not relax?"
Kyrie was bewildered by all this praise she was suddenly receiving.
...But they had plenty of time.
 She realized that this was just a way to waste time, and she decided to accept that role...
"......I\'m sure I\'ll say something off the mark, but...
well, I\'ll put forward my ideas."
"Mmhm.
 ......What did you mean in the beginning, about how, roughly speaking, it could be divided into three parts?"
"Well...I just mean what I said.
 I think that overall, the epitaph can be divided into three parts."
"First, there are the five lines up to and including "There the {loghint:kagi:key} to the {loghint:ougon:gold} sleeps".
 Up until this point is the first part, which points to the location of the key."
"And then there\'s the part formed by the eleven lines up until the tenth twilight, which refer to the location of the {loghint:ougonkyou:Golden Land} itself."
"And the remaining six lines make up the part after the Golden Land has been reached."
"I see.
 The key, the Golden Land,
 and the Golden Land\'s {loghint:takara:treasure}; it can be divided into these three parts."
"Even we have been able to grasp that much.
 The three sections that refer to the key, the door, and the treasure."
"...Nii‐san, don\'t butt in any more than you have to!
 Let Kyrie‐san speak her ideas freely."
"Kyrie.
 Please continue.
 ......We recognize the same thing regarding what you said.
 So then?"
"......I wonder what that thing in the beginning, the "{loghint:natsukashiki:beloved} {loghint:kokyou:home of old}", means.
 Thinking about it normally, would it refer to Grandfather\'s home?"
"Since he explicitly mentioned that it\'s {loghint:natsukashiki:beloved}, I can imagine that it\'s a home he thought about very deeply.
 ......Didn\'t Father come from Odawara?"
".........Odawara is definitely where he was born,
 but I don\'t think this home Father loved was Odawara.
 I believe all of us siblings are thinking of the same place."
"...Yes.
 This probably isn\'t Odawara.
 From what I\'ve heard, he had a very fun time as a youth."
"Hahhaha.
 ...Dad\'s greatest misfortune in his life was probably being made the Ushiromiya family head."
"......Probably.
 Father really hadn\'t wanted to become the Ushiromiya family head."
"So where is it?
 And is there a {loghint:kawa:river} where {loghint:ayu:sweetfish} swim?"
"......Maybe there was at the time.
 I\'m sure that there has been a lot of development there by now, so the sweetfish might have disappeared.
 It would be extremely difficult to investigate whether there were sweetfish there during the time Grandfather was a boy."
"There\'s not just one river, either.
 I believe we all investigated thoroughly in a geographical sense.
 ......You even went to the actual place to investigate directly, didn\'t you, Eva?"
"That was only as a vacation.
 ......But the townscape had changed completely from Father\'s time.
 After all, there was a war in between.
 It was impossible to even figure out where Father actually lived.
 ...Probably, even if Father dragged himself to the actual location,
 by now, even he wouldn\'t be able to determine where it was that he lived."
"They\'ve had a remarkable revival over there, after all..."
"............Doesn\'t any place name come clearly to mind after hearing "{loghint:ayu no kawa:sweetfish river}"?"
"Not really.
 I mean, they\'re sweetfish, right?
 People say they live in rivers with {loghint:kirei:clean} {loghint:mizu:water}, so there are countless rivers we could guess at.
 Any {loghint:ogawa:stream} that Dad innocently went {loghint:ayuzuri:sweetfish‐fishing} in was probably buried by the development later.
 It would be different if we had a map from before the war, or a person who knew a lot about how the area was before the war, but..."
"......It probably isn\'t something like that."
"What do you mean...?"
".........Behold the sweetfish river, running through my beloved home of old.
 You who seek the Golden Land, follow its path downstream in search of the key.
 ...After these two lines, there is a single blank line."
"...Something is being presented with just these two lines.
 I would suppose the next three lines continue based upon that something."
"I wonder what it is that\'s being presented, then...?"
"......I don\'t know.
 In any case, after just these two lines, it\'s not something vague like you don\'t know which river it is...
you\'re able to narrow it down and say specifically what "{loghint:kawa:river}"."
"......It may be that this isn\'t a "river" with water flowing down it.
 ...The "sweetfish river" might be some kind of metaphor.
 ......What kind of image does the word sweetfish have?"
".........Sweetfish are like {loghint:shake:salmon}.
 They\'re {loghint:tansui‐gyo:freshwater fish}, but they go out into the {loghint:umi:ocean} right after they\'re born.
 And when they get big, they return to the river to live there,
 and then they {loghint:sanran:spawn} there and end their lives there."
"Well, they leave their home at one point, but the part about them getting big and returning there to lay {loghint:tamago:eggs},
 that might have a family prosperity type of image."
"Huh.
 They\'re freshwater fish, but they can live in the {loghint:kaisui:ocean}?
 I didn\'t know that.
 I thought they were {loghint:kawa‐zakana:river fish}, so they couldn\'t go out into the sea."
"And they are also called {ruby:kougyo:{p:0:香魚}} (aroma fish) because they have a pleasant smell.
 I have never eaten one, but I have heard that they are very delicious when {loghint:shioyaki:grilled with salt}."
"Whoa, Natsuhi‐san!
 You\'ve never eaten salt‐grilled sweetfish?!
 They\'re delicious!
 I\'ll treat you sometime!"
"It is a food for commoners.
 It isn\'t appropriate for your mouth."
"......This is just my wild idea,
 ...but the image I get from a sweetfish river has made me suspect a {loghint:kakeizu:family tree} before.
 The sweetfish go out into the ocean for a time, but they return to the river where they were born to spawn, right?
 .........It makes me think about myself."
"......You\'re right.
 I can confess now...
that I have sometimes suspected that it refers to you and Maria‐chan."
"I see.
 ......As you travel down it, you will see a village.
 The only "village" ({ruby:sato:{p:0:里}}) you\'ll find by going down the family tree is the one in Maria\'s name ({p:0:真里亞})."
"Right?!
 ......But as you all know, Father has a dislike of Maria,
 and he has almost never spoken with her."
"Besides which, Father once told me to give Maria a completely different name.
 I just made it Maria on my own.
 Father was very mad about that."
"......If you think about the history there,
 I just really couldn\'t imagine that he\'d reference Maria\'s name in his precious epitaph about who would inherit his wealth and the family headship."
"Have you ever let Maria‐chan read the epitaph?"
"Um, yes. Of course I have.
 But she didn\'t seem to have a clue.
 ......She didn\'t have a clue, and she kept going on about that same occult stuff, about how it was a {loghint:fukkatsu:resurrection} {loghint:gishiki:ceremony} for the witch."
"............A connection between Father and Maria.
 ...Certainly, they do share that occult hobby, but they never interacted.
 ...I can\'t imagine it refers to Maria either."
"......What interests me is the fact that he explicitly added the word "{loghint:natsukashiki:beloved}" at the beginning.
 ......Like you all said just now,
 if Father was reluctant about becoming the Ushiromiya family head,
 would he describe it that way?
 ...I don\'t think it is Odawara, which points back to the Ushiromiya {loghint:honke:main family}."
"......I believe that this word "beloved" here at the beginning...
definitely refers to a place full of very important memories to Father."
"...............Hmmmmmm.
 ...Well, that\'s fine.
 It\'d be hard to pinpoint since we don\'t have a clue about a map from that time,
 but anyway, there were probably several rivers with sweetfish swimming in them near Dad\'s home during his youth."
"That\'s if it\'s a river with water flowing down it, right?
 And then?
 Go on, Kyrie‐san."
"......I don\'t really understand the three lines starting with "As you travel down it, you will see a village".
 ...These are probably coupled with the two lines about the sweetfish river."
"It\'s probably something that we would automatically understand if we knew what the sweetfish river really was.
 ...As long as we don\'t understand that, it\'s probably useless to try and solve those three lines any further."
"So we\'re screwed unless we know what the "sweetfish river" really is...
 And there\'s no guarantee it even means a literal river."
"...Seriously.
 The heck does it mean by sweetfish?
 Were they a {loghint:koubutsu:favorite dish} of Dad\'s?
 Or is there some special meaning?
 Is it pointless to read too deeply into it?"
"...If you don\'t have both a micro and a macro perspective, your field of vision grows narrow.
 ......Think not too deeply, about a river with {loghint:sakana:fish} swimming in it, or some kind of {loghint:nagare:flow},
 ...something you can {loghint:kudaru:go down} or {loghint:noboru:go up},
 keep those kinds of abstract images in mind, and we may be able to come up with more out‐of‐the‐box ideas."
"And via the three lines that follow, the answer for the "sweetfish river" ends up at the "key to the Golden Land"..."
"If you think about it this way, I wonder if it was a mistake to split it into three parts.
 There\'s actually four parts.
 ......‘Go down the sweetfish river’,
 "find the key to the Golden Land",
 "journey to the Golden Land",
 and "the treasure of the Golden Land"."
"Hmmm... ......Truly interesting.
 While we have this opportunity,
 would you mind continuing and telling us your opinion about the most central portion of the {loghint:hibun:epitaph},
 up until the {loghint:dai‐juu no ban:tenth twilight} where we arrive at the Golden Land?"
"......That\'s the most symbolic, ...and also the most disturbing part."
"Since it keeps mentioning the word {loghint:ikenie:sacrifice},
 I can\'t help but think it has something to do with Father\'s occult {loghint:gishiki:rituals}...
 .........How do you see it, Kyrie‐san?"
Kyrie recrossed her arms several times,
 peering into the paper with the epitaph copied onto it as though she was looking through it...
"...........................
 .........This is...very difficult.
 ...By starting with "You who laid {loghint:te:hand} upon the key",
 it probably means that you won\'t be able to continue without understanding the key.
 ...I\'ll have to give up, but I\'ll take a shot at it anyway."
"......Just like how the "sweetfish river" isn\'t necessarily a river with water flowing down it,
 it is also doubtful whether this "key" is actually something shaped like a key."
"Right.
 There\'s also the possibility that it\'s a code or a keyword.
 ......After all, this key isn\'t something to be stuck into a keyhole.
 It\'s something that selects the six people to be sacrifices for the first twilight."
"In that sense, we can state that this key isn\'t something to open the door to the Golden Land."
"......But what a disturbing key.
 A key that can select six people to be sacrifices..."
"How would a key {loghint:erabu:select} anything?
 ...Does it spin around like a roulette...?"
"This key points towards a certain specific group of {loghint:roku‐nin:six people}.
 ......No, we should say it points to a certain specific group of {loghint:muttsu:six things}.
 ......If this doesn\'t mean a literal command to offer sacrifices.
 ...For example, it could be an anagram."
"An anagram?
 Do you mean a word game...?"
"Yes.
 Ever since Rosa started talking about the family tree and how "village" was a part of Maria‐chan\'s name,
 this has constantly been going through my mind."
"......It seems as though Rudolf‐san, for example, has run with the words "beloved home of old",
 and is assuming that it has to something to do with {loghint:chikei:geography} or {loghint:zahyou:coordinates}, but that might not be true.
 This could be some kind of puzzle, ...or maybe playing with letters."
"......I\'m sorry.
 What do you mean by playing with letters?"
"Oh yeah, it\'s like "sucker merry barrellers".
 What do you get when you take out the e\'s and r\'s?
 Like that.
 Well, you were raised well, Natsuhi‐san, so you probably haven\'t heard that one."
"Take out the e\'s and r\'s? Huh?
 ???"
"Don\'t.
 It is an undignified game, inappropriate for you."
Only Natsuhi didn\'t get it and had a blank look on her face.
It seemed that she had only guessed the answer had to be something undignified,
 after hearing Rudolf and Eva\'s snickers.
"Ah, ...Natsuhi nee‐san, it\'s something like this.
 There was something like it in Maria\'s book of puzzles, okay?
 There\'s this thing called the Tanuki Notebook."
"There\'s a notebook written in some kind of code, with a lot of "ta"s mixed in,
 and if you "{ruby:nuki:remove}" all of the "ta"s, then the true sentences pop up.
 It\'s a game like that."
"Ah......oh, I see.
 .........??"
Natsuhi finally realized the answer to the undignified riddle Rudolf had posed, and her face grew red as she hung her head in embarrassment.
"...............So maybe that "remove" part is actually represented by "{loghint:korosu:kill}"...?"
"Yes.
 I was just thinking that too.
 It\'s possible that the key to the Golden Land is a word with {loghint:roku‐moji:six characters}."
"In other words, ...the "ta" from the Tanuki Notebook...is actually six characters here...?
 Hmmm, ...this is gettin\' complicated..."
"Playing with letters, is it...
 ......Hmmm.
 In Japan, it really feels like a child\'s game, but it seems that it is a stylish form of humor among intellectuals in the English‐speaking world.
 ...It is easy to imagine that Father showed interest in it."
"......But right here, I quickly lose my ability to understand it.
 Up until this point, while it was filled with mystery, it was extremely sequential."
"‘Sweetfish river’, "go down it", "then find the key" is all extremely sequential.
 And we can guess that we gain a six‐character key as a result,
 ......but in that case, we now don\'t know {i:what} we kill the six characters from."
"That\'s a point.
 What do we subtract the six characters from?
 It doesn\'t tell us."
"...On the second twilight, it says "{loghint:nokosareshi mono wa:those who remain}".
 ......Which means that, at the very least, that "something" has a finite number of characters.
 You could read it like it\'s telling you to continue with the {loghint:nokotta:remaining} characters after the six characters are removed."
".........And yet, we don\'t know what this "something" is, even though it should have been shown to us at the beginning.
 ...Were we wrong even to assume that this is playing with letters...?"
".....................hmmmmm..."
Everyone crossed their arms and fell into silence.
It felt like they were about to reach a novel understanding that they hadn\'t been able to before...but they stumbled just one step before it.
At that time, Hideyoshi\'s stomach rumbled heartily.
The silence up until then was broken by laughter.
"Sorry, sorry.
 By spinnin\' the gears in my head for a change, my stomach\'s gone completely empty.
 Looks like skippin\' breakfast really takes its toll on me...wahahahahaha."
"Natsuhi.
 Is there nothing here?"
"There should at least be enough set aside for breakfast.
 I will prepare it."
"I\'m also starving.
 I\'ll bet those brats above us are starving too.
 ...But I doubt there\'s enough for 18 people here, and for three meals."
"You\'re right there.
 It\'ll be a marathon to tomorrow.
 It might be better if we took a trip back to the mansion and fished around for some canned food or something in the kitchen."
"There\'s nothing more than crackers and snacks, but if that is alright, I can prepare them.
 But with this many people, there might not be any left for lunch..."
"That will be fine for now.
 Sorry, but would you prepare it for us?"
It looked like the men had been taken over with an appetite that stopped all thought.
The atmosphere grew more peaceful, and the epitaph investigation meeting broke up for the time being.
But Eva kept staring at the paper the epitaph was written on like she was going to burn a hole through it...
"............A word game was nothing more than my theory.
 There is a chance that it\'s mistaken.
 Eva‐san, don\'t take it too seriously, okay...?"
".........Thank you.
 This is something I\'ve decided to do myself.
 Would you mind leaving me alone?"
Eva spoke coldly.
...Kyrie didn\'t bother her any more, and went to help Natsuhi prepare breakfast.
"Nee‐san.
 Shouldn\'t we also help prepare breakfast?"
"Then you go help.
 I\'m busy solving this!"
"S‐sorry...
 Th‐then I\'ll go help..."
".........Come {i:on}.
 Why are you like this?"
"......Huh?"
"The Ushiromiya family inheritance will be given to the person who solves this epitaph.
 You seem to have given up from the beginning, as though it has nothing to do with you,
 but if you could solve it, even you have the opportunity to inherit the family headship."
"......This is a chance to steal everything from Nii‐san.
 Why aren\'t you seriously trying to solve it for that once‐in‐a‐lifetime chance?"
"...Um, .........umm, ......I......"
Rosa hung her head, troubled over how she should answer.
{n}...She regretted, for the first time in a while, carelessly speaking to her sister when she was in a bad mood.
"If you\'ve noticed anything, say so.
 Even though Kyrie‐san and I were seriously reasoning, you just kept nodding your head, didn\'t you?
 Come on.
 Isn\'t there anything you\'ve noticed?
 Come on!"
".........Uh,
 .........umm,
 .........
 ......Isn\'t...this strange?"
"...Strange?
 What is?"
"Umm, ......this word, {loghint:ougonkyou:Golden Land}.
 The word Golden Land comes up several times."
"So what?
 Do you get some keywords by splitting up the characters in "Golden Land"?"
"Um, umm, that\'s not it.
 ......Look, isn\'t just the tenth twilight strange?"
"...............Huh?
 ......ah."
"Even though they\'re all written the "Golden Land" ({ruby:ougonkyou:{p:0:黄金郷}}), for some reason, this one place has the "Home of the Gold" ({ruby:ougon no sato:{p:0:黄金の郷}}).
 He explicitly mixed in the character {ruby:no:{p:0:の}}, changing the phrasing.
 It vaguely bugged me that it\'s only said differently here..."
".........ah, umm, ...it\'s not like it means anything.
 This is Father we\'re talking about.
 It could just be a coincidental change in how he said the word."
".........................................."
".........Boring."
"Oh? What is boring...?"
".........Boring, boring."
"Well now.
 I don\'t have the foggiest idea what this child is grumbling about."
"She is probably dissatisfied that you gave Battler‐sama various hints, Madam."
"......Noooope?
 I\'m not dissatisfied about that.
 I\'m actually {i:more} satisfied now that that worthless Battler has finally reached the level where he can go along with me."
"Hoh‐hoh‐ho...
 Was I a little too friendly with Battler‐kun?
 Maybe it would be better if the old people went away and left everything to the young kids."
"Pu ku ku ku ku..."
When {f:5:Virgilia} and Ronove giggled and cackled,
 {f:5:Beatrice}\'s irritation meter finally reached its limit.
"Ahhhh, the both of you joining forces and laughing at me!
 Ronove, hide yourself for a while!
 Go away, go awaaaay!"
"Certainly.
 Then, I will rest for a while.
 Pukkukukuku..."
Ronove bowed his head, still laughing, and hid himself.
After that, all that remained was the figure of {f:5:Beatrice}, who was grumpy and irritated,
 and {f:5:Virgilia}, who was coolly enjoying her tea.
"...............When you said "{p:1:There are no more than 18 people on this island}", you actually cornered yourself."
".........I thought so...
 ............I thought it might have been a {i:little} too early, but...
 ......I guess it really was......"
"If you had led him further astray beforehand, things might have been different,
 but it really was a futile trump card.
 You stirred him up instead."
In addition to his victory condition of denying the witch,
 Battler had held onto a different victory condition, since he had wanted to explain things without suspecting any of the 18.
Hadn\'t he been at his weakest when he was being tossed about by these two opposing goals?
However, {f:5:Beatrice} had used the red carelessly, and had proclaimed that there were no more than 18 people.
...Because of that, Battler had been forced to suspect one of the 18,
 .........and he had finally begun to build up the readiness that he needed to accept that.
Battler was stubborn,
 but because of that, when he was struck where he was fragile, fissures would crack all over him, like breaking china.
That itself should have been his greatest weak point...
".........Kuuuuuu.
 ......Maybe I got a bit too careless after my overwhelming victory last time......"
"Yes, you were too careless.
 ...The last game was a difficult one for Battler‐kun,
 but it seems...
this game will prove a difficult one {i:for you}."
"......A broken vase will definitely never return to its original form.
 ...So it would be more constructive to think of the next move, rather than regretfully picking up the pieces."
".........But now that Battler has all the right ideas in his head, how should I plot against him...?"
"Hoh‐hoh‐ho.
 Your troubled face is an even better treat than Ronove\'s cookies."
"......Uu.
 You and Battler and even Ronove keep treating me like a snack.
 ...Even though I\'m not sweet at allll."
With a shameful, childlike face that she would never have shown in front of Battler,
 {f:5:Beatrice} rolled her head around on top of the table.
"............Masteeer.
 .........At least a hiiint."
"Oh?
 What kind of hint?"
"If you know a skillful move that will make Battler speechless, and make him want to accept me,
 I won\'t ask you to say it outright, so, umm,
 ...even if it\'s just a hint..."
"Hoh‐hoh‐ho, I can\'t.
 I am acting as Battler‐kun\'s ally right now,
 so I cannot teach you something that would give you an advantage."
"...You don\'t have to be so strict...
 Your disciple\'s in troubllle..."
"I believe you harshly boasted that you had surpassed your master, correct?"
".........Uu...
 Please act like the old person you are and give me just a bit of your cunning wisdom...
 Pleease...
 It\'s mean if you only help Battleeer..."
"My, my.
 You\'re still a spoiled child."
"......But, it\'s true that I may have given Battler‐kun a few too many hints.
 It did serve as a scolding to you,
 but perhaps it was a little too much support for a fair game."
"You see, you see...?
 Please, Masteeer, at least just a hint to help me on..."
"..................Just a hint.
 Think about what it means by yourself, alright?"
"Yeah, yeah!
 I\'ll think about it myself, so please!
 Please, give me one that\'ll leave Battler down in the dumps, Masterrrr."
It was truly shameful how she behaved when Battler wasn\'t around, even though she acted utterly like a Great Witch in front of him.
{f:5:Virgilia} sighed, lamenting under her breath that Beato never seemed to grow up.
"Then just a hint.
 ......Do you know of Aesop\'s fable, The North Wind and the Sun?"
"Of course.
 It\'s a story about how the north wind and the sun challenge each other to steal the cloak of a traveler, right?"
"That\'s right.
 The moral is that violent or impatient methods aren\'t always necessarily the best decisions."
"......You don\'t have to tell me that.
 I have already reflected on the fact that I rushed too fast towards victory."
"...............
 Think well about what this means.
 And furthermore,
 ......although it seems that Battler‐kun had a slight misunderstanding as well, you too seem to be under a misapprehension.
 Do you understand the victory conditions of this game?"
"...What else is there, other than making Battler submit to me?"
".........See?
 At that point, you are already mistaken."
"How am I mistaken?"
"Your victory isn\'t making Battler‐kun submit.
 ......It is to get Battler‐kun to accept your existence, is it not?"
"......What\'s this?
 You want me to butter up Battler, and ask him to "Accept me as a witch, pleease?"!
 How foolish!
 I will not sink so low!"
Grrrrrrrrrrr..., Beato growled, like a dog in a bad mood.
{f:5:Virgilia} shrugged her shoulders, snickering at her disciple, who was as short‐tempered as always...
"That is my hint.
 Now you should think deeply.
 .........In any event, your moves up until now will not work on Battler‐kun.
 A significant tactical conversion will probably be required."
"...I know that even without you telling me.
 ......I don\'t have a clue what you mean by the North Wind and the Sun,
 but anyway, I understand that I will have to change my direction.
 ......I\'ll showcase a clever scheme that will surprise even you, Master...!"
"Hoh‐hoh‐ho...
 I look forward to it.
 I wonder how Battler‐kun will tackle that.
 ......I will be wishing you good luck as well."
"After Battler, right?
 Hmph..."
".........Are you going to give up and resign already?
 If you\'re that tired, why not just go into a futon and sleep forever...?"
...As my consciousness grew vague and I pretended to fight my drowsiness, sinking deeper and deeper into the sofa,
 "I" scolded "myself".
"......Don\'t you remember how much you dreamed about stealing the position of family head from Krauss...?"
"Even though I gave you that chance with my magic, you\'re already throwing it away...?"
You say that, but...
 ............This riddle is really difficult.
Even a wire puzzle would be better.
...At least in that case, you\'re assured that it definitely is solvable.
But with this epitaph riddle, I don\'t know if I\'m even assured that.
......I might just be fighting a useless battle.
...Still hazy, I looked at the notebook which I had been holding the whole time.
It was opened to the page with the epitaph, which I had stared at, almost burned a hole through, on so many hundreds of nights I had lost count.
......That...is truly a door.
On the other side...is the "Golden Land", that place which ever since I was a child I\'ve wished to reach, I\'ve spared no effort to reach,
 ...and I\'ve never been able to reach.
Here I am with both hands upon the door,
 ...and even though the book, no, the door is open, I still cannot reach the other side?
"...That\'s right.
 You already have your hands upon the door.
 Come, open it with all of your strength.
 And read the characters written on the door."
".........Open it...
with all my strength.
 ...Read the characters...
written on the door..."
Strain your eyes.
 ......See through to what lies further beyond the epitaph written in the notebook...
"...The "beloved home of old" definitely won\'t betray our expectations.
 ......The only past that Father held dear was his years as a boy."
That\'s right......
 Then what about the "sweetfish river"?
There are several rivers where they swim, and it\'s dubious whether there was one very near the place that Father lived.
...If we start wondering which river that\'s home to sweetfish is closest in a cartographical sense...
things will quickly get vague and we won\'t be able to pin it down...
"......Didn\'t you say it yourself?
 You said it didn\'t have to be a river with water flowing down it.
 ......If the word sweetfish is too complicated, why not forget it forever...?"
"Think of a river.
 A river.
 Linking it with a "family tree" wasn\'t a bad idea.
 Try thinking about how to link a river with something else along those lines......"
......Not a river?
 Even though the sweetfish can\'t swim in it if it isn\'t a river?
Oh, but maybe "sweetfish can swim in it" means it joins up with the ocean......
My husband did say that, despite being river fish, they go out into the ocean... ...............
.......................................
 ...............With the ocean.
........................No,
 ...but,
 .........
 ......Huh...?
"......Did you notice?
 But that\'s just a faint memory.
 There should be a book archive somewhere around here.
 If you investigate, you can make sure."
......If that\'s the "sweetfish river".........
 .........And if the key might be a six‐character word...
.....................Is the key really resting in that river?
I, I don\'t know, I don\'t know.
{n}...Anyway, I have to search in an atlas...
But, even if I know that, I don\'t know {i:from what} I should take the six characters...
"......You really don\'t know?
 Think deeply.
 .........We\'re too smart for our own good, so our thoughts are inflexible."
"Don\'t think of it like it\'s something as grandiose as "The Riddle of the Epitaph", but like it\'s a child\'s puzzle.
 ......Men are always children, no matter how old they get.
 Even if Father has advanced into old age,
 that doesn\'t change the fact that he is essentially a child inside his heart."
".........Throw away your awe of Father.
 ...Think of this like it\'s a worthless, infantile puzzle game, like the ones Maria suddenly brings up on the boat."
......Puzzles.
 ......Worthless, infantile.
........................
 .....................Huh, .........ah.
.........I\'m sure that was, ...what was it, ......umm, umm......
...I\'m sure, if my memory isn\'t wrong, ......that was probably, umm...
No, I don\'t have to rely on my vague memory.
{n}I should be able to figure that out immediately too by searching in the archive.
".........We\'ve probably already realized the answer.
 ...All that\'s left is to research whether that\'s correct or not."
"Come, Eva.
 Let\'s go to the archive and make sure no one notices.
 ......There, we should find a mountain of thick books that didn\'t fit in Father\'s study.
 ...I\'m sure that we\'ll find a book that answers our question.
 .........Quickly.
 This is our first and last chance in our life to have our dreams made true."
When Natsuhi tried to lay a blanket over her, Eva suddenly jumped up.
"...I\'m sorry.
 I seem to have woken you."
"......Eva.
 If you\'re sleepy, don\'t overdo it.
 You rest first."
"Th‐......thank you.
 I\'m just going to the lavatory for a bit to wash my face."
"You should take it easy and rest.
 ...Your health\'ll take another bad turn, you know?"
"I said I\'m fine, really!
 I\'ll be right back."
Leaving only those words behind, I left the lobby at a brisk pace.
The lobby was partitioned off by a door, so as soon as I went into the corridor, they could no longer see me.
......The archive was next to the servant room.
Father always owned a vast book collection,
 but after he started to become engrossed with his occult hobby, his library of those kinds of books grew even larger,
 so that the normal books suitable for a normal study had been forced out as his study overflowed.
This archive was where those normal books were stored.
They were all stiff books for intellectuals, like complete volume sets of encyclopedias,
 but that was very convenient for me now that I was investigating something.
I entered softly, ......and just in case, I checked the room with my gun readied, making sure that there were no suspicious people there.
Then I locked it from the inside.
I actually wasn\'t thinking that the murderer might be hiding somewhere.
...What scared me was my fear that one of the siblings might hear what I was investigating.
My heart had started jumping......
{n}...I had been half‐asleep until a short time ago, so I hadn\'t been able to realize how significant this thing I had realized was.
But as I started to become aware, ......my heart started feeling like it was about to explode.
".........I...wonder if any of the other siblings have realized this......"
I don\'t think Krauss and Rudolf will realize.
......But I don\'t know about Kyrie.
She has extraordinarily good intuition.
.........And I don\'t know about Rosa either.
"Rosa is as dim as the others.
 She always has been, and ridiculously so."
Really...?
 I think she was wise enough to make you think she was dim, so that she didn\'t earn herself unnecessary malice.
".........Here it is.
 ...I wonder if we\'ll find it in this one."
I pulled the book out, and flipped through the pages......
"...............Oh.
 .........This is...
......
a "sweetfish river"...?"
I see...
This is what the sweetfish river means.
......Don\'t dawdle around, research further.
"Y‐yes, I know...
 As you travel down it, you will see a village ({ruby:sato:{p:0:里}})...
 {ruby:sato:{p:0:里}} is an older word for {loghint:machi:town} or {loghint:mura:village}, right?
 But it\'s a densely populated area... There\'s any number of those..."
Why have you stopped thinking?!
If you don\'t like it, why not quit forever...?
Why not just hand over the Ushiromiya headship to Kyrie forever?!
"I, ...I don\'t want to...
 I will become the head.
 ...This is my first and last chance to do that...
 ......What is {i:village}?
 What does it mean?!
 Is there a village if you go down this "river"......?!
 ............ah, .........
aaaaaaaahhh......!!"
......In {loghint:sono sato:that village}, look for the {loghint:kishi:shore} {loghint:futari:the two} {loghint:kuchi:speak} of.
......It\'s a "shore" ({ruby:kishi:{p:0:岸}}).
 Understand?
"Uh, ...*gulp*...
 I, I, I understand...!
 Shore, ......shore.........!"
All those pieces that I hadn\'t been able to understand at all were...
...right before my eyes, starting to...
...snap,
 snap into place, all by themselves......
I couldn\'t even remember to close my open mouth.
{n}...My throat grew completely dry...
Is it......really alright for this to be the answer?
{n}R‐really?
 Really...?!
"...But this isn\'t six characters at all.
 ......I\'m absolutely sure that this is the answer, but this doesn\'t reach six characters at all...!"
Did you stop thinking again?
 In that case, think of a way you could read it with six characters.
If you can\'t think of one, then research it.
......There has to be an answer.
 You must not doubt that.
If you can\'t believe that, why don\'t you cry yourself to sleep, and then just give up and die forever...?
"............One,
 two,
 three,
 four,
 five,
 six...
 ......Oooh,
 ...s‐
......
six characters...
"
"......I,
 ......I found it.
 ...This is...
......the Golden Land\'s...
k‐
......key.........!!"
Yes.
 That is...the key to the Golden Land.
 ......The key...to our childhood dreams.
......The only keyhole to stick that key in...is that place.
That...is definitely what offers the sacrifices.
You get it now...right...............?
"Uuu, ............uuuuUUUgghhHAAaaaaa...!!!"".........This way?
 ......That means go this way, right............?
 They are......inviting me to go this way, after all........."
......!!!
My heart leapt.
 ...Because there, ............gaping wide, ......was the opened mouth of eerie darkness.
"Wh‐.........what is this...
 What is this......?!"
When I strained my eyes, peering into the darkness, I saw something that looked like a light switch.
 ......In addition, there was a switch with open and close written on it.
I resolutely pushed the switch for the lights,
 and rough lights almost like you\'d find in a coal mine or something flickered on sporadically,
 making a staircase that stretched underground come hazily into vision...
It was creepy how it now looked even more gloomy with the lights turned on.
Other than the light switch, there was also a switch with open and close written on it.
...I could probably open and close it with this, but if I was unlucky enough to find that the open part was broken,
 I might be closed up in this creepy underground area for all eternity...
So for the time being, I didn\'t touch the open/close switch,
 ......and as I readied my gun again, I slowly went down the stairs.
Because the ceiling was very high, it didn\'t feel cramped.
{n}On the contrary, it felt as though a cool breeze was blowing upwards, and I even sensed a spiritual presence from the eeriness of it...
With my gun at the ready, and carefully staring forwards, ......I continued descending the stairs......
The walls, the stairs, the lights, ...all of them were very old‐fashioned.
{n}...It may be beyond doubt that this had been made at the same time that the mansion had been constructed on this island.
There were cracks in the ceiling, and water clung to the walls, constantly dripping down.
That water fell into a gutter that had been set up alongside the stairs, then quickly and silently flowed into the underground darkness.
 It was as though it was telling me to go faster...
The staircase turned back on itself a number of times.
 It was hard to tell how far underground I\'d gone, but I thought it to be much deeper than one floor.
And eventually, ............a rough, metal door showed itself.
And there, characters had been written in a dark red paint.
{n}...They had probably been written a long time ago.
— {p:1:On the tenth twilight, the journey ends, and you shall reach the Home of the Gold.}
My heart, which was already about to explode, jumped about even more as soon as I read those deep‐red characters...
There\'s no mistake...
 This is the last stop.
{n}.........Father\'s......Golden Land...!!
I calmed my throbbing heart, somehow regained my composure, and readied the gun again.
...But since, in the end, I couldn\'t open the door with my gun held in both hands...
......I lowered the gun, carefully erased my breath, and opened the door......
"..................I‐......isn\'t this......inside the......?!"
My first impression when I saw the room...
...was to question whether it might have been connected to one of the rooms in the mansion.
Yes, this place had exactly the same atmosphere about it as the forbidden VIP room on the second floor.
But this was underground, so there were no windows.
{n}There was only the solemn light of a grand chandelier.
But the quality of the interior, dimly lit by the faint light,
 was more than enough to take your breath away.
A bed with a canopy, and a rocking chair that looked like it would be very comfortable to sit in.
 An extravagant sofa and carpet.
The room was like a dream every girl yearns for at least once...
And yet, since it was an underground hidden room with no windows,
 it actually felt more like it could be the hidden house of a witch.
I had never swallowed the legend of {f:5:Beatrice}, witch of the forest.
However, ......if you were shown this room,
 ......it certainly would become hard to doubt that she actually had existed,
 and had lived in here.
".........Is someone...
..................there...?"
Although I was dumbfounded by this room, I cautiously,
 ...no, timidly kept my gun raised, and searched the interior.
And......in the center of the room, I found it.
"...............Eee—..............."
My gasp came out strangely, as though a bunny was being choked.
...I mean, ......after finding something like this,
 ...no one would have any words other than that stupid voice...
"It\'s here......
 ......I‐......it\'s really here.........
 ......Father\'s......gold......!!"
On the opposite side of the canopy bed, it was piled up in a massive heap...
 A mountain, a mountain of gold ingots!!
Of course, they weren\'t piled up carelessly in a way that would damage the dignity of this room.
A beautiful scarlet satin weave was laid on the mountain of gold,
 creating a beautiful three‐colored mix between the red, the gold, and the black of the deep darkness...
It was as though, when the witch slept on this bed,
 the gold would be a respectful chamberlain waiting on her.
Nobly, refinedly, gracefully, beautifully.
{n}It was piled there with an imposing and yet ceremonious air...
I tried to grab a single gold ingot and was surprised at its weight.
{n}......It was probably about ten kilograms.
......Just this one ingot would easily be worth ten million without a doubt.
The Ushiromiya family crest, the One‐winged Eagle, was lightly imprinted on it.
It was hard to tell whether it had worn away, or whether the impression had been made carelessly in the first place,
 but it was certainly the crest of the One‐winged Eagle.
Just how many ingots are piled up here?
Just by roughly multiplying both sides, and multiplying that by the height, it must surely come to over several hundred.
My mind\'s already blank... I can\'t calculate it properly.
{n}......Even a conservative count would put it easily above a billion yen.
"Well, of course... Of course it would be...
 ...I mean, it\'s ten tons of gold...
 At the current value, it\'s more than 20 billion yen of gold...
 I, ...I found it, ......before anyone else, .........I found it!!
 Ahaha, wahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha, ahah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"
In front of the mountain of gold, I spread my arms and looked up at the ceiling.
{n}A laugh without a trace of dignity flowed out from my entire body.
I had no intention at all of laughing in such a weird way,
 ...but I just, I just couldn\'t hold back the happy feeling that flowed throughout my entire body.
......That older brother of mine probably wouldn\'t accept his loss just because I had found this gold.
...But from now on, there would be no changing the fact that I had been the one to find the gold...!
To steal the headship of the family, I would still probably need some subtle tactics.
But after everything I\'ve gone through until now, that\'s a completely trivial problem.
Even if I lose out on the inheritance of the Ushiromiya family and everything...
{n}...this 20 billion yen\'s worth of gold is now mine and mine alone!!
"Hahahaha, a‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐ha!!
 There was a time when I thought of money as such a worthless thing.
 I thought, there are so many things in this world that you can\'t buy with money."
"...But now I understand that that\'s just a lie!
 It was just an excuse that have‐nots make for themselves!!"
"With this mountain of gold before me, I\'ve finally realized something so obvious...!!
 I can give birth to all the happiness in this world by melting this gold!
 With this money, my husband\'s company is fine now.
 We will always be happy as a family.
 And I can even leave a vast amount of money to George...!!"
"The rest of the relatives will eventually be ruined and disappear.
 At that time, George will use this gold, and revive the Ushiromiya family\'s lost honor,
 just like Father did...!!
 There will be no room for anyone to argue then.
 ......George is the true successor of the Ushiromiya family!!"
It happened!!!
 My wish was granted!!
That dream I have wished for ever since I was born into this world as Ushiromiya Eva, has been granted completely in this very moment...!!
My husband and I will be happy for all eternity.
 And I can also give my only son, George, eternal happiness!!
There\'s no way I\'ll waste it on foolish pleasures!!
{n}My older brother has chewed up the Ushiromiya family, but George and I will revive it!
And that means that we truly have succeeded the headship of the Ushiromiya family!!
"I succeeded...
 I did it, ...honey......George...
 ......I, ......your mother......finally succeeded...
 ......After this, we won\'t be threatened by anyone...
 Uuuhhu, uuuuUUuuuUUugghhuhuu!!"
That\'s right, after this, never again will we be smothered by sad nights.
Congratulations, me.
Congratulations, Ushiromiya Eva.
......Right here, right now, the sad half of our life has had its heart\'s desires granted.
"It\'s all thanks to you...
 I was blessed with this chance because of your magic.
 Because of that chance, I was able to make it here...!"
...Thank you.
 But my magic couldn\'t have been granted if we both didn\'t believe in each other.
So it isn\'t just the power of my magic.
This is our victory.
So, congratulations,
 "us".
"Thank you, me...
 Thank you, Ushiromiya Eva...
 ......I\'m so glad I didn\'t give in before now.
 I\'m so glad I didn\'t drown in sorrow and forget to keep struggling..."
".........No, this is my magic.
 Our magic!
 Your magic was the real thing.
 {f:5:Beatrice} the witch of the forest is nothing more than an illusion.
 {i:You} are the real witch, who can use real magic.
 ......That\'s right.
 Right now, {i:you} are the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}!!"
Eva decided to leave that place for the time being.
{n}And when she climbed the stairs again, trying to leave this secret place...
......She saw a creepy, swaying human shadow blocking her path, and her dreamlike state was blown away.
".....................Who\'s there?!"
For an instant, ...she believed that the true master of this room, the real {f:5:Beatrice}, had appeared.
It seemed that the other person was also holding a gun.
{n}The two of them were pointing guns at each other.
And eventually, they each realized who the other was...
".........Rosa.........?"
"...Nee‐san...
 .........What are you doing in a place like this...?"
"I could ask you the same.
 What business do {i:you} have in a place such as this?"
"......I shouldn\'t have given you that hint, Nee‐san.
 If I hadn\'t, I definitely would have been the first to reach this place.
 .........Too bad."
It seemed that Rosa knew where this staircase went,
 and what was waiting ahead of her.
"That\'s rich.
 .........Coming from someone who arrived here after me."
".........I racked my brains too much over the sweetfish river.
 The sweetfish part didn\'t really matter that much at all, did it?"
"That isn\'t true.
 It was an excellent hint, if you ask me.
 Well, of course, maybe there was no need for it to be sweetfish.
 ...But when I heard that sweetfish are fish that go out into the sea, I was able to figure it out."
"......What is inside?"
"Why not see with your own eyes?
 It definitely won\'t betray your expectations."
"........................
 ......Don\'t be afraid, Nee‐san.
 I never had any interest in who became the head.
 I don\'t even care about the Ushiromiya family name.
 ......Honestly, Krauss nii‐san always did throw his weight around, saying that he was going to be the head,
 so I actually feel good about you stealing the position from him."
"............Are you serious?"
"Of course.
 I am the outsider of the Ushiromiya siblings.
 ......Even if Father had named me as the next head,
 there\'s no way my brothers would accept that.
 I try not to have such naive dreams."
"........................"
"Let me see too.
 The proof of your victory, Nee‐san.
 ......As long as I receive the proper portion that we agreed upon as siblings,
 I plan to actively accept you as the true victor in this "game"."
"............If you shot me, then you would have this gold all to yourself, right?"
"It\'s the same for you.
 If you shot me, this gold would all be yours."
"......................................."
For a tense while, the sisters pointed their guns at each other.
{n}Eventually, after they sized up the glint in the other\'s eyes, they lowered their guns.
...Eva removed her finger from the trigger, and held the gun upside‐down.
It was a position that she couldn\'t quickly shoot from.
{n}When she saw that, Rosa held hers the same way.
"......That\'s right.
 That plan of shooting the other and having all the gold to ourselves is fascinating for both of us."
"...But if one of us suddenly disappeared on this island while it\'s isolated by the typhoon, there would be a huge uproar.
 ......If we hid the corpse here, it probably wouldn\'t be found easily, but that isn\'t for certain."
".........No matter how many billion yen\'s worth of gold is on the line,
 it isn\'t worth the risk of committing murder.
 In the end, that would become a weakness for Krauss nii‐san and the others to squeeze all the money out of us with."
"I agree.
 ......Considering that Nii‐san or Rudolf could have been the one to show up here,
 ......it may have been a blessing in disguise that it was you.
 ...I trust you the most of all the siblings."
"............Thank you.
 I also trust you the most of the siblings, Nee‐san."
"...................................."
"............I want to see the gold too."
"Do you?
 Now I also want to see it again.
 Even though I saw it with my own eyes, it still doesn\'t feel real.
 ...Unless I see it together with you and check once more that it actually exists,
 it feels like the gold will turn to fog and disappear."
Eva started descending the staircase once more.
{n}......However, she didn\'t carelessly expose her back to Rosa.
Likewise, even though at a glance it looked like Rosa had lowered her guard, she definitely didn\'t show any signs of carelessness.
......And they reached that room of the witch once again.
{n}Rosa also gasped, made speechless by the vast amount of gold...
......Rosa and Eva walked absentmindedly through the rose garden.
They had left the guesthouse secretly, so they had to be careful when they returned as well.
They had to regain their sense of tension soon.
"......Congratulations, Nee‐san."
"Thank you."
"You decided it, didn\'t you?
 Fifty percent goes to the bearer of the title of successor to the head.
 ......It sure did work out well for you.
 That doesn\'t refer to Krauss nii‐san anymore.
 ...So your share is now fifty percent along with a quarter of the rest, for a total of 12.5 billion yen."
"Isn\'t that an incredible share?
 ...I\'m satisfied with 2.5 billion.
 Rudolf nii‐san won\'t complain either.
 Krauss nii‐san will probably be the only one to complain."
"......Yeah, you\'re right.
 ...After all, Nii‐san is the practical manager of Rokkenjima.
 And since the gold was on these premises,
 even though I was the first to discover it, things might get complicated if I don\'t handle it skillfully."
"It won\'t get complicated.
 We covered this and every other eventuality in excruciating detail in last night\'s discussion, didn\'t we?"
"............I wonder if it will really go that smoothly.
 I\'ve already completely gotten over my excitement.
 How we regulate everything from here on is the real problem."
"...That is a problem for the new head of the Ushiromiya family.
 You should enjoy that problem, Nee‐san.
 It has nothing to do with me."
"Hmm, sharp words..."
"......I\'ll support you as the second person to find it.
 So please at least give me the early payment we decided on.
 I\'d like 150 million yen by March."
"Yes, that\'s fine.
 ......If you support me, I can graciously pay you that much.
 I am not Nii‐san."
"Anyway, why don\'t we go and shock Nii‐san and the others?
 Even if we cover up the actual location, I want to see Krauss nii‐san\'s shocked face as soon as I can."
"...............
 ............Wait a second, Rosa.
 Wait a while before telling everyone about it."
"..................Huh?
 ...Why?"
"...You idiot, isn\'t it obvious?
 ...This is that haughty Krauss nii‐san and that sly Rudolf we\'re talking about.
 Even if we announce it eventually, it\'s still too early now."
"Unless we carefully investigate how we should move things along first,
 it\'s possible that all of the gold we\'ve finally found will be snatched away by Nii‐san."
Eva had thought she had just said something completely obvious.
...So when she saw Rosa\'s expression suddenly cloud over, she was a little surprised.
"......What are you unsatisfied about?
 You know well what kind of people those two are."
"...............
 Nee‐san, that\'s against the rules."
"What do you mean?"
"......Didn\'t we make a rule that whoever found the gold would announce it immediately?
 If you hesitate, the foundation of the rules will be destroyed,
 and that could lead to something worse in the future.
 ...With Krauss nii‐san as crafty as he is,
 that violation of the rules will complicate things later."
"Don\'t be stupid.
 This is Nii‐san\'s island.
 And that gold just now wasn\'t cash.
 We\'re talking about the liquidation of a vast ten‐ton mountain, you know?"
"It will take a significant amount of time to carry it off and turn it into cash.
 And that will only work in Nii‐san\'s favor, since he has practical control over this island.
 Don\'t you even realize that?!"
".....................I don\'t like searching each other for weaknesses like that.
 I just want to clearly lock in my 2.5 billion portion."
"Of course, if you were to give me 2.5 billion in cash right now,
 whatever you did next would be up to you.
 But until I have my share in my own pocket, I will follow the siblings\' rules."
"You\'re so naive...
 You don\'t understand Nii‐san\'s craftiness at all!"
......It wasn\'t that Rosa didn\'t understand the craftiness of her older siblings.
In that sense, Rosa more or less understood Eva\'s caution.
But in her heart,
 she couldn\'t clear away her even greater suspicion that Eva wanted to keep all of the gold to herself.
......Because she knew that Eva was at least as crafty as her other siblings, if not more.
In other words, by quickly informing the siblings of the gold\'s discovery,
 Rosa wanted to put a stop to any chance Eva had to keep the gold all to herself...
"..................
 ......Rosa.
 Sorry, but at least listen to me this once."
".........Are you saying that if I don\'t listen to what you say, you won\'t be able to prepare the 150 million?"
"........................
 ...That isn\'t the way I wanted to say it.
 ...But if you really need that money, it\'s more realistic to support me.
 ......If you talk to Nii‐san and Rudolf, even that natural portion of yours might disappear.
 You don\'t want that, do you?"
"........................"
For a while, a severe expression that she had never shown to her sister before rose to Rosa\'s face.
There wasn\'t even a trace of her restraint as a younger sister.
 ......There was just the ruthlessness,
 no, the seriousness of a single human arguing about a vast sum of wealth.
Eva made light of it, chuckling.
"......Dear me.
 A frightful murder has just taken place, and the culprit still may be on this island...
how careless we must be to stand around here talking like this."
"I\'m sure it\'s just the servants\' farce.
 No murder ever occurred on this island."
"......Oh?
 So you really do think that?"
"It can be clearly explained by the manner of the six deaths.
 The locked room involving those six definitely couldn\'t be created by a crime from the outside."
"......Doctor Nanjo said that they were all dead, but that was also a lie.
 This is all a complicated act that Father plotted.
 All of the servants are just pretending to be dead.
 ...A murder never occurred in the first place.
 There\'s no way that there\'s a murderer prowling around."
"...Huh...
 I\'m surprised that you would notice that.
 You looked fairly frightened, so I hadn\'t thought that you realized that much."
"......I\'m a person who can read between the lines in that kind of situation.
 Thanks to you, I\'ve been well trained."
That\'s right.
 Before we realized it, the servants had "died", and the members of the Ushiromiya family had become the only ones on this island.
And after Nanjo had proclaimed the "deaths" of the servants,
 and the relatives had begun to discuss the riddle of the epitaph, he had disappeared off upstairs as though he was in the way...
"Everything...
was an act to get us to challenge that epitaph.
 ......And that\'s exactly why...
you need to proclaim that you are the victor, Nee‐san."
"There\'s no way that burnt corpse is really Father.
 ......He prepared a corpse with the right number of toes from somewhere, and deliberately burned it in that horribly morbid way."
"......I\'m sure he\'s hiding somewhere, watching to see how we\'ll behave.
 ...I\'m sure he already knows that you have reached the Golden Land, Nee‐san."
"......And that\'s why you should proclaim soon that you are the winner.
 I\'m sure Father will appear out of nowhere and proclaim that you are his successor while clapping his hands."
"........................"
"...Well, still.
 ......I have to pester you for 150 million,
 so I can\'t work against you in anything."
".........So you\'ll listen to what I say, and be quiet about this to Nii‐san and the rest...?"
"...................................."
"......Make your position clear.
 ...Rosa."
"...............I want to tell them.
 We just made that rule last night.
 We shouldn\'t just throw that away."
"Of course, I will announce it in front of the siblings.
 ...However, I want to make very sure of the situation first.
 Carrying out ten tons of gold, converting it into money,
 and distributing it fairly."
"......Until I can affirm my ability to carry those out without Nii‐san getting in the way, I want some time to think.
 I only want to hold off my announcement until then.
 .........I\'m definitely not keeping it secret because I want it all for myself."
"..................
 ...You\'ll definitely announce it to everyone sooner or later, right?"
"...Yes, of course.
 Even I want to rub it in Nii‐san\'s face as soon as I can."
".........About how much time will you need to "think"?"
"I won\'t know that until I\'ve thought about it."
"............Would one night be enough?"
"I can\'t promise you that it will take only one night...!"
"Out of respect for you as the successor to the head, I will support you for one night.
 ......This year\'s family conference will end tomorrow morning, when the typhoon passes and a boat comes to get us.
 ...That\'s right, when the seagulls cry.
 ......I will remain silent until then."
"If you think that you need more time to think after that, ...let\'s talk about it again at that time, alright?
 .........I will support your position...
{i:as much as possible}."
"......You......really are cunning, aren\'t you?
 ...I\'m surprised.
 Were you always this strong‐willed?"
"......It\'s true that women become stronger when they have a child.
 I realized that in myself when I had Maria."
"...............
 Alright.
 I thank you for your cooperation for the time being.
 ...We can talk about tomorrow when it comes."
"Yes, that\'s right.
 ......I believe that you will be a fair‐minded successor to the head, who wouldn\'t even think of taking all of the gold for herself."
"...Isn\'t that obvious!
 ......I will split the gold evenly among the siblings as we agreed."
No way. {i:I} found this.
Because I, because we solved the riddle of the epitaph!
So this gold is all mine...!!
"I won\'t give it up to anyone!
 I am the head of the Ushiromiya family!
 I am, {i:I} am!!"
In a loud voice, the witch inside Eva claimed exclusive possession of everything.
{n}...Of course, that didn\'t come close to reaching Rosa\'s ears, and it probably didn\'t even reach Eva\'s, either.
"......Mm.
 I shall acknowledge that.
 You are the true head of the Ushiromiya family, chosen by the witch\'s epitaph.
 Now, I shall acknowledge that upon my name."
"...Y‐
 .........you are.........
 That outfit...
you couldn\'t be...
......really...
{f:5:Beatrice}......?"
Maybe {f:5:Beatrice} was happy that Eva had called her by her own name.
 She cackled pleasantly.
In concert with that laugh, gold butterflies rose up as though a storm of gold dust had broken out in the room,
 and the room shone the color of gold...
"Indeed.
 I am the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}."
"......*cackle*cackle*, there is nothing that should frighten you so.
 I am praising your exploits.
 ...Truly excellent.
 Imagine that you would spectacularly solve that riddle of the epitaph...
 It is worthy of my admiration...!"
"...You were the one who sent that letter?
 So I\'ll succeed all of the gold and the Ushiromiya family inheritance, right...?
 You wrote that in your letter.
 And I overcame that challenge...!"
"Mm.
 I shall acknowledge it.
 Now, all of this piled‐up gold, and everything of the Ushiromiya family, is for you to do with as you please.
 For as of this moment, you are already the Ushiromiya family head."
"R‐......really?
 It\'s true, right?
 Right?!"
"Do not become agitated.
 I am openly praising you.
 As proof, I shall grant you this."
{f:5:Beatrice} took a ring off of her own finger,
 and held it out to Eva.
She fearfully accepted it,
 ......and realized that it was a ring.
"......C‐
......could.........
this be............"
"Mmhm.
 It is the proof of the Ushiromiya family headship, returned to me from Kinzo: the Golden Ring."
"From now on, it is yours.
 You may put it on your finger and display it high before your siblings.
 None should doubt that you have now succeeded the Ushiromiya family inheritance."
Eva stared closely at the ring.
...It certainly wasn\'t a fake.
 ...Without a doubt, it was the real thing.
She, who had dreamed of receiving this ring someday,
 and who had stared fixedly at it countless times, could say that for certain.
This ring...
had now designated her as its new owner,
 ......and had been handed over to her......
And...
timidly...
she put it on the middle finger of her left hand...
In that instant, ......she felt a deep emotion welling up inside her that she had never felt before.
Her mind grew blank.
 Both eyes opened wide.
{n}That ring...was on her own finger.
{n}Not in a dream, in reality............!
"That ring is surely also pleased.
 Because it was able to come to you, who had dreamed of putting it on your finger for so long."
"......The ring...
 ......Father\'s
......ring...............!"
"How many nights have you dreamed of putting that on your own finger as you have now done?
 ......The strength of those feelings became your magic and made that reality.
 Now, you are worthy of calling yourself a true witch."
"............Wh‐...who are you?
 ...Are you really......{f:5:Beatrice}......"
"*cackle*cackle*.
 I am the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}!
 The Ushiromiya family alchemist!"
"Following my contract with Kinzo, I now pass everything on to you.
 ...All of the gold I entrusted Kinzo with.
 And all of the wealth he built up through that.
 And the honor and inheritance of the Ushiromiya family.
 And I will pass on my power, and the title of the Endless Witch."
"......A witch\'s...
...title......"
"I will pass on all of my magical power, and the titles of the Golden Witch and the Endless Witch.
 ......Following my Predecessor, I will hand over my name, {f:5:Beatrice}, along with those titles.
 ......You may now call yourself by that name!"
Eva gulped.
 The chandelier light, which had seemed dim, now felt too bright.
"By my name, I shall now carry out the succession of the Golden Witch...!"
The instant that {f:5:Beatrice} made that proclamation, a golden brilliance buried everything,
 ......and changed it into a majestic space that looked like a throne room.
In the throne room, there was a crowd of {f:5:Beatrice}\'s minions and brethren, as well as countless gold butterflies,
 celebrating this first succession ceremony in a thousand years.
And there was {f:5:Beatrice}, in the throne that only the Endless Witch was permitted to sit in, holding a golden staff,
 reigning with a dazzling dignity.
Without being ordered by anyone, Eva automatically kneeled, hanging her head...
A goat attendant respectfully offered {f:5:Beatrice} a golden staff modeled after the One‐winged Eagle.
After {f:5:Beatrice} stood up and received that staff,
 she lay the tip of it on Eva\'s shoulder and spoke.
 It was a proclamation one thousand years in coming.
"Ushiromiya Eva.
 You have spectacularly solved the riddle of the witch\'s epitaph, and reached this Golden Land.
 ......I praise that accomplishment,
 and hand over all of the Endless Magic as well as the titles of the Golden and Endless Witch."
"From this point on,
 you may take my name, {f:5:Beatrice}...!
 Come, raise your face.
 Then stand and accept this staff...!"
"I, ......I am most grateful..."
Eva stood up dizzily and took the magic staff from {f:5:Beatrice}\'s hand.
 Her hand was trembling slightly.
As soon as she grasped that staff...
{n}......she was wrapped up in the brilliant sparkle of gold.
{n}As though gold butterflies were flowing out from inside of her.
In the instant she succeeded the Golden Witch, Eva felt something in the depths of her soul be reborn.
To describe it in a word, it was energy.
{n}Energy with a gold color.
It felt as though she had been half asleep ever since she was born,
 ......and had now awoken for the first time in her life.
For the first time in her life, she felt her true eyes inside her eyes open.
".........Mm.
 A fitting and beautiful outfit for the Golden Witch."
"Come, show yourself to all of these people.
 Show them that you are now the new witch...!"
Eva, ......no, the new {f:5:Beatrice} turned around timidly.
When she did, the witch\'s minions, which filled the vast throne room,
 honored her with a wild applause that sounded like the roaring of the sea......
"Come, everyone.
 Replace all of the portraits of {f:5:Beatrice} with the new {f:5:Beatrice}!
 Offer up words of celebration for the new {f:5:Beatrice}...!!"
"New {f:5:Beatrice}.
 Congratulations on the succession of the Golden Witch.
 ...I hope that you will become able to stand on your own as a noble Golden Witch, and as the Endless Witch."
"Y‐.........yes, ...I will do my best..."
"I expect a composure fitting for the Endless Witch from you, unlike your naughty predecessor.
 Hoh‐hohohohoho."
"Masteer, we\'re in the middle of a serious ceremony, so please, enough of thaaat..."
"Congratulations on the succession of the Golden Witch.
 New {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama."
"......I am called Ronove.
 I am one of the 72 demons permitted to serve the Golden Witch.
 From now on, I will always be at your service.
 If you are ever inconvenienced in the slightest, please let me know at once."
"......Th‐......thank you......"
"Ronove is rude but reliable.
 If you speak to this man of anything that confuses you in your new days as a witch, he should be able to help you."
".........And, predecessor {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama,
 it is a shame that I was not permitted to serve you further, even though we have finally been reunited like this."
"......These last thousand years have been very entertaining for me.
 I deeply thank you."
"Mm.
 ......One thousand years with you wasn\'t boring.
 ...Please, take care of the new witch."
"Yes.
 If that is the final order of the predecessor {f:5:Beatrice},
 ...I, Ronove,
 shall certainly carry on your wish."
"Thank me, \'kay?
 I signed as your reference for the succession of the witch, you know?
 So basically, if I hadn\'t signed, you wouldn\'t have been able to become the witch.
 So thank me a little, alright?!"
"This is the Witch of Certainty, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}.
 The recommendation of a witch from the Senate was required for your succession as an Endless Witch.
 Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} recommended you, and became your guardian."
"Th‐......thanks......"
"......Heyyy, Beatoo!
 This kid isn\'t grateful enough!
 I wanna stop recommending her!"
"Being a reference is not a thing to take lightly.
 If you\'ve signed, then you must take responsibility."
"Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} is also the Witch of Certainty.
 ......The Witch of Certainty prefers to make fate firm, to create a fate of Certainty.
 She took a great liking to your efforts up to today, and held them in the highest regard."
"Well, an unfortunate childhood, unrewarded effort...I can sympathize juuust a bit with those, that\'s all.
 It\'s not like I felt sorry for you or anything, don\'t get so full of yourself!
 Tsuun!"
"......From my point of view, your succession, well, it\'s more of a coincidence than a miracle.
 You wouldn\'t have been worthy of my recommendation."
"*cackle*.
 This is Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}.
 She is a very hard‐to‐please person.
 Still, you could say that just having her participate and celebrate is very fortunate."
".........I only came because this is a rare event, unseen in a thousand years.
 And I heard that there would be some delicious alcohol."
"New {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.
 Please, allow us to greet you as well."
"Huh, ...ah, ...I\'m pleased to meet you..."
The Seven Sisters of Purgatory formed a line side by side.
{n}The eldest sister, Lucifer, took a step forward and kneeled.
"These are furniture who serve me.
 As a gift in celebration of your inheritance, I will send them to you."
"......After you succeed the Golden Witch, you will need to perform the ritual for your own resurrection.
 The Seven Sisters of Purgatory perform an essential role in that ritual.
 ......They\'re a bunch of miscreants, but they serve their purpose.
 Have them do whatever you wish."
"We will always be by your side, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.
 Please order us to do anything you wish.
 We will certainly show that we can accomplish our task...!"
Even after that, various nobles and minions visited and offered words of congratulation for the new witch.
As she responded to them confusedly,
 she felt as though she was getting light‐headed due to lack of oxygen.
......She couldn\'t tell if this was something real or unreal.
But there was just one thing she could understand.
 The feeling of achievement at being permitted to call herself the Golden Witch.
...That alone was a truth she could definitely understand...
"............What......is all this?
 Of course, I\'m not going to swallow this story, ...but what on Earth does it mean?!"
"Auntie Eva is the new {f:5:Beatrice}?
 Are you saying she\'s become a witch?
 ......What the hell...!!"
"I am also surprised.
 Imagine that someone would be able to solve that riddle.
 ......However, that is the rule.
 I must follow it, and pass on the position of Golden Witch and my name."
"It is hardly something to be surprised about.
 Milady wrote that rule in a letter and announced it at the beginning.
 ......Eva‐sama was the first to be successful.
 That is all there is to say."
"......{f:5:Virgilia}, are you there?!"
"Yes, here I am..."
"What does this farce mean?!
 Even if this depiction of strange witches showing up one after another is some of her bullshit...!
 ......Isn\'t this like Auntie Eva has become a witch?!"
"Calm yourself.
 She has simply received the title of "Golden Witch", and might call herself that in the future.
 ......This succession ceremony is, without doubt, nothing more than that performed according to that child\'s "interpretation".
 Don\'t fall for the same move again."
"Th‐...that\'s right...
 That whole grand ceremony was all phony.
 But it\'s at least a fact that Auntie Eva solved the riddle of the epitaph.
 ......And at the same time, that means that she inherited the Ushiromiya family headship."
"......And by obtaining ten tons of gold,
 ......it means that Auntie Eva might as well call herself the "Golden Witch"...is that it...?
 Damn, making things as complicated as ever...!!"
"...Dear me.
 Is a boorish {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} unable to comprehend the grandeur of this ceremony?
 ......Oh, well.
 Being unable to read between the lines is what makes you {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.
 I pity you, but I do not blame you."
"Damn it...
 Don\'t look at me like you feel sorry for me...
 .........Still, for the time being, there\'s something I need to check."
"And that\'s regarding this younger version of Auntie Eva,
 ...in other words, the definition of this new {f:5:Beatrice}.
 ......What the heck {i:is} she?!"
"Even if I tell of it, you will just persist in your disbelief in magic and witches, will you not?
 So there is nothing in particular for me to explain.
 You may believe that things are as you think they are."
"......The way I think things are...?!
 Then, then how should I interpret this...?!"
"For now, grasping it as a visualization of a different being inside Ushiromiya Eva may not be a hindrance, I believe."
"...Of course, you cannot blindly accept it, but it is probably appropriate for you to think that way now."
"............In, in other words, I should think of Auntie Eva and her as the same person?
 ......Damn, ...this is starting to feel bad..."
"With that being the case, from now on, my name is not {f:5:Beatrice}.
 Because I have passed it on to Ushiromiya Eva."
"......Which means that I am nameless!
 Battleerr, isn\'t there some name that is fitting for me?
 I shall take your recommendation!
 Isn\'t there a name that\'s refined, full of elegance, and make it a little cute if you can...!"
"...Just "Beato" is good enough for you.
 There\'s probably enough of a difference between Beato and {f:5:Beatrice}."
"Mh...muu.
 Stay as Beato, is it...
 It doesn\'t feel odd, but it\'s boring for some reason.
 Muu."
"Pu ku ku ku ku...
 They say the temperature of black tea and a woman\'s heart are difficult in any time period."
".........Battler‐kun.
 In any case, handle what is to come with composure.
 Compared to when this child was {f:5:Beatrice},
 now that we can tell her apart from Ushiromiya Eva, the situation is advantageous to us."
"......And it\'s exactly because of that,
 ...that I like it even less.
 ......What is she thinking of?
 That Beato........."
Over there, Auntie Eva,
 who had the figure of her younger days and who now possessed the name {f:5:Beatrice}, had a long line forming of witches wishing to bless her.
It was like a witch\'s coronation.
Countless gold butterflies flapped their wings, directing this fantastical, gold‐sparkling space.
 They were all praising her.
As I stared from the distance,
 I looked at the {f:5:Beatrice} given new life, who had a slightly embarrassed smile on her face.
......Her expression, which had been hesitant at first,
 seemed to be full of a happiness that she had finally become aware of.
In that expression, there wasn\'t a trace of the madness that had led her to that insane laugh before the gold.
 There was only the innocence of relishing her joy.
Since I deny witches, I couldn\'t accept her as she showed that joyful expression at her witch succession ceremony...
......However, as I watched that innocent smile,
 ...it made me feel like I wanted to celebrate her, just for now.
The moment when a strong effort is successful and rewarded is always beautiful.
Auntie Eva, who had always yearned to succeed the head, and had worked hard since she was young without being rewarded,
 ......had spectacularly taken hold of the chance given to her by the riddle of the epitaph, ...and had finally gained that position.
How divine is the smile of a person whose childhood dreams have been granted?
I definitely won\'t accept witches.
{n}But, ......Battler put his hands together, making a small sound.
Clap. Clap.
......It didn\'t reach her ears, ...but it did celebrate her.
".........Congratulations, Auntie Eva."
You solved the riddle of the epitaph masterfully, and before anyone else.
{n}It\'s your victory without any complaints.
............I won\'t accept all that about the Golden Witch and so on, but I will accept you as the new head of the Ushiromiya family, and I will celebrate you honestly.
"...............Hmph."
As though lured by Battler\'s applause, Beato also clapped.
...It was a slightly odd scene.
 Because Battler and Beato, who opposed each other, were standing next to one another, applauding for the same person.
"I\'m not clapping for a witch.
 ...I\'m clapping for all of Auntie Eva\'s efforts up until now."
"I am too.
 I am offering Eva my sincere congratulations in applause for the tremendous accomplishment of solving that epitaph."
".........Hmm.
 ...I don\'t like the fact that I\'m clapping with you.
 ...But, well, I won\'t worry about it for now.
 ...I guess it doesn\'t hurt to clap with you every once in a while."
"Mmhm.
 It isn\'t bad once in a while.
 ......Still, it is fun to applaud.
 Even though it was Eva who achieved it and not me, for some reason, I\'m starting to feel happy too."
"That\'s because celebrating someone means the same thing as empathizing with their joy, and sharing in it."
"I see.
 Then, I must even be sharing this irrational happy feeling with you.
 ......Since we are a pair of enemies trying to make each other submit, it is an odd experience."
"Well, ......just for now, let\'s have a truce and clap, alright?"
Beato laughed impishly, playing around and applauding even louder,
 as though eagerly trying not to lose to Battler as she clapped.
Battler went along with her, and clapped even louder.
And when he did, as though he had ended some kind of ceremony, everyone present put their hands together in loud applause, and highly praised the newly born {f:5:Beatrice}.
It was just as though Battler\'s and Beato\'s applause had been the final thing needed for her succession......Rosa returned to the lobby.
It was still her time to rest,
 but her expression made it look as though she couldn\'t sleep deeply with all this tension.
"......You have to force yourself to lie down.
 It\'ll get tough for you later on at this rate."
"Thanks for caring.
 I just can\'t sleep.
 ......I went and took a shower at least, so that will be enough.
 The next person can rest."
"What about you two, Kyrie‐san? Rudolf‐san?"
"......What will we do, Rudolf‐san?
 Will we rest?"
"You can rest if you want.
 I\'ll stay awake.
 That\'s the only manly thing I can do right now."
"Then I\'ll stay awake.
 Staying awake with my husband is the only womanly thing I can do right now."
"......*giggle*.
 You two truly are close."
"As are you two.
 *giggle*."
"It seems that Eva and Hideyoshi‐san are out cold.
 It appears as though, unlike Rosa, they can\'t fight against their age."
As though in response to those words, the door to the hall clunked open.
Eva and Hideyoshi returned from the guest room.
"That\'s none of your business.
 ...Oh, Rosa, are you still alright without sleeping?"
"What about you, Nee‐san.
 Why not take it easy and rest?"
"............I just can\'t get to sleep.
 After taking a shower, my drowsiness faded away.
 Rudolf, Kyrie‐san, you can rest if you want."
"Yeah, thanks.
 For now the sentiment alone is enough.
 Why don\'t you go first, Aniki?"
"How kind of you.
 But I cannot rest first.
 That is the most I can do as the oldest brother."
"Do not worry, the two of us will be awake until the very end."
"......*giggle*.
 .........More importantly, Eva nee‐san,
 are you alright?
 You look a little pale."
"......Come to think of it, you\'re right.
 ......Hmmm?
 You\'re feelin\' a bit hot, you know?"
Hideyoshi put his hand up against Eva\'s forehead.
{n}...It seemed that Eva wasn\'t feeling her best.
"Told you so.
 ...That\'s what happens when you break your daily cycle at your age.
 ......Is it a cold?"
"...Natsuhi.
 Could you call Doctor Nanjo down?"
"Y‐yes."
"...I\'m fine, you don\'t have to make such a big deal out of it.
 I have some medicine, so I\'ll be fine.
 ......I tend to get a fever when I\'m tired.
 Don\'t worry."
"......Nee‐san, take it easy, okay?"
".........Thank you.
 ...When my siblings gather without me around, I get the feeling everyone is talking behind my back.
 ...It\'s a persecution complex from long ago.
 Sorry, okay?"
"...............I won\'t say anything.
 I would never say something bad about you when you\'re away."
"......................................."
"......What is it?
 Nee‐san, you\'ve been acting strange for a while, you know?
 Shouldn\'t you get a little rest now?"
"............You\'re right.
 I started thinking about {i:raising money by March} and it made my headache even worse."
"That isn\'t good.
 Rest.
 ...I\'ll restrain myself so that your headache doesn\'t get worse.
 I\'ve had a bad headache myself for a while now."
".........Thank you.
 ......Well then, I\'ll count on what you\'ve said and rest for a while."
"What\'s up, Eva?
 Why so bent out of shape all of a sudden?
 ......Sorry \'bout this... Please let us rest a bit longer.
 Sorry... Sorry..."
After putting his hands together as though praying and apologizing several times,
 Hideyoshi went after Eva, and left the lobby.
"............I don\'t like this atmosphere.
 Everything\'s so strained."
"That\'s no surprise.
 ......There was a murder early this morning.
 And since then, we\'ve been eating canned food and holding guns.
 ...It\'s natural that we would start to build up stress."
"I wonder if the kids up there have also built up stress.
 ......I\'m worried about Maria.
 She tends to get irritable in times like this."
Just then, they heard the sound of wild footsteps from upstairs.
 The guesthouse wasn\'t a cheap building, so if they had been any normal footsteps, there was no way they would have heard them.
It was like the sound of someone stamping their feet in frustration.
And not a moment later, in addition to the apparent sound of feet running out into the upstairs corridor,
 they could hear Maria calling "uu‐uu‐uu" over and over again, sounding displeased.
Rosa grabbed her head, ruffled up her hair, and voicelessly moaned in anguish...
The adults conscientiously turned their backs to her, pretending not to notice.
The noisy clamor came downstairs and flew into the lobby.
It was Maria, who was sobbing; the other children, who had come down with her; and Nanjo.
...In other words, everyone on the second floor had come downstairs because of Maria\'s tantrum.
Rosa couldn\'t hide her dizziness at the scale of the annoyance her daughter was bringing to everyone...
"S‐sorry, Auntie Rosa...
 We tried to calm her, but she just wouldn\'t listen..."
"Uu‐uu‐uu!!
 Uu‐uu‐uu!!
 Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!"
"...What is it, Maria?
 Could you be a little more quiet?
 Everyone\'s looking."
"It\'s that rose of hers from the rose garden...
 She suddenly started saying that she was worried about it."
"......I think she\'s half asleep.
 She suddenly woke up, and started going on about how worried she was for that rose.
 .........Maria‐chan, calm down.
 That was just a dream..."
"Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!
 That was {f:5:Beatrice}\'s and my rooose!!
 So if I don\'t take care of it, {f:5:Beatrice} will get mad at meee!!
 It might be broken again!
 Uu‐uu‐uu!
 Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!"
"......Haah...!
 ...Listen, I\'m {i:telling} you to quiet down a bit, {i:alright}?!?!"
The children were taken aback by the sudden rise in the tone of Rosa\'s voice.
But Maria\'s crying just grew louder, and her tantrum just grew fiercer.
"R‐...Rosa‐san.
 You mustn\'t scold a child so bluntly without attending to what they say...
 ...In times like this, it is good to give them some warm milk or something."
"......Is there any here?"
"The milk we served in place of breakfast earlier was the last..."
"Doesn\'t anyone have a sedative to use on kids...?
 You know, those silver pill things?"
"Of course I do!!
 Yes, I\'ll search for them now and make her take them!!"
Without hiding her displeasure, Rosa grabbed her handbag that she had placed on the sofa and fished around for the medicine.
 ......It seemed that she had brought some child‐use sedatives for Maria\'s tantrums.
She found it and tipped the bottle into her palm, but it seemed to be empty.
{n}Irritated, Rosa shook the bottle several times, but that didn\'t change the fact that nothing was in there.
...All the while, Maria\'s crying was growing more and more intense...
Meanwhile, Eva was lying in bed, covered by the bedding.
Hideyoshi returned from the washroom, folding a handkerchief soaked in water.
"......My, this is one nasty fever...
 ......I\'m sure it\'s the poisonous air at this family conference that got you...
 ......For now, you can forget all about the other relatives.
 ...Alright?"
As Hideyoshi spoke to her kindly, he set the soaked handkerchief gently on Eva\'s burning forehead.
Eva rested her own hand on top of his.
".........Your hand...
feels wonderfully cool."
"If my hand feels wonderful, your fever must be pretty bad.
 No worries, the medicine will start workin\' soon.
 Plus, my hand is a magic hand.
 If I just put my hand up against your forehead like this, see,
 any fever will melt right away."
"You\'re right.
 ......Your hand always makes my fevers fade..."
"Yep.
 No need for a doctor when you\'ve got my hand.
 Don\'t worry and close your eyes.
 ......The fever will fade right away thanks to my magic..."
"Yes, I know...
 ......I can feel your magic."
Hideyoshi was about to say "they call that the placebo effect", but he stopped.
......If Eva said that she could feel magic from his hand, then that was alright for now...
"............I wonder if magic really exists."
"Yeah.
 Sure does.
 Only those who believe can tell, though.
 ...There\'s actually a lot of magic like that out there in the world."
"...If magic is real, ......then I wonder if witches are real too."
"Oh?
 You mean that witch of the forest, {f:5:Beatrice}?
 She probably does exist for those who believe.
 Just like God.
 Won\'t show himself except in front of those who strongly believe."
"...............You know,
 ...long ago, I was able to use magic too."
"Oh?
 That so?
 Then you\'ve been a witch once too."
"......You know, whenever I had a dream that I wanted to come true no matter what,
 if I wished strongly and tried hard, it came true every time.
 ......With my magic, my grades were always the best, and I even became the student council president, and got into the university I wanted by my own ability.
 ......Everything I wished for was granted."
"That\'s right.
 Your magic was always a thing to be reckoned with...
 You\'re definitely a witch.
 ...And you work harder than anyone.
 ......I know aaall about it."
"...............You know,
 ever since I was a kid, the whole time, there\'s been another me inside myself, who always supported me.
 ...And that other self was a witch."
".........I didn\'t believe in {f:5:Beatrice}, the witch of the forest.
 I always believed that if a witch of Rokkenjima did exist, it was the witch inside my heart.
 .........I am so grateful to that witch inside myself.
 ...I\'m always so grateful......that she let me meet up with you..."
"............You\'re always too timid when you get sick.
 ...Don\'t say anythin\' for now.
 ......I\'ll stay like this the whole time, until your fever has gone down, okay?"
"......Yeah.
 ......No matter what,
 ......don\'t take your hand away.
 .........Somehow, I...
...feel like I\'m becoming something that isn\'t myself,
 ......and it\'s been scaring me for a while now.
 ...I get the feeling that the witch inside of me...
...was provoked by {f:5:Beatrice}, and is growing stronger and stronger.
 ...Somehow, it feels like she\'s going to swallow me up."
"It\'s alright.
 As long as I\'m with you, there\'s not a thiiing to be afraid of!
 Remember the time we went to that dangerous country and the whole bus was robbed?
 I repelled \'em!"
"...Honey, you just handed over your gold watch and begged them to go away.
 ......It was pretty lame, ...but it was cool..."
"............This hand...
 ...Please don\'t move it away, no matter what...
 ......Not even if I fall asleep.
 ......And even if something creepy sneaks inside,
 ...protect me..."
"Yep, leave it to me.
 ......So stop worryin\' now and get some sleep.
 The medicine and my magic will start workin\' real soon..."
Eva finally calmed her heart and closed her eyes.
......Just then, there was the sound of a door being opened violently from the direction of the lobby.
It seemed that Maria was having a tantrum, and screams of "uu‐uu" could be heard,
 along with Rosa\'s rebuking yells.
...That was probably very annoying to listen to.
{n}Or maybe it was taking a toll on her headache.
{n}Eva moaned as though in pain, and buried herself in the covers.
It was easy to guess what was happening.
 Maria had probably had a tantrum for some reason, gone down to the lobby,
 and when Rosa had scolded her for it, they had started arguing.
...And then, the looks of the rest of the family had been too much to bear, so Rosa had taken Maria out into the corridor.
......Hideyoshi had no desire to interfere with Rosa and Maria\'s problems.
 ...But just for now, since Eva\'s condition was so bad, he wanted them to take their ruckus somewhere else.
"...Wait just a second.
 I\'ll go ask them to keep it down."
".........C‐come back quickly..."
"Don\'t worry, I won\'t leave this room."
Hideyoshi removed the chain, opened the door, and stuck his face out into the corridor.
 He immediately met Rosa\'s gaze.
"...Everythin\' alright, Rosa‐san?"
"I\'m sorry, did all this noise wake you up...?"
"Uu‐uu!
 Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!!"
"...Maria‐chan, sorry.
 Auntie Eva isn\'t feelin\' well, and she\'s tryin\' to sleep.
 Could you quiet down a smidgen...?"
Maria\'s tone didn\'t change after being asked by Hideyoshi.
She kept whining and repeating "My rose, my rose".
Rosa slapped Maria\'s cheek, lifted her up while covering her mouth,
 and carried her off towards the entrance, trying to at least put some distance between her and Hideyoshi\'s room.
...They would still probably be clamorous for a while yet, but he had at least warned her.
{n}Hoping that Rosa would show her capabilities as a mother, Hideyoshi closed the door.
".........Is Maria‐chan crying again?"
"Looks like it.
 ...It\'s tough for Rosa‐san too.
 ......When you think about that, our George is almost too good to be true.
 We should be grateful."
"...............You\'re right.
 .........nn,
 ......hand."
"Oh, sorry, sorry.
 ......Here you go, it\'s the magic hand."
He put his hand on Eva\'s forehead again.
......Maybe there really was magical power in that hand.
A truly peaceful look rose to Eva\'s face, and bit by bit, she began to drift off into the land of sleep.
As he had promised, Hideyoshi kept his hand on her forehead......
By the entrance, with her hand still against Maria\'s mouth, Rosa was at a loss at what to do next.
She had been unable to withstand everyone\'s gaze in the lobby,
 and had yelled at the children to go upstairs, before dashing out of the lobby.
And when she went out into the corridor, Hideyoshi had told her that she was being too noisy.
Where should I go now?
 ......Where should I take this child who\'s having a tantrum?
She felt as though she was about to cry in frustration...
As Maria kept struggling in an attempt to scream, Rosa put her mouth up to Maria\'s ear,
 and tried to persuade Maria in as calm a voice as she could manage.
".........Maria, you really want to see the rose that much...?"
Maria nodded her head several times, moaning "uu‐uu".
"...Why do you want to see the rose that much?
 I\'ll listen to you, so will you tell me quietly?
 I\'ll hit you if you scream."
"............My rose...
 {f:5:Beatrice} revived it.
 ......It might have broken again...
 ...I\'m worried about that...
 Can\'t sleep until I make sure..."
It seemed that she was still making a fuss about that marked rose from yesterday.
Rosa felt her headache throbbing again,
 but she was at least a little relieved that Maria had now stopped her screaming.
"Anyway, everyone is having a hard time right now.
 So don\'t bother Mama and everyone else.
 ......You can worry about that rose all you want tomorrow, when it stops raining.
 So just listen to me for now...!"
"No.
 ...No no no no.
 My {f:5:Beatrice}\'s rose...
 ...Uuuu..., uu‐uu.
 WaaaaaaAAaaaahh!!"
Rosa reflexively covered Maria\'s mouth.
 She had spoken a little too harshly, and had gotten her agitated again...
Rosa realized that it was partly her own fault and clicked her tongue in self‐hatred.
But Maria thought that was directed at her, and her crying grew even fiercer...
"...I\'m begging you, be quiet...
 What can I do to make you stop crying?
 What should I do to make you listen to what your Mama says?"
"........."
Abruptly.
 Maria stopped crying unnaturally fast.
{n}......Then she turned around, and muttered.
"............
If I can see my rose, I\'ll be quiet until tomorrow."
"Really?"
"Yeah.
 ...If we go to the rose garden and see my rose, I\'ll behave."
".................."
"I mean it, Mama."
"...................................."
If it would keep Maria quiet for the time being,
 Rosa thought that even going out into this wind and rain would be a small price to pay.
She did think it might be a bit reckless.
{n}............But in the end, no murder or anything of the sort had actually occurred.
All of that clamor since this morning had been a farce set up by Kinzo.
If you carefully thought about that chain of locked rooms, it communicated more clearly than anything that it was all an act by the victims themselves...
"......Will you really listen if you get to see the rose?"
"Yeah.
 I mean it, Mama.
 ......Kihihi."
"................................."
"Ouch."
Rosa didn\'t overlook that creepy laugh, and lightly hit Maria with her fist.
{n}And she shrugged, as though giving up.
"......Fine.
 You have one look and be satisfied.
 Understand?"
"Yes, Mama.
 I promise.
 ......Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi."
Once again, Rosa tested the weight of her gun.
......It\'s alright.
 It\'s only a farce.
{n}There was never a murderer on this island in the first place...
"Damn it, wait, Auntie Rosa...!!
 Are Auntie Rosa and Maria......the sacrifices for the second twilight?!
 Damn it damn it damn it, someone, notice them, tell them to stop!!
 What are those guys in the living room and us kids doing?!!"
"Hmm.
 They are being considerate of Rosa\'s pitiful relationship with her daughter, and are forcibly changing the subject.
 The group you are in went upstairs, and are talking about something else while watching TV."
"Goddammit!!
 Someone, notice them!
 Who\'s the closest, is it Uncle Hideyoshi?!
 Please, notice that those two are leaving through the front door, aaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaahhh!!"
"It won\'t reach, it won\'t reach, *cackle*!
 Don\'t disturb their precious time together.
 Fuhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!"
Hideyoshi kept talking kindly, his hand on Eva\'s forehead.
He didn\'t notice that Rosa and Maria were going outside through the front door at all.
In that case, there was no way that the others in the lobby, which was even further away, would notice either.
 And the cousins\' room upstairs was even worse...!
"Why are you so panicked?
 On the first twilight, didn\'t you defeat me with that bold move, saying that the culprit died in an accident on the first twilight?"
"...Doesn\'t that mean that there is no longer a culprit on this island...?
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*, what is there to be so worried about...?"
"Shut up, I can see right through you!!
 Someone stop them, those two\'ll be killed!!
 Someone, stop theee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}eeem, aaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaaahhh!!"
......There was no way that Battler\'s voiceless scream would reach Rosa or Maria.
The two of them could be seen in the rose garden.
The rain was still awful, but fortunately, the wind had died down a little.
......No, maybe that wasn\'t fortunate.
 Because if the wind {i:had} been a little fiercer, Rosa would surely have hesitated to go outside...
"......Uu, uu, uu...
 ............Here it is...!"
Maria found her own rose with the gold lace and stared at it lovingly.
Rosa had accepted with the promise that Maria would only have one look at it,
 but she didn\'t want Maria to complain that it hadn\'t been enough later on,
 so she decided to go along with her until she was satisfied.
......She believed that there wasn\'t a culprit,
 but if by any chance she was mistaken, they were now in an extremely dangerous position.
Rosa realized that faintly herself.
If things got bad, she would throw away her umbrella and ready her gun.
{n}...Keeping the innocently rejoicing Maria in the corner of her eye, Rosa gazed warily in all directions.
....................................?
{n}......Were her eyes just tired?
Even though no one should have been there, she thought she saw something glitter in the dark rose garden with all its wind and rain.
...Gold‐colored......?
{n}It had to be her imagination.
Because, to Rosa, it seemed as though gold butterflies were dancing through the rose bushes...
"......Are you alright, Eva...?
 ...Just take it easy...and should I call Doctor Nanjo after all...?!"
"I...... ......I\'m alright...
 ......Don\'t take your hand away......
 ...I\'m begging you, ......don\'t take your hand away......"
Eva was breathing wildly.
 Beads of sweat were appearing on her forehead.
It certainly was true that she had stayed up all night last night, and that things had been rough since early this morning.
{n}It wasn\'t odd that her body wasn\'t keeping up.
......Even though he understood that,
 Hideyoshi suspected that Eva\'s sudden fever was the sign of some serious illness.
Several times, Hideyoshi suggested to call Doctor Nanjo, but Eva resisted firmly,
 ...pleading with him and saying that it was even more important that he didn\'t take his hand away...
"I understand...
 But you\'ve gotta have Doctor Nanjo look at you by lunchtime.
 If you can promise me that, I\'ll stay here the whole time, grippin\' your hand.
 Tightly, like this."
"......Thank you...
 ......I\'m fine...
 The magic of your hand......will definitely make this fever subside......"
Even as she said that, Eva\'s harsh breathing didn\'t improve in the slightest.
"......Haah,
 ......haah,
 ......haahh...
 ......Don\'t let go,
 ...don\'t let go......
haah,
 ......haahh,
 ............aaaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaaaahhhh!!"
"Wh‐............who\'s there...?!"
She saw an umbrella moving from beyond the rose bush.
Rosa threw away her umbrella and wildly lifted her gun...
When she did, the figure beyond the bush......showed itself.
".........Uu?
 ......Auntie Eva............
 .........?"
"...You scared me.
 So it was you, Nee‐san?
 ............Do you have some business?
 ...Do you want to continue our earlier discussion?"
"..............................
 ...Yes, that\'s right.
 Our discussion about Father\'s gold."
"......Please, restrain yourself in front of Maria.
 I\'ve been keeping my promise, okay?
 I won\'t get in the way of your scheming."
"...............Scheming?
 What\'s that?"
".........Whatever you\'re thinking, that\'s up to you.
 I have no desire to get in the way.
 So please, not in front of Maria.
 As long as I get my share, that will be enough."
"Your share?
 Heheheheh, ahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha."
Eva started laughing in a creepy voice...
{n}Rosa was startled, but Maria stared blankly.
.........Then Maria said just one thing.
".........Uu......?
 ............Wait,
 ............who are you...?"
"Hahahahahaha, ahhahhahahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!
 Your shaaare?!
 Who would give that to you...?!
 All of that is mine!
 It all belongs to me, the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}...!!!"
"UaaaAAAAAAAAaaaAaaaaaa—!!"
"Eva! Are you alright, Eva?!
 Eva!
 Eva!!"
"Hold on...!!
 Don\'t let go!!
 So that I don\'t get taken away by someone who isn\'t me...!!
 Keep holding on to my hand...
 Don\'t let gooo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}ooooo...!!!"
"When did you ever work hard?!
 You never worked hard for anything!
 You were always hiding in our shadows!
 You always ran about from shadow to shadow without fighting,
 and yet, you really think yourself qualified to ask me for the Ushiromiya family gold...?!"
"All of that is mine!
 It\'s all mine and mine alone, as the head of the Ushiromiya family and the new Golden Witch, successor to the name of {f:5:Beatrice}!!"
".........{f:5:Beatrice}.
 ...............It\'s {f:5:Beatrice}!!
 Mama, {f:5:Beatrice}!"
Frolicking around, Maria jumped at her mother in ecstasy.
{n}...Rosa treated Maria coldheartedly and raised her gun high.
"......Y‐......you\'re Nee‐san, right......?
 ......You are Nee‐san, right......?"
"Wrong.
 ...I am no longer the one who was your sister."
"Then who are you?!!
 Are you going to say that you\'re {f:5:Beatrice}?!
 That\'s impossible!
 You died 19 years ago!!!"
"Yes, you were definitely dead, after all, I clearly saw that your head was smashed.
 I can remember your insides flowing out like it was yesterday!
 How could you be alive and right here noooooooooow?!?!"
"The concept of death does not exist for a Golden Witch.
 The names of the Golden Witch and {f:5:Beatrice} will be handed down for all eternity."
"Maybe the {f:5:Beatrice} you knew met with death, but that name is mine now...!
 Therefore it is endless!
 The concept of death does not exist for {f:5:Beatrice}!!"
"......How pitiful, Nee‐san...!"
.........That gold has caused you to lose the distinction between fantasy and reality......
"I said I\'m not your sister anymore.
 ......Well then, as the new {f:5:Beatrice}, I have been tasked with my own resurrection ritual.
 .........Ronove!
 What should I do?!"
"That is up to you.
 {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, you already have the power to make whatever you think reality.
 You should grow used to it if you use it a little."
"......You worthless former sister.
 You should consider it an honor to have been selected as my first sacrifice as a witch.
 On the second twilight, I\'ll tear apart the two who are close, with my own hands...!!"
The first thing the new {f:5:Beatrice} wished,
 ......no, the first magic she tried to use, was to surpass the limitations given to humans.
...In particular, gravity.
She wanted to become fully aware of her transformation into a witch by being released from those shackles.
As the witch and Rosa stayed as they were...
......The ground retreated all by itself, into the distance below them.
{n}By now, their feet were no longer attached to the ground.
Rosa finally realized that the ground hadn\'t retreated into the distance below her,
 but that she and the witch had been sucked up into the rainy sky.
"............huh...?
 ...............Eeeek...?!"
"Wh‐.........whoooooooooaaaa...... Awesome......!"
To humans, shackled by gravity, there is nothing more unnerving than not having their feet on solid earth.
......However, to {f:5:Beatrice}, who had learned the joy of being released from gravity as a new witch,
 it was enough to cause her whole body to shake with delight.
"......Hey, Rosa.
 Do you remember, long ago, when we were small, when we used to talk about what it\'d be like to become witches and fly around the sky?
 ......It\'s come true, you know?
 I became a real witch and granted it for you."
"S‐............Stop it, .........wake me from this dream......"
"You said it.
 You said that you flew through the sky in your dream.
 And you also said that you hadn\'t wanted to wake up.
 You were even mad at me for waking you, right?"
"......Don\'t worry.
 You won\'t wake up this time, alright?
 Heheh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eheheh!!"
Come, dance with me in the vast, rainy sky.
Didn\'t we wish together to fly like seagulls in the sky,
 and escape the cramped and boring island of Rokkenjima...?
Now, I\'ll make that dream a reality for you.
That is why I want to share this joy with you, and no one else...!
"Ahhahaha ahhahahahaha!!
 Isn\'t this so fun, Rosa, isn\'t this so fun?!!
"
"Take a look, below you!
 Look at how small our mansion is.
 I wonder how much time we spent in a place that small.
 ...Now I\'m especially shocked at how cramped and tiny it is."
"So feel.
 Enjoy.
 Rejoice...!
 That power we yearned for, the power to move through the sky at will!
 Come on, let\'s dance, Rosa!
 Through the rain, through the wind!
 Let\'s fly around like we\'re dancing!
 The lightning will shine on us and bless us!!
 Ahhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"
The witch and Rosa were like leaves fluttering around in a whirlwind.
{n}As the rain pounded upon every part of their bodies, as the lightning occasionally shone upon them, they shook with the joy of being released from the ground.
...However, it was only that way for the witch.
{n}Rosa was holding onto her head, voicelessly screaming over and over.
"Stop iiiiiiiiiiiiiitt!!
 Please no mooo{-}o{-}o{-}ooore, let me dooo{-}o{-}o{-}ooown!!"
"......You\'re right, it\'s more fitting for {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s to crawl on the ground.
 Then why not go back there?"
A slightly displeased expression rose to the witch\'s face when she realized that her own joy was not being shared.
 And she decided to listen to her former sister\'s request.
"............?!
 .........aaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaaAAA{0}A{0}A{0}AAHHHHH!!"
The whirlwind that had been making Rosa dance around grew weaker, then stopped.
In other words, Rosa was once again bound by the restrictions of gravity, as a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.
......Following the laws that were originally correct, Rosa began to descend towards the ground upside‐down.
 No, she began to fall.
"Oops...
 That\'s right, if I don\'t take her down the right way, this is what happens!"
The witch hadn\'t intended to send Rosa plummeting.
{n}But she still wasn\'t used to using magic.
After plummeting about 100 meters into a rose bush,
 as a very, very natural result, Rosa died instantly.
But the witch hadn\'t intended to kill her.
{n}So she willed for Rosa not to die.
When she did, gold butterflies coiled about Rosa\'s body, reviving that life just as the witch had wished.
Rosa\'s body, which had laid out a radial carpet of fresh blood, rapidly returned to normal.
The broken and crushed bones returned to normal.
The torn and smashed flesh returned to normal.
......How easy it is to break things in this world, and how difficult it is to fix them...
Anyone can take a life.
But no {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} can revive a lost life!
 By surpassing the irreversible, one proves that they have surpassed {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s.
......This surely gave her a much, much greater realization that she was a witch than flying through the sky had.
".........Awesome...
 I can even revive......an ended life......!"
"Of course.
 {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, you are already an Endless Witch."
"......To live and to die.
 To bring to life and to kill, all of it repeated endlessly.
 {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, as the Endless Witch, you are the queen who controls that cycle of life and death."
"Ahaha, aha.
 One time, I dropped a goldfish bowl.
 The fragile and beautiful bowl broke, and I couldn\'t put it back together again.
 That cute pop‐eyed goldfish would never swim for me again after it landed on the floor."
".........No matter how much I cried, the servants shook their heads, saying that broken things and dead things could never be revived."
"...That\'s when I learned, you know?
 You mustn\'t break things, you mustn\'t kill people.
 After all, you can\'t fix them!!"
"So...if you {i:could} fix them...
...then you wouldn\'t get in trouble for breaking them, right...?
 Haha, ahahahaha, .........awesome...
 Awesome, awesome, awesome...!!
 Ahhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaah{0}hahah{0}hahhah{0}hahhaha!!"
For a while, the witch became intoxicated with how terrible and wonderful the power she had succeeded was.
Her laugh was pure, innocent, and also cruel.
".........Uuuuuunnghh, ......au......"
Even though Rosa had been revived, she let out a cry of anguish at the pain from her fall.
 The witch landed in front of her and held out her hand.
"Hahahahahahaha, sorry about that, Rosa.
 I didn\'t think flying in the sky would be so much fun.
 Sorry, I\'m really sorry."
"And I didn\'t know that {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s could die so easily.
 But I\'ve brought you back to life, so you\'re fine now.
 So get up, okay?
 Play with me some more, okay?
 *giggle*giggle*, ehehehaaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"
What were those dreams you told me about when you were a kid...?
 Go ahead and tell me about all of them without holding back.
As I am now, I can make anything come true, no matter how absurd...!
I can let you drown in a ocean of jelly!
{n}I can swallow you up in a mountain of cake!
{n}I can even make you grow butterfly wings and let you fly around the garden!
I\'ll do them one after another, let\'s start with the ocean of jelly, okay...?!
"S‐stop,
 ...............urgg!!"
Rosa was once again thrown high into the rainy sky.
 However, the sky wasn\'t filled with raindrops, but with drops of orange juice.
When she looked down, Rosa had to doubt her eyes.
 The rose garden had disappeared, and the ground spread out beneath her was like a pastel‐colored jigsaw puzzle.
......It was from the dream she had talked about when she was young, an ocean of jelly.
The black part was coffee jelly.
 The red was strawberry,
 the yellow was pineapple,
 the green was melon.
What was the white part, apple, perhaps...?
.........Did Rosa even have the time to think something like that?
Rosa fell towards that multi‐colored ocean.
......And sank deep into a grape‐flavored purple sea.
It really was an ocean of jelly.
 It had no bottom.
As Rosa sank, she was shocked to see a school of transparent fish swimming through the grape jelly ocean.
They were probably made of grape skin.
Then she sank on and on, deeper and deeper, as deep as the Mariana Trench,
 ......compressed tight by the water pressure of the jelly ocean,
 as her ribs crushed and crunched, as her spine snapped and cracked.
...In the end, she had become a small, frail meatball.
"Ahhahahahahahahahaha!
 What a truly wonderful experience, to drown to death in an ocean of jelly...!!
 It\'s a dream no one else can imitate!!
 I granted it for you, ahhyahyahyahya!!"
The instant I snapped my fingers, the meatball that had been Rosa was launched up into the sky.
And after being enveloped in a golden brilliance, she returned to her original form.
It was as simple and easy as returning dried seaweed to its original form, and anyone could do it.
 If they were a witch!
That vacant look on Rosa\'s face...
had to be because of the joy from having that dream she had given up on as a child made into reality.
 Definitely. Probably.
Next is the mountain of cake.
{n}In an instant, the sky was covered, and became patterned black and white like a chessboard.
That almost transparent white part was her favorite gelatin cheesecake.
{n}The elegant black part was a slightly bitter gâteau au chocolat.
They were a ceiling, they were a mountain, ......and those several billion cakes were thrown down towards Rosa.
If you piled those cakes up, they would surely be taller than Everest.
So they probably weighed...
......I\'m not too sure, but it was probably heavier than all the cakes across Japan put together.
It fell down like a ceiling and swallowed Rosa up,
 ......so as a very, very natural result, Rosa was crushed to death.
In less than a second,
 her bones broke throughout her body and her insides were all smashed and forced out,
 spladdasplutslop.
And yet still an even greater number of cakes piled up on top,
 ...and Rosa ended up as a layer of jam wedged between the cakes.
She became as thin as a single hair, and was probably smashed out into the area of a tennis court.
That world swallowed up by cake was once again absorbed by a golden flash.
Then, as though it had all been a dream, Rosa was revived once again.
......Of course, it definitely wasn\'t a dream.
{n}She had been revived after dying.
By that point, death, which most {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s only have to experience once after they are born,
 had already been experienced repeatedly by Rosa.
In other words, she had gone through that which {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s cannot, the precious experience of dying more than once.
"Ahhahahahahahahaha, kyahha{0}hha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!
 Isn\'t this fun, Rosa, isn\'t this fun?!
 Next is the butterflies, look...!!"
"P‐please, have mercy...... .........aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!"
"No waaay!
 Let\'s play more, let\'s play more...!!
 Kyahihihiha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"
Laughing innocently, she pointed her gold staff at Rosa as she begged for mercy.
When she did, Rosa glittered gold and rapidly began to shrink.
She shrank down to the size of a real butterfly.
 Then, gold wings sprouted from her back...and she joined her fellow gold butterflies.
However, while a human body could withstand this wind, it was a different matter for a butterfly\'s body.
The gold butterfly Rosa was invited to dance by each gale of wind, and she spun in circles around the rose garden.
"No, ...nooo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}ooOO{-}O{-}OOoo{-}o{-}ooOO{-}OOooo!!
 .........ah—"
A gentle bed caught her as she tired from dancing.
It was a soft, knit hammock in the shadows beneath the roof of the arbor.
...The owner of that hammock lumbered into view, welcoming its rare guest who had wandered in on this stormy night...
That owner, which should have been small enough to crush in the palm of your hand,
 now looked as big as the top of a canopy bed to Rosa.
"Giiyaaaaaaaaaaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaaaa!!!"
"Kyahhahaha{0}kya{0}hha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!
 What a klutz, you got caught in a spider\'s web!
 Ahhahaha, ahhahahahahaha!!"
"This time, it\'s a dance with a spider.
 That takes me back, remember the times we\'d find a spider\'s web and play around by throwing pebbles at it?
 I\'ve heard that spiders don\'t chew their prey,
 but insert their venom, and when the insides melt into a sticky soup, they suck it out."
"......Hey, Rosa, remember?
 Remember how we\'d throw butterflies into the spider\'s web on purpose, and play around by seeing how the spider would attack?"
"Kyahhahahahahahaha,
 you don\'t remember, do you? This happened before you got into grade school...!!
 You\'ll be able to see it up close this time, you know!
 Very close.
 Kyahihi{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}kyaaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"
"Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo,
 have mercy, Nee‐san,
 help me, Nee‐san!!
"
"Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
gaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh
gigyeeehhh
gpgyaagh
wagaghhggggg
ergorblahgehmolgeeaarggaagagaga—
ga—
...ga—
......gyuboh!!"
"This girl\'s not bad. She truly can use magic at will!
 Hiihyahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hakkuhi{0}hie{0}hie{0}hya{0}hyahya!!"
"Interesting interesting, interesting interesting!
 You feel like laughing too, right, Battleeeeeeer?!"
"Stop this bullshit!!!
 Just STOOOOOOP!!!
 What\'s so fun, you\'re insane, you\'re insane!!
 What\'s so fun about doing something like this?!?!"
"Doesn\'t she look like she\'s having so much fun?
 I don\'t blame her, magic {i:is} fun!!
 I remember, when I first became able to use magic, I played around so much!
 ...Yeess, I understand, I understand, I understand that play from the bottom of my heart!"
"......I expect I won\'t be able to share this joy and passion with you, Battler, aah, what a shame, what a shame!!
 If you accepted me, I\'d teach you magic anytime you wanted, you know?!
 It\'s hard to describe the joy you receive in the instant you are freed from the shackles of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}ity!"
"I want to teach you about it, that joy, that passion!
 I definitely would like to see the world of magic you would give birth to, just once!
 Kihhihihihi, hhyahhya{0}haah{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"
"You\'re starting to enjoy yourself, right?
 You\'ve started wanting to use magic, right?!
 It\'s pretty fun to be a witch, you know?!
 Just for you, I\'ll teach everything!
 About the joy of flying together in the sky, about the joy of diving together through the sea!"
"I will teach you the excitement that you feel,
 in the instant you surpass the bounds of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s and see how wide your world stretches!
 Wouldn\'t that be fun,
 wahhyahhyaha{0}hha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"
There was no malice in Beato\'s expression.
...It was hard to believe, but she was genuinely enjoying this cruel show.
And she thought she was sharing her appreciation with Battler.
{n}......Battler was aghast at that vastly...
hopelessly different measure of value.
"This is unbelievable... There\'s definitely something screwed up with you!!
 Stop it already, goddammiiiiiiiiit!!
 {f:5:Virgilia}, make her stop this insane farce!!
 What do I have to do?!!"
".........We exist outside the board.
 We cannot touch the board itself."
{f:5:Virgilia} shook her head apologetically.
{n}...She was one who had already been "killed".
{n}Did that mean she couldn\'t interfere in any way...?
As Beato continued to enjoy it in a crazed sort of way, Battler lifted her up by the collar and yelled at her.
"Stop it stop it stop iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit!!!
 That\'s {i:enough}, you goddamn witch!!
 Are you trying to tell me that\'s Auntie Eva?!"
"That\'s impossible!!
 While the Auntie Eva I know may be a bit mean at times,
 it\'s completely impossible that she\'s the kind of person that would do something this cruel!!"
"This is all part of your deception!!
 Don\'t toy with Auntie Rosa!!
 Don\'t toy with Auntie Eva!!
 Stop this farce RIGHT NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW!!"
"But I already said that it\'s not me playing with Rosa anymore.
 I told you, that\'s the new {f:5:Beatrice}."
"Is it really so cruel that you have to squeal like that?
 You\'re also pretty fond of stuff like this, aren\'t you?!
 You actually have just a bit of interest in magic and—
...ouch.
 Wh‐what was that—"
For the first time, Battler slapped Beato across the cheek.
...Beato didn\'t know why something like that would be done to her, and a stunned expression rose to her face.
Battler found that expression even more unforgivable, and he roared.
"HUUUUUUH?!
 You call this {i:interesting}?!
 What the shit is wrong with your head?!!
 Go kill yourself!
 Slice the top of your head off and try looking inside, you\'ll definitely find that the insides have been completely removed!!!"
"Make her stop it right now, make her stop this disgusting farce!!
 I\'ll never forgive you!!
 How dare you do something so cruel!!
 I\'ve sometimes thought that you\'re a bit of a funny person, but I\'ll never make that mistake again!"
"You\'re just a monster who\'s nothing but cruel!!!
 Don\'t show yourself in front of me!!
 Never again!!
 I won\'t accept you, I won\'t talk with you, I don\'t even want to look at your face!!"
"That get through to you?!!
 Don\'t show yourself in front of me!!
 Just—FUCK—OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOFF!!!"
The instant Battler screamed, the power that resisted the witch became a red wall which repelled Beato, knocking her back onto her butt.
"......Owowowow...
 ...What are you talking about, isn\'t it an interesting show...?"
She spoke as though making an excuse, but the person those words were directed at, Battler, was no longer there.
 His figure had suddenly disappeared into the darkness...
...But Beato pouted her lips, and continued trying to explain herself.
"......I‐it\'s not like I completely don\'t see where you\'re coming from,
 ...but this is nothing more than an innocent prank, right...?
 No matter how she kills, that person will be brought back to life in the end, right?
 ...Aren\'t {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s creatures that are fine with anything as long as it ends well......?!"
"R‐right, Master?
 It\'s not something to get so angry about...!"
She was hoping for approval, but {f:5:Virgilia} simply faced her with an indifferent expression.
{n}...To Beato, at that moment, even an exasperated face would probably have seemed better.
"............I have nothing in particular to say.
 If you think it is fun, you can keep watching as long as you want.
 ...Call me when it\'s over.
 I will erase my form until then."
Following Battler\'s lead, {f:5:Virgilia} hid herself in the darkness...
Left sitting there on her own, Beato didn\'t have a clue what was going on, and felt like she had been made out to be the bad guy.
"..............................
 ......What\'s so wronnng?
 It\'s an interesting show, isn\'t it...?!
 I‐it might be a little vulgar, ......but it\'s fairly interesting, isn\'t it...?!!
 Right, Ronove...?!
 It\'s nothing to get so mad about, right...?!"
"Pu ku ku ku.
 ......Something interesting for you, Milady, is not necessarily interesting for Battler‐sama."
"Does he really...hate me that much?"
"......Well, certainly, we are playing against each other, so it is true we are enemies,
 ...but is our relationship really so bad that we can\'t laugh together at entertainment...?!
 .........Since I applauded together with Battler, I thought I could at least laugh together with him...
 ......Does he really reject me so much that we can\'t even do that...?"
"...He doesn\'t have to accept that I\'m a witch.
 Because the point of the game is to compete over that.
 But still, saying he won\'t look at my face, that he won\'t talk to me,
 ......surely ignoring me is going too far...
 Am I really hated that muuuuuch......!"
"The moves you have made thus far are certainly worthy of hatred, Milady.
 Even a demon such as myself can slightly understand Battler‐sama\'s feelings.
 ......I wonder if you cannot understand that because you are especially thickheaded, Milady?
 Pukkukukukuku."
"Sh‐shut up shut up shut up shut up!!
 Why don\'t you disappear too?!!"
"Yes, certainly.
 ......Then, if you would excuse me."
Even Ronove hid himself in the darkness, and Beato was left alone.
The only one in the rainy rose garden.
No one will play with a lonely witch.
Because no one would play with her, she was a lonely witch.
".....................
 ......What\'s going on?
 ...Why won\'t anyone play with me...?
 .........Am I really that weird, that cruel...?
 ............Someone, answer meeeeeeeeee!!"
"Kyahhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha, isn\'t this fun, Rosa, isn\'t this fun!
 Hey, how should we play next?
 Of course, I\'ll play with Maria too, okay?"
"Let\'s all have a friendly walk together!
 Let\'s swim in a pot of boiling chocolate, let\'s have a picnic in a cake‐rising oven!
 Ahahaha, akya{0}kya{0}kya{0}kya{0}kyakya!!"
".........H‐hey, new {f:5:Beatrice}."
Behind the witch who was continuing her spree of tragedy, Beato showed herself.
...Her expression was very rare for her.
 It was kind of restrained, somehow unreliable, miserable.
"Oh, it\'s the predecessor {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.
 Were you watching?"
"The power of magic is truly wonderful!
 Until now, I had never thought it would be so fun to be reborn as a witch.
 It\'s like playtime that never ends...!
 Come on, let\'s play together, Predecessor‐sama...!!"
"But first, wait for a second, okay?!
 The two of them were cooked to death in the oven, so I have to revive them again!"
"They\'re like bread rising because of yeast!
 Like cookies expanding in an oven!
 *giggle*giggle*giggle*!!"
"L‐Listen to what I\'m saying..."
"......Umm, well.
 Isn\'t that enough for the sacrifices of the second twilight?
 ...Of course, it isn\'t specified how you kill them, but,
 umm,
 ......maybe you shouldn\'t toy with them any more than that..."
"What are you saying, Predecessor‐sama?
 I heard from Ronove a short while ago.
 That your magic was much, much more wonderful, cruel, and self‐indulgent!"
"A Halloween party where candies poured out of six people\'s stomachs, how truly wonderful!
 As for me, maybe I\'ll act out Alice\'s tea party...!
 I\'ll invite everyone to a tea party to celebrate a happy unbirthday, and entertain them one by one with my magic!"
"I wonder if I can do it as wonderfully as you?
 I wonder if I can be cruel in my own pop, cute style?!"
"Now that I think about it, all fairy tales are cruel, aren\'t they?
 Now that I\'m a witch inside one of those fairy tales, I finally understand.
 Kyahhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}kukyahya{0}fuhyaha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"
"...............I, I am, umm,
 ...slightly of the opinion that, in the past,
 ...I, too, might have gone a little too far.
 ......Well, I think that as the Golden Witch, it\'s a good idea to have a little elegance..."
"..................???
 I don\'t understand what you\'re saying, Predecessor‐sama."
"But there\'s one thing I do understand.
 No matter how hard I try now, I\'m no match for how cruel you are.
 I\'ve gotta try much, much harder.
 I\'ve gotta become more cruel, and become an excellent Golden Witch...!"
"L‐like I said, you\'ve already done enough here...!
 A‐anyway, this is my order, as your predecessor.
 That\'s enough for the second twilight.
 I\'ll show you how it\'s done.
 Stand back and watch..."
"Yes, Predecessor‐sama.
 I can\'t wait to see what brutal, cruel, and disgusting method of killing you\'ll use."
The new witch pinched the sides of her skirt and gave a graceful bow,
 stepping back as an expectant gaze rose to her face.
......She was expecting an even more cruel magic that surpassed even herself.
"............Well, speaking of that...
 You\'re only half a witch if you can only kill with methods like that.
 ...I shall show you an elegant way to kill, worthy of the Golden Witch..."
When Beato waved her pipe, seven colors of smoke poured out, reviving Rosa and Maria.
......Compared to how the new {f:5:Beatrice} had done it a short while ago, it was slightly gentler.
 ...It was probably gentler than how Beato had done it herself up until now.
Rosa\'s consciousness had already grown dim from the pain of so many repeated deaths.
...But even so, she pleaded that her daughter be spared...
"......Please......have mercy......
 ...Even......if it\'s just Maria......have mercy......"
"Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh, Mama, Mamaaaaaa!!"
".........Sorry.
 My disciple just, umm, ...acted without restraint for a bit.
 ...Umm,
 .........forgive me."
"B‐{f:5:Beatriceeeeeeeeeeeee}!!
 Waaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaaahh, waaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaaahh!!"
When Maria realized it was the real {f:5:Beatrice}, she jumped onto her.
"...You promised, right, Beato?!
 You promised that you would take me to the Golden Land, right?!
 There I can be friends with Mama, and everyone will laugh together...!
 You promised that you would take us there, right?!"
".........A‐
...about that.
 ...I can no longer...
keep that promise.
 .........Because someone appeared who could solve the riddle,
 ......I am no longer the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}."
"......So, I\'m sorry.
 ...I can no longer keep my promise with you......"
"Why...?
 Why...?
 Beato, you promised..."
"......I\'m sorry.
 ...I\'m truly sorry...
 .........So at least, in apology for not being able to keep my promise..."
............I\'ll give you a truly quiet sleep,
{n}which will never be disrupted again...
Beato embraced Maria with a loving expression...
Then, .........softly, a red bruise appeared on Maria\'s neck.
{n}It was a very gentle bruise.
...It grew redder and redder, ...and when it distinctly formed itself into the shape of a hand...
......Maria\'s neck tilted suddenly.
{n}...Peacefully, as though she had fallen asleep.
"M‐Maria......
 ...MariaaaAAaaaAAAAAaa!!"
"......Sorry.
 ......I won\'t apologize that you were the sacrifices for the second twilight.
 That is simply your fate."
"However, I must apologize for the vulgar way in which you were offered as sacrifices...
 ......This is your final sleep.
 ...Never again will it be disturbed..."
Beato softly, gently lifted her finger, as though touching the empty air in front of her nose.
...When she did, a light breeze lifted up, making Rosa\'s body dance lightly like a feather.
Then, Rosa\'s body floated lightly,
 ......and there was the garden fence, with its spear‐shaped prongs.
The spear of the fence pierced Rosa\'s medulla oblongata.
......Benevolently, without toying with her, in a single blow.
{n}Rosa\'s life was snuffed out.
Compared to the earlier innocent yet cruel events, her end was surprisingly tame.
...It just looked like a doll shaped like Rosa was leaning against the fence.
...But, she had passed away.
".........W‐...well, that\'s pretty much how you do it."
Beato acted proud, but the new witch wore a blank expression, almost as though this was an anticlimax.
 And she was forthright with that opinion.
"It\'s kinda plain...
 ......Very different from the person Ronove told me about."
"...Well, um, ...you must use magic with dignity, you see...?
 If it\'s too, umm, ...undignified, that isn\'t very elegant..."
".............................................
 ......But you can do wonderful things endlessly with this magic.
 ......How boring."
"Now now! No complaining...!
 The path of a Golden Witch cannot be completed in a day.
 You are still incomplete until you finish the tenth twilight...
 For now, stay quiet and follow my instructions.
 ...Alright......?!"
"......................................."
"Wh‐what happened to your answer?
 Your answer...!"
"...........................
 ...............Fiiine."
"...Better, much better.
 ......Well, there is still much to do for the resurrection ritual.
 You still have to kill five people...
 You should do it without toying with them too much, with beauty and dignity,
 ...and with at least a little decorum, alright...?"
"What Ronove told you about how I did it, ......that was a bad example.
 You mustn\'t use that as a model.
 Engrave that into your heart."
"............Yes, Predecessor‐sama."
"A good answer.
 ......Ronove, the Seven Stakes of Purgatory, arise...!"
"......Yes, Milady.
 Ronove, right here."
"Lucifer the Proud, right here."
"...Up until this point, umm, I\'ve done things a little flashy, but,
 ......umm,
 ......well, the dignity of the Golden Witch is also important,
 so, what I\'m trying to say is—"
As Ronove chuckled at Beato\'s uncharacteristically flustered speech,
 he summed it up for her.
"Certainly.
 From now on, we will be careful to perform in a graceful manner, suitable for the name of the Golden Witch.
 ......Even the Seven Sisters of Purgatory will reform their previous bad behavior,
 and we shall espouse to perform our task in the quickest possible manner.
 ......Would that be acceptable? Milady?"
"M‐mm.
 That\'s it, more or less.
 Everyone, take it to heart!
 Alright...?!"
"Yes.
 Certainly."
"That is all I wish to say.
 ......You may leave now."
"Certainly.
 If you would excuse me."
"Excuse us."
".........................................."
"Well, ...that\'s all I want to say.
 So, take care as you continue, alright?
 Go with dignity, and, ...umm, decorum, befitting the Golden Witch, alright?
 ......You should do your best.
 I will be watching over you."
Acting unsure until the very end, Beato communicated only that to her,
 became a group of gold butterflies, and vanished into thin air.
 It may be fitting to say that she disappeared in a hurry because she was having trouble maintaining the conversation.
After that, all that remained was Maria\'s outstretched body, pounded by the rain,
 and Rosa\'s body, propped up by the fence and gazing up at the sky.
......And the figure of the witch.
".....................Show some decorum............you say."
Her expression looked just a little bored.
There was a popping sound.
{n}...That was probably her clicking her tongue.
".................................
 ...........................What a boring person."
Leaving that last sentence behind, she, too, vanished into thin air......"..............................zzzzz..."
"..................Whew.
 ...Looks like she\'s finally calmed down..."
Hideyoshi wiped his own forehead.
 ...For a time, Eva had seemed to be having a very painful nightmare, but it appeared that she had finally fallen asleep.
As promised, he still gripped Eva\'s hand.
 ...He thought it would probably be alright to let go about now, but he faithfully continued to hold her hand.
Every once in a while, his hand would get tired, and he would switch between his right and his left,
 but even so, as promised, he never let go of her hand...
At that time, there was a heavy knock.
 Eva had finally managed to fall asleep, so Hideyoshi grimaced for just an instant.
"......Aneki, Hideyoshi‐san, sorry.
 Is Rosa there...?"
It was Rudolf\'s voice.
 ...What could it be?
Hideyoshi headed for the door, hiding his footsteps so that he wouldn\'t wake Eva.
......It was definitely Rudolf\'s voice, but just in case, he opened the door without removing the chain.
"What is it?
 Somethin\' happen to Rosa?"
"We can\'t find Rosa or Maria‐chan.
 I thought they might be with you."
"...I heard her scoldin\' Maria‐chan in the corridor.
 They got quiet after that, so I thought they went back to the lobby......didn\'t they...?"
"............That idiot..."
Rudolf clicked his tongue.
Other people could be seen in the corridor.
 It had been some time since Rosa went out into the corridor, and she had still not returned, so they had begun to worry.
Near the front door, Natsuhi pointed at the removed chain.
"......The chain isn\'t set.
 They must have gone outside to see the rose after all."
"Going out and leaving the door unlocked, that is simply too careless.
 What a troublesome person."
"...More importantly for now, I\'m worried about Rosa‐san and Maria‐chan themselves."
"Right.
 ......Hey, brats.
 Where was this rose of Maria‐chan\'s?!"
"I\'m pretty sure...it was in the flower bed right in the middle of the rose garden..."
"If those two are there, we should be able to tell quickly if we go."
"......Dad, I think we should bring them back as soon as we can..."
"Of course.
 We\'ll bring them both back and spank them on the butt.
 I\'ll dash out there and come back.
 Lock the door as soon as I go out."
"...Dad, I\'ll go with you."
"Don\'t be an idiot.
 You\'re a brat, and what brats do is they watch the house with Mommy."
"............What is it...?
 Did something happen......?"
"Sorry, did I wake you up...?
 ...Seems like Rosa‐san took Maria‐chan outside.
 ...How reckless of her."
"Rosa and Maria‐chan went...
...outside...?
 Into the rose garden......?!"
"That\'s right.
 ...Oh, I guess you must\'ve heard.
 Maria‐chan was causin\' a ruckus \'cause she wanted to see her rose."
"......Th‐......they mustn\'t,
 ......they mustn\'t go to the rose garden...!
 Tell Rosa to stop...!"
"Th‐there\'s no tellin\' her to stop now, it looks like they left a while ago.
 ......Seriously, how reckless of them."
".........That\'s not it...
 ...Not the rose garden...
 ...There\'s a witch there...
......and she\'s waiting for a sacrifice...!
 Rosa, you mustn\'t go...
......ooooooooooohhh..."
...Eva curled herself up again, holding her head.
{n}......Her complexion looked very bad.
"What is it?
 Did the fever make you dream somethin\' bad?"
"............It was a dream,
 ......yes...
 ............In the rose garden, the witch, doing that to Rosa and Maria......
 .........That\'s right.
 ...It\'s a dream,
 ......yes..."
"Calm down.
 I\'m also in this room.
 The chain is set, too.
 The shutter\'s closed on the window, and there\'s even a gun.
 This room is just like a fort.
 There\'s not a thiiing to be afraid of."
Hideyoshi beat his chest, trying to calm her, but Eva\'s insecure expression didn\'t change.
...Under the covers, Eva kept praying...
that the grotesque nightmare she had just had was only a dream...
"In the center of the rose garden, Rudolf confirmed the bodies of Rosa and Maria.
 After that, he returned to the guesthouse, called for help, and carried both of them into the guesthouse."
"If we can trust Nanjo\'s examination, the cause of Rosa\'s death was a stab to the medulla oblongata with the pointed gate of the fence.
 It is thought that Maria\'s death was due to strangling with bare hands.
 However, due to the "Devil\'s Proof", we cannot discount a misdiagnosis."
"......I will say it in red.
 {p:1:Rosa and Maria died}.
 {p:1:The causes of death were as Nanjo diagnosed}.
 ......She wasn\'t eaten by a spider, nor was she crushed by a mountain of cake.
 Don\'t worry."
"............So you argue that even though you toyed with their death so much, it\'s all okay because the corpse is clean...
 I definitely won\'t forgive you.
 ...All of that brutal treatment you gave Auntie Rosa,
 I\'ll never forget it, and I\'ll never forgive you for it..."
"...L‐like I said, that wasn\'t me......
 ...I think I gave them a much more peaceful death than the way she treated them..."
"Shut the hell up.
 I don\'t want to listen to you.
 .........I\'ve been told that there are no more than 18 people on this island, and now that eight people are already dead,
 the suspects are narrowed down to ten.
 One of them probably killed those two."
"...Or it could also be an accidental death.
 Like Maria was having a tantrum,
 and when Auntie Rosa tried to stop her crying, she misjudged how much power she was using and accidentally killed her.
 Then, in her consternation, she slipped and fell, landed on the fence, and unluckily, died."
"......How\'s that?
 That way there\'s no need for a witch or magic."
"......Well, that\'s not true.
 Actually, Rosa and Maria—"
"Shut up.
 Didn\'t I say that I didn\'t want to listen to you?
 You\'re an eyesore, so get lost.
 You monster."
Battler said that without rage, ...but with a horribly cold voice.
...Beato had also felt something out of place since the beginning.
{n}In a fight, both of them could go at each other without restraint.
However, he wouldn\'t even step into the ring.
{n}She could feel that coldness.
Beato wasn\'t pleased about that.
{n}...She thought about flaring up, but she held back.
Maybe even though she was innocent and childish,
 she had enough sense to realize that she shouldn\'t fight.
"........................
 ..................Is that so?
 Then I will hide myself.
 ...Ronove, continue for me."
"Certainly.
 ...Will that be satisfactory, Battler‐sama?"
".........There are no problems with that proposal.
 If Battler‐kun says that he doesn\'t want to see Beato\'s face, I believe that will be an acceptable alternative."
"Do what you like.
 ...I couldn\'t care less what you do as long as I don\'t have to look at that monster\'s face."
"......Hey, wait a second.
 ...You keep saying "monster monster", but isn\'t that a mean way to speak of me?"
"......Why do you instinctively hate me so much, Battler?
 None of that was me, it was all the work of my disciple..."
".........It\'s not like I\'m only mad about what happened just now.
 It\'s from the very beginning."
"Come on, Battleer.
 Don\'t misunderstand, alright...?
 Aren\'t we just a pair of players confronting each other through a game?
 ...We look for moves to make things painful for each other, but—"
"Don\'t get the wrong idea.
 I don\'t hate you because you\'re my rival in this strange game about whether I accept you as a witch or not.
 ......I just cannot in any way forgive how senselessly cruel you are."
"That\'s because a serial murder is part of the game...
 It\'s probably impossible to avoid a little cruelty..."
"I\'m not just talking about what just happened.
 The last time, and the time before that too.
 ......Tearing everyone\'s stomach and stuffing it with sweets, plowing their face.
 What was the point of all that?"
"..................That\'s...
well—"
"All this stuff about locked‐room murders and tricks and alibis,
 I\'m willing to give you a pass on all that.
 You want to claim that these are murders done by magic,
 so I\'ll grudgingly accept that those complicated crimes have to occur."
"......But what exactly are all those grotesque murders supposed to mean?"
"............Well, umm,
 ...............nothing much..."
"That\'s right.
 They don\'t mean anything.
 You\'re just fooling around by mangling the corpses for fun.
 That has nothing to do with whether you\'re a witch, or whether it could or couldn\'t be done with magic."
"You\'re just exploring the depths of cruelty for fun.
 I don\'t hate you because you\'re a witch, or anything like that.
 There\'s just some things I cannot forgive as a human."
".........Wh‐
......what do you mean, as a human...?"
"For example,
 ......the six people of the first twilight for this game.
 ...Well, other than Grandfather being burned black,
 the other five corpses were killed in a normal way, without any unnecessary shaming of the dead."
"...It wasn\'t clear whether the weapon was a spear or a gun, but anyways, as far as killing goes, that was permissibly better.
 It was much better than the insanity and cruelty of the first twilight last time, or the time before that."
"And this time, there were six locked rooms tied together to make a locked‐room chain.
 ......That was sort of interesting.
 When we were going back and forth with each other on that, to be perfectly honest, I thought it was just a little fun."
"...You were frantic to make me accept your existence, and I was frantic trying to deny it.
 ......We were both frantically doing all we could."
"This may sound weird, but I even felt a faint sense of sportsmanship between the two of us.
 ...We exist in conflict,
 but I faintly thought that we {i:might} not be {i:completely} unable to understand each other\'s existence."
".........But just now, that feeling was blown away without a trace."
"Th‐that\'s where you\'re misunderstanding...!
 That wasn\'t me—"
"That\'s not it.
 That\'s not what I\'m talking about!
 ......You watched Auntie Rosa being killed horribly over and over,
 and you sneered at it like it was an interesting show."
.........When I saw that, I was deeply disappointed.
When I realized that your decision to kill them in a slightly better way this time had been nothing more than a little whim,
 ...and that nothing had changed in your cruel character, I was deeply disappointed.
And that\'s not all, you were even genuinely enjoying a brutal death.
You weren\'t just acting as cruel as you could to bully me.
...You truly, genuinely enjoy cruelty.
Your character lets you enjoy it.
You saw Auntie Rosa being brutally killed over and over, and said, isn\'t this fun?
That wasn\'t sarcasm, you enjoyed it from the bottom of your heart,
 wanted to share that feeling with me, and said, isn\'t this fun?
......In that instant, I despaired, and I realized the truth.
"The problem isn\'t whether you\'re a witch or not.
 ......That cruelty of yours is unforgivable to me.
 And I can\'t understand it!
 I can\'t forgive it, either!
 Still, I\'ll continue this game of whether to accept or deny witches.
 I won\'t step down and accept my own defeat."
"However, your pointless cruelty is absolutely not needed for that game.
 So I\'ve decided that I won\'t accept you as my opponent.
 Ronove is a hundred times better.
 He doesn\'t have the same cruel hobby you do.
 Even if he does, he doesn\'t have the awful taste to show it off in front of me."
"......That\'s right, you have awful taste.
 You\'re heartless and cruel, so you can\'t understand.
 That\'s unpleasant in an opponent.
 So I don\'t want to see your face again."
After Battler had finished his rant, Beato was shocked into silence for a long time.
Maybe she couldn\'t understand what she was being told,
 or maybe this was a sign that she was doing all she could in an effort to understand.
For a while, she kept switching between angry expressions, frustrated expressions, bold expressions,
 ......as though she didn\'t even know herself what attitude she should take.
In the end, she made her face into a candid expression, as though she had come to her senses,
 and shrugged her shoulders as though she was tired.
"........................
 .........In that case, do as you like.
 From now on, I will continue this game through Ronove.
 ......You have no complaints as long as I don\'t show myself, right?"
"......For the time being.
 But I definitely won\'t forgive your countless cruel actions up until now.
 So I definitely won\'t accept you.
 For that reason as well, I won\'t back down from this fight you\'ve picked.
 And I definitely won\'t lose.
 ...That\'s all there is to it."
"...............Beato.
 No matter how many more excuses you give, his impression of you will not waver.
 ...I have something to talk about later.
 Until then, stay back."
".....................M‐...mm...
 ...Alright.
 ...Then I\'ll hide myself until I\'m called..."
Looking lonely, Beato turned her back to them, and hid herself.
...Battler watched, a slightly displeased expression on his face.
He thought his argument had been valid, but for some reason, his mood didn\'t clear up.
"......She\'s...
an idiot."
".........That\'s true.
 An idiot, and honest."
"That idiot watched with me as Auntie Rosa was horribly killed,
 and turned around with a huge smile on her face."
"......She really believed that she could laugh with me at that cruel show.
 ...She really believed that I could sympathize with that emotion..."
"Looking at that innocent smile, I felt just horrible.
 ......It would have been much better if she\'d said it with her normal bullying face...
 ...Damn it..."
"Milady has never had the experience of having a friend.
 ......In addition, she has probably never had something spoken to her that strongly."
"Both Madam and I are her attendants.
 No matter what we say, it will not reach her ears.
 For Milady, this is also—"
"To hell with that.
 I don\'t remember ever becoming her friend."
"......That is true.
 My apologies."
".....................
 ......There is one thing I would like to thank you for.
 ...Thank you for not backing down from that child\'s game."
She spoke words of gratitude, but for some reason, Battler made a displeased face.
Then, as though finding revulsion in his own bad mood, he chuckled.
"Now that I\'ve even got witches and demons thanking me, I\'m screwed.
 ......Let\'s resume the game.
 Of course, I don\'t intend to go easy on you."
"I wouldn\'t have it any other way.
 Unlike Milady, I do not get agitated."
"......I\'ve already made my move.
 If we suppose that Auntie Rosa is the culprit and died in an accident, I can deny the witch.
 ......I don\'t want to suspect Auntie Rosa, but for now I\'ll deliberately assume that it was her, just to beat the hell out of Beato."
"I will deny it with red.
 {p:1:Rosa\'s and Maria\'s deaths were homicides}."
"Alright.
 ...Why don\'t we start from there.
 ...............Damn, I\'m just not getting fired up."
Since Rosa and Maria had been killed, it had become clear that the murderer was still hiding somewhere,
 trying to add even more murders to this chain.
As he shed tears, Rudolf scolded Rosa\'s body over and over for being reckless,
 but Rosa would never respond to that again.
They decided to place the two bodies in one of the guest rooms, and to seal it until the police arrived...
The second murder, ...no, the murder of the second twilight, had delivered a heavy blow to everyone.
Because it had blown away the optimism that some of them had held—
the thought that "actually, a crime didn\'t occur, and it was all a game or a farce by Kinzo and the servants".
Trying to distract themselves from the sadness of losing the people they loved,
 George and Jessica had spent the whole time since morning talking about every possibility.
......And, they had distracted their hearts...
...by supposing that these murders might actually have all been an act,
 and that Shannon and Kanon were only pretending to be dead.
When the murders occurred again, it destroyed that thought,
 ......and they were once again confronted with the fact that their loved ones had most definitely been killed...
The tears that they\'d thought had died away began to drip down once more, and Battler couldn\'t think of anything to say to them...
After that, to be extra cautious, all of the adults checked that all of the rooms were safe, and that everything was locked.
They made certain that the shutters on all of the windows were down and locked, and they checked that no one suspicious was hiding anywhere.
On top of that, they checked their weapons once again,
 and made sure that each other\'s hearts were prepared, so that they wouldn\'t hesitate to fire off a preemptive shot if they saw the shadow of a mysterious person.
Furthermore, the gun Rosa had been holding had been left near the place she had been found.
Someone had gone out of their way to leave it there, so everyone suspected that it was some kind of trap,
 but when Hideyoshi made ingenious use of a fire iron to fire off a test shot, it discharged without a problem.
When all five shots that had been loaded discharged without any problems as a result,
 it was reloaded with bullets and handed over to the only adult male who wasn\'t armed, Hideyoshi.
However, the fact that it had been able to fire off five shots gave rise to a certain paranoia.
This short barrel rifle could load a maximum of five shots.
{n}In other words, Rosa hadn\'t fired even once.
And yet, the two had probably been killed by someone with their bare hands.
This meant there was a possibility that the crime had been committed by someone whose face they knew...
"......When the first murder occurred,
 I privately thought of the possibility that it was all an act."
"...My apologies to Doctor Nanjo, but if he had actually been in on it,
 and only convinced us that the servants were dead,
 I thought this could have been some massive, elaborate act by Father."
"......After all, unless we assume they were acting, that locked‐room situation of theirs couldn\'t have been created in the first place."
"...We also...
...suspected that.
 ...No,
 ...I still want to believe that\'s the case."
"...............My apologies, ......but that is not so.
 ...I am quite old.
 There may be a chance that I made a misdiagnosis.
 ......However, I would never mistake whether they were alive or dead..."
"I get it!
 Don\'t frickin\' say it out loud, Doctor Nanjo...!"
"......My apologies..."
They couldn\'t know about it,
 but Beato had already proclaimed the deaths of the six,
 ...no, this time the deaths of all victims so far, in red.
That faint dream that it was all a farce, and that the victims were actually alive,
 ......was, sadly, impossible...
"......In that case, it\'s more natural to think there\'s someone hiding on this island who knows the mansion inside out,
 carrying out a crime they\'ve been planning for ages.
 In other words, from the time that the typhoon came to this island and sealed it off from the outside world, there were more than 18 people on this island."
And, of course, they had no way of knowing this either:
That claim of Rudolf\'s had also been denied in red.
{n}There are no more than 18 humans on this island...
"Maybe it makes some sense if we think of it this way.
 ......Essentially, there\'s the possibility that the person who\'s hiding is someone who wasn\'t originally supposed to be on the island right now,
 yet is someone whose face was known by Rosa‐san, and with whom she would let her guard down."
"......S‐
so, for example,
 could it be...a servant whose shift doesn\'t lie on these two days...?"
"Hmm......
 ...It\'s hard to argue with that one.
 After they finish their duties, it is not as though we verify that they leave the island by punching a ticket or something.
 If we suppose that a servant on a shift from a few days ago only pretended to leave the island, and actually stayed here,
 that would be hard to deny..."
"......Rosa‐san isn\'t stupid, if you ask me.
 If a servant who\'s not supposed to be here popped up in front of you, that\'d normally set alarm bells ringing..."
"...............I have a problem with assuming this was a crime by an acquaintance.
 ...Perhaps whoever it was suddenly attacked Rosa from the darkness, and were about to steal her gun.
 Then Rosa fell, hit her head against the fence, and stopped moving.
 The guesthouse was nearby, so they wanted to avoid the sound of a gunshot, and they killed Maria‐chan with their bare hands..."
"......That\'s also a possibility.
 ...Still, even if that is the case..."
"Would they intentionally leave Rosa\'s gun at the scene of the crime?
 I don\'t know what the culprit is armed with, but our guns should be a point of worry for them.
 ...Wasn\'t that a perfect chance for them to thin out our supply?
 Why\'d they deliberately leave it at the scene of the crime?"
"At first, I thought that the gun was a trap.
 ......That\'s what chessboard thinking says it would be.
 By purposefully leaving it, they wanted to make one of us touch it.
 And they must have wanted to make us pull the trigger.
 ...I was sure that it would have some dangerous device to make it explode and cause massive injuries."
"But, it\'s actually alright.
 ......I\'d say, the culprit was probably in a hurry.
 I\'ll bet that right now, they\'re regretting they missed their chance to steal a gun...!"
".........I don\'t like it.
 It pisses me off, \'cause it\'s like a message from the witch, saying she isn\'t even scared of guns."
"...However, in any event, this is a fearsome opponent.
 It should have been obvious to any observer that Rosa‐san was holding a gun.
 To think that they attacked her despite that.
 ......We should not neglect the fact that they are unafraid of guns."
"Mm...
 It is as Natsuhi says.
 ......We should probably be even more cautious than we have been."
"This is just for peace of mind, but...
.........at the time we think Rosa‐san went outside,
 where was everyone...?"
"Natsuhi and I were here, along with Rudolf and Kyrie‐san.
 I can guarantee their alibis."
"Eva and I were together.
 I can guarantee that."
"Me, George‐aniki, and Jessica were together too.
 ......When Auntie Rosa yelled at us to go back upstairs,
 we turned right around and went back to the cousins\' room with our tails between our legs."
"......Back then,
 ...if we hadn\'t let Maria go..."
"Saying that isn\'t going to change anything..."
"............Doctor Nanjo?"
"I, I was reading a book in one of the upstairs rooms.
 ......I was by myself, so no one can verify my alibi,
 but I believe everyone saw me return upstairs with the children."
"...You could say any number of things like this,
 but what if you jumped out the window, attacked Rosa,
 then climbed back up using the rain gutter or something...?"
"D‐d‐don\'t be absurd...
 How could I perform a feat like jumping down from the second story with this old body...or climbing up, for that matter..."
"......Let us stop this...
 Suspecting each other...
 It\'s more important that we trust each other, and, for the children\'s sakes as well, defend this place until the very end."
"Yeah...
 ...It\'s like Natsuhi‐san says.
 .........For now, let\'s stop doubting each other."
"You\'re right.
 ...We may be useless as far as searching for the culprit is concerned.
 ......We can only stay alive until tomorrow, inform the police, and follow their instructions.
 Because the police will definitely expose who the culprit is."
".........What is it, Eva?
 ...Is your body still feelin\' bad...?"
"M‐Mother, what\'s wrong?
 Are you alright...?"
"...Sorry.
 ...It looks like my fever is still strong.
 I\'ll be fine, so leave me alone..."
When they looked, they saw Eva staring at the floor, her breathing harsh again.
{n}...She had been able to act firm for a time, due to the urgency of their situation,
 but it seemed her body wasn\'t at its best after all...
"Yes.
 I killed those two.
 Now, the only ones who know about the gold are us.
 I won\'t give up even a scrap to the other siblings."
"............What have you done......!
 There\'s so much of that gold!
 Giving Rosa and the others their share wouldn\'t have been a problem at all...!"
"It would.
 ...That gold is to be passed on only to the head of the Ushiromiya family.
 And that makes that gold, all of it, in its entirety, the very honor of the head."
"......Putting even the smallest dent in it...
is definitely not something I will permit as the new Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}.
 ......*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!"
"...Do you plan to continue these murders according to the witch\'s epitaph...?
 Do you actually plan to kill five more people...?"
"Yes.
 If I don\'t finish that annoying ritual, it seems that my power as a witch won\'t become complete.
 ......Hey, "me"..."
"...The power of the witch is really awesome.
 It really can make all of our fantasies become reality.
 The power to make dreams more than just dreams...!"
"Now that I\'ve learned of this power, I can no longer stop being a witch.
 If I can complete the ritual and make my power whole, I\'m sure I\'ll be able to teach you that feeling too.
 *giggle*giggle*giggle*, *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"
"Stop acting like an idiot...!
 Haven\'t you played witch enough?
 We found the gold.
 And we\'ve even been promised the position of successor to the head.
 We\'ll probably need to tightrope walk just a bit, but at this point, that\'s a dream that will definitely come true.
 ......Beyond that, what more could you wish for...?!"
"I wanted to become a witch."
"I don\'t know anything about that dream...!"
"That\'s it.
 Because I kept holding on to that dream, I\'ve lived at this age forever.
 ......You threw that dream away by becoming an adult."
"......You thought, no matter how long you waited, the rabbit holding a clock wouldn\'t visit you,
 and you wouldn\'t be able to meet Humpty Dumpty.
 And of course, you definitely wouldn\'t be invited to the land of cards.
 You gave up like that, and so you became an adult."
"And that\'s why you don\'t want to become a witch or anything like that anymore.
 ...You\'ve even forgotten that it was the dream of your true self."
"......Look, just stop it!
 I\'ve already gotten my hands on two dreams!
 The gold and the position of head.
 That\'s more than enough!
 So please, your dream has nothing to do with me!
 Be obedient...!!"
".........No waaaay.
 Magic\'s too much fun.
 .........Besides, those two dreams of yours both came true because of my magic.
 It\'s not fair if my dream doesn\'t come true too."
"I am grateful for your magic, and I accept you as a real witch.
 ......So please, be obedient now and return to the inside of my heart!
 And never appear again!!"
"No waaay.
 ......We\'re both misunderstanding each other, aren\'t we?
 That\'s right, I am not you anymore.
 You are Ushiromiya Eva.
 I am the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}."
"So I have no reponsibility to go back inside your heart.
 ......I would say I feel like a butterfly who has broken out of her cocoon, namely you."
"............haah,
 ......haah......
 ...Urg,
 ......the fever...
is making my mind cloudy......"
"My inexperience with my magic power is making me support it with your vitality.
 Until I finish the ritual and become a full witch, you might have to bear the burden.
 I\'ll take that in exchange for making two of your dreams come true."
"......It\'s alright, don\'t worry, okay?
 For the remaining five sacrifices, I\'ll avoid your family."
"Let\'s see, Rudolf, Kyrie, Krauss, Natsuhi.
 ...And what about that old geezer Nanjo?
 Perfect, I\'ll kill those five people.
 *giggle*giggle*, could you call this a murder announcement revealed only to yoouu?
 *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!!"
Eva finally crouched down.
{n}Hideyoshi rushed up to her, and lent her his shoulder...
"......Are you alright?
 ...Let\'s take it easy and rest!"
"Are you alright...?
 Doctor Nanjo, take a look at Eva...!"
When Nanjo and George tried to approach, Eva made a gesture to stop them.
"...Thank you.
 I\'m fine, Doctor Nanjo.
 I\'m taking medicine.
 ......I apologize for saying this in such an extreme situation,
 ...but let me rest a little longer..."
"Mom...I\'ll lend a hand too..."
"Thank you,
 but I\'ll be fine as long as your father watches over me.
 ......Go back to the cousins\' room upstairs, and don\'t come out no matter what.
 ...Understood...?
 No matter what happens, you must not leave the guesthouse......"
"...Outside,
 ......that...witch is......
uuuuhrg..."
"Don\'t talk anymore...!
 Sorry, everyone, but I\'ll be watchin\' over Eva in the room.
 Call if somethin\' happens."
Hideyoshi and Eva retreated from the lobby.
...Of course, Eva wasn\'t the only one who wasn\'t feeling well.
 They hadn\'t gotten a wink of sleep since the previous night, and had been pressed by tension since the morning.
...They were mustering their energy to protect their families,
 but if they relaxed even a little, surely every of one them would be down and out...
"......Everything has gone as planned so far, but from here on out, it will become difficult, you see?"
"Difficult, you say...?"
"Mm.
 In most cases, as the ritual progresses and the victims increase, they begin to tighten their guard,
 and often, they hole up in one place and stop moving.
 That is extremely inconvenient for us."
"...Are you saying that we witches are inferior to a bunch of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s in a group...?"
"Witches are never inferior to {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s...
 However, perhaps you could say that times change, and that {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s have gotten their hands on a poison..."
"......This wasn\'t a problem long ago, during the period when witches were believed in,
 but just like that annoyance Battler, people in the current era generally deny magic."
"In other words, their existence itself is anti‐magical.
 As a result, at some point, they grew to possess a toxin inside their bodies that denies magic."
"In other words, you\'re saying that the more {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s there are,
 the stronger that anti‐magic toxin gets, and the greater the disadvantage is for us witches?"
"......The total value of all their hearts\' power to deny magic, in other words their Magic Resistance, becomes the denominator to our Magic.
 Understand?
 Is that a bit too difficult for you...?"
"You\'re joking.
 I understand it truly easily.
 ...In other words, you\'re saying that the more people there are that don\'t believe in magic,
 and the stronger their will is, the greater the dramatic division in the effect of the magic is.
 ......I see, if that\'s the kind of formula it is, I\'ll have to rethink my method of attack."
Fundamentally, magic possesses a vast power.
It can even make a rain of fire fall from the heavens, divide a sea, and reviving a lost life isn\'t impossible either.
However, that power is extremely weak against the toxin that rejects it.
And that toxin has been piling up in {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s since the time they forgot their respect for all things sacred,
 ...until finally, this earth was covered with enough toxin that the miracles of magic could not be displayed.
Thus, witches from across the world were chased from their dwellings.
...They were forced to choose whether to throw away their magic and live as {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s, or live in hiding in remote areas where the toxin of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s didn\'t reach.
In that sense, Rokkenjima, with its population of only ten to twenty humans, was extremely favorable for witches.
And even more favorable was the existence of the ghost story about the witch who lived in the Rokkenjima forest.
...Essentially, the fear that a witch might exist permeates the island to a certain extent,
 weakening the anti‐magic toxin from the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s.
A small population, and a margin of possibility to accept a magical being.
{n}In other words, minds that were only weakly anti‐magical.
...Only in the valley where those two converged...could a witch live in modern times...
"I see...
 ......So by this formula, we can say that there are several rules a witch must follow to use her power efficiently."
"The first one is creating a scene.
 Create a murder scene that you couldn\'t imagine was done by {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s, decorate it with occult ornaments,
 make it look very much like a witch exists, and by permeating the people with fear, make them believe that witches exist,
 and as a result, the anti‐magic power and the denominator for the power of the magic will be decreased."
"......I see, so this is why the creepy magic circles of the first twilight were created?"
"Th‐that\'s right, exactly...!
 The gaudy scenes for the first twilight each game are all for that reason.
 It\'s definitely not as though I like cruel things or am doing it for fun..."
"...In that case, Predecessor‐sama,
 this time was a failure.
 You killed them in a very plain way.
 It doesn\'t look like anything more than a simple mystery."
".........You should have damaged the bodies more grotesquely, like you did last time and the time before that, as I heard from Ronove,
 making it look like a fantasy and instilling fear in those people."
".........W‐...well, about that.
 ...I thought it wouldn\'t be artful to do that every time, you understand...?
 Don\'t think too deeply on it, it\'s just a whim...!"
Actually, it really had been her whim.
{n}After being told all that by Battler, she couldn\'t say it out loud anymore,
 but she had decided her method of killing based only on a whim.
No, would it be better to say that she had halfheartedly let Ronove decide?
{n}Because she had left the locked room of this game\'s first twilight to him.
But if Beato had gotten a cruel idea, then she surely would have explored the limits of atrocity even worse than the last game...
"...........................
 For the methods of Rosa and Maria\'s deaths too, you told me to show restraint,
 but that wasn\'t a course of action beneficial to us witches either, was it?"
"In actuality, at the present moment, none of them believe one bit that a witch actually exists.
 They\'re sure that it isn\'t a fantasy, but completely in the mystery genre.
 This turn of events is a failure for us witches.
 ......And it\'s all because, for some reason, you keep doing things in a kinda lukewarm way, Predecessor‐sama."
"Aah... L‐like they say, you should seek out work while you\'re young...!
 This is a test from me to you as your predecessor.
 Challenge it with respect.
 Wahahaha...!"
Beato tried to laugh heartily,
 but it was obviously a fake laugh trying to cover something up,
 and the new witch shrugged, sighing.
"........................
 ...At this stage, it\'s probably too late to reduce the anti‐magic power by creating a scene.
 ...In that case, there\'s another move.
 Having the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s split up should work."
"Mmhm, that is probably the most effective way.
 The smaller the number of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s, the more the denominator shrinks.
 As a result, the magic power becomes immediately effective.
 ...In other words, the crucial point from here on will be how to destroy this barricade situation and have them split up into small groups."
"However, they are already very cautious.
 The barricade won\'t be destroyed easily, you know...?
 Both the barricade in Kinzo\'s study two games ago and the barricade in the parlor last time were very stubborn.
 Furthermore, most of the cunning adults have been left this time."
"The situation is more difficult than all the ones before it, you see?
 ......If you wish, I could give you some special advice..."
If the first murder case occurs in a closed circle, the survivors hole up without fail,
 gathering together to observe each other and ensure their safety.
......Worrying about how to break that situation apart is probably the domain of murderers and mystery authors,
 so how ludicrous it is that witches, who are meant to exist at the other end of the spectrum, share in that exact same worry.
For a while, the new witch poked her cheek with her index finger, making gestures as though deep in thought, and eventually spoke.
"...........................
 ......No, I\'m fine.
 After all, it is a test.
 ......I won\'t borrow your moves."
"Mh, ...really...?
 ...The thing is, though, it will be pretty hard to defeat this barricade, you know...?"
"I\'ve already made my move.
 I\'m pretty sure it will work.
 If they\'re smart, then it definitely will."
"I‐is that so......
 You really are excellent...
 I am pleased that my disciple isn\'t hard to deal with."
"My motto is to study things myself before asking other people.
 ......Then, if you would excuse me.
 I have to wait for my prey to get nonchalantly lured out."
"Mm.
 ...Well then, handle it with care."
As the new witch lowered her head, her face blank, she turned into gold butterflies and hid herself.
......Beato looked slightly unamused.
{n}It seemed she was lonely since she hadn\'t been relied on at all.
"...............Not one of them bothers themselves with me.
 .........Hmph.
 You witch apprentice, acting so smart.
 ...I\'ll bet any moment now she\'s going to make some painful mistake and start crying."
"Then, without a doubt, she\'ll finally realize my greatness and follow my teachings!
 *cackle*, until then, I shall watch from above."
She laughed loudly on the outside, but a laugh no one can hear is completely pointless.
Beato started to feel empty, and quickly stopped laughing.
...Ronove chose that time to show himself.
"Excuse me, Milady.
 ......The game of the second twilight with Battler‐sama has ended."
"......Mh, ...I see.
 Good work.
 What was the result?"
"My sincere apologies.
 I was forced to resign.
 ......Battler‐sama\'s claim of "Rosa strangled Maria to death, then died in an accident",
 I struck down in red with "both deaths were homicides",
 ...but I could not repel his chain of moves placing Eva as the principal offender."
"But Eva was sleeping in her room the whole time as Hideyoshi cared for her."
"...He put forth the possibility that Hideyoshi was an accomplice, and that the two worked together to create an alibi."
"He even suspects Hideyoshi...?!
 Couldn\'t you have struck back by saying in red that they were in the guest room at the time of the murder?"
"......I also thought of that, but, in any event, several important pieces might have been taken several moves later.
 ...And, because there is a possibility that this move was part of the preparations made by the new {f:5:Beatrice},
 I acted out of respect to her.
 ...My apologies."
"Preparations, you say.
 .........Her mind does seem to be sharp.
 ...Hmm, we can let her do as she likes.
 It will be quite a show to see how far she can go."
"Pukkukukuku.
 I thought you would say that.
 ......I see that your disciple\'s unpleasantness has you in a bad mood."
"That\'s none of your business.
 I wonder how that one plans on destroying this barricade from here on out.
 I shall keep a close eye on her."
"...............Oh, and...
...how was B‐...Battler\'s mood?"
"It appeared as though he had calmed himself down.
 He did say that, after all, he couldn\'t get fired up without you as his opponent."
"R‐really, that\'s no surprise, no surprise at all!
 If I don\'t return for the fourth twilight and after, Battler will probably be lonely himself...!"
"Pu ku ku ku...
 And with that, if you would excuse me.
 ...I must bake some delicious cookies.
 So as to at least enliven the discussion between Milady and Battler‐sama."
"Mmhm!
 That guy really was munching your cookies, wasn\'t he?
 It must be because he\'s a boy that he can eat so much.
 Make a lot of them...!"
"Certainly.
 I shall make enough cookies to bury the table."
"Yes, you do just that!"
"......What\'s going on?
 What did you want to talk about...?"
Kyrie called Rudolf out into the corridor.
 It was obvious that she wanted to talk about something that she didn\'t want the others to hear.
"Umm, I..."
"Yeah?"
".........want to go outside.""......Certainly, the body cannot last with nothing more than a small breakfast, but..."
"Of course, we understand.
 But the thing is, as time passes, it\'ll get darker and darker.
 Now is probably the lightest.
 Now is the most convenient time."
"Only about an hour has passed since Rosa‐san was attacked.
 This is simply too reckless...!"
It was only natural that Natsuhi was yelling about recklessness.
{n}...Because Rudolf had said that he was going to the mansion to get food.
Certainly, they were being tormented by hunger as well as their fatigue.
In the beginning, they were just fine, because they could fight their moderate hunger with their drowsiness;
 but now it just made their minds hazy, and even though it was still only midday, their bodies felt like they were reaching their limits.
The thought of going to the kitchen in the mansion and bringing back some food certainly was attractive.
"I am opposed to this.
 It may be a little tough, but we definitely shouldn\'t leave this place."
"......It is alright for us.
 But it would pain my heart to keep the children hungry...
 I must bear my responsibility as a parent."
"D‐dear...!
 Now that Father has passed away, you are the Ushiromiya family head.
 It is not permissible for you to take on such a danger...!"
".........Yes.
 It\'s like Natsuhi‐san says.
 Krauss‐san, you should remain here as the leader."
"......Then, who will go to the mansion?"
"I think Kyrie and I, and Hideyoshi nii‐san as well, should go.
 Hideyoshi nii‐san and I are holding guns.
 They shouldn\'t be able to lay a hand on us that easily."
"Rosa‐san was also holding a gun, but she was attacked.
 ...Isn\'t it dangerous?"
"...When I went out to check on Rosa and Maria‐chan, I was alone, although I had a gun with me.
 But I wasn\'t attacked.
 ......Maybe they\'ll be cautious if their opponent is a man."
"Two men.
 And even two guns.
 Those two will act as guards, and I\'ll push the cart with the things.
 I believe the situation clearly differs from Rosa‐san\'s."
"If you\'re countin\' me as a man, I\'d be pleased to help.
 I don\'t look it, but I trained this body pullin\' stalls.
 Leave the heavy liftin\' to me!"
"You men just need to devote yourselves to guarding.
 There\'s a folding cart in the servant room, so using that, I should be able to handle carrying the food alone."
"......Of course, we will be careful.
 And if we can succeed in this venture just once,
 we\'ll never again need to take the risk of leaving this place."
"............Is there any way I can get you to reconsider?
 It may be painful for everyone to deal with an empty stomach, ...but even so, we do not know what could happen outside now..."
"We\'ll take care.
 ......And Eva\'s feelin\' pretty darn bad right now.
 I can\'t let her stay hungry.
 If her stomach\'s empty, she can\'t even take her medicine.
 I\'ve gotta go out for Eva\'s sake as well."
"How is Eva?"
"She\'s finally gotten to sleep.
 ...She\'s burnin\' up, too.
 We should leave her be for a while..."
"......I guess you can\'t just stand still when it comes to your wife\'s health...
 .........Understood.
 I\'ll give you permission to go outside."
"Then, we\'ll take a little trip there and back.
 A speed contest.
 Canned food is OK, right?
 You at least have a can opener here, right?"
"Y‐yes.
 We have a can opener and a bottle opener..."
"There\'s running water in the guesthouse, so we won\'t need anything to drink.
 There\'s ten people to cover for, so you\'ll have to take what you get."
"Alright!
 Let\'s dash out there and bring it all back pronto.
 There\'s no time to open umbrellas...!"
"So, Aniki.
 Watch the place for me."
"......Be careful.
 ...Under normal circumstances, I would want to go too.
 ...Being a man, I despise this title of eldest brother that prevents me from lending a hand in an emergency like this."
"This is about the only time we get to show off.
 Sit back and take it easy every once in a while, Aniki.
 Alright, Natsuhi‐san.
 Wait here and get some towels ready or something.
 We aren\'t using umbrellas, so we\'ll be coming back like drowned rats."
"U‐understood.
 ...Take care."
Rudolf, Kyrie, and Hideyoshi,
 each leaving their own brave words behind, left the lobby...
Compared to the time Rosa and Maria had gone outside, the winds had picked up once again.
Rudolf\'s group of three people jogged through the rose garden without umbrellas, holding their guns and a folded cart.
If everything had been still and quiet, without the wind and the rain, they would probably have kept their ears open and moved with caution.
But in this rain, even if some suspicious person was hiding nearby, it would be difficult to notice them.
Because of that, it had been Rudolf\'s plan to instead dash through the dangerous area.
......If there was a chance that their opponent was equipped with a gun,
 then walking slowly with their guard up would only make them a target.
It was probably correct to decide on swift action.
".........The rose garden.
 It feels like we\'re just askin\' to be attacked...!"
"Please, let nobody come out of there..."
Even as Rudolf and Hideyoshi continued to run, they looked around restlessly, vigilant of their surroundings.
Rosa and Maria\'s deaths had not been caused by a projectile.
{n}......However, it was easy to suspect that the servants had been killed in such a manner.
Will they come flying out of the dark?
{n}Or will they take careful aim and snipe from the shadows?
......Either way, they couldn\'t relax their tension for even an instant.
But even so, when they reached the overhang in front of the entrance to the mansion and escaped the reach of the raindrops,
 they felt themselves breathing a sigh of relief.
"No problems for the first part.
 ......It\'s not like how it was for Rosa‐san.
 Maybe they can\'t get their hands on us easily."
"I\'d like to believe that.
 Kyrie, unlock the door while we keep a lookout."
"Sure.
 Returning home to the mansion with a pair of bodyguards makes me feel just like an executive."
"Wahahahaha.
 If we had a welcoming party of servants on a red carpet, it\'d be perfect."
"A welcoming party, huh.
 ...Careful what you wish for.
 Stay alert."
As the two cautiously surveyed their surroundings,
 Kyrie unlocked the front door with the master key she had been given.
"It\'s open."
"Hideyoshi nii‐san.
 Could you take the front?
 I\'ll keep an eye on the rear."
"Roger.
 Kyrie‐san, try not to move from my shadow.
 ......Alright, let\'s break in!"
"Rear guard, understood. Covering...!"
"......Men.
 You\'re enjoying this situation a little bit, aren\'t you?"
"Give it up, that\'s how men are.
 ......But man, there\'s still that rank stench."
...The air in the mansion felt stagnant with a heavy silence.
And worse, it was still thick with the stench from Kinzo\'s burnt corpse in the boiler room,
 and they were struck with a strong desire to leave the mansion—although they were never planning to stay.
"No problems in the front.
 Just a short dash to the kitchen."
"Let\'s finish this quickly and head home.
 This suit\'ll get fumigated with Dad\'s stench."
The three of them dashed towards the kitchen...
And after they disappeared from the entrance hall, ......the new witch showed herself there.
"They were lured out just as planned.
 ......They got caught right in my trap."
The witch grinned.
......Thinking about it now, no matter how unbearable their hunger had grown,
 barely a few hours had passed since Rosa and Maria had been attacked and had lost their lives.
In that case, why had they needed to recklessly leave the guesthouse...?
Until that question could be dealt with, the only answer was that they had been called out by the witch\'s magic...
"What reckless people.
 ......They will never leave this mansion alive.
 Lock yourself, locks! Close yourself, mansion!"
The instant she proclaimed that...
...the mansion was sealed off in a separate world.
......Unless she were to dispel the barrier, no longer could anyone exit this mansion, or enter it.
"......Spectacular.
 To think that even though barely half a day has passed since you succeeded the Endless Witch, you can use magic this well.
 ......That talent surprises me.
 It is almost as though you were born a witch."
"Well, I {i:have} been a witch since the time I was born.
 ......Who taught you how to blink?
 That\'s what using magic is like for me."
".....................
 ...A fearsome person."
The witch\'s face twisted with brutality.
{n}......She was beside herself with excitement at being able to toy with lives again.
"Well then.
 ......Gehehehe{0}hhi{0}hhi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihyahya!
 First is Rudolf and Kyrie, but what cruel way should I kill them...?!"
"......If you would excuse me,
 but the Predecessor has left instructions that you are to restrain yourself from committing murders of unnecessary cruelty.
 And, there is a protocol to follow for the sacrifices from the fourth twilight onwards.
 For that, you must borrow the power of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory."
"......Oh, really?
 Now that you mention it, that\'s right.
 I\'m only allowed to play as I like until the second twilight I just finished.
 ..................Boring.
 Just when I thought I could play to my heart\'s content like I did with Rosa.
 ......But, that refers to the way they\'re killed in the end, right?"
"By which you mean..."
"So I can just kill them however I want over and over again, revive them,
 and follow the epitaph the last time I kill them, right?"
"......So, in the end, no matter how I play, it isn\'t a problem.
 ......Who\'d act well‐behaved with an interesting power like this...?!
 Kuhhihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi!"
Her wild logic was, for an Endless Witch, an extremely valid argument.
{n}The sacrifices for the fourth twilight and onward had prescribed protocols for the method of killing, represented by things like "gouge the head".
However, that referred to the way they died in the end.
In other words, ......in the process leading up to that, she was free to tease and kill them however she wanted.
She just had to keep on reviving them, and follow the rules only when she killed them the final time.
Even while Ronove glimpsed some talent as a witch in her innocent cruelty,
 he was beginning to notice a naturally brutal side of her.
"......They do say that apprentices are the most brutal of witches, and now I see that may be true."
".........Do as you wish, ...is what I would like to say,
 but I must insist that it would be wiser to exercise some restraint in this instance.
 They are holding guns.
 Weapons with a high anti‐magic power, such as guns, are the natural enemies of witches and demons."
The witch stared blankly at this demon butler, who was unexpectedly afraid of guns.
".........No one told me this.
 Shouldn\'t a witch be able to take a bullet like it\'s nothing?"
"No.
 It would be a fatal wound, exactly the same as it would for a normal {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.
 ...To prevent that weak point from being noticed,
 most witches rigorously strengthen their guard with a defense of protective barriers and furniture."
"Do I have any of those protective barrier things?"
"......Constructing a barrier to make even gun bullets ineffective requires much in preparation and rituals.
 I am afraid to say that you currently have none of those, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.
 Furthermore, you are currently ill‐prepared to summon furniture strong enough to block a bullet."
"So even though I\'ve become a Great Witch with this much magical power, I really do have to be afraid of lead bullets.
 .........Annoying, but I\'ll just have to accept it.
 So, in that case, should I call some furniture to act as my arms and legs?"
"Yes.
 Leaving everything to your servants while not exposing yourself to danger is also part of a witch\'s elegant temperance.
 {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, leave this to the furniture and hide in a safe place."
"...............Fine."
"...Seven Sisters of Purgatory.
 I don\'t care who, any two of you...!"
Leviathan and Belphegor responded to that call.
"Leviathan the Envious, right here."
"Belphegor the Slothful, right here."
"Show me your power.
 Your targets are Rudolf and Kyrie.
 Not Hideyoshi.
 ......Now, show me just how cruel you can be, furniture."
"......My apologies,
 but we have received an order from the Predecessor to restrain ourselves from unnecessarily cruel actions."
"Buuut, I think the Predecessor\'s order does give us some leeway to tease them.
 Will that be acceptable?"
"Hmph.
 Fine, I\'ll compromise."
"......You mustn\'t kill them easily.
 Thoroughly corner them and let them taste the fear of death before killing them.
 ......Will that be alright, Ronove?"
"Yes. If you simply remain conscious of the extent, I do not believe there will be a problem."
"...............Then, go!"
""Yes, leave it to us...!""
"Your opponents are armed with guns.
 ...For those as skilled as yourselves, dodging them should be easy,
 ...but if you are hit, it will be fatal.
 Go with an appropriate level of caution."
"Do not worry.
 We won\'t expose such a level of incompetence."
The two Sisters of Purgatory vanished.
{n}After bowing, Ronove also disappeared.
".........There\'s even rules on how to kill them.
 .........Why do I have to be constrained by my predecessor?
 ............It\'s so rigid and boring."
As the witch looked up at the portrait of the Predecessor {f:5:Beatrice} hanging in the hall, she cursed...
The three had already arrived at the kitchen, and were gathering food supplies.
Thinking of the possibility that poison had been mixed in, they gave up on the alluring fruits and vegetables,
 and gathered a whole cardboard box full of only the safe canned foods.
It was very heavy, but by piling it on the cart, they could carry it well enough.
With all of that, there would be plenty for ten people to hold out until tomorrow\'s breakfast.
 That would be enough while they waited for the boat.
The two men were supposed to be devoted to guard duty, but the weight of the load was tough on Kyrie even with the cart.
Hideyoshi, who professed himself strong, switched to being the cart‐pusher, and Rudolf and his wife took up the task of guard duty.
"With all this, even George and the kids will be full.
 We\'re not safe until we\'re home, let\'s go...!"
When Hideyoshi vigorously proclaimed their departure, Kyrie frowned, looking as though she was gazing into the distance.
......There was a wall in that direction.
 ...No, if her gaze could go through that, the hall was beyond it...
".........What is it, Kyrie?"
"...I sense something.
 .........I have a bad feeling about this."
Kyrie stopped, narrowing her eyes even further.
".........Women\'s intuition?"
In times like this, Kyrie\'s intuition surpassed reason.
{n}...Rudolf trusted that intuition.
"Yes.
 Someone\'s probably waiting to ambush us.
 ......I didn\'t sense them until a short while ago.
 ...But just now, I felt it.
 ......Just now, someone...
{i:set up an ambush for us}."
"......Then, there\'s no reason we need to return the way we came.
 There\'s a back door over there, right?
 Let\'s leave that way."
Rudolf made to unlock the back door.
When things were carried into the kitchen, they never passed through the part of the mansion that the family came and went from.
So outside the back door, there was probably a slope for transporting things.
 Surely, they would be able to leave through there with the cart.
"......What is this?
 ...It\'s stuck.
 ...Damn, what\'s going on?"
"Can\'t you open it?"
"Nope.
 Is it broken?
 It isn\'t giving an inch..."
Rudolf tried various things, using force, then coaxing it,
 but the lock was as hard as stone, and didn\'t even budge.
"...Don\'t stress over it, let\'s leave through the front entrance.
 Right now, it\'ll be even worse if we stand around wastin\' time."
".............................."
"......Are you saying this is a trap?"
"...I don\'t know.
 Be careful."
With strained expressions, the three of them returned to the hall again, and headed for the entrance...
"Wh‐......who\'s there?!!"
The instant they exited into the hall, Rudolf noticed a suspicious shadow right in front of them and yelled...
In that instant, a storm of gold leaf started blowing, and gold butterflies dyed the area a golden color.
"............I can\'t believe it.
 A lowly {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} predicted our ambush?"
"I‐it isn\'t my fault.
 I was hiding my presence...!"
"Don\'t hesitate!! FIRE!!!"
The two guns spouted fire.
The lead bullets blasted right through the pair\'s magic defense as easily as though it were a wet paper wall,
 ......but the two who should have been there had disappeared.
Certainly, guns were very frightening objects for them.
...But there was no need to fear as long as they weren\'t hit.
{n}They at least had enough speed to dodge those.
"Wait a sec!
 You won\'t even let us say our names?!
 This is why I hate {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s!"
Leviathan protested, popping her head out from behind a pillar in the shadow of the staircase, a full ten meters from where she had supposedly been.
"By order of {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, we shall now slay you!
 We are ordered to take some time teasing you.
 You are free to resist, but know that it is useless...!"
That voice came from overhead.
{n}Belphegor could be seen on top of the hall chandelier.
{n}Elegantly looking down upon them, she proclaimed their execution with a cruel smile.
"......Wh‐
......who the heck are these girls...?!"
"Forget the cart!!
 We have two opponents, so if we split up, they can\'t chase all of us!"
All three of them were well acquainted with the inside of the mansion.
They had already made plans to run off in separate directions in the case of a crisis, returning to the guesthouse by breaking windows or leaving through a back door.
Fighting was forbidden.
 ......As long as they could get away.
"Hah‐hah‐ha, of the thirty‐six stratagems, fleeing is best...!!"
The three of them escaped into the depths of the mansion at full tilt.
{n}The two furniture calmly watched them go.
"......I\'ll kill the woman.
 You take the man!"
"Understood."
The two pieces of furniture in the shadow of the pillar and on the chandelier burst apart their humanlike forms,
 and, leaving behind only the sound of hopping beetles colliding with the walls, they pursued their respective targets.
Their speed was overwhelming, and they easily blocked the others\' path of retreat.
"............I\'ll inspect their skill as furniture.
 It\'d be nice if they entertained me."
"{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, I might suggest it wise not to show yourself carelessly..."
"A king doesn\'t carelessly wander about the center.
 That\'s part of a king\'s—
a witch\'s dignity!"
In front of Rudolf, who had boldly tried to escape to the second floor, Belphegor was already standing in the way.
"It\'s useless to try and resist or escape.
 ......You don\'t need to think about anything.
 Just close your eyes.
 I\'ll bring everything to a gentle finish."
"You\'d make a good wife.
 Your husband would be pleased to hear that kind of thing when he comes home tired."
"To think that you\'re still relaxed enough to speak such vulgarity at a time like this...!"
"{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, thank you for such good prey!
 Die!!!"
Rudolf fired first.
But even before that bullet could hit her, Belphegor had already moved behind Rudolf\'s back.
There she stood, her arm raised above her, a purple trail extending from it...
However, even before that arm could decapitate Rudolf, unbelievably, Rudolf had swung his gun behind him.
The barrel pointed behind his back, from the same motion with which he had reloaded the sawed‐off gun one‐handedly.
It was pointing right at Belphegor\'s chest...
Takk, clunk‐rrrr...!
 It was the sound of the ejected empty cartridge finally hitting the wall after the reload.
In other words, it meant that the next shot was already fully loaded.
Without turning around, his gun pointing right at Belphegor\'s chest, Rudolf grinned.
".........Not bad.........
 ...For a middle‐aged man...!!"
"Don\'t look down on the generation that loves westerns, got it?
 Brats don\'t know jack squat about the refinement of a lever‐action."
Just like Rudolf, Kyrie was also confronting a demon stake, in the first floor corridor.
"What an idiot you are.
 You should have just escaped with your husband.
 You do know that that was your final farewell just now, right...?
 *giggle*giggle*giggle*!"
"Don\'t worry.
 This kind of thing is my husband\'s specialty.
 I\'m sure he\'ll come for me on a white horse soon."
"Because he\'s never failed to come and save me when I\'m in trouble.
 ......Not even when Asumu‐san was around, you see?
 Heheh."
"Heheheheheheheh!
 What a happy couple.
 I envy you.
 .........I am Leviathan the Envious...!
 Envy is itself my power.
 My anger, my origin!"
"I agree.
 Envy is the source of a woman\'s power.
 ...And if you call something like that power, I won\'t lose to a girl like you."
"Hahhahahahahahahahaha!
 Imagine saying that to the one who governs envy!
 You actually think I\'d let you two be reunited...?!!"
"Ahhahahahaha, I\'ll give you a tragic farewell!!"
The arm Leviathan swung trailed purple.
{n}It was a magic blade that cut by the power of malice.
Kyrie guarded herself against that with her gun.
......Even though the magic blade should have been able to cut through metal like butter, the {i:gun}, with its extremely high magic resistance,
 was able to block the blade as easily as if it were a rolled up newspaper.
Rapidly, two times, three times.
 It blocked all of them.
And, without missing the opening created when that purple trail took a long swing upward,
 Kyrie kicked Leviathan in the stomach with her heel.
Almost like she was a lightly dancing feather, Leviathan was knocked away.
...Before the demon stake\'s feet touched ground again...
Kyrie had already perfectly captured Leviathan, who was in midair, down the barrel of her gun.
From midair, the two women who had spoken to each other of envy as power met each other\'s gaze.
"......C‐can you pull it?
 That trigger...!!"
"You know, I can be pretty brutal when my husband isn\'t around."
"Whoawhoaoaoaoao!!"
Rudolf tumbled down the staircase.
 He had been gradually chased down by Belphegor, and had been pushed back into the original hall.
".........The Predecessor\'s furniture is pretty good.
 She\'s lacking in flair, though!"
"{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama...!
 It isn\'t over yet, it\'s dangerous to show yourself...!"
"........................Could you...
...possibly be...Aneki?"
"That used to be my name.
 But not now, Rudolf."
"You don\'t have to tell me.
 You\'re going to say you\'re the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}, right?"
"Ehheheheheh, ahhahahahaha!
 How did you know?"
"......Since the time Rosa was killed, I had a general idea."
".........Rosa, forgive me.
 Forgive me for sending the sister you hated down to your hell...!!"
"{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, look out!!!"
Rudolf pointed the unforgiving barrel of his gun at the witch who claimed to have once been his sister.
{n}But Belphegor could not permit that, and savagely attacked.
She sprung at him, vanished, and got behind him.
If he dodged that attack, she got behind him again.
She vanished over and over, each time teleporting into Rudolf\'s blind spot.
It was almost like she was a fairy.
 As she blinked in and out of vision, Belphegor incessantly drove towards Rudolf.
"This might be kinda fun in its own way.
 Rudolf, let me leisurely watch and see how long your brave efforts last you.
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"
Then, a dull tearing sound and Rudolf\'s cry of anguish intermingled.
Rudolf had finally reacted too slowly in his dance with the purple trail which pressed upon him,
 and he had let it lightly cut him on his side.
A single wound delayed a single one of his actions.
That caused a new wound, which delayed him from acting again.
Belphegor\'s dance began to swallow Rudolf whole...
Watching Rudolf\'s body gradually get carved up, his former sister let out a shrill laugh.
Leviathan could no longer hide her irritation that Kyrie was absolutely refusing to allow her to deliver a fatal wound.
".........I really am dense.
 ...Among the Seven Sisters, I was always the slowest to grow.
 I was always slow, always weak, always stupid."
"......That inferiority complex became envy,
 and when I converted that into power, I gained a strength greater than that of any of the other sisters."
"It\'s important to have a moderate inferiority complex when you\'re a girl.
 It teaches women about cosmetics and hard work."
"I don\'t like using the limits of my power against mere {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s.
 ......But I will turn my envy of your ability to completely trust your husband into power."
"......I don\'t like it.
 Why are you so relaxed when you\'re fighting for your life?"
"......*giggle*.
 I wonder?"
"............I get it.
 You fully believe that your husband will definitely come to rescue you and will save you.
 .........Isn\'t it incredible, that trust of yours.
 It\'s worthy of my envy."
What kind of trust do we sisters have in each other?
We sisters are always looking down on each other, trying to thoroughly lambast each other and turn things from bad to worse...!
"I\'ve always been bullied by my sisters.
 I\'ve always wanted just one of them to become my ally."
"......So since you have that single ally,
 who you can place complete trust in, I feel the strongest envy towards you..."
"............Aaah, that composed expression of total belief in your husband...!
 I can feel my envy giving me power...!!
 .........I might even exceed it.
 The speed of sound!!!"
Leviathan turned herself into a stake, and the speed of her flight as she attacked was proportional to the strength of her envy.
"On that day when my sisters looked down on me,
 I was jealous from the bottom of my heart of the other six, who had grown quickly!
 I was jealous for seven days and seven nights!!
 Behold the power and speed I ultimately gained...!!
 Die, Ushiromiya Kyrieee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}eeee!!!"
The demon stake exposed her true form, leaping about at a terrible speed.
 The noise from her colliding with and bouncing off the walls sounded like a machine gun.
By now, Kyrie probably couldn\'t tell whether it was a single stake or a swarm of beetles flying and bouncing around.
Leviathan was certain of a greater than 100% chance of victory, from the bottom of her heart...!
Then, Kyrie spoke with an unbelievably calm voice.
".........I was the one who had been going out with Rudolf‐san from the very beginning.
 ......Asumu‐san shamelessly cut in between us,
 ...and calculatingly got herself pregnant."
"......I don\'t blame Rudolf‐san.
 That woman manipulated him using her body as a weapon,
 and cornered him into a situation where he was forced to become engaged to her."
Asumu‐san was carrying Battler‐kun.
And at the same time, I was also carrying a boy.
...As fate would have it, our delivery dates were on the same day.
"And Asumu‐san gave birth to Battler‐kun.
 ...But I was not so lucky.
 .........There\'s something I\'ve thought about.
 What if Asumu‐san had been the unlucky one, and I had been the one to give birth?"
"......Would Rudolf‐san have broken off his engagement and married me?
 ......But I couldn\'t birth a child.
 So until Asumu‐san died,
 and until I got pregnant with Ange, I cursed Asumu‐san, and was jealous of her."
Asumu‐san should just die.
And then I want him to remarry, with me... In my envy, I kept cursing her like that, over and over, until Asumu‐san finally died.
I became certain.
I became certain that I possessed the power of magic, and that it had become a curse which had killed Asumu‐san.
But that did not quell the flames of my envy.
Don\'t tell anyone, alright?
Every time I look at Battler‐kun, I remember that woman.
And every time I look at Battler‐kun,
 ...I think that if only my child had been born, he would be the same age.
I am still jealous of her, tormented by her.
Now, and forever.
 For all eternity.
"You say that you were jealous of your sisters for seven days and seven nights...?"
"Th‐......that\'s right..."
Don\'t make me laugh, you little brat.
".........How could you understand the madness of a woman...
whose man was stolen from her, and who has burned with envy for eighteen years...!!"
"U‐......uoawa{0}aaa{0}aAAa{0}a{0}aaAA{0}AAHHH!!!!"
If Leviathan\'s power had 24 hours × 7 days, or 168 hours\' worth of speed...
Then the power that Kyrie had accumulated...
was 24 hours in 1 day,
 365 days in 1 year,
 and for 18 whole years......
Even without counting leap years,
 it was 157,680 hours.
...Compared to Leviathan\'s power and speed,
 it was more than 938 times greater.
So then, even if Leviathan was soaring at the speed of sound, {nobreak:1,225 km/h},
 ......to Kyrie\'s eyes, it only looked like...
1/938 of that.
So then, so then, 1225÷938 is...
.........a speed of...
1.30 km/h.
...They say that a human\'s walking speed is 4 km/h, so it was even less than half of that.
 Almost the same speed as a baby crawling on the floor.
So then, so then, so then...!
In unit time slowed so much you could count all the bits of dust floating through the air,
 Kyrie looked at the demon stake with pity.
She pitied the slowness at which it came towards her.
And she lazily raised the barrel of her gun.
{n}Almost as though she was trying to swallow the demon stake up with the gun barrel.
"You\'re completely lacking in both love and envy."
"......Come back when you\'re older, darling."
"Rudolf, what happened to all that vigor from a couple seconds ago?
 {ruby:Sliced live fish:Ikezukuri} is best served while it\'s still twitching.
 After it dies, it isn\'t interesting in the slightest.
 That\'s enough.
 Why not kill him now and forever?!"
".........kh, ......damn it......"
"I\'m surprised you managed to endure this long after being carved up."
"......That\'s enough.
 You don\'t need to think about anything more.
 I\'ll steal your life away painlessly...!"
"Wait... Do me a favor.
 In the very end, I want to do one of those..."
"......What do you mean, one of those?"
"One of those things that westerns made famous.
 That thing where we put our backs together, walk three steps, and then {i:bang}."
"............Ah, a duel.
 Very well.
 If that will satisfy your regrets in this world, I\'ll accept."
Rudolf raised his wound‐covered body, and turned his back to her.
Belphegor responded, and faced her back to his.
...Belphegor had a sense of integrity that was uncommon in a witch\'s furniture.
"Let me warn you.
 Even if you press the barrel of your gun between my eyebrows,
 I can teleport even faster than you could pull the trigger and have the bullet reach my skull."
"......Yeah, I\'m already feeling that throughout my body.
 ...You are faster than a bullet."
"I have agreed to this out of respect for your courage in challenging me to a duel despite that knowledge.
 Thank me."
"......You are a person of integrity.
 And a good woman.
 You might just steal my heart away."
"Let\'s get this started.
 Three steps is fine?"
".........First, one step."
"......Two steps."
"......Three steps.
 Is that alright?"
"Yep.
 ......And, since you still haven\'t noticed after walking three whole steps,
 ......looks like I win, girl."
"Whaaat......?"
"...........................Ah...h...!"
Rudolf turned around and fired off a bullet.
......Of course, Belphegor could easily see through the speed and trajectory of a bullet like that.
It should have been no problem at all to dodge it.
But a spray of fresh blood flew about.
......Belphegor had set up an adequate magical defensive barrier.
But before an incarnation of anti‐magic power such as that bullet, it was completely meaningless.
".........What are you doing?
 Why\'d you get hit...?!"
The bullet had hit Belphegor right in the chest.
 ...The pain from the lead caused her to grimace, as did as the pain from the denial of magic...
"......Forgive me.
 I\'m a coward of a man."
"..................ku‐
...............u..."
"Wh‐...What a mood‐killer.
 To think that someone who is furniture to a witch could be defeated by a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}...!"
"Know your shame.
 Worthless, pathetic...!
 Why don\'t you just stay sprawled there and die forever?!"
".........Quit it, Aneki.
 ...This girl could have dodged it.
 But she didn\'t."
"......She realized that you were in the line of fire.
 So this girl of integrity took it without dodging, and guarded you.
 In the very end, she noticed that I was forking the rook and the king."
"Spe‐.........spectacular............"
"Don\'t think badly of me.
 ...I\'d planned to accept my fate if you realized while you were taking those three steps."
"............Those three steps...
were out of...
consideration for me, then...
 .........I didn\'t even try to think about it.
 ......I...
...was la...
zy........."
"......You were a good woman.
 Go to heaven before me and do your makeup.
 I\'ll definitely come and talk you up."
As Belphegor slowly fell over, ...she lost even the power that kept her in a human form,
 and she turned as fine as gold dust, and melted into thin air...
At that point, Kyrie dashed in.
{n}It seemed that she had defeated her pursuer with her own hands.
As she pointed the barrel of her gun straight at the witch, she ran up to the wound‐covered Rudolf.
"......Are you alright?
 Were you talking someone up just now?"
"Yep, a fine woman.
 ...No match for you, of course."
"............Sorry, Aneki.
 It\'s checkmate."
The two of them pinned the witch down the barrels of their guns.
"............Worthless furniture.
 ...I can\'t believe they were beaten by {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} opponents.
 ...Worthless.
 Stupid.
 ...Boring...!"
"{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, we should retreat from this place.
 ......There is no furniture or barrier to guard against bullets here."
"Eheheheh,
 ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!"
The witch began to let out a muffled laugh.
...It surprised not only Rudolf and Kyrie, but Ronove as well.
.........Because a situation like this, with two guns pointed at her,
 was not one that could just be laughed off, even by a witch.
But the witch laughed with pleasure.
".........Well, it\'s only natural that it\'d be impossible for the Predecessor\'s worn out furniture.
 ......I have to have new furniture, suitable for me.
 I used them out of obligation,
 ......but I\'ve always hated hand‐me‐downs."
As she said that, she looked down at Belphegor\'s remains, which had turned completely into a pile of gold dust, with disgust.
"I don\'t know what you\'re talking about.
 Now put your damn hands up."
...Then, the witch obediently raised her hands.
But instead of raising her hands because a gun was being pointed at her,
 it looked more like she was a conductor facing an orchestra, waving her conductor\'s baton.
"Come, arise, furniture suitable for me...!!
 Not that cheap furniture, much much stronger ones!
 Cruel ones!!
 Ahhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahyahhyahhya!!!"
"No funny stuff...!
 I\'ll pull the trigger...!"
In response to the witch\'s call, the hall was once again buried in the color of gold.
It was a wild dance of brilliantly radiant gold butterflies,
 ...and felt as though they had been swallowed up by an ocean of gold leaf.
Ronove was left shocked at that upsurge in magic power...
{n}That was because it far surpassed even that of his former master.
As their eyes were dazzled amidst the golden brilliance, a gunshot could be heard.
{n}Either Rudolf or Kyrie had fired a round.
......And after the golden glow had subsided, there was the witch, looking at least cool and composed.
The bullet?
 Kyrie had definitely fired it into her.
But it was not embedded anywhere in the witch\'s body.
There it was.
 ...The bullet was fastened in midair right in front of the witch\'s chest.
"A, ......a bullet‐proof barrier........."
A barrier which took even her predecessor a significant amount of preparation...in an instant...
{n}Ronove\'s face was by now twisted in shock.
{n}And the surprise did not stop there......
The group of gold butterflies created two humanoid forms.
......It was a furniture summoning.
The butterflies peeled off and flew away, and beneath them, furniture in the shape of girls showed themselves.
"..................The Chiester Sisters troops...
 .........Even the Predecessor...
...wasn\'t able to summon the Pendragon\'s Memorial Troops on a moment\'s notice, and so easily...!"
"Chiester{ruby:four‐one‐zero:410}. Right here."
"Chiester{ruby:forty‐five:45}. Right here."
"...You two {i:are} suitable furniture for me, right?"
"From reading you a picture book, to going on a friendship date, to shooting down a meteorite,
 we\'ll take care of anything. Nihihi."
"I‐if we don\'t take care of it, the Dragon King will get mad at us...!
 Please, your orders, Great Lady {f:5:Beatrice}!"
".........Rudolf‐san.
 Let\'s run.
 These guys are no good......!"
"S‐.........sure!"
Thanks to the same feeling that had alerted her to the ambush by the Seven Sisters of Purgatory,
 Kyrie clearly heard warning sirens going off in her head, almost resembling screams.
Without hesitation, they ran.
As the witch elegantly watched them leave, she ordered her new furniture.
"...This is an order.
 Kill the two who ran away.
 Then bring the corpses back here.
 Then I\'ll bring them back to life, and play with them over and over.
 ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"
The witch\'s expression twisted with an evil smile.
Even though she feared that expression, Lucifer appeared and spoke.
"M‐...my apologies.
 ...The Predecessor said to avoid brutal actions of that—"
When the witch stared at her with those terrifying eyes, Lucifer was struck dumb.
...She was unsatisfied.
 She was bored, of not being able to let her own power and her own cruelty run wild.
......Irritated by her predecessor\'s furniture telling her to act with restraint, her discontent was at its peak.
"Oh, it\'s Lucifer‐chan the Proud.
 Long time no see nyeh, how ya doin\'?
 Let\'s play together again sometime.
 Nihhihihihihihi!"
"F‐...410, you mustn\'t chat, you\'ll get in trouble...!
 Let us carry out the great Lady {f:5:Beatrice}\'s order at once...!"
"Nihi.
 Looks like we\'re on the job right now nyeh."
"......410, understood.
 Preparing for sniping pursuit combat."
"Collecting terrain data, collecting firing data.
 Data link to 410."
"410, data received.
 Target acquired.
 Correcting for terrain.
 Forming firing curve, control points adjusted.
 Data link to 45."
"45, data received.
 Checking danger zone, ......ah, not there!"
"You\'re in the way behind us, Lucifer‐chan,
 you\'ll get roasted in the backfire, you know? Nihi!"
".........nh..."
The Chiester sisters, through their mutual measurements,
 were able to instantly calculate the terrain inside the mansion and the coordinates of their targets, as well as a firing curve to reach them.
...Yes, their shots could be guided to draw a curved line.
{n}No one would be able to escape it.
The precision homing ability of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory was nothing more than a cheap version of the ability these two held.
"45, firing preparations complete.
 Ammo selected, now loading."
The two of them faced each other,
 and, as though they were both pulling back a bowstring together,
 ...there, a dazzling golden arrow was readied.
"410, nihi.
 Firing."
After they proclaimed that they were firing, together, they released a single arrow.
As the curve taken by the gold‐sparkling snake of light drew a trail,
 it headed in the direction Rudolf and Kyrie had run, in rapid pursuit.
It turned through the corridors, crawled over the floor, chasing them as it drew a beautiful curve.
No one could block the Chiester Sisters\' homing projectiles.
 No one could escape them.
 And their strength could pierce all physical and magical defenses.
......It was an all‐too‐merciless guided weapon of certain death.
However, among mythical‐class soldiers, it was a weapon used by pretty much everyone.
 It was very commonplace for them, ...and very extraordinary for those of the everyday world.
"Wh‐what the...?!"
When he noticed something rapidly chasing them, and turned around...
Rudolf was shot straight through the location of his heart by the gold snake.
 It all happened in an instant.
"R‐Rudolf‐san......?!"
After the gold snake ran Rudolf through,
 it swooped down to the floor, drawing a beautiful spiral, coiled itself around Kyrie\'s legs, and crawled up to her chest.
And just like Rudolf, it shot straight through the location of her heart.
...And all of that, too, happened in an instant.
{n}It impaled Rudolf, and it impaled Kyrie.
So they died at almost the same time, dropped to their knees at the same time, and fell over at the same time.
"......What is thiiis?
 So overwhelming, ahhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!
 That was ridiculously easy, wasn\'t it?
 Kuhhihihya{0}hya{0}hya{0}hyahya!
 This is the kind of furniture I need.
 Way different from my predecessor\'s second‐hand furniture!"
"Come on, bring their corpses here.
 I\'ll keep reviving them until I\'m bored, and try killing them in the most brutal ways I can think of.
 Aaah, to think that being a witch could be so much fun,
 that taking a life could be so much fun, ahhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!"
......The most shunned action to take for someone born a human is the murder of another human.
It\'s only natural for a human not to understand how pleasurable it is to break this taboo.
......But she was no longer a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.
{n}She was a witch.
...And there were some pleasures that only witches could understand.
By now, she had tasted those pleasures, and was totally immersed in them.
...After learning that the contents of the forbidden pot were honey, she could no longer live without it.
......No, maybe the contents were honey because they were forbidden.
In any case, the act of killing {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s gruesomely,
 and doing it over and over, was by now giving her a drug‐like pleasure.
As the witch rolled over laughing,
 the gold snake which had just been fired returned as though being hauled back in.
The two were stitched at the tip and being dragged along.
The witch\'s order had been carried out.
...Rudolf and Kyrie had been killed instantly, and their bodies had been carried back.
"Chiester45, 410, execution of orders completed.
 We await your next order, Great Lady {f:5:Beatrice}.
 Please, your order...!"
"From babysitting, to playing you in online multiplayer,
 to shooting down a space shuttle, we\'ll take care of everything.
 Nihihi!"
"............These two are apparently the sacrifices for the fourth twilight and the fifth twilight.
 So in the end, I need those worthless Seven Sisters,
 ...oh, I guess they\'re the Five Sisters now.
 I need those girls to pierce and gouge the forehead and the chest."
"......But I can do that at the very end, and I\'m free to play in any way until then, right?
 Eheheh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eheh!"
"Wait wait wait waait.
 ...Have you already forgotten what I told you?!"
"Oh, it\'s you, Predecessor‐sama.
 Do you have any complaints?"
"Of course I do...!
 You are doing as you please, are you not?!
 Why can\'t you follow my directions?!"
"What\'s wrong with doing as I please, Predecessor‐sama?
 And I haven\'t got the slightest desire to deviate from the rules of the ritual."
"I\'ll make sure to clean these two corpses up later, and drive stakes into their forehead and chest."
"I, I\'m telling you, that is not the problem...!
 If you act so undignified and cruel, uh,
 ...umm, some people might take it badly..."
"..............................
 ......You mean, your opponent in that game, who I heard you were fighting with somewhere?
 Ronove told me."
"......C‐curse that blabbermouth.
 .........Well, to be perfectly honest, that\'s how it is.
 I had a complaint that, um,
 ...it is a little too much, you see?"
"It\'s not like there\'s any need for them to tell you to pass it on instead of objecting directly to me.
 ...That person is a coward."
".........Well, that person is a resident of, uh, a different world from this one, you see.
 There\'s no choice but to use me as an intermediary.
 Well, anyway, the point is—"
"........................
 ......Which means that this person can\'t interact with me even if they wanted to.
 And I can\'t interact with them even if I wanted to either.
 Am I correct to understand this as an unrelated person from a world that far away?"
"M‐mm.
 ......By analogy, perhaps you could say these worlds are like two very close parallel lines.
 The worlds are very nearby, but since they are parallel lines, they will never cross.
 For the time being, you may view that world in such a manner."
"They never cross.
 Which means...
.........that world has nothing to do with me.
 ...If you\'re telling me on behalf of that person to show some restraint, please pass this message on to them."
"A message?
 What should I say...?"
"It\'s none of your business, so screw off, you old hag.
 Why don\'t you just give up and die forever...?"
"..................Wha—"
"...Oh, I\'m sorry.
 Since it was a friend of yours, I just imagined that she\'d be a woman.
 By "old hag", I\'m definitely not talking about youuu, Predecessor‐sama, so please forgive me.
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!"
When she spoke, the witch was looking straight into Beato\'s eyes.
{n}...Anyone in that place would be able to figure it out just by looking.
"............Predecessor‐sama.
 There is something I find very strange.
 ...Why do you have to play a game with that person from another world,
 and have them accept that you are a witch?"
"Well, about that,
 ...that is because making all humans accept the existence of witches is related to perfect control.
 There was a single holdout, you see, and he just won\'t accept me as a witch."
".........Why is it that you need that {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}\'s approval?
 Witches are witches, and they use magic; why do you need a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}\'s acknowledgement for this?"
"...Mh, .........well, like I said earlier, that which is called magic is—"
"I am a witch.
 I can use magic without anyone\'s approval in particular, so what\'s your point......?"
"In this world, right?
 However, since he will not accept it, umm,
 ...hmmmm, how should I explain it..."
"......I don\'t need an explanation.
 After all, isn\'t this all about a different world that never crosses this one?
 In other words, it\'s just as though that world doesn\'t exist."
"...............Whether you\'re fighting in a game in another world, or talking about your delusions, that doesn\'t change aaanything.
 ......I\'ll say it again.
 It has nothing to do with me.
 And I am already a witch."
"Predecessor‐sama, somehow or another, it seems that you can\'t become a witch as long as this person doesn\'t accept you, but I\'m different.
 Even though no one has accepted me, I am already an excellent witch.
 .........Since you are my predecessor, I will formally pay you respect,
 but that is out of good will, not out of duty."
"......I do not seek your advice anymore,
 and I understand clearly what I should do now and how I should play from now on."
".........So I will carry out the ceremonial murder of the thirteen people as a final act of respect for you.
 However, as for the methods I use,
 and what I do after that, there is absolutely no reason I should be lectured by you on those.
 ..................Therefore, I\'ll be counting on you in that regard."
At a glance, those words seemed obedient, but they contained within them a clear parting of ways.
...They were saying, as clear as could be,
 "I have no more reason to rely on you, so don\'t get in the way of my fun".
Beato understood that,
 ...and was dejected, realizing that no matter how she explained it, she wouldn\'t be able to make the witch understand.
"...I, ............I see...
 Then it is no longer my problem...
 Go and learn first‐hand how magic ceases to exist when you lose your feelings of respect for it."
"......That carefree rampage of yours up until now,
 I would dearly like to hear how it can be called respect."
After hearing that, Beato could not respond.
 ......Because she remembered hearing exactly the same thing from her master.
"So.
 Chiester Sisters?
 My predecessor is just leaving, please see her off."
"Nihihihihi.
 Predecessor‐sama, please retire from this place."
"I‐if you don\'t, we\'ll be scolded...!"
Throughout her body, Beato felt something invisible in the Chiester Sisters\' eyes which could only be described as an oppressive feeling.
......Most likely, they were initiating firing calculations.
{n}It was an action much like taking out a gun and cocking it.
Even Beato could not escape from the Chiester Sisters\' attacks without any preparation.
...In the past, she had placed her greatest trust in them, so she knew down to her very soul how terrifying they were.
".........Predecessor‐sama, if you would retire.
 .........I would not recommend damaging {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama\'s mood any further."
"......Predecessor‐sama..."
"A‐.........alright.
 ...I shall now take my leave.
 ......I shall take my time appreciating the circumstances you will put yourself in!"
That was as close as you could get to a loser\'s last retort.
...So after Beato hid herself, the witch and her furniture fell over laughing...
"............Well, I understand.
 Endless power is fun.
 ...The joy of freely toying with a life, the epitome of finite things, cannot be explained to those who have not tasted it.
 ......I can understand the feeling of being possessed with that pleasure."
"......It must have been quite fun.
 Judging from your antics in the past."
"Are you saying it is like how you used to admonish me in the past, Master, and I did not listen...?"
".........Why is it that you have started trying to scold that child for her actions?"
"Mh, ......umm, well.
 ........................"
"...There is a single large difference between you and that child.
 That child may already be a witch.
 Of course, you are also a witch.
 In the world on top of the game board."
"......However, to be accepted as a witch outside the game board,
 you need to have your opponent in this game, Battler‐kun, accept you.
 ......You must have understood that when you started the game."
"......I thought that if I could show off a whirlwind of proof that I am a witch,
 blow away his feelings that made him deny me, and break him completely,
 .........he would accept me as a witch.
 ...It all went my way last time, so I thought I was just a breath away..."
"It\'s actually the opposite.
 Battler‐kun was shocked by your brutality.
 And the reason he stepped up as your opponent was not because he accepted you as an equal opponent.
 It was based on a strong animosity, as he tried to completely deny the existence of a brutal witch."
".........In your foolishness, you probably felt that Battler‐kun considering himself as your opponent...
was a first step towards making him accept that you are a witch.
 However, it was actually the exact opposite."
"Battler‐kun challenged you in this game because he definitely would not accept you as a witch.
 ......No matter how much the thoughtless north wind blew, the traveler only wore his cloak even tighter.
 You were committing a huge error from the very beginning."
"............This game is not torture to break Battler‐kun.
 It is a test, in which you must work hard to make Battler‐kun accept you."
"...............
 ...I,
 ......I vaguely, you know,
 ...realized that..."
"Last time, it was a tough game for Battler‐kun.
 But it seems that you\'ve already noticed.
 ......This time, the game is tough for you."
"Wh‐...what should I do from now on?"
"Think about it yourself.
 ......Fortunately, you have already abandoned being a piece on the game board, and relegated things to the new witch.
 You should have time to deliberately ponder upon yourself."
"............But Battler\'s already a big ball of hostility.
 He won\'t accept witches, and he won\'t accept me.
 ......In that case, how do I make Battler accept me, then...?
 Are you saying that if the north wind doesn\'t work, ...then I should shine on him as the sun from now on...?
 {i:I} should, after all this time......?"
"It is October now.
 The Halloween season.
 .........It is the month of rebirth, when the sun dies and is revived again.
 When the sun is weak right after reviving, it may pale in comparison to the cold winter winds."
"However, it slowly grows, and is eventually able to hail the coming of spring.
 ...At that time, the traveler may even fold up his cloak."
".........So you say...
...that I am mistaken........."
...The beautiful hall of the Ushiromiya mansion was covered in a glow golden like gold leaf,
 ...and stained deep red with thick spurts of blood.
The number of deaths given to Rudolf and Kyrie had long surpassed anything you could count on both your fingers and your toes.
The witch was breathing so hard her shoulders shook, but it wasn\'t because she was tired.
{n}...She just couldn\'t hide the ragged breathing caused by her still uncontainable excitement.
"Ahhahahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!
 How fun it is to do as I will with the life and death of people!
 Before the power of the Endless Witch, every one of the infinities I paint with my mind becomes reality!"
"No matter how {i:sloppily} I {i:mash} them,
 I can revive them, returning them to normal with just a snap of my fingers."
"Because in the end, I just have to return the corpses to normal and make a token show of following the epitaph.
 Ahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"
"......Hey, you guys,
 have you ever sliced a stuffed animal\'s stomach open?"
"Never, nihi.
 What about you, 45?"
"N‐no...!
 I have never done it, my apologies...!"
"Of course not.
 Normally, you wouldn\'t.
 ......Especially not if it was a stuffed animal you liked.
 But I\'ve always thought about it."
"I wondered what was packed inside this fluffy stuffed animal that I loved so much,
 and always thought I\'d like to peek inside one day."
If you cut it and looked inside, your curiosity might be quelled, but the stuffed animal would be broken.
......So even though you want to see, you can\'t.
{n}You understand that feeling, right?
"......The power of the Endless Witch can grant exactly that wish.
 ...As I am now, I can slice the stuffed animal all I want."
"......And yet, with a bit of magic, I can revive it back to normal.
 ...In other words, it means that I have broken all limitations in this world.
 ......As I am now, I don\'t have to hesitate, refrain, or anything of the sort."
"That joy, ......aah, there\'s probably no one who can understand it.
 No one other than me, the Endless Witch!!"
As the witch let out a euphoric cry, she revived Rudolf and Kyrie again,
 and faster than they could realize it, she killed them right away.
......As she made it known that something other than cotton was stuffed inside those two.
"...G‐
............give it a rest, Eva......!"
"Huh?
 ......Ah, you.
 You\'re here."
In that hall of tragedy, Hideyoshi showed himself, his gun readied.
The witch had sealed the mansion with a barrier, so Hideyoshi had nowhere to run.
...He had probably picked up Rudolf\'s or Kyrie\'s gun, and come back.
It seemed that the gun, which should have been something to be feared, was no longer an object she took seriously now that she was overflowing with magic power.
Her bold expression didn\'t flinch in the slightest.
".........Why\'d you have to kill Rosa‐san and Maria‐chan,
 ......and Rudolf‐kun and Kyrie‐san......?!"
"Huh?
 I am the head of the Ushiromiya family, and the witch of Rokkenjima.
 I am free to start whatever I like on this island.
 ...Just isolating this one instant and asking about their life and death within it is meaningless to me."
Hideyoshi was struck speechless by that all‐too‐callous response from the witch.
 Could someone\'s personality change so much just by finding Kinzo\'s gold......?
"Just how high was that gold piled?
 I can\'t even imagine it.
 It must have been enough to make you lose your sanity..."
"......Still, if there was that much gold,
 ......why didn\'t you think of graciously splittin\' it up...?!!"
"You misunderstand.
 ............All of that belongs to the Golden Witch.
 No one is qualified to touch it except for me.
 *giggle*giggle*giggle*, ahhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!!"
"......What are you?
 Are you tryin\' to say you\'re that thing Eva told me about long ago......the witch Eva from when she was young?"
"That\'s right.
 I am me in my youth, who was always living in the heart of your wife, Ushiromiya Eva.
 ...And I\'m a witch.
 .........Eva became an adult by forgetting me.
 So she can\'t use magic."
"...Everyone fills their head sometimes with innocent yet cruel fantasies, as kids.
 Even me, when I was young, I\'d sometimes go around steppin\' on ants and pullin\' the wings off dragonflies.
 .........But you learn the importance of life, and grow out of that cruel childhood age."
"......Right now, you really are a child, y\'know!
 ...A personality that Eva should have outgrown!
 That\'s not Eva.
 It\'s a different human!!"
"That\'s right.
 I am not Ushiromiya Eva.
 I\'m the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}."
"It\'s so fun, not being bounded by any limitations, and the pleasure of being able to do as I will with life and death is truly wonderful...!
 I don\'t have to apologize for breaking the goldfish bowl,
 and I can tear the stuffed animal as much as I want!
 I—"
A dry sound.
...It was the sound of Hideyoshi slapping the witch\'s face.
By looking at the hall stained deep red with fresh blood, he should have been able to imagine how terrible the witch was.
But without fear, without even hesitating, Hideyoshi had walked determinedly up to her, and hit her on the cheek.
"....................."
"You dolt!!
 Don\'t act like you\'re cruel, not when you\'re really a coward and a weaklin\'!
 I\'ll keep you on the straight and narrow, you wicked woman!!
 You dumbo!
 Nitwit!!"
"Ow,
 ......ouch,
 ...hey...!"
"You used to be a woman who understood how important, how fragile a life is!
 I\'ll knock some sense back into you...!!
 What\'s all this about witches, what a load of crock!!"
"You\'re my wife, Ushiromiya Eva!
 A witch of the kitchen, thoughtfully whippin\' up snacks from leftovers in the fridge, that\'s the only witch you are!!
 Open your eyes, you blunderin\' dolt...!!"
"Didn\'t I just say...
that I\'m not Ushiromiya Eva......?!"
"That\'s horsecrap!!
 You!
 You!!"
As tears dripped down his face, Hideyoshi kept hitting the witch\'s head.
He wasn\'t even pointing the gun at her anymore.
So.
 That sound of gunfire couldn\'t have come from the gun Hideyoshi was holding.
......The gun, which had fallen in the corner near Rudolf\'s body, was floating in the air,
 ...and smoke lingered near the barrel.
And the bullet?
 .........A red stain was slowly spreading across the chest of Hideyoshi\'s vest.
Even though his back was facing the barrel of the gun, ...the bullet was embedded in Hideyoshi\'s chest.
".........E...
va............
 ............uu..."
"...I told you, I\'m not Eva.
 What a stupid, annoying man."
"......You\'re a pain, so I\'ll switch the sacrifice for the sixth twilight to you.
 ...If you\'d just stayed hidden under a bed quivering or something, I\'d planned to let you go.
 ......You deliberately came back.
 You really are a stupid man."
Thunk...
 There was a dull sound as Hideyoshi fell to the floor.
Even though he would be able to escape his pain by dying, he resisted that until the last second,
 and staring straight into the witch\'s eyes, ...he passed away.
Because he had died without closing his eyes, for a short while, the witch didn\'t realize that he was dead,
 and she remained pinned down by that gaze.
"Will we make this one a new toy and play?
 Nihi."
At those words, the witch finally realized that Hideyoshi was dead.
".........nn, ...ahh.
 ...Right, what\'ll we do..."
The Chiester Sisters waited for instructions.
{n}On the inside, they imagined an order even more brutal than before from their master.
But the expression that rose to the witch\'s face looked as though she had gotten over her excitement.
{n}She looked down at Hideyoshi\'s face, which still had tears dripping down it...
"......This guy totally ruined my mood.
 Yeeeah, I\'m done.
 .........Ronove, you there?"
"Yes, right here."
"Clean up, please.
 ...My predecessor will be annoying.
 Please make it clean enough so that the old hag will accept it. ......And I guess I will follow the rules of the ritual, out of responsibility to my predecessor.
 Please make these three corpses the fourth twilight through the sixth twilight."
"Lucifer, you\'re up."
"Lucifer the Proud, right here."
"Dig into these three corpses and gouge them."
"I‐...into the corpses?"
"That\'s right.
 You have a problem with that?"
"N‐...no..."
The Seven Sisters of Purgatory had a modest sense of pride.
 It was the pride of a hunter, the pride of gouging prey that they had brought down themselves.
...However, being told to gouge a corpse that someone else had brought down ran contrary to that feeling.
 Of course, that was not the witch\'s intention, but for the Seven Sisters, it was horribly humiliating.
...However, they had already messed up, with two of the sisters defeated, so they had no right to question her.
Only Ronove appreciated that, and he rested his hand on her shoulder in understanding.
"......It is {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama\'s order.
 Lucifer, carry the three, and deal with them according to the protocol of the ritual.
 Then, when you are done, lend me a hand with the cleanup."
"Certainly......"
The witch looked down upon Hideyoshi\'s corpse, as though implying that this somehow weird atmosphere was all Hideyoshi\'s fault.
".........Stupid man.
 You didn\'t even have to die."
"Honey......!!!
 Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!
 Honey, where are you?!
 You\'re there, right?
 Answer me!!"
The sound of a loud thunderbolt woke Eva from her nightmare.
If Hideyoshi had been gripping her hand at that time, her fearful heart would probably have been instantly healed.
However, Hideyoshi, who had sworn that he wouldn\'t leave even for a moment, was nowhere to be seen in the room.
"Honey,
 ...answer me...
 .........Honey...!!
 Uuuuuhhuuu{0}uuughhhuu!!"...Thirty minutes had already passed since Rudolf\'s group had left the guesthouse.
By any measure, their return was too late.
{n}...And Krauss and Natsuhi, who were waiting by the entrance, were by now about as restless as they could stand.
The chain was set on the door.
 That was a precaution in the event that Rudolf\'s group was attacked, and the master key was stolen from them.
For that reason, they needed to wait by the entrance like this for the others to return...
"......They really are taking too long.
 You don\'t think something happened to them...?"
"...............Hmm..."
Krauss glanced between the clock and the door, struggling to feign composure.
"If...by some chance they were not to return......"
"...A terrible thought, but it looks as though we should ready ourselves for that possibility.
 ......It really was reckless, after all."
"Th‐that is what I said...!
 Why did they go outside when they knew it was this dangerous...!
 How foolish!
 Why go outside, even though Rosa‐san had just been attacked...?!!"
".........Nothing will come from saying that now.
 ...In any event, there are now three adults in the guesthouse.
 Me, you,
 ......and Eva, who\'s asleep with a high fever."
At that time, there was the forceful sound from the hallway of a door being opened, and Eva\'s shrieking voice.
...That voice kept calling Hideyoshi\'s name.
 ......It seemed as though the high fever had given her a bad dream or something, and now she was calling her husband\'s name.
"Eva‐san...
what is it, are you alright...?"
"Wh‐...where is my husband?!
 My husband isn\'t here!!
 He promised that he\'d stay with me the whole time!
 He promised that he\'d hold my hand the whole time!!"
...Krauss was taken aback by this attitude of hers, which she had never shown in front of him before, but Natsuhi understood her feelings.
"......C‐calm down...
 Hideyoshi‐san is with Rudolf‐san and Kyrie‐san, and they\'re outside right now."
"Outside?!?!
 Whwh‐why,
 he promised that he\'d stay with me the whole time,
 why did he go outside?!
 You mustn\'t go outside, the witch is outside, you mustn\'t go, you\'ll be killed!!
 Waaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaagg{0}g{0}g{0}g{0}g{0}gghhh...!!"
"...Eva, calm yourself.
 ......Hideyoshi‐san is back in the mansion with Rudolf and Kyrie‐san."
"Why did he have to go to the mansion?!!
 Why did you let him outside when it\'s safe in here?!!
 Why did he go back to the mansion?!!"
"..................
 ......They went to get enough food to last until tomorrow.
 ...Hideyoshi‐san was worried about your health, and he told us so..."
"When will they come back?!
 When will he come back?!
 He can\'t go outside, not to the rose garden, not to the mansion!!
 The witch is there, the Golden Witch is walking around!
 If she finds him he\'ll be killed, he\'ll definitely be killed!!
 When will my husband come back?!"
".........They left here thirty minutes ago.
 We are waiting for their return."
"Th‐thirty minutes?!
 That makes no sense, why would it take him so much time to go to the mansion, get food, and come back?!
 And why are you two just standing around here?!"
"We have to go get him!!
 Quick, we have to go to where he is!!
 Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!!"
Eva had probably had quite a nightmare.
 ...And after waking up and discovering that it still wasn\'t over, she could no longer hide her confusion.
Natsuhi tried calming her down, but it only made Eva\'s emotions explode all the more.
......Maybe they heard that disturbance.
 The lobby door opened slightly, and Battler and the kids, who should have been upstairs, poked their faces out.
Krauss, Natsuhi, Eva.
 And Battler, George, Jessica, Nanjo.
{n}...Everyone in the guesthouse was gathered by the entrance, and understood the current situation.
"I agree with Mother.
 We should go to check on Father and the others."
"Yeah, you\'re right.
 There\'s also the chance that their load is too heavy and they\'re having trouble carrying it.
 They should welcome some extra hands."
"......R‐Rosa‐san was attacked not long ago.
 ...There\'s a possibility that this is a second disaster.
 We should act with caution here and—"
"Don\'t be ridiculous!!
 Act with caution and {i:what}?!
 Are you saying we should stand by and let my husband die when he might be praying for help?!
 I\'m going to look, the cowards can stay here!!"
Looking agitated, Eva raised her gun.
{n}Judging by her expression, it would be useless for anyone to try to stop her.
...George, who realized that first, raised his head.
"I\'ll go too.
 You will too, right, Battler‐kun?
 The more people, the better...!"
"S‐sure!!
 Auntie Eva, we\'re coming even if you tell us not to."
"...I, I\'m coming too...!
 I\'ll be damned if I\'m gonna be the only one hiding where it\'s safe...!"
"Jessica, you must not go outside!!
 You are to stay here with me.
 Do you understand?!"
She was essentially implying that those three had already been killed anyway, so it was pointless to go outside.
Natsuhi also realized that she had made a deep gouge in Eva\'s heart, but she said those words strongly as Jessica\'s mother.
"..................You\'re right.
 That would probably be best.
 Nii‐san, you and your family keep watch over the guesthouse."
"This is my family\'s and Battler‐kun\'s family\'s problem.
 And I wonder if Doctor Nanjo would come too.
 Just in case of the worst."
".........In the hall of the mansion, Battler, Eva, George, and Nanjo...
found the bodies of Rudolf, Kyrie, and Hideyoshi."
".........The fourth twilight through the sixth twilight?
 Then, the corpses were pierced through the forehead, chest, and stomach with those demon stakes?"
"Yes.
 ......Into Rudolf\'s forehead,
 into Hideyoshi\'s chest,
 and into Kyrie\'s stomach: one demon stake buried into each."
"The clothing on all three was disordered, and because of this, it is thought that they had been fighting or running away.
 Since the three bodies were not found right next to each other, it is hypothesized that after coming into contact with the culprit, they attempted some form of resistance."
".........With stakes, in the forehead, chest, and stomach.
 ......Horrible, just like usual..."
"................................."
Even though Ronove knew it would be superfluous, he thought that maybe he should tell Battler.
...In actuality, the witch had killed them in a much more horrible way.
......Beato had advised the witch to restrain herself, which was why the corpses had been left so undamaged.
The new and brutal witch, thinking that all she needed to do was get the "gouged with a stake" part right,
 ......might even have just stuck a stake into a lump of meat that wasn\'t even shaped like a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.
Rosa\'s and Maria\'s corpses would probably have been especially striking.
 ...If they had been killed as the Golden Witch had wished, just how gruesome would the exposed corpses have been?
Beato had changed that into a kind of killing that Battler would have called "still better".
Wanting to have Beato\'s small bit of thoughtfulness appreciated, he thought of telling Battler about that.
...But, for Battler, that might do more harm than good.
 To humans, the gap between being alive and being dead is very large.
To ask for Beato\'s feelings to be accommodated on the grounds that she had changed it to a better way of dying...
might have made it possible for a demon to pardon her, ......but there was no way it would work the same way for a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.
Understanding this, Ronove remained silent even though he knew of Beato\'s modest effort...
"Just like usual, let\'s start by checking whether the corpses are dead.
 ......Ronove, please, declare it in red."
"...................................."
"Hey, can\'t you hear me?
 ...Please, declare it in red.
 This is a repetition request.
 "Rudolf, Kyrie, and Hideyoshi are dead"."
"...............My apologies.
 Allow me to decline from repeating that."
"What...?
 That\'s so sudden... What are you planning...?"
By now, proclaiming the death of the victims in red was almost a given in this battle.
Refusing to do that was almost like losing by default.
...So when Ronove declined as his first move, Battler was dumbfounded.
"My apologies.
 I hereby humbly relinquish my right to be Milady\'s agent.
 ...Accordingly, {i:I} cannot repeat that in red.
 ......The only one qualified to repeat that...is Milady."
"........................"
"...It is a valid point.
 Ronove is but an agent for Beato\'s side.
 ......If Ronove steps down from the position of agent, and Battler‐kun will not accept Beato as an opponent,
 ...a new agent must be created."
"......There is no new agent.
 ......Please, Battler‐sama.
 Please accept Milady as your game partner once more."
"............Sorry,
 but that\'s not happening.
 ......I definitely won\'t accept that unpleasant, ruthless bitch as my opponent.
 ...Refusing to accept that is the reason I won\'t abandon this game."
"Regarding your point about Milady being unpleasant, I apologize in her stead.
 I shall obtain Milady\'s pledge that she will not take unpleasant actions again."
"..............................
 ......Yeah, right."
"...Battler‐kun.
 ...I also apologize as that child\'s master.
 I will give her a thorough talking‐to, so would you please forgive her just this once?"
"......Hey, hey, quit that.
 You\'re making it sound like I\'m the bad guy."
"...And no matter how much {i:you guys} apologize, it won\'t reach my ears.
 ......If Beato can say that from her own mouth,
 ............well, it\'s not like I\'m not gonna listen to her."
"............Alright.
 If that is the only condition under which you will accept that child again, let us have her apologize."
".........Ronove.
 Call for that child.
 Is that alright, Battler‐kun...?"
"...............Tch.
 ...Do whatever you want.
 But don\'t expect me to forgive her.
 ......Go on, call for that irritating witch."
"...You have my thanks, Battler‐sama.
 .........I will call her now.
 ......Milady, Battler‐sama is calling for you."
After a few heartbeats, gold butterflies gathered together in midair and created Beato\'s form.
...It was much more docile than the way she had appeared before now.
"............Did you call, Ronove?"
"...I believe you heard.
 ......Is there anything you have to say, from your own mouth...?"
"...................................."
".............................."
It looked as though Beato shrunk slightly under Battler\'s cold gaze.
Several times, Beato made an effort to get the words out of her mouth, but that didn\'t work so well,
 ......and she was just as awkward as someone trying to light a match during a freezing winter with frozen hands...
Even as she did that, the game board was proceeding...
In the hall, they had just found the bodies of the new victims, and had broken down crying...
"......Dad,
 ......Kyrie‐san...
 ...UooOO{0}O{0}O{0}OOoo{0}ooO{0}OOo{0}oohhhh...
 UOOOOooo{0}ooOO{0}OOoo{0}oohhhhh..."
"Oh honey, ...honeyyyy... uuu{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}huu{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}uughhhu{0}uuhu{0}uhuu...!!"
"...Mother,
 ......stay strong......
 ......You\'re not the only one who\'s...
...crushed and...
...sad......!"
"........................They probably died instantly.
 ...Even if we had arrived immediately after they fell, I am sure that it would have been too late..."
"No, it wouldn\'t!!
 He would definitely have been alive!!
 His chest was stabbed with this thing...!
 My husband must have died in extreme pain...!!"
"If we had come faster, ...he would have been saved, I just know it!
 I just know it!!
 Uuuuuwa{0}aAAAaa{0}aaAA{0}AAaa{0}aa{0}aahhh..."
"...Battler‐kun... I know it\'s horrible, but......you have to stay strong......"
"...............I\'m fine, ...I really am, Aniki...
 ...Let me cry just a bit longer...
 ......Compared to you people, this is nothing...
 I should be the least sad...!
 So if you let me cry just a little longer, ......I\'ll be fine..."
"That isn\'t true...
 ......I can understand how much it must be hurting your heart to have lost both parents...
 ...I still have my mother.
 ...I\'ve got it much better than you, Battler‐kun..."
"No, you haven\'t!!
 You have it the worst, George‐aniki...
 ......I understand, Aniki..."
"...Out of all of us, ...you\'re the most devastated, and the most in pain!!
 I know that...
so I can\'t keep on snivelling like this...!!
 Uuu{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}uughhu{0}uugh!!"
"......Why......do you say that......?"
"To me, Dad and Kyrie‐san......were people I\'d eventually part with when I became an independent adult.
 Since they\'re parents, it\'s fated that they\'d die before their children.
 ...It\'s just that it happened a little early...!"
".........But it\'s not like that for you, Aniki.
 You didn\'t just lose a parent you\'d part with eventually.
 .........You also lost someone you should have lived your whole life with,
 ............you lost Shannon‐chan as well...!!"
"......................................."
"It\'s not like human lives have different weights.
 Whether it\'s a baby or an old person, they\'re all just as precious...!"
"......But still, the longer the life they had in front of them,
 ...the longer the future you\'d have built together, ............the sadder their death is......!!"
"Aniki, you were engaged to Shannon‐chan, weren\'t you?
 You promised that you\'d build a life and a home together in the future, didn\'t you?!
 .........Compared to how huge that future was, ...compared to how huge that happiness was,
 ......my pain doesn\'t even come close...!!"
".........No one would blame you for crying so, so much more...!!
 And yet, ...just because you\'re like a big brother to us cousins,
 .........you force yourself to act like everything\'s all OK......!!"
"..................Stop it, ...Battler‐kun."
George was trying to make a calm smile.
......But.........he couldn\'t, any longer, stop a single hot tear from leaving a streak down his face.
"......How could I possibly...
......not be sad...?
 .........I think of Shannon, and all the futures we imagined together.
 We talked of so many dreams, the hundred years of our human lives would never have been enough to make them all come true."
"......Of those dreams,
 not even the very first one,
 ............having her move into my family register... We couldn\'t even have that...
......so how could I possibly...
.........not be sad.........?"
"Compared to that, I, ......I...!!
 Like I said, I have no right to cry any more!
 When even you\'re holding back, Aniki, what right do I have to shed any more tears?!"
"......We\'re the same.
 ...Both of us feel the exact same sadness from losing the ones we love.
 .........So there\'s nothing saying you don\'t have the right to cry compared to me."
".........And...
...there\'s nothing saying...I have to hold back {i:my} tears...any longer either."
"...Aniki, ......Anikii...!!!
 UOO{0}Oo{0}o{0}ooHhh{0}hhO{0}OoOhh{0}hgghhh!!"
"Shannon and I always talked about our future together...and now she\'s dead.
 And my dad, he\'s dead too.
 .........It hurts, ......it really hurts...
 ......uuu{0}uuhuu{0}huu{0}huu{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}uugh{0}hh{0}uuughh!!"
As Battler and George tightly hugged each other, they cried a waterfall of tears over each other\'s shoulders for those people important to them...
"............Do you understand why I said that George‐aniki is the most in pain...?"
"I, ......I was listening, so I understand.
 ......The sadness is proportional to the length of time that would have been spent together in their lives after that..."
"......Of course, you can\'t calculate it just like that though.
 .........We {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s aren\'t like you witches.
 ......We have a finite time we\'re alive to the moment we die, and we live it with our utmost strength."
".........I can\'t forgive anyone who makes light of that.
 ......Never mind someone who sneers at it and toys with it.
 ...A person like you, whose very concept of death is all screwed up, probably can\'t understand that."
"......................................."
"......It isn\'t just the length of time we\'d live afterwards.
 ......Sneering at the lives of people living with all their strength...
 That\'s...what I can\'t forgive the most."
"George‐aniki has gone through his life hell‐bent on doing his best.
 ...He must have shown up today with heroic determination in order that he could marry Shannon‐chan.
 ......It\'s completely different from me, a guy who was just feeling happy to be able to meet his cousins again for the first time in ages."
"...B‐.........But still—"
"Beato.
 For now, stay silent and listen."
"............M‐...mm."
".........In a way, I do understand where you\'re coming from.
 ...You say that you need to continue murdering according to that weird epitaph for your own resurrection."
"......So if I keep the circumstances of your position in mind,
 ......I can just barely understand your murders.
 ......Because for you, that is a necessary action.
 ......In that case, all further unnecessary actions are your own meaningless cruel hobby."
"......In other words, if killing six people for the first twilight is a "necessary action" for you,
 ...all that show of crushing their faces and splitting their stomachs and stuffing them full of sweets is your own, completely unnecessary,
 preference for cruelty.
 .........I absolutely cannot forgive this aspect of you."
"........................m...mm......"
"When Auntie Rosa was repeatedly killed in horrible ways,
 ......you said, "she\'ll be brought back to life in the end, so it doesn\'t matter how she kills her",
 ...or something like that, I hear.
 {f:5:Virgilia} told me."
".........That was...
...well...
umm........."
"That idea that you can kill them as many times as you want, as long as you bring them back to life in the end,
 is a completely unnecessary action of toying with a life, isn\'t it?"
".........If you\'re going to kill them, get it over with!
 Don\'t toy with them!!
 If you aren\'t going to kill them, then don\'t tease them!!
 You\'re taking advantage of the fact that you can do as you will with people\'s lives, and you\'ve forgotten the sanctity of life.
 So I can\'t accept you...!"
"I definitely can\'t accept as my opponent a person who doesn\'t know the weight of a life, and the sadness when that life is lost!"
"...............That is why the Endless Magic is known as a black art.
 ...An Endless Witch has no concept of the finite.
 ......They have no concept of the finite, of the end that is implied by breaking and killing."
"...For that reason, Endless Witches sometimes treat the gap between life and death as if it was a Chinese jump rope,
 and start jumping back and forth over it."
".........That is a very, very frightening thing.
 That is why, as an Endless Witch, and out of my own desire,
 {i:I never reached your level}."
{f:5:Virgilia} had told Beato that countless times before.
But Beato had been too young to obediently listen to those words.
 She had been too wild.
 ...She had been possessed by that...detestable pleasure.
"......I had always been told not to break vases.
 ......But that\'s what made me want to break them someday."
".........Then, when I gained the Endless Magic,
 ...and I learned that I could fix it back to normal no matter how much I broke it,
 ......I was surprised at how fun it was to break a vase..."
"That is called the forbidden honey.
 People are not captivated by what\'s inside.
 They are captivated by the lock that seals it.
 .........It truly is deplorable."
".........I want to ask you, {f:5:Virgilia}.
 Why does this thing called the Endless Magic exist?
 ...For what purpose does it exist in this world?"
"It is not limited to the Endless Magic.
 ...All magic exists to bring happiness to the human world."
"......After everything that has happened, it may be difficult for you to believe, Battler‐kun, ......but we witches train in order to bring blessings to the human world,
 to become a bridge between humans and those who are not human."
"......How the hell does reviving the dead and torturing them to death over and over again help the human world?"
"When a vase that is an important memento is broken,
 if by fixing it everyone will regain their smiles, I would repair it with magic as many times as necessary.
 However, I would not be fixing it in order to break it again.
 ......I would be reviving it to give humans happiness."
"In that case,
 ............Beato.
 You fail as an Endless Witch."
"..............................h......mmm..."
"......There\'s something that\'s just come to me.
 .........Why do I keep going on with this strange game against you?"
"......Maybe this isn\'t a game to make me submit.
 ......Couldn\'t it be a test for you to be accepted as an Endless Witch, {i:in its true meaning}?"
"...I, .........I don\'t know about that.
 ...The reason I proposed this game to you was, umm, ......simply as a way to kill time...
 There was no one\'s ulterior motive."
"Just now, I heard the definition of a witch from {f:5:Virgilia}.
 By that definition, you, Beato,
 are not even a witch.
 You\'d be an apprentice who\'s in the middle of her training, and who misunderstands her own power."
"......This was supposedly a fight between a witch and a human.
 In that case, someone like you, who isn\'t a witch, is not qualified to be my opponent.
 .........Understand?"
"......I am still...
.........only an apprentice,
 ......you say......
 Then, when will I be accepted as your opponent once again?
 ......When can we resume this game?"
"..................Who knows.
 ...At the very least, it isn\'t now.
 ......When you fully understand what I\'ve said, and become a real witch,
 ...I will probably accept you as my opponent in this game once more."
"I, I can\'t understand if you say it so abstractly like that...
 Clearly tell me what I should do to earn your forgiveness..."
"No, I\'ve said enough.
 You think about the rest.
 .........I\'ve said everything I want to say.
 ...If you can\'t understand it, try talking with {f:5:Virgilia} and Ronove.
 ...A brat like you should start off by listening to what the adults say."
".........{f:5:Virgilia}.
 I will suspend the game for now.
 Now that Ronove has stepped down as representative,
 all we can do is wait for Beato to gain the qualifications of a proper opponent."
"......Understood.
 ......Until Beato has been accepted as having gained those qualifications, the game will proceed without an opponent.
 Is that alright with you too, Beato?"
"...I, ......I have no objections.
 .........I want time, and a place where I can think at a leisurely pace.
 ...May I take my leave now?"
".........Yeah, sure."
"...Well then, see you...later."
"Wait.
 ......Don\'t make that dejected face."
"........................Sorry about that.
 Letting everything inside my heart show up on my face is part of my personality.
 I cannot deceive."
"In that case, there\'s hope for you yet.
 .........Let me promise you one thing.
 In this game with you, I might win, and I might lose.
 ......It\'s also possible that it\'ll be a victory by default for me if you don\'t come back."
At that point, Battler stopped talking for a second.
{n}...Then he spoke forcefully.
".........However, I definitely won\'t be the one to step down.
 I definitely won\'t give you a victory by default.
 ......I will keep on waiting here, for you to sit there again as my worthy opponent."
"......Battler‐sama..."
"...............Thank you,
 Battler.
 ...I will definitely come back and be accepted by you."
Beato showed him a very slightly hopeful smile, and disappeared.
...Looking at that expression, Battler strongly believed that her face could tell no lies...
The seven survivors returned to the guesthouse once again.
{n}By now, it was clear that those who went outside would not be able to return alive.
Rudolf\'s group had gone out holding two guns and one master key.
 But those had been lost.
It was more than clear by now that they had been stolen by the culprit.
Since the windows were closed with the shutters, they wouldn\'t open even if the culprit had the master key.
They sealed the front door and all other doors to the outside with chains,
 and further blocked them with sofas and tables.
Even if the culprit decided to break in through violent means, it wouldn\'t be easy for them.
"......At this point, the typhoon may actually be fortunate.
 If it were clear outside, it might have been possible for them to set fire to the guesthouse."
"If there wasn\'t a typhoon in the first place, the boat would have arrived before noon.
 I\'m not sure you can call that a cloud\'s silver lining."
"......Eva‐san, how are you feeling physically?
 Please, try to take it easy."
"Thank you.
 ...I still have a temperature, but now isn\'t the time to be saying things like that.
 ......Now is not the time to be stuck in bed, for the children\'s sake as well."
After crying so much in front of Hideyoshi\'s body,
 Eva had now gained a strong self‐awareness that she was a mother, and her expression conveyed a strong will.
...Actually, her fever still hadn\'t gone down.
And she was aware of that.
 Whenever she wasn\'t galvanizing herself, she felt the fever starting to make her mind hazy again.
By this point, the first floor was a final line of defense made by Krauss, Natsuhi, and Eva.
{n}The children and the guest, Nanjo, had been strongly warned not to carelessly come downstairs.
If the culprit used a ladder or something, it probably wouldn\'t be impossible for them to attack from upstairs.
But it wouldn\'t be easy for them to break those sturdy shutters from such an unstable position.
 It was comparatively safer upstairs compared to downstairs.
Battler and George had hoped to remain downstairs as well, to fight in the worst case scenario, but Eva had rejected that.
In her mind, George was now her only family.
{n}It seemed that she didn\'t even want to expose him to the danger of coming downstairs to the first floor.
Krauss and Natsuhi could also understand that feeling.
......A great deal of time had now passed since they once again barricaded themselves in.
In the cousins\' room upstairs, Battler, George, and Jessica were sitting dazed,
 their ears not even registering the TV that had been left on.
For a while, Nanjo had been with them, and had tried to send them words to cheer them up,
 but when he realized that he might actually be having the opposite effect, he disappeared into his own upstairs room.
George kept looking dazedly at the photographs inserted in his notebook.
......They were from that time he had taken a vacation to Okinawa with Shannon.
Shannon\'s happy smile was contained in those photographs.
......George could remember the temperature and the humidity, the warmth and strength of the wind,
 and even what he had been talking about with her at the time those photos had been taken, as clearly as though it had been yesterday.
So to George, they weren\'t simply photos,
 but a door to bring back warm memories...
In this room, even though the sound of the typhoon and the TV should have entered George\'s hearing,
 ......it was the scenery of Okinawa he had seen with her, and her laughing voice, that reached his eyes and his ears...
After meeting Shannon, George had made the decision to be reborn.
He had sworn to separate himself from the timid person he had once been:
 easily caught up in the atmosphere, unable to refuse a request, and easily used by those around him.
......He had resolved himself to become a strong man who would make her life even more joyous.
So.
 ...If he hadn\'t met Shannon,
 ......the man called Ushiromiya George would probably have lived a very different life.
And the George of that different life surely wouldn\'t have been as excellent a man as he now was.
The way he was now, he was for the sake of Shannon.
 ......But if that same Shannon was now gone,
 ...he found himself wondering why he exists.
Isn\'t it completely meaningless?
...A deep, deep sadness, as though he himself had become empty.
That feeling had tormented him the whole time.
 ......However, until Battler had told him, he hadn\'t been aware of the feeling himself.
......He finally remembered...that he should have cried much, much more.
So he had cried.
 Just like Battler, he had cried himself dry.
......By now, his eyes were bright red and swollen, and he could not cry any more.
 So George did his best to change his way of thinking.
He decided to think that he was not meaningless, ...that he should be grateful to Shannon for giving him such a character.
Dead lives are not revived.
 He would have to get over being separated from his beloved.
If he were to come after Shannon by killing himself, she would surely be deeply dejected.
......It would be the same the other way around, too.
 If he died, and Shannon chased after him, throwing away her own life, he wouldn\'t be able to forgive himself.
......So he chose to surpass his emotions of sadness and anger,
 .........and decided to thank her.
Meeting Shannon had made his days rich and full,
 ...and had taught him the meaning of working hard for other people\'s sakes.
As a result, she had shaped him into the person he had wanted to be.
{n}...He thought he should thank her for that.
By doing that, he tried to quell his sadness.
{n}But each time he did, he remembered Shannon\'s smile...
.........He knew it, logically.
He understood that grieving any more than this would only make her grieve in heaven,
 ......yet he couldn\'t stop his sadness...
"Why...
......does people dying...
...make us this sad..."
Battler muttered.
{n}...It was as though he was speaking on behalf of all humans.
He probably hadn\'t been asking anyone, but Jessica answered.
"......Partings are always sad, no matter what they\'re like."
"...But, when, for example, the person is old, or there\'s some time it\'s going to happen,
 ...when it\'s expected in advance, and you know it\'s a farewell that must come sooner or later,
 ...you can spend a long time softening the blow of that sadness.
 ......Sudden misfortune is probably sad...because you aren\'t allowed even that..."
"...............I see, yeah.
 ...Sure, if they get sick or something, and end up bedridden in a hospital for several years, you might be able to ready yourself for it bit by bit,
 ...but when it happens suddenly some day, you don\'t have that much time."
"...The sadness which you should normally spend several years softening closes in on you all at once.
 .........No wonder it\'s tough.
 ......Sometimes, it might even cause a sadness great enough to leave a scar for life..."
"......Enough to leave a scar for life, ...you say."
"......It\'s like Grandfather\'s occult hobby.
 That was what they whispered about it.
 ......That maybe {f:5:Beatrice} was his lover, who died a long time ago, and he was so sad that he couldn\'t pull himself together."
"......And that\'s why he started sacrificing the rest of his life to research of the occult, in order to revive the dead.
 ......That\'s what they said."
"In that case, Grandfather succeeded in that miracle in his last moments.
 ......The culprit would be the revived {f:5:Beatrice}, with Grandfather being reunited with her at the moment he was killed.
 ......Pretty ironic that he revived her, only then to be killed by her."
"............Even so, Grandfather was probably able to meet her.
 ...He gambled half of his life, and even though it was only for a short time,
 he was probably reunited with the woman he wished to see once again."
"...Except he got totally roasted.
 Probably wanted a bit more than that out of half a life\'s research."
"I wouldn\'t say that.
 .........Even if it was only for an instant,
 ......Grandfather must have been happy to be reunited with the woman he loved."
".........Even if his sin of defying life\'s providence was punished by God,
 and his body was burnt and sent down to hell,
 ...and even if the reunion he got in return only lasted a very short time..."
"George nii‐san......"
"......I wouldn\'t care if I met with the wrath of God and had my body burned.
 .........Even if it was just for a short amount of time,
 ......if I could revive Shannon again,
 ..................I would sacrifice the rest of my life to the same research as Grandfather."
"......Five minutes would be enough,
 ......I just want to talk with Shannon again...
 ......Even one minute would be fine......
 ......In exchange, ...I wouldn\'t mind......sacrificing the rest of my life......!"
".........Aniki......"
When Battler and Jessica realized that their pointless discussion was hurting George, they had no choice but to shut their mouths...
......George directed his thoughts at Kinzo\'s life:
I saw him sacrifice half of his life to research that no one could understand.
......And, on the last day of his life, he revived the person he loved most,
 ......and probably succeeded in his reunion in his final moments.
I don\'t know how much time they were able to spend together.
 ...I don\'t know whether they were given an hour, ...or just five minutes.
However, ......in that moment, all of that time he had sacrificed for his research must have been rewarded.
 ...Even though he spent decades to gain it, that small amount of time must have been enough to reward him.
Until today, I never believed in the occult or magic or anything.
{n}Somewhere in my heart,
 ...I even made fun of Grandfather\'s research as nothing more than an indulgence.
However,
 ......I won\'t make fun of it anymore.
{n}...No, to the contrary, I strongly believe that it does exist.
...If that power of belief can become miracles,
 I\'ll probably throw away all of my studies up until today,
 and spend the rest of my life from today onwards studying magic.
.........Give me the power of magic.
...And...a miracle which lets me meet Shannon again...
"....................................
 ......Haha, ...ha.
 ...Sorry, you two.
 I must be going mad.
 ......If you could revive the dead with magic,
 ......people would probably be studying it everywhere around the world."
"...But things like that don\'t exist in reality.
 No one studies it.
 .........That\'s because...they know...that the dead can\'t be brought back with magic."
"............Sorry for saying such weird things.
 It\'s my fault that the atmosphere here has gotten so strange.
 ...Sorry for making you worry about me, even though this is hard on everybody."
...Even though I did it to divert myself from my sadness, maybe I did say something strange.
If I keep talking about something so weird, I\'m sure it won\'t heal their sadness...
But, even so, ...that doesn\'t mean that I can withstand this silence.
"......I\'ll go downstairs, and get another cup of coffee.
 ......My mother is very particular about how to make a cup of coffee.
 Does anyone want a refill?"
Battler‐kun and Jessica‐chan lightly shook their heads.
{n}Without being any more persistent than that, I took my mug and left the room.
I did visit Doctor Nanjo\'s room to ask whether he wanted any more coffee as well,
 but he too said that he didn\'t want any more.
......It seemed as though my mother\'s orthodox method of making coffee wasn\'t universally appreciated.
One time, I had Shannon drink some that I brewed by that method,
 ......but she told me that while it was delicious, it was a little strong,
 if I remember her words...
"............Shannon........."
It\'s no good...
 ......Even though I left the room to change my mood,
 ...that image of Shannon\'s face that\'s filling my head hasn\'t faded in the slightest...
The fun days I shared with her were becoming more and more vivid,
 ............and I felt saddened that I was not even allowed to see her dead face.
According to our parents, it seems as though she was killed with something like a gun or spear.
...I\'m sure they were just trying to console me, ......but they had said that her face in death had been very beautiful and peaceful.
I wonder if she\'s...wearing the engagement ring I gave her last night?
......If she accepted my engagement, she should have it on the ring finger of her left hand...
Last night, our heads were both full of each other, and we weren\'t composed at all.
Shannon had accepted the engagement semi‐boldly,
 but she might have regretted that as a rash action once she cooled her head.
 She might have taken the ring off.
......I wonder if she has the ring on now.
......I at least want to be sure of that much.
{n}I want to know...her final feelings......
However, ......even if I do check that, ...it\'s not as if she\'ll be revived.
...............I wonder what will happen to her body.
{n}After the autopsy, ......it will probably be immediately cremated.
Then, I\'ll never be able to see her face, ...even her dead face, for all eternity...
"..................
 .........Haha, ...because of the shock of losing Shannon,
 ......am I going a little crazy...?"
I don\'t want......Shannon\'s body to be burned.
{n}If she\'s burned, she\'ll turn to ash, ......and {i:never again will it be possible for her to revive}.
They say that cremation is disliked in Western tradition.
{n}......Because on the day of resurrection, there would be no body to revive.
Because of that, it seems that great criminals in Western history were often cremated after execution as a punishment,
 and their ashes were sometimes scattered in rivers and such...
In other words, to Western people, death is nothing more than a sleep until the resurrection.
 It is essential that the corpse is left after death.
"In other words,
 ......that\'s because Western people...
...knew of the existence of...
...a miracle to revive the dead.
 .........But that miracle didn\'t exist in Japan, so we burn them."
Now I understand.
 ...I understand why Grandfather idolized the Western occult.
From the beginning, it had all been only for that reason.
 ...Just to revive the person dear to him, ...Grandfather spent the rest of his remaining life researching the Western occult.
.........The situation surrounding us right now was abnormal.
Grandfather had revived his beloved {f:5:Beatrice}.
...And that {f:5:Beatrice} had carried out a terrible serial murder,
 with chains of locked rooms that were impossible without the use of magic.
......The Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}.
{n}The incarnation of the miracle of the Western occult.
{n}.........And also, the culprit who killed Shannon......
I should hate that being, ............and yet, for some reason, I want to cling to the hope she represents.
I wonder if she could use that miraculous magic that Grandfather spent his life espousing...to revive Shannon...
According to the Ushiromiya family legend, Grandfather met with her long ago, and was given a vast quantity of gold.
...Then if I also met her,
 ......instead of gold, would she give me Shannon\'s life?
In return, she could impose any kind of devil\'s contract.
{n}For that, I would sacrifice all of my remaining life...
George probably couldn\'t have believed or noticed that, ...right behind him,
 ......the witch herself stood, listening to his voiceless wish.
{f:5:Beatrice} had been listening to everything George and the others had to say since their discussion just now in the cousins\' room.
......Battler had told her that she didn\'t know the weight of a human\'s life,
 ......and wanting to understand that in her own way, she had stealthily visited, and listened to their discussion.
"........................
 ......You say that is your wish...?
 If I could grant that, would I be accepted as a witch...?"
Beato looked at the palms of both of her hands.
...She had handed over most of her previously surging magic power when the new witch had succeeded the name of Endless Witch.
Of course, even now her magic power still made her worthy of being called a witch,
 ...but it did not even compare to her previous strength.
"......Hmph.
 Even without the Endless Magic, I am a Great Witch whose name has thundered through a thousand years.
 Reviving the dead is no trouble at all."
Inside her head, she thought about several magical methods for reviving the dead.
......Even magic that she could do easily in the past would be difficult with her current magic power.
She thought of something, then clicked her tongue, and repeated this several times.
In the end, ......she finally thought of a single spell.
But that was a spell that she couldn\'t use by herself.
{n}It was a spell that witches with weak power used, that relied on the aid of others.
...In the past, Beato had looked down upon that type of magic.
Therefore, she frantically tried to think if there wasn\'t any other possible spell,
 .........but in the end, she couldn\'t think of one, and slumped over in self‐derision.
And then, ......careful not to surprise him, she softly called out.
 Softly, to George\'s heart...
".........Ushiromiya George.
 ...Can you hear my voice...?"
"......I can hear.
 ......Who are you...?
 Are you really the witch, {f:5:Beatrice}...?
 ...Or else, are you an illusion created by my sadness...?"
".........If it\'s the former, I want you to hear my wish.
 ...And if it\'s the latter, just leave me alone..."
Conversations in the world of the mind are a lot like those in a dream.
When you dream, haven\'t you ever had the experience...
of casually accepting something that would have been absurd in the real world?
......The conversation in this world was like that.
So even though a witch appeared and started talking to George, he was not surprised...
"Mm.
 ......I am...the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}.
 .........Normally, you and I would not be able to talk together like this.
 ...However, you are strongly conscious of me, and wish to have a discussion,
 ...so both of our channels are able to match like this."
"...............The person who killed Shannon...
I don\'t care if it was you, or someone else taking on your name.
 ......As long as you exist as a real witch."
"............I would pay any compensation.
 ...If you desire my life, you can take it right now.
 ......Please, I want you to bring Shannon back to life...
 .........If that\'s impossible, then at least, I would like just to be allowed to talk to her for a short while......
 ......Please........."
".........I require no compensation.
 I shall grant that wish."
"...Really......?
 You\'ll really bring Shannon........."
"Mm.
 ......However, my current magic power is not sufficient to use resurrection magic.
 ...Therefore, I must rely on your help."
".........If there\'s something I can do, I\'ll do anything.
 ...Even if that means taking my heart out right here and now, I will not hesitate..."
"...I\'m telling you that I don\'t require something like that.
 ............I may cast the spell.
 Then, a gap would open in the door to Hades."
"...But as I am now, I do not have the power to bring Shannon\'s soul up through that gap.
 .........However, if it were you, who has strong feelings for Shannon,
 you should be able to change those feelings into magic, and bring her soul out without fail."
"......What do you say?
 Will you help me...?"
"...Of course I will.
 .........If Shannon\'s life will be revived,
 ......I am not afraid to lose everything......!"
George\'s fists shook in silence.
...Then he slowly regained consciousness.
He had been absentmindedly standing near the window in the hall the whole time, his mug still in his hand...
And......
............the witch from his dream......was still there.
"Wh‐......what the... .........I‐it isn\'t......a dream........."
"......Be quiet.
 I am very fragile now.
 If any more {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s appear now, I will not be able to preserve this form.
 ...I shall grant your wish, so stay silent for now.
 ...Is that alright?"
George covered his mouth with both hands, forcefully nodding several times.
As he did, he almost dropped the mug he was holding.
George frantically juggled it around and caught it.
...He was afraid that if it fell to the floor and made a loud sound,
 the witch\'s form might disappear like a bubble popping.
He softly set the mug on the floor, ...and stared once again at the witch in front of him.
.........Her form didn\'t disappear.
 It wasn\'t a dream......
"Come, let us go to the parlor where Shannon sleeps.
 With the power of your feelings, we will bring back her soul."
"Y‐you say go, but...how...?
 My mother and the others are downstairs.
 There\'s no way they\'d let me go outside.
 ......And, didn\'t you just say that you wouldn\'t be able to preserve your form if another {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} appeared?"
"......Come to think of it, that is true.
 So, Krauss and the rest are downstairs.
 ...In that case, we definitely cannot go down.
 ......Well then, we just need to go to the mansion without going downstairs, right?
 It\'s simple."
Beato laughed, as though she had thought of a pleasant prank.
......And with her golden pipe, she lightly tapped a window with its shutter closed.
When she did, three gold butterflies appeared from the pipe and opened the lock on the window as though melting it.
Then the window opened without a sound.
The shutter beyond it was exactly the same.
{n}The clasp unset itself, also without making a sound, and it quietly opened.
The window opened, exposing the wind and rain outside the mansion.
 ...Perhaps because of the direction or something related to the construction of the building, the wind did not blow inside.
Because of that, for a while,
 George felt as though this entrance opening to the outside was a dream or illusion, and he couldn\'t accept it as real.
"Come, let us go.
 Come with me."
Beato gently floated upwards.
 It was a natural action, like that of a diver enjoying an underwater stroll.
......It made it easy to believe that if you acted like she did,
 you too might be able to float in the sky just as though you were swimming in the water.
...No, George did believe that.
......So without thinking, just as she had done, he also...
...gently...
...as though swimming in the water...he moved his feet......
"......ah, ............aaaaaaahh........."
"Hoh.
 ...Not bad.
 So you learned how to dance through the sky faster than I could explain it."
George was shocked to find himself floating in midair like he was swimming.
...Of course, Beato was also shocked that George, who should have been unacquainted with magic, had learned how to do that just by instinct.
".........To be able to...
...fly in the air,
 ......swim in the air......"
"...You must not think of the logic.
 Accept it as a natural thing.
 ......You must not think back upon the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} doctrines, such as those from Newton and Einstein."
"Especially when flying high in the sky.
 ...Inexperienced witches sometimes fall."
"...I, ...I accept it as true...
 I accept it as true......"
George repeated those words over and over.
{n}......He must not deny magic, no matter what.
To deny that would be the same as to throw away what might be...
his first and last chance to revive Shannon.
However, compared to Beato, who was elegantly drifting like smoke, George\'s movements were clearly similar to someone underwater.
...Therefore, if he didn\'t make a movement like kicking his feet in water every once in a while, he would be slowly dragged down by the force of gravity.
"I shall praise this as being a better performance than the first time I danced in the sky.
 ......Here we go.
 Come with me."
Beato beckoned to George, and gently flew into the stormy sky.
......It was just like a scene from a fairy tale.
The scene unfolding before George\'s eyes felt entirely like an extension of his dream.
"......Being able to fly is......incredible, ......but so is the wind and the rain..."
"What\'s this? Are the wind and rain tormenting you...?
 ......I could teach you magic to block against that,
 but it may be too early for you, and it may be a misuse of time right now."
"........................Yes.
 ...The magic I need...isn\'t that."
Without losing to the wind and rain, George wore a strong‐willed gaze.
"The mansion is coming into sight.
 ...Hold out just a little longer.
 If you fall now, you\'ll hit the bushes in the rose garden."
The undulating rose garden was spread beneath the witch and George\'s gazes.
This fantasy‐like scene no longer surprised George.
Only the gradually approaching mansion was reflected in his eyes.
"Shannon, .........wait for me...
 ......I will definitely...revive you......!"
Meanwhile...
......the cruel new witch could be seen staring at the guesthouse from a different location.
"...............Now, all that\'s left is the seventh and eighth twilights.
 Just two more, and my obligation to that predecessor hag is finished.
 .........I\'ll kill Krauss and Natsuhi.
 Together like a happy couple."
"Nihi.
 How are the targets nyeh?"
"......In the lobby on the first floor of the guesthouse, both targets and Ushiromiya Eva acquired.
 Measuring anti‐magic power.
 Data link to 410."
"410, data received.
 Anti‐magic power is extremely low.
 If Eva just goes outside, they\'re tuna and abalone on a chopping board.
 Nihihihihi...!"
"What would you ask of us, Great Lady {f:5:Beatrice}?
 If you give the order, we will snipe right away...!
 Please, your orders...!"
"...You guys reaally are convenient furniture.
 Very different from old, second‐hand furniture, which only has enough talent to gouge corpses.
 Right?"
"..............................kh..."
"Chiester Sisters, please show me your skill again.
 ...Prepare to attack!
 *giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*!
 Carry the corpses out again, alright?
 \'Cause I\'ll play with them a lot.
 No complaints, OK, Ronove?"
"......Yes.
 Certainly."
"Nn......"
At that time, the witch noticed something.
 ......As though some presence had disappeared...
 ...Was it her imagination......?
".........Did you feel some kind of presence just now?
 Did any of you feel it?"
"M‐...my apologies, I didn\'t notice anything... Please forgive me......!!"
"We were in the middle of observing the guesthouse, so our peripheral surveillance was turned off. Nihi.
 ...What about you, Lucifer‐chaaan?
 Did you feel a presence?"
".........nh—"
For just an instant, Lucifer sent a glance at Ronove, questioning whether she should answer honestly or not.
Ronove gave a small nod in response.
"No.
 ...My apologies, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.
 Nothing from us.
 .........Forgive us for this stupidity, as we are only second‐hand furniture."
"..........................."
"..........................."
"...........................
 ......I see.
 If a Great Demon like you says that, then it must have been my imagination."
The witch stared persistently in the direction the presence had disappeared to.
......That was the direction of the rose garden.
 And beyond that, she could see the mansion\'s dark silhouette created by lightning.
......It took her quite some time before she pushed her unsatisfied feelings aside,
 and once again turned to face the guesthouse.The guesthouse lobby had been engulfed by silence.
The strings of tension which bound Krauss, Natsuhi, and Eva had already loosened; they were completely tired; and their consciousness was beginning to waver.
Every once in a while, they would stand up and walk around pointlessly, fighting their drowsiness.
".........Are you alright, Eva‐san?
 ...Please, do take it easy and rest."
"I told you, I\'m fine......
 ...The three of us are now the only adults...
 There\'s no time to rest...
 I\'ll guard this place even if I have to go through hell and high water......
 ......haah......haah......"
She spoke a brave line, but she couldn\'t hide her rough breathing.
{n}...It seemed that the fever, which had been calmed with medicine for a time, had returned.
It was very obvious that Eva\'s condition was not good.
"Don\'t push yourself.
 At least close your eyes.
 If we have to wake you, we definitely will."
"I\'m telling you that I\'m fine...!
 Leave me alone......!!"
".............................."
It seemed that she had now become stubborn.
 ......Krauss and Natsuhi realized that no matter what else they said to her, in her current state, it wouldn\'t reach her ears.
So they decided to say nothing more, and to let her be.
To Eva right now, even an argument like that was putting a burden on her.
{n}It would probably be better for her if she just sat there with her mouth closed.
As a matter of fact, Eva was already on the point of succumbing to her drowsiness.
 ...She might have talked back with a temper because she was trying to encourage herself and throw off her sleepiness.
The clock would very soon be pointing to six in the afternoon.
Because she had been snacking over and over again to fool her drowsiness, she didn\'t feel hungry,
 but instead, her lack of sleep made it feel like it was six in the morning rather than the afternoon.
......Even supposing that the boat would come at precisely nine in the morning tomorrow,
 ......there were still more than twelve full hours to go.
...That was a dizzyingly long stretch of time.
............Long.
 .........Painful......
 ......Hot...
Even the sound of the clock torments my body now.
In times like this, ......he would put his hand on my forehead, and the fever would always fade at once.
...But he isn\'t here anymore.........
As Eva\'s mind grew foggy, she was once again gripped by a deep sadness...
She had already cried herself dry.
{n}Even so, the sadness from losing her beloved husband had not been exhausted...
"...............I...
...was wrong..."
"...Why?"
Originally, the new witch had been the same being as Eva.
{n}...If Eva talked to her, she would always respond...
"......If I could only gain the position of family head, ...that was always enough.
 ......But as soon as I saw that mountain of gold, my greed grew.
 ............I was struck with a desire to have that mountain of gold all to myself......"
"That\'s nothing to be embarrassed about.
 After all, it\'s your natural right as the Ushiromiya family head.
 How could you give up even a bit of it to anyone else?"
"............I was gripped by that temptation, ...which is why you were born.
 ......While you are the heart of my young self,
 ......at the same time, you are also my self‐centered evil heart."
"......It\'s my foolish greed, which sprouted thanks to that mountain of gold,
 ......that allowed you to break out of the shell of my heart, ...and be born into this world...
 .........I\'m to blame for giving birth to you......!"
"In that case, when I killed Rosa and Maria,
 and then Rudolf, Kyrie and Hideyoshi, you were to blame for that too."
"Why did you kill my husband too...?!
 Why......?!!
 Uuuuuhghuuhuhhuu!!"
"...I didn\'t want to kill Hideyoshi.
 He was just so annoying and persistent.
 ...And that\'s our, no, your fault.
 It\'s your fault for choosing a husband like that."
"A child like you can\'t possibly understand how good he was!!
 Uuuughh{0}hhu{0}uuhu{0}u{0}u{0}u{0}uughh...{0}honey.........uuu{0}u{0}u{0}uuhhuhghh{0}hhu{0}uhuu{0}huu!"
".........Come on.
 Our dreams were made real with magic, right?
 We solved the riddle of the epitaph.
 And we found the gold and got the Head\'s Ring.
 All of our dreams came fully true, right?
 What more could you want...?"
"Those weren\'t the only dreams I had...!!
 Living a wonderful life with that man, and entrusting George with an excellent life...!
 I still have so many dreams that I need to fulfil, ...as a wife, as a mother...!!
 And yet, ......and yet......!"
"...Those are just extra dreams {i:you} gained after becoming an adult.
 They aren\'t {i:our} dreams."
"And that is why you\'re a child...!!
 It only matters that {i:you} get what {i:you} want?!
 ......That\'s right, all of this is my fault...!!
 Back then, why did I resist doing what Rosa told me to?
 Why couldn\'t I announce to all of the siblings that I had found the gold...?"
"......It\'s all because of the ugliness in my heart!!
 My evil heart, which sprouted out of a desire to have all of the gold all to myself, ......caused you to hatch!!"
".........I don\'t see why I deserve that much hate.
 Even though the both of us together make up Ushiromiya Eva."
"No, that isn\'t true anymore.
 And it was you who said it.
 I am Ushiromiya Eva.
 And you are the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}...!!"
"So just disappear already!
 Witches are a delusion, a fantasy that can only exist in fairy tales...!!
 Just DISAPPEAR!
 Don\'t ever show yourself to me again!!"
"...Oh, ......so that\'s how it is.
 ...Alright.
 I\'ll disappear from your sight."
"...And I am no longer Ushiromiya Eva.
 From now on, I\'m the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}.
 ...So now I will play however I want."
"I\'m done caring about you.
 Why don\'t you just give up and die forever?!"
After having a fittingly childlike tantrum, the witch who had once been another Eva vanished.
......Only Eva was left behind in the darkness.
{n}And she questioned herself...
"Was it me......?
 {i:I}......killed them......?
 Did I kill...that person......?
 ......Did {i:I}......kill...him............?"
Now, that question was one she herself would never answer......
"...g... *cough*cough*cough*!!
 *cough*cough*cough*!!"
It seemed that, half‐asleep, she had gotten some saliva caught in her windpipe just as she was dozing off.
 ...Eva suddenly started coughing.
"Are you alright, Eva?
 ...Natsuhi, some water, please."
"Y‐yes..."
"I, ......I\'m alright, okay...
 *cough*cough*cough*!
 *cooough*cough*!!
 I just...choked a bit, that\'s all......!
 *cough*cough*cough*!"
Eva pushed away Natsuhi\'s hand as she tried to rub her back, and unsteadily rose to her feet.
".........I\'m going to wash my face.
 ...Sorry, I fell asleep.
 ......When I get back, I\'ll make some more coffee.
 .........Extra strong, so that we won\'t get drowsy until tomorrow morning."
"Mm, please do.
 ......Your coffee fits my tastes more than the one Gohda makes."
"I\'m pleased to hear that, even if you\'re just flattering me...
 *cough*cough*!
 .........I\'ll be back soon."
Eva exited the lobby, heading for the lavatory.
{n}Krauss and Natsuhi watched over her frail back...
"......So you do sometimes care for Eva‐san, even though you have always been so much at odds with her."
"........................
 ...Properly speaking, isn\'t this what an older brother should do...?"
"......Yes.
 I believe it is."
"Not just Eva.
 ......Rudolf, and Rosa too.
 ...The only ways in which I have acted like an older brother to them are to speak arrogantly and bully them."
".........In my own way, I was frantic in my desire to be like my father.
 ...But I could never match up, and I always vented my feelings on them...
 However, that is no excuse."
"...I probably scarred Eva so deep that it still has not healed.
 ......I regret it, but even if I apologized after all this time, that would not heal those wounds..."
".........If you hold on to that emotion, and continue to hold onto it,
 ...I\'m sure that feeling will come through to your siblings."
"......At this point, my only sibling left is Eva."
"...............If only...the family you and your siblings were born into had not been the Ushiromiya family......
......you might have had a more normal, a more fun sibling relationship..."
"...You mustn\'t say that...
 .........Eva will probably continue to hate me for her whole life.
 And she has the right to.
 ...I intend to resign myself to that and accept it."
".....................Dear......"
"......Eva,
 .........I am sorry.
 ......Of course, you don\'t have to forgive me..."
Of course I won\'t. Bit late, don\'t you think?
"If you know you\'re in the wrong, why don\'t you just give up and die right now and forever?!
 Do it, Chiester Sisters!!"
"45, firing permission received.
 Reconfirming firing curve, correcting for weather.
 Data link to 410."
"410, data received, firing permission confirmed.
 Nihihihihi, firing!"
Together, the sisters released the readied magic bowstring.
 A beautiful tail trailed the golden arrow, and it drew a beautiful curve as it flew.
It was just like a golden snake.
It skillfully avoided a grove of trees and flew towards the front door of the guesthouse.
Then it flew into the keyhole of the door and snuck into the guesthouse without any problem at all.
The gold snake raced down the hall smoothly, yet as fast as an arrow.
Right in front of it was the door to the lobby.
It would only need to fly into that keyhole, and Krauss and Natsuhi would be right there...
For an instant, Krauss thought he saw the door\'s keyhole sparkle gold.
However, at the same time he strained his eyes to see what it was, that sparkle bent like a whip and attacked,
 wrapping itself around Krauss\'s neck.
"...............ack.........ahkh—khk—"
Just looking at it, the gold snake looked very supple.
 However, it was as though a wire had tightened around Krauss\'s neck.
And while that snake choked Krauss, it extended even more, and also tightened around Natsuhi\'s neck.
Without even the chance to scream, their eyes bulged as they went into convulsions and then collapsed.
"45, hit and kill confirmed.
 Forming towing curve, correcting adjustment points.
 Data link to 410."
"410, data received.
 Initiating corpse towing.
 Two on the line at once nyeh, nihi!"
The gold snake began to drag Krauss and Natsuhi\'s corpses back.
......It slipped through the door to the corridor, dragging the corpses, gradually increasing in speed,
 and in the blink of an eye, it had pulled them outside the guesthouse.
So the lobby was still, as though nothing had happened at all.
...As though Krauss and Natsuhi had never been there to begin with.
Only the sound of the wind and the rain remained, as though feigning ignorance and pretending that they had been the only ones there......
"......Sorry, I\'m fine now.
 ...Now, I\'ll go make some coffee."
Eva returned from the lavatory.
{n}But no one was in the lobby.
Even though they had been in that sofa until the very moment she had choked and gone to the lavatory,
 they had now gone, as if they had been an illusion from the beginning.
"...How careless...
 ......Where did those two go off together?"
Like she was pretending to be in a detective novel, Eva put her hand on the sofa.
......She felt a warmth indicating that they had been sitting there until a short while ago.
Maybe they had gone to do the rounds or something.
For the time being, Eva sat down and waited for their return...
Beato and George could be seen in the parlor of the mansion.
{n}George was kneeling near Shannon\'s body as though praying...
{n}His face was sincerity itself, and there was even sweat on his forehead.
However, Beato was the same.
 Now that she had handed her name over, most of her previous power had been lost.
...Of course, she still had more than enough power to be called a witch, but compared to the past, it was a very faint thing.
"......Good.
 Don\'t talk to her, don\'t touch her with your hand.
 ...Call to her with the voice of your heart; seek her with the hand of your heart.
 ...Only your strong feelings can make my magic reach Shannon\'s lost soul."
".................................hh."
George maintained a single‐minded focus.
{n}He kept frantically yelling inside his heart, trying to call back the soul of the person he loved.
...He strongly envisioned his soul leaving his body, and searching for her as she wandered through Hell.
......Beato turned that strong force into magical power, supplementing her own magic.
 It was magic that, in the past, she could have performed easily, without anyone\'s help.
...But now, if she didn\'t rely on someone\'s help, she wouldn\'t be able to finish the chant, much less succeed.
".........I have forgotten after several hundred years...
 .........Was magic,
 ......was resurrection...
always this difficult of a magic......?"
An even more strained expression than George\'s had risen to Beato\'s face.
...She was still forgetting this, but the magic to revive a life is fundamentally the ultimate hidden art.
It was her previous magical power, giving her the ability to use that magic over and over with a snap of her fingers, that was abnormal.
Therefore, the heavy burden to her body and mind was, by rights, absolutely to be expected...
"......However, .........the power this one has...
is quite considerable, even though he doesn\'t know magic.
 ......I see, so he truly is Kinzo\'s grandchild..."
The strong power pouring from George was even large enough to pass as magical power.
...At first, Beato thought it was due to the blood of the mage Kinzo.
......However, that was probably wrong.
{n}...She had a feeling that Battler had taught her that.
George\'s power to feel sorrow for the death of his loved one......arose from the way he had tried his hardest throughout his life,
 from the warm time spent together with Shannon, and from the size of their shared dream, promising each other their futures.
Do humans really live this seriously during their one single life?
......Of course they do.
 To her, a life didn\'t mean anything more than the difference between the top and bottom of an Othello piece.
If the black represented death, then she thought all you had to do was flip it over again and make it white.
However, it was just like that broken vase.
......To humans in a world without magic, where they can never return it to its original form,
 ......it is very, very natural for them to bet all their body and soul on that single life.
".........So there are times when an Endless Witch, with full command over even life and death,
 ......is inferior to a finite {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}, for whom even death\'s mountain is impossible to cross......?"
Now, the witch acknowledged it.
He was able to hold a magical power that could not reside in witches who didn\'t understand the value of a life.
......What is this thing called the Endless Magic {i:for} again?
...Even though I call myself the Endless Witch,
 have I been forgetting what the Endless Magic means...for a whole thousand years.........?
She looked at George\'s expression again.
 .........His surging earnestness was like a lightning bolt.
...Right now, even if George\'s body was burned, or smashed by a waterfall,
 he would probably continue to pray for his beloved without minding it, without noticing it.
For the first time, ...she showed respect for that power.
So in that instant, all magical resistance was lost, and the enormous power of George\'s feelings turned into magical power in its perfect form......
The vase was very, very beautiful, rich with history and value.
Even as young as I was, it still forced me to take a deep breath when I witnessed its beauty.
 ......But that just made me want to touch it.
But the vase easily fell and smashed into smithereens.
...Like a popped bubble,
 it felt as though the time when it had possessed a form was just an illusion.
It was that fragile, ......that easily lost, that life.
I realized that, because of my own foolish curiosity, I had done something that couldn\'t be taken back.
No matter how much I regretted it, no matter how much I apologized.
{n}The broken vase would not return to its original form...
{n}A lost life will not return to normal no matter what happens.
I was frightened by the fact that my own frivolous action, even though it had been frivolous,
 ...had stolen a life that could never be revived again.
And, out of pity for the lost life, I cried.
{n}Out of fear of myself, who had made it become lost, I cried even more.
I was sure that Grandfather would also cry at the loss of his precious vase.
I was sure that all of the people who thought fondly of Grandfather would cry too, when they saw him like that.
By just the loss of a single life, the whole world would be filled with so much sadness.
......I cried even more at how terrible that would be.
{f:5:Beatrice} appeared, and spoke.
"Then, Milady.
 Let us revive this vase with magic.
 If that will make everyone happy, then the vase and the magic and the spirits...
should be happy to lend you their power, and return it to its original form."
"Come, Milady.
 Close your eyes, and say the chant with me..."
"Come, try closing your eyes.
 And try to remember.
 What form did you have?
 It was surely a very, very beautiful form.
 Please, show me that form one more time..."
Those words of power powerfully knocked on the door to Hades.
Her previous magic had powerfully knocked on the door to Hades in the same way.
......However, back then, it was horribly violent, ...and earned the displeasure of the peacefully sleeping dead...
However, this time was different.
 ...It was very powerful, ...but it was very kind and loving.
The dead near the door opened their eyes,
 ......and called out to the other dead that there was a voice calling for someone to come back.
...The sadness of that voice calling from the outside touched the hearts of the dead,
 and trying to respond as quickly as possible, they searched for Shannon\'s lost soul...
And then,
 .........they found it.
{n}They found the casket in which Shannon was peacefully sleeping.
It truly was Shannon\'s soul, sleeping in the land of the dead.
{n}......Inside a casket that was covered with rose petals frozen with frost, she was sleeping in peace...
The dead silently lifted that casket up.
...While it looked like a funeral march at a glance, it had the complete opposite meaning.
It was solemn, but filled with joy.
...It reminded the long‐forgotten dead...
that they continue to be loved even after their deaths,
 ......and gave them all a warm sense of peace......
Then, ...as though guided by a warm light from the heavens, ...Shannon\'s body floated up out of the casket...
The dead watched her go.
 ......They squinted at that warm light,
 giving their respect to this unknown member of the living, who had continued to hold onto his love for a person even after her death...
Shannon\'s body was sucked into the light in the heavens, and began to disappear...
In the jet‐black darkness of the land of the dead, the faint flickering of gold butterflies could be seen.
...It reminded them of the gentle stars in the night sky, which they had long forgotten...
"........................hh!"
George remembered being told that he must not say anything, and he hurriedly covered his mouth.
However, it felt like his heart was trying to jump out of his throat.
{n}......Because he had seen Shannon\'s eyelids shake slightly.
And then, ...those eyelids slowly opened.
 Shannon\'s eyes were there, but they were still covered in the frost of the land of the dead.
However, ......the warmth of the human world...no.
 ......The warmth of her loved one, who had called her soul back, slowly dissolved that frost,
 .........and her eyes gradually regained their sparkle.
Then, .........her eyes moved, ...and recognized George.
"......George......san..............."
As her lips shook weakly,
 ......Shannon definitely said that.
The words were very faint.
{n}So much so that they normally wouldn\'t even have reached his ears.
......However, George clearly heard them.
.........He heard his loved one, his fiancée, the one he loved most who should have been dead,
 call his name once again...
"Shannon,
 .........Shannon.........
can you...
...recognize me.........?"
"...George‐sa...n......
 .........Is this...a dream.........?"
"No.
 This isn\'t a dream.
 ......See, look, ......even if I pinch, you don\'t wake up."
As George said that, he softly pinched Shannon\'s cheek.
......It was how George had always responded in the past, when Shannon had been surprised by something and had asked if she was dreaming.
When Shannon felt the warm touch of George\'s finger on her cheek...
{n}......And when George realized that the warmth of a living person had already returned to the cheek of his beloved...
......They both cried.
...With what words should a pair of lovers separated by death celebrate their reunion?
 ......The words of the human world are not enough to celebrate that.
In short, they had no need of the words of this world...
Shannon sat up, and the two of them simply wordlessly hugged each other.
Shannon still didn\'t have much strength in her, and putting her arms around George\'s back took all she had,
 ......so George hugged her tightly to make up for that.
To stop her from ever again going to a place beyond his reach,
 he hugged her so tightly, and yet so gently......
Shannon\'s fingers curled around George\'s back,
 ......and on her ring finger indeed shone the engagement ring George had given her.
That strong sparkle was absolutely not the sparkle of diamond alone.
{n}......There was, without doubt, a magical power there that only the two lovers could possibly feel.
It was because that strong light existed...that they had been able to find her casket in the land of the dead.
Beato understood.
......That ring, ......no.
............The couple\'s feelings, in the form of that ring, had created this miracle.
In that moment, George had definitely used magic.
 Beato had done nothing more than help him along.
 That magic had a magical power that could only reside in those who knew of the importance of life and trying their hardest.
It was the power of a miracle that an Endless Witch could not know, ......that only the power of the {i:finite} could give rise to.
By now, she had no choice but to accept it.
 ......She had to accept that true magic, true magical power...
...existed in the place farthest away from she who called herself a Great Witch.
".........{f:5:Beatrice}...sama......"
"......She brought you back to life...
 Thank you, {f:5:Beatrice}...!"
"No.
 I could not do anything.
 ......What revived Shannon...was your magical power.
 Your magic.
 ............I have indeed witnessed here the Ushiromiya blood, capable of achieving miracles."
".........George‐san was the one who......brought......?"
"...Mm.
 .........He had a phenomenal magical power, so much so that I could not reach up to his feet.
 ......So I still have not left the level of apprentice, then.
 ...Now I finally know my place."
Beato staggered backwards.
{n}...Her physical strength was clearly exhausted.
She had humbly said that George\'s power alone had revived Shannon, but Beato had also used all of her magical and physical strength.
...And she reflected upon how difficult it was to revive a single one of these lives,
 which she had toyed with however she wanted in the past.
The couple kept each other in their tight embrace, and showed no signs of letting go.
 ...Feelings that couldn\'t be communicated with a billion words were thus communicated between them...
"Thank you, {f:5:Beatrice}.
 ...We are in your debt..."
"...Thank you very much, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.
 ......I will never forget that it was you who let me meet with George again."
"......Enough, enough.
 Being thanked by a pair of lovers is far too embarrassing for one who has been feared as an extreme savage.
 ......Don\'t worry...about me.
 ...Take all the time you want.........celebrating your reunion together........."
Beato, who was leaning her back against the wall, slid down the wall, and sat.
 How many centuries had it been since she had last grown this tired from using magic?
......Probably, not since the time I first succeeded in magic.
.........Didn\'t Master praise me for that back then?
Oh, but, I myself killed that master who praises me, didn\'t I...
......Don\'t be naive, {f:5:Beatrice}.
...In the end, that\'s what it means to kill something, right...?
"......Finally,
 ...it seems you\'ve remembered how to use magic."
"...............My whole head...feels parched and suffocated, ......and I can\'t even think, let alone remember...
 ...Wait, ...didn\'t I kill you?
 You shouldn\'t be appearing..."
"You have let me live until now.
 That is why I can appear like this.
 ......However, I did not come here to pat you on the head."
"......Did you come here just to sneer at how pathetic I am?
 ......And after all this time, after retiring as a witch and everything, ...if I sit here and have my head patted, I\'ll be the laughingstock of the other witches......"
"That\'s right.
 ......Not only are you a full adult, but you boast about having retired from active service,
 so I am sure that it would be far too embarrassing to tell anyone that you only just now learned how to use magic."
"............Yeah.
 ......Keep it a secret, Masteer..."
With a sense of pleasant despondency, Beato gazed at the couple hugging each other.
"Love, huh.
 ...............I\'m no match..."
"45, data received.
 Firing preparations complete.
 Ammo selected, now loading."
"410, firing.
 Nihi!"
The golden serpentine arrow fired by the Chiesters...
weaved its way through the bushes in the rose garden,
 weaved its way through the hedges,
 and climbed the stone steps towards the mansion\'s entrance,
 aiming for the keyhole.
It weaved through the corridors,
 and flew into the keyhole in the door to the parlor...!
"......Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh?!?!"
It happened in an instant.
 ...It would have been difficult for Beato, who was completely worn out, to have noticed it beforehand.
Right before Beato\'s eyes, the gold snake that flew in through the keyhole...
spun circles around the two lovers,
 and pierced through their two hearts in a blink of an eye.
......And with meticulous precision, that gold snake ran through that hole in Shannon\'s chest once more...
The two had been pierced through the heart by the gold snake,
 ...no, by the gold sewing thread used by the new brutal witch\'s furniture,
 .........and it had only taken an instant, so unfitting for the amount of effort it had taken to revive Shannon...!
In front of Beato\'s shocked eyes, the two collapsed onto the floor...
".........G‐
......George......
.........Shannon..............."
"......Thank you,
 ...{f:5:Beatrice}......
 ...For letting us meet,
 ...even just for a short while,
 ......thank you........."
George spent his last breath thanking Beato, and died side by side with the one he loved.
The gold snake, which still sewed the two in place, spun like a large cyclone, revolving around the inside of the parlor.
.........It was searching for further kills in that room.
Then, the tip of the snake met Beato\'s gaze...
{n}In that instant, Beato prepared herself for death.
Just then, {f:5:Virgilia} stood in front of her, the fingers of both her hands drawing a mark.
In that instant, gold‐colored gold leaf buried the inside of the parlor.
{n}It was like a blizzard of gold...
"Beato, escape while you can!!
 {i:No one can escape} from the Chiesters\' golden bow!!!"
"410, target lost!!
 Nihyah, magical chaff!!"
"45, understood...!
 Modifying enemy search: personal image homing algorithm.
 Target reacquired, data link to 410."
"410, data received.
 Too slowww nyeh, Predecessor‐samaa!!
 Here it comes here it comes here it comes,
 ...IMPACT!!"
The Chiester Sisters\' golden bow would not let its kill escape.
{n}It would not let them block it.
...No magical barrier could even dream of blocking it without being multilayered.
The weak point during the instant of confusion caused by {f:5:Virgilia}\'s deception magic was Beato\'s only chance to escape.
And the only opportunity to make the sisters confuse {f:5:Virgilia} for Beato.
As {f:5:Virgilia} spread her arms wide, blocking the way to her beloved disciple, the gold snake pierced straight through the location of her heart...
The snake, which had snuck in through the keyhole, shot through George and Shannon, and then shot through {f:5:Virgilia} in an instant,
 completely failed to notice as Beato escaped...
As soon as {f:5:Virgilia} saw that Beato had gotten away, she expired.
......The strength left her body, and like gold dust drifting with the wind, her form was erased...
Beato completely erased all traces of her magical power,
 became gold butterflies, and passed through the wall, escaping to the wind and rain outside......
"..................Damn it,
 .........damn it, damn it...
 ......You bitch,
 ......you biii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}iiitch...!!"
Beato felt sick from the bottom of her heart.
Why?
 Because she had been attacked by the new witch?
Probably...not.
 Of course, she also felt sick over the loss of her master.
But even more than that, Beato was enraged at the barbarism which had boorishly stolen the union between the two reunited lovers.
......Beato had poured out almost all of her magical power to reunite them.
...That miracle had been achieved only as a result of all that,
 ......yet it had taken such a short time to steal it away...!
Beato trembled at the barbarous cruelty which had ended it so fast.
......And it was also the true form of the acts she herself had committed up until that point...
So just as strongly as Beato hated the new witch, she looked at her previous self with disgust.
But now she had to escape...
{n}......If she was targeted next, she would probably lose her life.
And it wouldn\'t even be funny if the chess player, descended like a god,
 ended up being attacked and killed by the pieces.
"45, impact confirmed, target scattered.
 ......W‐without a doubt, we crushed the Predecessor...!"
"Our pile of kill medals is gonna get bigger yeeeet again nyeh.
 Nihi!"
"What was that about loving couples?
 You get to enjoy them thrice—once tearing the two apart, once reuniting them, and once tearing them apart again...right?
 *cackle*hihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hhihi!"
"And I feel great about getting to say goodbye to that fussy‐as‐fuck old hag at the same time.
 ......Ronove, you don\'t have any complaints, right?"
"......Why, of course not,
 {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama."
"She interfered with the ritual of the witch\'s epitaph, you see?
 She revived a sacrifice from the first twilight without permission, and interfered with my ritual.
 No one has aaany right at all to complain."
"Kuhhihihihhyahyahyahya...!
 Sucks that she doesn\'t leave a corpse behind though.
 ......I was thinking of torturing that old hag to death over and over again endlessly.
 Kuhhi{0}hihya{0}hyahya...!!"
"........................"
"G‐George did...?!
 He didn\'t show up, when did he come down?!"
"......Wh‐when...?
 What time was that, again...?"
"I think...it was probably about four or five.
 ...It was at least an hour ago..."
"We got sleepy, and probably dozed off after that...
 But I think Jessica probably has it right.
 About one or two hours ago."
"I, I also remember it being around that time.
 Because I was asked whether I wanted more coffee..."
Something hard to believe had happened...
Apparently, when Auntie Eva had left for a second to visit the lavatory,
 Uncle Krauss and Aunt Natsuhi had disappeared.
There\'s no way they went hiding somewhere.
 Of course, the doors and windows had all been rigorously checked, and all were locked from the inside.
 Not one of them was broken.
And that wasn\'t just the first floor—the second floor was the same.
 Also, all of the doors and windows were designed in such a way that they couldn\'t be locked from the outside.
...In other words, there was no way that Uncle Krauss and Aunt Natsuhi had gone outside.
{n}......And yet, they couldn\'t be found.
Furthermore, they weren\'t the only ones who had disappeared......astonishingly, George‐aniki had too.
George‐aniki had left saying that he was going to get more coffee,
 and had gone downstairs more than an hour earlier.
I\'d been under the impression that he was having a good conversation with Auntie Eva and the rest,
 ......but Auntie Eva, who had been in the lobby the whole time, said that no one had come down.
Since all of the doors and windows are locked from the inside,
 ...it\'s hard to imagine that they went outside.
......Nevertheless, three humans had evaporated from this barricaded guesthouse, which had become a perfect locked room......
It\'s hard to imagine any reason why they\'d hide themselves away for a surprise prank in a situation like this.
......It\'s probably appropriate to think that they\'ve become caught up in this crime...
When Auntie Eva learned that her only son was missing,
 she went half insane, running from room to room and yelling his name loudly.
...And Jessica, who had suddenly lost both of her parents, followed suit.
Cries of "George, George" and "Mom, Dad" were even now continuing to echo through the guesthouse...
I think George said something about wanting to see Shannon\'s face.
......It would be reasonable to imagine that he had snuck out of the guesthouse and gone to the mansion.
...However, I don\'t know about Uncle Krauss and Aunt Natsuhi.
{n}...Maybe they guessed that\'s what happened, and went to the mansion to search for him...?
Without even telling Auntie Eva...?
At this rate, it\'s only a matter of time before we start talking about leaving the guesthouse to search for them.
.........At this point, I\'d be in favor of that.
We said that shutting ourselves up inside the guesthouse would be safe,
 and shut ourselves in this morning as a big, happy family of twelve people.
And yet, now there are only four people here.
 ......In other words, being here does not imply safety...
However, ...there\'s something even more important that we mustn\'t forget.
{n}That\'s the fact that all of the doors and windows were locked from the inside.
......This is a locked room.
{n}How had they vanished from this place?
We\'d searched around thoroughly.
{n}However, we were unable to find any signs of anyone hiding.
...The three of them had almost certainly been taken outside the guesthouse.
".........I wonder how they did it...
 You don\'t think......there might be something like a hidden door?"
"A hidden door...?"
"...The doors and the windows are impossible to lock from the outside by construction.
 Even using a fishing line of some kind, it would probably be impossible with the way they are constructed.
 In that case, it\'s probably reasonable to think that they left through somewhere other than a door or a window..."
".........You\'re right.
 That does make logical sense.
 ......No one can be sure that no hidden doors exist.
 ...However, before leaping to that conclusion, I suspect a much simpler possibility."
"And...what would that be......?"
For some time, Battler had been opening windows, opening the shutters, and checking outside,
 and repeating this for each window.
".........Hmm.
 ...This window sure is quiet.
 ...I see, unlike the other windows, the building\'s construction means that the wind doesn\'t blow into this one."
"It appears that way...
 It feels strange that no wind or rain comes in, even though there is so much of it outside."
"Doctor Nanjo.
 ...When I opened the window just now, did you hear a sound?"
"Huh?
 ......No, I did not notice it...
 I believe it is well oiled."
"In other words,
 it would be possible to slink out through this hall window, which no one was watching.
 Furthermore, the wind doesn\'t blow in through this window,
 so the air pressure wouldn\'t cause the curtains or a door to make a sound.
 ......It\'d be quiet."
Battler leaned out and looked at the ground below.
{n}...He was searching for some sign that George had jumped down.
......But at a glance, he didn\'t see any mark like that on the grass in the middle of the pouring rain.
"......There might also be a window like this on the first floor.
 It is possible to go outside without anyone noticing."
"However, not only the doors, but the windows too were all locked, and the shutters were even down as well, correct...?
 It is possible to go out, but it would be impossible to lock up..."
"But they can be locked, see?
 Just like this, click."
Battler closed the window and locked it, as though this was perfectly obvious.
"............B‐......Battler‐san, you aren\'t saying..............."
"If someone inside locked it in the end, this locked room is as easy as pie."
"B‐but that means,
 .........that means,
 ......ooooooohhhh......"
Nanjo turned pale and shook his head several times.
 ...Because the thing that Battler said was presenting a certain truth to him that was frightening even to imagine...
"......That\'s {i:if} they used the trick I thought of, of course?
 However, with this trick, only a very limited number of people can be suspected."
He didn\'t want to say it in front of Nanjo, ...but after eliminating Jessica, who had been with him the whole time,
 ...the only ones who could have done it were Nanjo...and Eva.
"I, ...I would not do anything of the sort...!
 Y‐yes, I can swear it...!!"
"......In this case, it would become a battle between Auntie Eva and you for an alibi.
 ...We\'d just have to suspect both of you,
 and confine the two of you separately."
".........To say it the other way around, this might be an effective trick if there were more survivors,
 but since our numbers have shrunk so much, it isn\'t particularly effective at all."
...No, in fact, there\'s a chance they could dig their own grave with it.
......It should have been more expedient to make it look like the culprit was outside,
 and to intentionally leave a door unlocked, or break a window...
"............If this disappearing act had taken place midday today,
 I\'d have probably announced this theory with full confidence.
 ...But at this stage, I\'m not confident at all.
 ............What\'s going on here?
 ...What the hell does it {i:mean}?
 .........This "locked room"......"
"Y‐......you don\'t think, umm........."
"Hmm?
 What is it, Doctor Nanjo?
 ...Even if it\'s just a thought, please say it."
Because Doctor Nanjo looked like he was trying to swallow his words despite having thought of something, I urged him on.
After he refused several times, saying that it was just a foolish idea, he finally said it out loud.
"......Well, umm,
 ............you don\'t think this actually might be...
...the work of the witch...?"
"R‐...ridiculous.
 There\'s no way witches exist."
"......The witch is trying to make her case to us.
 ...She must be showing us that she can do things that humans cannot,
 ...trying to make us accept her as a witch."
"...To me, this disappearance from the locked room of this entire guesthouse......feels like that kind of message from the witch......
 ............I must not think of it.
 Surely, it cannot mean anything.
 ...Oooh, ......I, ...I am frightened......"
As Doctor Nanjo shook with fear, it looked like he was he was trying to erase the fearsome thoughts that he kept imagining, one after the other.
......When we went downstairs, Auntie Eva and Jessica were enraged,
 and were each making a lot of noise about leaving this place and searching for their respective families.
It was a desire that naturally hits those who can no longer see their family.
Auntie Eva told Doctor Nanjo and me to stay here, but I shook my head and started walking.
".........I\'ve had enough of being shut up in here.
 ...I\'ve started wanting to breathe some outside air."
"Yeah, and if we\'re going, let\'s go right now...!!
 I\'m sick as hell of staying shut up in this place...!!
 Let\'s go and find Mom, Dad, and George nii‐san as fast as we can...!!"
The blood had all risen to Jessica\'s head.
{n}...I hope it doesn\'t set off her asthma.
"Anyone who wants to stay behind can do that themselves.
 But we are going to search outside...!"
"What about you, Doctor Nanjo...?
 Gonna watch the place by yourself...?"
"N‐no...
 Please allow me to join you..."
If the alternative was holing up alone in a guesthouse whose security was by no means guaranteed,
 it would be better to be in a danger zone as a group of four people.
Auntie Eva was holding the gun.
 Moving separately from her was almost like asking to be made into the next victim.
In this way, the four of us decided to leave the guesthouse.
......We\'d barricaded ourselves in, saying we\'d be safe if we did, ......and then lost eight people.
It was almost as though this had been nothing more than a holding cell from which the sacrifices could be killed one after another.
We removed the chain, unlocked the front door, and opened it.
It was already pitch black out.
 While there were some lights outside which dimly lit the pathway,
 ......they didn\'t have enough power to illuminate the darkness that some suspicious person was likely to be hiding in.
"I\'m going...!
 If you fall behind, you\'re on your own, okay...?!"
Still holding her gun, Auntie Eva dashed out without an umbrella.
Jessica followed after her.
After looking at each other, Doctor Nanjo and I chased after them.
...What in the world is happening in this mansion, on this island?
Since yesterday, I\'ve just been shut up in the cousins\' room in the guesthouse with the rest of my cousins.
 So I don\'t know anything about what\'s been going on outside.
Just what has been happening in those places I don\'t know about...
outside the room, in the mansion, and on this island?
......Everything is occurring, everything is proceeding,
 ...and everything is ending without my knowing it.
Somewhere in my heart, I had already begun to give up.
...Most likely, ......not one of us will see tomorrow morning.
When the seagulls cry, none shall be left alive..."Dad.........Mom......!!
 Who would do something like this...?!!
 Waaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaahhh...!!"
Jessica\'s woeful voice echoed throughout the rose garden...
Perhaps it was the intuition of a person who lived on this island.
...After Jessica had looked in the rose garden where Auntie Rosa and Maria had fallen and seen nothing,
 she had gone to look in the arbor next.
Normally, the arbor was probably a wonderful location to enjoy tea peacefully while appreciating the roses on a good sunny day.
......Who knows, maybe even Uncle Krauss and Aunt Natsuhi...
had their days where they relaxed and enjoyed tea together there.
......In that arbor lay the bodies of Uncle Krauss and Aunt Natsuhi.
At least they weren\'t drenched in the rain like Auntie Rosa and Maria had been,
 but there was no way I could say that out loud to Jessica at that moment...
"......What do you think, Doctor Nanjo?"
"Str‐...strangulation, I believe.
 ...Take a look at this.
 On their necks, there are distinct markings that something thin was used to strangle them."
"Right.
 ......I doubt that these things were the primary cause of their deaths."
...The two stake‐like weapons decorated with an occult design that were lying on the ground...
had been found driven into Uncle Krauss\'s thigh area,
 and near Aunt Natsuhi\'s calf.
When we had found these sticking out of my parents\' forehead and chest,
 we had decided to leave them exactly as they were for the police and to preserve the crime scene,
 ......but Jessica no longer cared about such matters, and immediately pulled the stakes out of her parents\' forsaken bodies.
"......So we\'ve found all five gouged corpses now, in the head, chest, stomach, knee, and leg."
"Uuuuhhhghhhhuu, shit, shit shit!!
 I\'ll frickin\' kill that murderer, kill him!!
 UwaaAA{0}AAaa{0}aaHHH...!!"
"......Everything as far as the eighth twilight is finished now.
 ...Is this going to continue onto the ninth twilight?
 ......The witch revives, and none shall be left alive."
"Bring it on, dammit...
 ......When it says the witch revives,
 ...that means the culprit\'s gonna make his grand appearance, right?!"
"Bull{i:shit} no one\'s gonna be left alive...
 ......I\'ll kill him myself...!
 I\'ll make sure I kill whoever murdered Mom and Dad, with my own two hands...!!"
Jessica howled furiously, her emotions laid bare.
 ......To avoid being crushed by her grief, she could do nothing but resist it with anger.
".........We still...haven\'t found George.
 ...Jessica‐chan, and the rest of you, you can stay here if you want.
 I\'ll go to the mansion."
"E‐Eva‐san, we mustn\'t split up...!!
 It is dangerous if we do not all stick together...!"
"There\'s nothing we can do for Nii‐san or his wife.
 But George may be still alive somewhere...!
 I have no time to waste here...!!"
As Auntie Eva screamed this, Jessica glared at her.
...Auntie Eva had no more time to bother about the dead.
{n}She was more concerned for the safety of her only son, who was yet to be seen.
"Jessica‐chan, you should stay by your father and mother\'s side.
 I\'ll make a short trip to the mansion.
 Battler‐kun and Doctor Nanjo, you two can stay here with her as well."
After saying this and leaving no time for debate, Auntie Eva rushed out of the arbor.
I called out for her to stop, but there was no way she would listen.
...However, by now, being alone in this situation meant nothing short of death.
If we silently watched her leave, it would be the same as letting her die.
{n}As long as Auntie Eva was unwilling to stop, we would have no choice but to follow her.
......And, while it may be cruel to say so,
 Uncle Krauss and Aunt Natsuhi were already dead,
 so there was nothing more we could do for them...
In the end, we had no choice but to console Jessica and head for the mansion together.
...Fortunately, Jessica stood up.
Perhaps she had been able to draw a line under her grief for the moment.
 ......But, what had surfaced in its place was an expression like a demon.
"...I\'ll murder \'em with my own hands, ......I\'ll avenge my parents, just you wait.........
 ......Let\'s go, Battler.
 If we find whoever did this, don\'t get in my way.
 I\'m definitely gonna kill them...!!"
".........I also have my parents to avenge.
 Sorry, but this is first come, first served."
"...Yeah, ...that\'s right...
 ......Let\'s make mincemeat of that bastard!"
At my words, Jessica finally seemed to feel like someone had sympathized with her emotions.
She still had that dark expression, but I felt Jessica regaining some of her sanity.
We took off.
{n}Chasing after Auntie Eva.
Through the rose garden,
 up the stone steps,
 running at full speed towards the mansion......whose large, intimidating shadow flashed in the lightning.
......With this, the epitaph murders had finished the eighth twilight.
{n}And now, on the ninth twilight, the witch will revive.
{n}...None shall be left alive.
I will most likely lose my life.
......But at the very least, I wanted to burn the truth into my eyes.
{n}That was the only thing motivating me to move at that moment.
We were able to reunite with Auntie Eva, who was having trouble with the lock to the front door.
It seemed that all the blood had risen to Auntie Eva\'s head.
{n}That was probably making her fingers clumsy.
It seemed she couldn\'t even handle the simple task of inserting the key into the lock.
...Then, there was a faint sound.
The sound of the door unlocking.
 Just as though it had waited for all of the survivors to unite before opening.
......It seemed to me as though the malicious mansion...
was trying to swallow all of the remaining humans at once...
The stench that erupted outwards at the instant the door opened,
 ...could it really be explained as just a smell?
It wasn\'t just the charred smell from Grandfather.
......I think it may also have contained something like...
regrets, held by so many dead, including our parents, and all of the servants.
...What did it mean as it billowed out, overwhelming us?
......Was it the cry of the dead, telling us not to enter?
However, Auntie Eva didn\'t even flinch at something like that.
......And we who had to chase after her...
were forced to step into the mansion, despite receiving that message...
"George?!
 George!!
 If you can hear me, answer!
 Geoooooorge!!"
Auntie Eva shouted at the top of her lungs.
......Considering the situation, it\'s probably far too optimistic to imagine that he\'s alive.
When we also started following Auntie Eva\'s example and calling George‐aniki\'s name in loud voices...
...Auntie Eva found something, and stopped walking.
She was standing in front of the door to the parlor.
".........What is this.........?
 D‐Doctor Nanjo, could you come here for a second......?"
"Wh‐what is it......?"
I had heard from the adults about the creepy magic circles that had been drawn on doors such as the one to the parlor.
......Creepy was the only word to describe that thing,
 which had been scrawled there with a deep‐red paint reminiscent of blood that slowly dripped down.
However, that had supposedly been there since this morning.
......Wondering why Auntie Eva, who had seen it already,
 would think it odd now, Jessica and I stared at the door...
"......Certainly, .........I have no memory of numbers such as these being written here."
"Right, they weren\'t.
 ......The creepy magical text was written here, but not the numbers."
From what the two of them said, only a magic circle had been there here this morning.
However, right now, there were eight digits newly written in the upper part of the magic circle.
07151129.
...I didn\'t know what it meant,
 but I didn\'t even want to imagine the thought process of whoever wrote this.
It was drawn with what was probably the same paint as the magic circle,
 ...but it had clearly been written very recently.
The way it had dried and the condition of the color was completely different from the magic circle part.
".........pfeh.
 I\'m sure it just has some magical meaning.
 It\'s pointless to rack our brains over it."
Jessica intentionally spat those words out in an attempt to wipe out how creepy it was.
"It...could be a magic {i:square}.
 ......The idea that a ward against evil can reside in a certain form of number play.
 I am sure you have all heard of the one where adding all of the numbers in each row leads to the same sum..."
"Wasn\'t that a group of numbers filled inside a square?
 This is just a single row.
 I don\'t have a clue what it could mean."
"......What Jessica‐chan said is probably correct.
 There isn\'t any point in us thinking about it deeply..."
Even though she said that, she probably suspected that it might actually mean something.
Using an old receipt or something from inside her pocket,
 Auntie Eva deftly wrote that number down with a short ballpoint pen.
Because an eight‐digit number would probably be a little difficult to memorize, unless it had some kind of pattern.
.................................
"......Couldn\'t...
...this be a date,
 ......or something?"
"A date...?
 What are you talking about...?"
"Well, ...it\'s probably a coincidence,
 but my birthday...
is July 15th.
 ...Once I thought that 0715 might refer to July 15th,
 I figured that if 1129 stood for November 29th, maybe that\'d fit perfectly..."
"............Why would your birthday be written in a place like this?
 And what\'s up with November 29th...?"
"That\'s what I wanna know...
 Still, ...it\'s probably just a coincidence.
 When I thought about it, it started to feel a little creepy."
"......Is November 29th someone\'s birthday or something?
 It\'s not anyone in my family, not Dad or Kyrie‐san or Ange.
 And of course, not my mom either."
"I cannot think of anything...
 ...I don\'t believe it is Kinzo‐san\'s or Genji‐san\'s birthday."
"It isn\'t from my family either.
 And it isn\'t Rosa\'s or Maria‐chan\'s."
"It\'s not anyone in mine, either...
 And it isn\'t Kanon‐kun\'s or Shannon\'s."
"......I always give the servants presents on their birthdays, so I know it for all of them,
 but I don\'t know anyone who was born on November 29th..."
Once we started imagining that the eight digits, which we had thought were meaningless,
 were actually two dates written together, it really started to look that way.
......However, its true meaning may be something completely different, or there may be no meaning at all.
Anyway, since we don\'t have any real clue, it\'s probably pointless to stand around here analyzing it.
......More important was the inside of the parlor.
This morning, behind each of the doors with a magic circle drawn on them, there had been the body of a victim.
...And now that a number had been newly added to the door, what new thing {i:had been added} inside the parlor?
When Auntie Eva tried to open it, she felt the resistance of the lock.
{n}She immediately took out a master key, and put it in the keyhole.
As soon as she opened the door, ......Auntie Eva let out a high‐pitched scream and ran inside.
That alone was enough to tell us what had happened inside the room...
Doctor Nanjo and I looked at each other, and I shook my head slightly as we entered the parlor...
"George!!
 Geooooorge!!
 Speak to me...!!
 Geoooooooooorge!!
 Doctor Nanjo, quickly!!"
George‐aniki had fallen alongside Shannon‐chan\'s body.
His chest was stained bright red.
 And from his still‐opened eyes,
 ...all my condolences to Auntie Eva,
 ......but I couldn\'t pick up any signs of life.
After moving to take his pulse,
 ...Doctor Nanjo shook his head, wordlessly reporting that George‐aniki was dead.
Brushing him aside, Auntie Eva once again crouched beside George‐aniki,
 and started crying at the top of her lungs...
With this, ...Aniki\'s death, one thing had become certain.
The murders would not be ending at the eighth twilight.
The epitaph was going to be carried out in its complete form, including the ninth twilight, "and none will be left alive"...
I\'m really starting to lose the plot.
...For some reason, Auntie Eva\'s half‐insane cries and appearance actually made me cool down...
...Crestfallen and exhausted, I flopped onto the sofa,
 and plunked my feet on top of the table.
Maybe all of these murders have paralyzed my heart.
 ......Instead of fright, the stronger emotion I\'m feeling is one of complete confusion.
Dad and Kyrie‐san have died, and starting with the servants, people have been killed off one by one.
 ...And at one hell of a pace, too.
I don\'t know what time the first murders started,
 ...but I\'d say we\'re probably being killed at a rate of about one person an hour.
We believe that the boat will come for us around nine tomorrow.
 ......There\'s still a full twelve hours until then.
...How many more sacrifices to the witch would there have to be for us to survive...?
With the four of us, if one goes each hour, ...we won\'t last any longer than four hours.
 It\'s not clear anymore if we\'ll even last until midnight tonight...
......Yesterday, after lunch, we came into this parlor.
At about the time that the discussion had turned to the black tea that Auntie Rosa said she bought,
 we kids had started talking about going to take a walk.
......Maria was fooling around.
...Didn\'t Shannon‐chan bring us some cookies?
She said that Kumasawa‐san had baked them, or something.
......I\'d probably have laughed my ass off if there had actually been a cooked mackerel one mixed in with them.
............That\'s right, I\'ll never hear Kumasawa baa‐chan\'s mackerel jokes again, will I...
...Oh yeah, if I only remember stuff about Kumasawa baa‐chan, that wouldn\'t be fair to everyone else...
.........Why did Dad and Kyrie‐san...even go outside?
It\'s not like we\'d die from being without food for a day.
...So why did gluttony get ahold of them and make them go to get food?
......I\'ll bet it was my fearless dad who started complaining about being hungry...
Kyrie‐san, you were supposed to be the brakes for my reckless dad...
 Why didn\'t you stop him?
.........And what about your daughter Ange...?
...She\'s only six years old.
{n}You weren\'t thinking of entrusting her to me, were you...?
At this point, it\'s doubtful that even I will be able to leave this island alive.........
"St‐stop this...!!
 Why are you fighting at a time such as this...?!
 Jessica‐san, stop...!!"
......Some kind of commotion was interrupting my thoughts.
I looked up to see what it was, and saw that Jessica and Auntie Eva had started fighting each other at some point.
......No, maybe I should say that Jessica was grabbing at Auntie Eva.
"......You killed my mom and dad!!
 There\'s no other explanation!!"
"Don\'t be stupid!!
 How would I know anything about what happened to your parents?!"
"Who was downstairs in the guesthouse?!
 You were!!
 Mom and Dad were in the downstairs lobby, along with YOU!
 Who was left alive?!
 Only YOU!!
 Why?"
"Because you\'re the {i:fucking murderer}, that\'s why goddammit!!
 You killed Mom and Dad, carried them outside, and then shamelessly locked the door,
 trying to make it seem like it was the frickin\' witch\'s doing...!!"
"Then why did George go missing?!
 He didn\'t come downstairs, you know?!
 So did he disappear from upstairs?!"
"Who was upstairs?!
 It was you people who were up there!!
 You knew, didn\'t you?!
 You knew that George slipped out of the mansion!!
 You brazenly made a face as if you didn\'t know anything!!
 If you had stopped George, he would, ......he would...!!!"
"I am telling you to stop...!
 Jessica‐san was in the cousins\' room the whole time!
 And Eva‐san was also in the downstairs lobby the whole time!
 And neither of you are responsible for anything!
 This is only the sadness of losing your family...!!"
"The culprit is no one, is nowhere...!!
 It is all.........just the witch\'s fault, that is all!!
 So you two, please, stop hating one another...!!"
......The witch\'s fault, is it...
{n}I wonder if that\'s a good way to mediate things for now.
Yes, ...I finally understand the meaning of all of the doors and windows having been {i:locked from the inside} when three whole people evaporated from the guesthouse...
This is what they were after.
......Making us think the culprit was inside, ...and causing this ugly mutual hatred...
....had to be the culprit\'s......the witch\'s goal.
............But in that case, how had the culprit {i:locked it from the outside}...?
It\'s certainly true that the master key had been stolen when Dad\'s group was attacked.
...But the doors and windows to the guesthouse...
had been constructed so that you couldn\'t lock them from the outside no matter how hard you tried.
So that master key shouldn\'t mean anything for the guesthouse locked room...
......Jessica and Auntie Eva were turning their sadness at losing their blood relatives into anger at the person in front of them.
Doctor Nanjo was trying to step between them.
......And I sat haphazardly in a sofa staring up at the ceiling,
 ......thinking about things that didn\'t even matter anymore with a worn‐out expression.
............I just couldn\'t believe that this was the same parlor that had been so warm and pleasant midday yesterday,
 ...for just a short time before the typhoon hit......
"GYAAAAaAAaaAAAaaaAAA......
uWAA{0}AAuu{0}ughhaAA{0}AAUU{0}UUgghh{0}hhh...!!"
The sudden sound of a gunshot shook me out of my half‐asleep trance.
...Smoke was rising out of the barrel of the gun Auntie Eva held.
Jessica was rolling around on the floor, covering both her eyes.
Auntie Eva and Doctor Nanjo were looking down at her, shocked...
"A‐are you alright, Jessica‐san...?!
 Jessica‐san...!!"
"UuuAaaaAAAaaaaHHHaHHHhhh,
 oww, owwww, ow...
uuuaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaggghhh...!"
"I‐......it isn\'t my fault...
 Th‐......this happened because you came at me even after I told you to stop...!"
"H‐...hey, hey, what the hell happened, what\'s going on...?!"
Jessica had grabbed at Auntie Eva, and it had turned into a scuffle...
They had then...started fighting over the gun Auntie Eva had been holding?
And some movement or other caused the trigger to be pulled...?
I didn\'t know the details, about whether the bullet had grazed her, or whether she had been burned by the discharge,
 but whatever the case, Jessica was covering both of her eyes, screaming in pain, and rolling around on the floor.
"......It\'s alright, calm down...!
 It is not a serious wound, so get ahold of yourself...!"
"My eyes hurt, it hurts...
 ...I can\'t see,
 ...I can\'t see......!!"
Doctor Nanjo lent Jessica his shoulder, saying that he would tend to her in the servant room.
......The servant room in this mansion apparently had a bed and a first aid kit, and was able to function as an infirmary.
"Damn iiiiiit!!
 You killed Mom and Dad!!
 I\'ll kill you... I\'ll kill you......!!"
"I‐......it wasn\'t me... It wasn\'t me......!!"
"Jessica‐san, you are aggravating the wound, so please, stop struggling...!
 Come, let us go to the servant room..."
Jessica still continued to curse Auntie Eva as her parents\' murderer.
{n}It seemed that Auntie Eva couldn\'t conceal her shock at the fact that she had pulled the trigger, even if it had been an accident.
"...It wasn\'t my fault... That kid jumped at me, that\'s why this happened......
 ......I didn\'t kill anyone..."
"......No, forget that... Who killed George?
 That\'s right, who killed George?!!
 George, Geooooooooooorge!!
 It isn\'t my fault, it isn\'t my fault...!!"
"W‐wait a sec, Auntie Eva...!!
 Don\'t go off on your own!!"
I didn\'t know whether it was because Auntie Eva couldn\'t stand her mistake,
 or whether it was because she had lost herself to anger at the person who had killed her only son,
 ...or whether it was both of those all mixed together.
...In any case, she ran out into the corridor, yelling, fearful, and shouting.
I was also worried about Jessica\'s condition, but anyway, right then, I couldn\'t leave Auntie Eva alone.
Why would she go off on her own in this mansion, of all places? Is she suicidal...?!
Doctor Nanjo took Jessica towards the servant room.
...I chased after Auntie Eva, dashing into the depths of the mansion......
After sitting Jessica on the servant room bed,
 Nanjo told her several times not to rub her eyes, and examined the affected area.
The barrel had probably been near her eyes.
{n}There was a possibility that the flames from the discharge had damaged her corneas.
...There was no threat to her life, but it would probably be necessary to have a suitable doctor look at her as soon as humanly possible.
Nanjo applied emergency first aid, covering the affected area with gauze and wrapping it with a bandage.
 As a result, Jessica completely lost her field of vision...
"Now, pay attention...
 This wound may hurt or itch, but you must not scratch at it or rub it.
 When tomorrow comes, let us go to an ophthalmologist as soon as possible."
"......That bitch, ...she really was trying to kill me...
 If the angle had been just a little bit off, I\'d have been killed by now...
 I\'ll definitely turn her in to the police......!"
"...Eva‐san would not do such a thing.
 That was an accident."
"Accident my ass...!
 She killed Mom and Dad.
 There\'s no way any 19th person or witch exists on this island...!!
 She\'s behind everything.
 She was the only one on the first floor of the guesthouse!"
"George nii‐san must have seen her kill Mom and Dad, and she killed him to keep him silent!!
 It\'s the same with Grandfather and the servants.
 I\'m sure she snuck out of the family conference last night and killed all of them...!!"
"......I‐if that is the case, then we will know as soon as the police investigate."
"The police are incredible, you know—there is nothing that cannot be understood by a forensic investigator.
 ......There is no need for us to suspect or hate anyone.
 The police will resolve everything."
"So for now, Jessica‐san, you should concentrate on resting your body and making things easy on your eyes.
 ...If you wrinkle your forehead too much, it will do no good for your eyes, of course, and nothing for your looks either."
Indeed, when Jessica had grown agitated in her verbal abuse of Eva,
 she had naturally started glaring, and the pressure on her eyes hurt her.
Jessica herself soon realized that the more she talked, the more the wound would hurt,
 and regardless of whether she had overcome her suspicions of Eva, she regained her composure for the time being...
"......She killed them...
 ......Mom and Dad.
 ......And Shannon,
 .........and Kanon‐kun...
 ............Kanon‐kun........."
She had heard that Kanon had been killed in the chapel.
{n}...Jessica still hadn\'t seen his face after he had died.
Jessica was now less fearful about the fact that she might go blind,
 and more frightened that the police would carry Kanon\'s corpse away while she still couldn\'t see,
 and that she would have to say her final farewell without being able to see his face.
Her anger at the culprit, and her sadness at the death of the person she had liked.
{n}...Those mixed emotions provoked her tear ducts.
But right now, tears were actually painful for her,
 so she wasn\'t even permitted to leisurely remember the late Kanon\'s face...
Jessica could do nothing but sit on the bed and let her head droop, withstanding the pain...
"..................
 ...Well, now it is Eva‐san I must be concerned for.
 I hope she isn\'t too shaken by this."
Letting out a small sigh of relief that Jessica had calmed down for the time being,
 he stuck his head out into the hallway to look for any sign of the others coming back.
"..............."
They...met eyes.
{n}Nanjo, unable to understand who this person was, was bewildered for an instant.
"I hear that people who have lost the power of sight have zero anti‐magic power and zero magic resistance.
 In other words, you\'re an isolated pawn right now.
 Understand what that meeeans?"
"......Wh‐......what did you say......?"
There was no possible way that Nanjo could have understood who the person in front of him was.
 ...And there was certainly no possible way that he could ever have understood what she had just said.
".........Doctor Nanjo?
 What\'s going on......?"
Unable to see, Jessica couldn\'t tell what was going on except by whatever voice she heard.
{n}...But since she had heard Nanjo say something with an uneasy tone,
 she tightened up, thinking that something bad might have happened.
"S‐......stop, please......!
 Please don\'t kill me...!!
 I have a sick grandchild...!
 I can\'t die here...!
 For mercy\'s sake, spare me...!!
 HIIIii!!!"
"...Doctor Nanjo...?
 Doctor Nanjo?!"
Jessica couldn\'t do anything except call out from the bed.
{n}...Judging by the tone of his voice, Nanjo was in the corridor, being confronted by someone.
And he was scared.
 There was no doubt that at this very moment, his life was being threatened.
"No, don\'t!!
 HiiiIIIIiIIIII!!!"
"On the ninth twilight, the witch revives, and none shall be left alive.
 Kuhhihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi!!"
The witch pointed the end of her gold staff at Nanjo.
...Even though he didn\'t know what she was planning to do,
 Nanjo imagined that she must be trying to take his life.
"Doctor Nanjo!!
 Doctor Nanjo!!
 Who\'s out there?!
 Answer me!!"
"Please, nooooOoOOOo, ahii{0}ie{0}eeEAAH{0}HHhhh!!"
Bang!
 A sharp sound echoed.
And tapered to a point just as sharp, the elongated tip of the golden staff was stuck straight into Nanjo\'s forehead...
Jessica, who only had her ears to help her try to grasp what was happening, had no clue what was going on.
...But even so, she was able to realize that with that sound, Nanjo had died.
And the person who had killed him was now in the corridor, right in front of the servant room.
{n}...Furthermore, since she couldn\'t see, she wouldn\'t even be able to run away, much less resist.
...Upon discovering that she was in a life‐or‐death situation, caught like a rat in a trap, Jessica felt her blood run cold...
"......Oh, Jessica.
 Poor girl, you injured your eyes.
 ...In that case, you can\'t even escape, can you?
 *giggle*giggle*giggle*.
 ...I\'m gonna play a whole lot with Nanjo\'s corpse now.
 ...When I get bored of that, I\'ll kill you next and play a bunch more."
"......No, wait, it\'s not every day that you get blinded, right?
 ......I won\'t wait until I kill you.
 I\'ll play with you a bunch {i:before} I kill you too.
 ...Kuhhihya{0}hya{0}hya{0}hya...!!
 So wait there shaking for a while, okay?
 As you try to imagine all the ways I\'m playing with Nanjo\'s corpse!!"
"H‐...hiiiiiiiiiiiiii!!!"
Struck with fear, Jessica let out a frail scream.
......She really wanted to scream in a much louder voice, trying to get someone to help her.
But she couldn\'t.
When a person is faced with true fear, it clogs up their throat...
Right now, Jessica could barely even breathe.
"H‐
......help...
 ......Help.........!!
 HiIIiiIiiIIi!!"
She searched around with her hands, trying to find some way to escape.
 But even though she knew this room well, just being unable to see made it like a locked room of darkness.
She bumped into some shelves or something, and some tins of sweets and bottles and things fell down from them, hitting her on the head.
...As she was now, even protecting her head to block them wasn\'t working out.
...She was becoming painfully aware of how very powerless humans become just by losing their sense of sight.
{n}Of course, she had no time to appreciate that.
She crawled around, as best as she could, trying to escape that place,
 but she kept bumping into things that she didn\'t understand, getting hit by various falling objects,
 and it felt to her like the entire room was alive, bullying her and refusing to let her escape.
Then, she heard footsteps from the presence in the hallway.
{n}And then a voice.
......The person had probably peered into the room since Jessica was making so much noise.
"What a racket you\'re making.
 Sit on the bed and wait quietly like a lady.
 \'Cause I\'ll give you a wonderful blood‐red death costume fitting for a lady of class.
 ......Something good enough to make the person who finds you faint, okay?
 Gehhe{0}he{0}he{0}he{0}he{0}he{0}he{0}he{0}heh!!"
"Hii...hiiIIiiIIIIiiiiiiIIIi!!"
Just a short while ago, she had sworn that she would kill the culprit if she found them.
...However, she was now all too powerless.
She couldn\'t do anything except let out feeble screams and crawl around on the floor, bumping her head into the bed and the legs of desks.
"Help... Help......!
 Someone, help......!!
 Dad, ......Mom...!
 Battleeeer......!
 Someone, coooooooome...!!
 .........Help me, ......Kanon‐kun.........!!"
In the corridor, as the witch thought of how to toy with Nanjo\'s life...
......a single gold butterfly secretly watched that scene from the corner of the hallway.
...It was Beato, who had barely escaped with her life once before.
The gold butterfly softly returned to human form.
 ...Its form was faint and transparent like a lace curtain.
Even just the power to hold a human form had become scarce for her.
Right next to her, Ronove also appeared.
"......Jessica will probably be unable to survive.
 ...Although, no one was to be left alive since the beginning."
"..................She has grown feelings of love for Kanon.
 ......I have even toyed with that at times.
 ............However, I know that now to be something shameful for a witch."
"......Love is the single element.
 Romantic love is even more pure, more sacred.
 ...Though, for some reason, you hate it very much, Milady."
".................................
 ......Master told me.
 ...Magic exists to bring people happiness.
 ...I\'m sure that I knew that once."
"......And from the moment I forgot that, I was no longer a witch.
 ......So I...lost the qualifications to be Battler\'s opponent..."
".........Milady, I hesitate to ask, but...
...surely you do not intend to rescue Jessica?
 That would be dangerous."
"I understand...
 Even if I save her, she will become a plaything of the witch\'s banquet when the door to the Golden Land opens."
"......But even so, ...that would be much more compassionate than the way that person would kill her.
 ...The witch\'s banquet steals lives in a terrible way, but it does not do so more than once.
 It does not toy with life and death."
"...However, she is different.
 She kills over and over.
 She kills for fun!
 There is not even a trace of compassion there.
 .........I want to at least save Jessica from that kind of cruel fate."
"......Certainly, by carrying that out, you would probably be praised as a good witch."
"......However, the new {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama already views you as hostile, Milady.
 ...If you were to be seen by her again, ......you are aware, you would have no way to escape this time?"
".......................................
 ......When I reunited George with Shannon,
 .........I finally understood what a witch is,
 and what magic is."
".........I am a witch.
 I must be a witch.
 And I must be acknowledged by Battler as his opponent, ......and I must make him accept me as a witch this time at last."
"......The road to that goal may be long and difficult.
 ...However, if I do not take a step forward here and now, ......I cannot call myself a witch."
"I understand your feelings, but how do you plan to rescue her?
 There are not many forms of magic that your body is capable of now, Milady.
 Did you not have to borrow George\'s power even back when you revived Shannon?"
"......Mm.
 ...And for that very reason, I may be able to save Jessica at least."
"......Right now, she is begging for Kanon to save her.
 ......If I can borrow the power of that emotion, I may be able to knock on the doors of Hades once again with my magical power."
"I am sure you would be able.
 However, you would use up all of your magical power.
 ......If you were to be spotted by the new {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, you would truly be without a method of escape."
"...I am no longer your butler, Milady.
 ......Understand that I cannot assist you if the situation worsens."
"...I know.
 .........By now, I have toyed with and taken more lives than I can count.
 ...So I may not be able to compensate for that sin except by saving the same number of lives."
"......I have nothing to lose in the first place.
 ...I am just a golden butterfly who has passed its name and magic power on, and who is no longer accepted as a witch."
".........What about Battler‐sama?
 You are part‐way through a game with him.
 He has said that he would wait until you returned, Milady."
"...Is it alright for you to expire here?
 ...You have a duty to return to the seat across from Battler‐sama, Milady."
"For that very reason...!
 If there is a life that only I can save, I choose to save it."
"And I will be accepted as a witch.
 ......I must be a witch...!
 If this is a test, it is a very childish one, unfitting for the evils I have committed until now."
"......Go, hide yourself, Ronove.
 Watch what may be the final magic of a single butterfly who used to be called a Golden Witch...!"
"......Certainly.
 ......Please show me magic...
...that will not disgrace the name of the Golden Witch.
 ......I pray that it will not be your last."
"Go, my friend.
 ...If there is enough ink, pen the story of my foolish life, and hand it to some fool attempting to walk the same path.
 Farewell, Ronove...!"
"Kanon‐kun,
 ......where are you...
where are you......
 ...Help me,
 ......help me...
 ...uuuu...u...uuuu..."
.........Milady.
 I am always...waiting by your side.
"K‐......Kanon‐kun......?
 Kanon‐kun......?!"
Jessica thought that she had just heard Kanon\'s voice.
 She looked around with unseeing eyes, but of course, there was no way for her to see anything.
...On the contrary, that action caused her head to hit the desk again.
"......Kanon‐kun, .........Kanon‐kun......
 ...Help me, .........help me........."
Yes, Milady.
 ...I will...help you.
"K‐......Kanon‐kun...?!
 Y‐you were alive...?!"
This time, she thought that she had heard his voice clearly.
{n}Jessica jumped up in surprise, banging her head against the desk once again.
......Milady, please calm your heart and listen.
...Unfortunately, I am not alive.
".........Huh......?"
I have already...died.
......However, ...that witch came to me to tell me of your peril.
...Then, she gave me only a short period of time to help you, Milady.
Please, calm your heart even more.
If you do, ......my form will become visible even to you, Milady...
Jessica obeyed those words.
{n}She chased all idle thoughts from her head, and relaxed her breathing.
......Her heart actually felt like it was going to explode after hearing the voice of the loved one she thought was dead.
She resisted that with all of her strength.
......When she did, ......she could feel that Kanon‐kun really was right in front of her.
......Even though she was unable to see, ......somehow, she was still able to sense him clearly.
"......Can you...see me?
 Milady..."
"Yeah...
 I can see, ......I can definitely see you, Kanon‐kun..."
".........I exist only as a spirit.
 So I cannot touch you, Milady.
 I cannot do anything except talk to you like this.
 ......I am a weak existence which can do nothing more than that, ...but I should be able to be of some aid to you, Milady."
"......Just words, ......that\'s all......?
 I can\'t......touch you, Kanon‐kun......?"
"I am now even more fragile than smoke from a candle.
 ...So much so, that if one of the living such as you were to touch me, I would be wiped away instantly.
 ......So please, don\'t try to touch me.
 ...Because I am also......holding back my desire......to touch you, Milady."
"Ah, .........y‐...yeah..."
"More importantly, Milady.
 ......Please listen well.
 .........The new Golden Witch is the owner of a cruel heart.
 ...She will surely try to make you meet with a horrible end.
 ......You must escape from this room and hide."
"H‐...how...?
 I can\'t...see anything......!"
"Quiet...
 ......I will be your eyes, Milady.
 Please move in accordance with my instructions.
 ......First, please crawl three steps from there, and then stand up.
 You are currently under the desk, Milady.
 If you stand there, you\'ll hit your head."
"...Th‐that was under the desk...?
 I got it... One, two, three...
 ...Standing up..."
"Well done......
 Next, please turn towards nine o\'clock.
 .........Yes, well done."
"Ha, ......haha...
 This is pretty...embarrassing...
 ......Ah, ...ack, ...owowow..."
"Are you alright? Does your wound hurt...?"
"N‐No, ...I\'m fine...
 What next......?"
Jessica thought that if this was a dream, she didn\'t want to wake up.
{n}...And, if she were allowed to, she would have wanted to take off the bandage covering her eyes and see him.
...However, if she did that, surely Kanon would vanish like frail candle smoke, just like he himself had said...
 ......She was afraid of that.
So she satisfied herself with just being able to hear his words once more,
 repressing her desire to see him, to hold him.
So what hurt her eyes now were tears of gratitude.
{n}......Tears of gratitude for the god, ...or else witch, who had given her this miraculous moment.
"...Is this okay...?
 If we keep talking like this, won\'t we be noticed by her?
 Won\'t our voices be heard...?"
"......I have erected a stealth barrier.
 If you don\'t make any loud noises or speak noisily, no one will notice.
 ......That is why no one can notice my presence."
"...I, ...I don\'t really get it, ...but anyway, we\'ll be okay as long as we stay quiet, right...?
 ......Wh‐what should I do next...?"
"Please walk ten steps, slowly, in the direction you\'re facing.
 You will touch the sofa.
 Please continue along that.
 ......Do it slowly.
 ......Stay calm.
 Believe my words."
"Su‐......sure.
 ............Heheh, ...it\'s weird...
 ......Even though it was so scary not being able to see, .........when you\'re with me, Kanon‐kun, it isn\'t scary at all..."
".........Yes, that is the sofa.
 Trace it to the left while advancing slowly...
 There is a table just to the left.
 Be careful not to bump into it with your shins..."
......It was a very, very peculiar and magical team effort.
Even though she would be killed in an instant if she was noticed by the terrible witch,
 ......there was no fear in Jessica\'s heart right then.
She was being protected and guided by Kanon, who she had thought she would never be able to meet with again.
...It was probably only a momentary miracle.
{n}......But even so, Jessica was deeply grateful for it.
If she hoped for too much, she was sure that he would disappear—so, in order not to break this transient miracle...
...and in order to engrave this moment into her heart for all eternity...{0}she slowly...{0}slowly...{0}continued to walk...{0}obeying Kanon\'s voice...
"......Alright, if you walk ten more steps, you will exit the servant room.
 Then, please turn to face nine o\'clock, and keep walking very slowly.
 Put your hand on the wall to your right, and keep on following that.
 ...I will take you to a safe room."
"............If I go there,
 ...will you...
.........leave me again, Kanon‐kun......?"
"..........................."
Kanon didn\'t answer.
{n}...But even his lack of an answer was enough to let her know that was the truth.
"......Then, ......no.
 .........I don\'t want to go..."
"If you stay here, you will be killed by the witch."
"That\'s alright...
 If I\'m killed, I can go to the world where you are, Kanon‐kun..."
"......Milady,
 please be reasonable.
 ......For the dead such as myself, the human world is too bright and painful...
 So I cannot stay for long."
"So Milady, ......with the time I am allowed, ......please permit me to guide you to a safe place.
 ............And after that, .........I will stay with you until my time runs out."
".........Is that...the best you can do, Kanon‐kun......?"
"...Yes.
 .........And in exchange, I will stay by your side for every second I can, Milady.
 ......The whole time, I will be with you, ......and I will talk with you, Milady."
"Talk...about what...?"
"..................What would you like me to talk about...?"
"...Anything...that you\'re willing to..."
"......Well then...
 ............I will tell you the story of a cowardly servant boy without courage.
 .........About a foolish and pitiful boy who felt love for a lady as radiant as the sun, ...and who, even though those same feelings were confessed to him,
 ......lost to his cowardice, and in the end, was not able to be true to himself while he still lived."
"...............Yeah...
 Then, ...I want to tell one too.
 .........The story of a cowardly girl, ......who couldn\'t muster her courage...
...to keep telling the boy she loved just how much she loved him."
"......And, ......about how God gave her a miracle to be reunited with that boy,
 ............and how, when she was given one more chance to muster up her courage, .........she did."
".........I also......want to hear that.
 ......So, for that reason as well, let us go.
 ......To a safe place."
"......Yeah...
 If I could be with you, Kanon‐kun, I would walk however long, however far...
 I don\'t need eyes anymore.
 If you told me to step forward, I would even take a step off a cliff."
"Thank you.
 ...Well then, Milady.
 Let us go.
 The first ten steps."
"No... Not like that.
 ...Not unless you call me............Jessica."
"......Understood.
 .....................Well then, Jessica.
 ...Take the first ten steps."
"Yeah.
 Kanon‐kun......"
Quietly, quietly, Jessica and Kanon snuck slowly out of the servant room.
Directly around the corner, the witch could be seen cruelly looking down upon Nanjo\'s corpse,
 but the witch did not even notice their presence.
However, Ronove, who was waiting at her side, met Kanon\'s eyes.
...Kanon thought "oh no", grimacing and blocking Jessica with his back.
"........................"
However, Ronove did not inform his master.
As though it had been his imagination that he ever spotted him in the first place, he pretended to know nothing.
......No, maybe he did appear to chuckle.
From a finger on one of Ronove\'s hands, which were joined behind his back, a single small gold butterfly appeared,
 flying in front of Kanon as though guiding him.
It was undetectable by the master he served.
Kanon was surprised at the magic that butterfly held.
Because it was far more powerful than the stealth barrier Kanon had.
...He may not have known, but that power had originally been Ronove\'s.
...An imitation of that had been given to Kanon by Kinzo, and that was what Kanon was using now.
As that butterfly of stealth magic scattered gold scales, it grew smaller bit by bit.
 ...It probably wouldn\'t last long.
......But without a doubt, even that would buy them enough time to get far away from the cruel witch.
"Alright, Milady...
 Let\'s follow that wall and keep walking.
 ...On and on.
 And on."
"Yeah.
 ......If I can be with you, Kanon‐kun, ......I\'ll keep on walking, on and on, as far as you want to go..."
Led and protected by the small gold butterfly,
 ...the two who were separated by the wall between life and death slowly walked away towards the end of the corridor...
......There was no way that the evil witch would have any magic to notice their flight.
Until they had already disappeared down the other end of the corridor, the witch never noticed that Jessica had vanished...
By the time the gold butterfly that Ronove had cast out evaporated completely, ...Jessica had reached the parlor.
Even though she would have been able to make it this far in no time if she had been able to see, as she was now, it had been a long, long adventure.
"......Now, Milady.
 We\'ve reached the parlor.
 I will now take you to the bundle of curtains by the window.
 ...If you hide in there, you\'ll surely be safe."
"Inside the curtains...
 Not bad.
 I used to hide in there a lot, long ago."
".........{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama..."
"...Huh?"
Kanon called the witch\'s name.
 Jessica looked around in surprise, but being unable to see, she obviously couldn\'t find the witch...
Beato had appeared once again with a faint form.
{n}Kanon squared off against the evil witch, but Beato\'s expression was soft, ...and actually pitying.
"I don\'t understand what kind of whim drove you to revive me... Your feelings elude me."
"......It was a whim and nothing more.
 ......No, ......this is how witches should be.
 ...It took me one thousand years to realize that.
 ...That is all... A foolish tale."
"Wh‐......who?!
 Who\'s there...?!"
"...Milady, be quiet.
 ......She is the witch, ...{f:5:Beatrice}...
 .........I am in her debt, ......because she let me be with you one more time."
"............The witch.........{f:5:Beatrice}......"
"...I am unimportant.
 I suggest you instead make haste in hiding that girl in the shadows of the curtains.
 .........You probably do not have much time left.
 You should spend it in a final conversation with Jessica."
"...A secret meeting inside a bundle of curtains... You two have quite the sense of style.
 *cackle*cackle*..."
"Uh, umm, ............thank you, {f:5:Beatrice}...!!
 Thank you for letting me be with Kanon‐kun......!!"
Jessica didn\'t know where Beato was, so she said that while facing in the wrong direction.
Perhaps because she found that funny, Beato snickered.
"I will now leave this room to the pair of lovers.
 Evil witches have no need for tales of love, you see.
 Allow me to retreat."
"......{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama...
 ...Thank you very much."
"Hmph...
 .........No need to thank me.
 You know well that something like this isn\'t enough to compensate for all of the evil I have done."
"I give my gratitude to good witches as a parting gift.
 ...I don\'t care about what happened before now, or what will happen in the future.
 ......All I know is that, in this very moment,
 ...you are without a doubt...a good witch."
"......You flatter me, furniture.
 The next time we meet, I may be an evil witch who will not betray your expectations.
 ......And with that, farewell."
Beato left the parlor and closed the door.
And mustering the last of her remaining magical power, she sealed the door.
The fact that those two had escaped into here would eventually be noticed.
...And now that the ninth twilight had been reached, no matter how much they struggled, their inescapable fate had already been decided.
However, until that final moment, they should be permitted the time to speak with each other of their love.
The witch poured out all of her magical power to protect their time together.
......So that no one would be able to defile their time alone together until the final moment.
Just then, ...Beato perceived something.
......Her body had been detected by a magical searching technique.
...The cruelhearted witch\'s furniture had sniffed this place out.
"............So, boorishness is the witch\'s way of doing things...
 To think that she doesn\'t even intend to allow the two young ones to speak to each other of their love...
 ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!!"

 There\'s something I want to ask that old hag."
"410, firing.
 Nihi!"
The Chiester Sisters\' gold bow released a golden snake.
......It crawled down the corridor starting from the front of the servant room, drawing a soft, serpentine curved trajectory as it made for the parlor,
 ...and struck through Beato\'s chest.
"..................guhahh......!!!"
Gold butterflies gathered, and the cruel witch showed herself there along with her furniture.
"......Predecessor‐sama.
 You will not get away with obstructing us a second time."
"......ugh......u......... I never thought I would...
 ......Still, the Chiester Sisters really have gotten rusty.
 To think that they failed to bring me down.
 ...And twice, at that...!"
Ronove spoke in a manner fitting for the witch\'s butler.
{n}As she pushed her pain aside, Beato grinned and spoke back.
"My, my apologies, Predecessor‐sama...!
 We were ordered to avoid vital areas...!"
"As soon as there\'s an order, we can pierce you at any time.
 Through your earring holes, your belly button hole, any hole you like.
 Nihi!"
The gold snake that had shot through Beato grew even longer, drawing a helix like a morning glory vine, and awaited its next order.
...It was ready to pierce a vital spot as soon as the merciless witch told it to.
".........For what reason would someone like you, who is even more brutal than me,
 make them avoid my vital areas?
 New {f:5:Beatrice}...!!"
"I wanted to ask you.
 ...I don\'t know what trick you used to escape, but we were under the impression we had taken you out, you know?"
"Why is it that even though you could have escaped by hiding, you took the risk of appearing again?
 ......It can\'t be that you came back just to protect those two young people, surely?"
"......Well, ...who knows?
 ......*cackle*cackle*...!"
"And just a second ago.
 Why\'d you do something as soft as reviving the lovers and reuniting them?
 ...The more I hear about you, the more I learn that I don\'t even reach up to your feet as an incarnation of evil."
"If you\'re like that, why did you suddenly start acting so mildly?
 ......That\'s what I wanted to ask."
".........*cackle*cackle*!
 Because I am brutal, I am fickle.
 How could there be any meaning in asking that?"
"Chiester Sisters. Sew her."
When she ordered that, the gold snake that was curled in a helix and suspended in space...
moved as fast as a real snake going after its prey,
 and pierced Beato\'s body multiple times from the front and the back, its golden tail drawing a {p:0:×} shape.
As the ruthless witch had ordered, it drew a cross‐stitch through Beato\'s chest.
The gold thread made a squeaking sound and tormented Beato...
Rather than a gold snake aiming for its prey,
 it waited for orders in midair as if it was a sewing needle ready to sew Beato.
"When it comes to you, there\'s no way it was a whim.
 ......I\'ve heard about you.
 And I\'ve learned.
 You are such an incarnation of evil that I don\'t even rise up to your feet.
 I thought I was truly a fitting successor to you."
"......But you\'ve always been in the way.
 You always say warm, pleasant things that shock me.
 ......What changed you?
 You explored the depths of evil for one thousand years,
 so I let you live just to find out...what happened to overturn that millennium?"
"......If you want to know, I suggest you too spend a thousand years finding out.
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*!"
"Sew her."
"Gwaahhhh!!!
 Ackkah, ......gahah!!"
Beato\'s chest was once again sewn with a golden cross‐stitch.
It tightened once again, squeezing fresh blood from Beato\'s chest.
The intense pain it caused ran in conflict with its beauty to the eye.
".........You might actually be another one of those types who disappear when they die and don\'t leave a corpse.
 So I\'ll kill you slowly."
"But if you answer my questions honestly, I\'ll kill you gently.
 I\'ll give you a splendid, gorgeous death perfect for my predecessor.
 I\'ll sink you in a coffin filled with water and roses.
 Isn\'t that wonderful?
 ...And you still won\'t talk?
 About the reason for your change of heart."
"*cackle*cackle*...!!
 Not answering what she is asked is also one of the pleasures of an evil witch."
"Sew her. Twice."
"Gyoah, gwuhaahh.........!!"
"Of course, you don\'t have to answer.
 After all, that way I get to torture you.
 Kuukuhihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi!!"
"The Endless Magic, the Infinite Magic, truly is wonderful.
 ...When you think about it, this world is finite in every way.
 The infinite cannot exist in the human world.
 Because God is infinite, he deprived the human world of all infinities so that he could look down upon it."
"...So, in other words, the power of the infinite is the power of God!
 A wonderful power where the more you play with it, the more fun ways of playing you find!
 You used that power as you pleased for one thousand years and went on a rampage!
 Why are you having a change of heart only now?
 Don\'t tell me you just {i:miss} it now that you handed it over to me?"
"How could I miss it.
 The Endless Magic is not magic as you believe it to be.
 ...True magic is in a deep abyss that you most certainly cannot reach."
"And you realized what that is......?
 What...is it?"
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!
 Wander around for a thousand years without realizing that, you foolish witch."
"Sew her. Three times this time."
"Gwoah, gyuooh, ...guhh...!!!"
They continued embroidering Beato\'s chest with the gold thread.
{n}It tightened even more, causing Beato more and more pain...
"......Well, whatever.
 I\'m not the least bit interested anymore in what deep understanding some good‐as‐dead hag came to.
 I\'m bored now, so I\'ll kill you quickly.
 If I kill you, the barrier to the parlor will be undone."
"......Then I\'ll torture Kanon and Jessica to death a whole bunch of times.
 ......Being able to have two lovers as my toys at the same time, ......sounds fun, right?
 Kuhhi{0}hi{0}hhi{0}hhi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hhi{0}hi{0}hihihi!!
 Kill her...!!!"
Without missing by a millimeter, the gold sewing thread shot through Beato\'s heart...
{n}That intense pain was worse than all of the pain before that put together.
Beato finally remembered the actual feeling of dying, which she had forgotten over one thousand years...
But, .........she couldn\'t die.
 She must not die.
{n}If she died, the two in the parlor would be handed over to the brutal witch.
So she definitely couldn\'t die.
{n}She resolutely...refused to die...!
".........New {f:5:Beatrice}...
 ...I have a request.
 .........The lover\'s meeting between the two in the parlor is to be short.
 .........In the amount of time an hourglass can measure, Kanon will probably disappear to Hades.
 ...Would you please allow them that much time...?"
"No waay.
 Tearing apart two who love each other is fun, isn\'t it?
 You\'re the one who said it.
 So I want to try it!"
"......*cackle*cackle*...
 In that case, I cannot allow you to enjoy that pleasure...
 *cackle*cackle*, it is fun, tearing lovers apart."
"Right?
 I\'m sure it must be, right?
 So don\'t get in my way!!
 Sew her more!
 Sew, sew, sew!!"
"Nihi!
 410, understood!!"
The merciless gold sewing needle sewed its golden thread through Beato\'s heart over and over again.
......However, no matter how much it tightened, that heart did not stop...
"Khh......hhhhhhh...this isn\'t nearly enough...
 You\'ll have to do better than this to kill me...!!"
"What are you doing?
 Make this old hag stop talking.
 Kill her quickly!"
"W‐...we are...!!
 Even though we\'ve sewn her heart in place several times,
 ......her heart...w‐won\'t stop...!!"
"......Are you...immortal?"
"Of course not.
 ......I\'ve handed the endless over to you.
 There is a limit to how many more times my heart can beat."
"...However, if by making it beat just one time extra, I can give the two in this room even slightly longer to themselves,
 ......I\'ll continue that meager resistance for all eternity!!"
"Sew!!
 Keep sewing until her heart stops beating!!"
"Guuh, guooooh, gwaa{0}aA{0}A{0}Aaa{0}a{0}aAA{0}A{0}AAa{0}ahhhh!!"
"...Wh‐......why doesn\'t she die?!
 This is impossible...!!"
"Her heart is, ......sewn in place...
 ......So why...doesn\'t it stop?!"
"Fine then, we\'ll make the heart explode from the inside nyeh...!
 How pitiful, and you could have died cleanly if you hadn\'t resisted us!!"
The gold needle and thread made round trips over and over again as they spoke, and still Beato didn\'t expire...
The barbarous witch was at last starting to turn pale at how unnatural this was.
"............What in the world......are you...?"
"......*cackle*cackle*cackle*.
 ......You probably cannot understand.
 ......Even I didn\'t understand.
 ......But still.
 ...Somehow or another, it seems that this is true magic.
 .........In other words,
 ......I have now...
...become it.
 ...I have become...
...a true witch!!"
"Center of explosion stabilized in heart interior.
 Primed and ready!"
"Detonate!!!"
There was a deafening sound, .........and gold leaf and a flutter of gold butterflies were scattered around the area.
Beato\'s chest had...opened wide from the inside,
 ......and from that, gold butterflies and gold leaf erupted, staining the surrounding area gold...
Then, Beato\'s body crumpled.
Like a puppet whose strings had been cut, ...she crumpled and sank down to the floor.
......However, in the air, a gold heart tied by gold threads floated, and continued to beat...
".........Wh‐.........what the, .........hiiiiii..."
"M‐......monster......hiiiiiiiiii...!"
When the Chiester Sisters saw that, they fell on their behinds in shock.
......Somehow, ......even though Beato had become nothing more than a heart, it still kept beating,
 continuing to protect the barrier to the parlor.
...It was an immeasurably immense magical power.
...Impossible to measure.
 In other words, infinite—and endless.
".........I, {i:I\'m} the Endless Witch, right...?
 .........Why is this old hag......still alive......after all of this......?!!"
"Chiester Sisters!!
 Smash that heart!!
 Quickly!!"
"I‐it\'s impossible, my apologies!
 We cannot do it!!"
"............It is probably impossible.
 No number of people could crush that heart.
 ...Much less the likes of the soldiers who serve under His Highness the Dragon King."
"In that case,
 an Endless Witch like me should be able to crush it, right?
 My power is a god\'s power!!"
"I am afraid to say,
 that your power...
cannot leave a single scratch on {i:{f:7:Beatrice}‐sama\'s} endless nature."
"......Just what...do you mean by that......"
"In the same way that there is no light without knowledge of shadows,
 ......there is also no endless without knowledge of the limited.
 .........Before Milady {f:5:Beatrice}\'s true endless power, your flimsy magical power is very, very lacking."
"What is.........that supposed to mean......"
"...aah—"
The cruel witch stepped back in surprise.
It was more transparent than a lace curtain...
......but Beato\'s form—no, {i:{f:7:Beatrice}\'s} form—was still standing there.
Even after taking on this wretched appearance, ......she would not allow evil through that door.
At that time, ......a shadow just as faint as {f:5:Beatrice} stood behind her.
It was Kanon.
".........{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.
 ...Thank you very much.
 ...I will not forget this favor you have done for me."
"......Hmph.
 ...I shall hear those words again when the number of my favors surpasses the number of grievances I have caused.
 ......Are you done?"
"Yes.
 .........Truly, thank you very much.
 ......And {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama,
 ......you have also...done enough.
 ......Please,
 ......be at peace..."
"......Is that so...
 ......So this...is enough......
 .........ku......*cackle*cackle*cackle*..."
"What\'s going on...?
 ......Why are you guys calling that predecessor hag {f:5:Beatrice}?!
 {f:5:Beatrice} is {i:my} name, right?!
 It should be my name, as the new Golden Witch and Endless Witch, right?!"
"............What gall.
 How dare you assume {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama\'s name."
"I am afraid to say...
...that the name of {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama should be taken by the person who can be crowned as the Endless Witch.
 By now, the term "predecessor" refers to you.
 ...Pukkukukukuku."
"What......did you say......?"
".........Farewell, Kanon.
 ......I\'ll meet you soon anyway.
 In a new nightmare."
".........In the nightmare of a new night, I will once again be your companion, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama...
 ......With that, ...if you would excuse me......"
Kanon\'s form grew faint, ......and he disappeared into thin air.
After watching him go, ...{f:5:Beatrice}\'s form also grew faint, ......and before disappearing, it slumped over onto the floor.
Then, ......there was a splat.
The golden heart which had been floating in midair...had lost its sparkle, become blood‐stained flesh, and fallen to the ground.
...How frail it was.
{n}It was ragged and full of holes.
...But until just now, it had sparkled so much, and had continued to beat forcefully.
That heart still barely managed to beat.
......However, it was only a matter of time before it stopped.
{f:5:Beatrice}, whose form had become fragile and faint like incense smoke, lay on the floor,
 ......steadily watching her own heart...
There, the cruel witch could be seen...
"...H‐...how are {i:you} "{i:endless}"...?
 Face reality, you\'re collapsed in a heap on the floor, aren\'t you?!"
"Endlessness with limits...that\'s a contradiction, it can\'t possibly exist!
 This is the limit of your magic!
 The limited is inferior to the infinite!!"
"...................................."
{f:5:Beatrice} no longer had the energy even to respond.
{n}...No, in fact, it was doubtful whether the words of the cruel witch even reached her ears...
"If you\'re a real Endless Witch, try standing up!!
 Well?
 You can\'t, can you?!
 Why do you think you can\'t stand?!
 It\'s because you aren\'t an Endless Witch!!"
The merciless witch poked {f:5:Beatrice}\'s heart with her fingernail.
{f:5:Beatrice} had no words with which to respond to that provocation.
......However, ...instead of words, she returned a single expression.
{n}......It looked insulting only to the cruel witch.
Because she had gently curved her mouth, ......and smiled.
......Footsteps were approaching that place.
There was no way she could mistake them.
 ...That boisterous noise of shoes against the ground was the sound of Battler\'s footsteps...
".........Battler, is it.........
 .........ku, ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*...
 ...For all my talk, ...I\'ve ended up like this......"
"................................."
"............I\'ve been trying to become...
...the true witch you talked about,
 .........in my own way......"
"...Yeah.
 ......I was watching."
"......Hey,
 ......have I now...
......been able to...
...become a witch......?
 ......Have I earned the qualifications to become...
...your opponent......?"
"No good."
Battler said that unbelievably bluntly.
Taking a painful breath, {f:5:Beatrice} saw that, and sneered at herself as though she should have expected it.
"............ku, ...*cackle*...
 ...Is that so.
 ......It seems I still have an uphill struggle ahead of me on the road to becoming a true witch..."
"......However, ...I will not surrender...
 ......Just like you never surrendered to my torture...
 .........I will definitely......become a true witch,
 ......and be...accepted as......your opponent......"
"Yeah, it\'s no good.
 It\'s no goddamn good at all.
 You aren\'t my opponent."
The brutal witch raised her foot high...
{n}...Below it was {f:5:Beatrice}\'s frail heart.
"Die, you old hag!!
 See if you can show how endless you are after you\'ve been mushed to bits!!
 I am the witch!
 I am the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}!!!
 Diiiiiii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}iieee!!"
{e:170:"Yeeeeeahhhh, it\'s no good, it\'s no goddamn good at aaaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aaall!!!"}
"Wha‐.........what...
...is this......?
 ...Wh‐.........where am I......?"
"Get in your seat.
 My opponent isn\'t Beato.
 .........It\'s you."
"......B‐...Battler...?!
 What kind of magic is this?!
 Who cares, it doesn\'t matter!!
 Chiester Sisters!!"
"45, understood, individual firing!!"
"410, understood, die Battler!!"
The Chiester Sisters each readied their own golden bows, and fired golden arrows.
The two only pulled the bowstring together when using precision guidance.
{n}If they were fighting against an enemy before their eyes, they fired their bows at the same time.
And the power was no different from what it normally was.
"Wha......... I‐i‐it was deflected?!?!
 There\'s no barrier, it was deflected with resistance alone...
 F‐...45, target measurement!!"
"45, understood...
 ............huh, ......whaaaa...?!
 Th‐this is... ...Am I broken?
 The measurement is...going berserk......?"
"A‐anti‐magic resistance, endless nine...
 E‐even mythical‐class magical attacks have no effect on the target!!"
The warheads of the golden bows could penetrate any magical armor with their mutual corrosion.
When attempting to block that using the anti‐magic resistance stat, even something with eight digits wouldn\'t escape penetration.
...Furthermore, even among the famous gods that appear in myths, there are not many who reach a resistance stat of nine digits.
For that reason, nine digits were enough to measure almost all imaginable values.
...Battler had filled all nine of those digits with 9\'s......
"......How foolish.
 When Battler‐sama is serious, mere magical arrows cannot even succeed in making his hair tremble."
The Chiester Sisters dropped their golden bows in shock...
...To this Battler, it felt even less perceptible than two dragonflies passing by his sides.
"............What the hell are you guys doing?
 Are you playing or something?"
"...Hiiiiiii...
 ...M‐......monster......"
"If your name\'s not Eva, get the hell out of here!!
 And you get in your seat, you goddamn fake witch!!
 I\'ll tear that mask of yours off!!!"
""H‐...hiiiiiiiiiiiii!!""
The Chiester Sisters couldn\'t hide their fear at Battler\'s ferocity, and they backed up as though they had been struck.
{f:5:Beatrice} watched this scene in shock......
"B‐......Battler,
 ......what......is this supposed to be......?"
"Just what you\'re seeing.
 My opponent isn\'t you."
"It\'s her!!
 The impostor over there, who\'s assuming your name!!!"
"Gh...!"
"......I\'m fighting against witches.
 ...And my method of denying them is to make anyone who calls themselves a witch my opponent, and crush them.
 ......I\'ve seen more than enough of your arrogance."
Then, Battler\'s eyes grew as sharp as blades as he fixed his eyes on the cruel witch.
"......Magic, my ass.
 Witches, my ass!
 You aren\'t a witch!!
 I\'ll rip that mask off and tear it to shreds!!
 {f:5:Virgilia}, get ready to fight!!"
"Understood.
 Preparations are complete, so go whenever you\'re ready.
 ......{f:5:Beatrice}.
 You stay back and rest."
"M‐mm......"
Beato looked at Battler timidly.
{n}...She still hadn\'t been acknowledged as his opponent.
{n}Was she qualified to watch the game board from the sidelines...?
"Beato, stay back and watch!!
 I\'ll tear it off!!
 I\'ll take this fake witch completely apart!!
 I won\'t let someone like this call themselves a witch!!
 You protected the honor of true witches!"
"Uh, ...I, umm......"
"You don\'t need to say anything."
"On your behalf, I\'ll teach her that the name of the Golden Witch definitely isn\'t that cheap!!"
".........B‐.........Battler..."
"Those are the general rules."
"............Thanks, Ronove.
 I get most of the rules now."
"...I see.
 You can\'t win with magic, so you came to face off with me in a world where victory is decided by something other than magic."
"......Foolish people.
 You really think you can win against me with twisted logic?!"
"Damn right I do.
 I\'ll crush all of your twisted logic, Aunt Eva!!"
"I, I am not Eva...!!
 That is the name of the old shell that I shed.
 I am a true witch, born inside of her...!!"
"Don\'t try to trick me! Your true form isn\'t a witch or anything like it, but a flesh‐and‐blood human.
 The human culprit, Ushiromiya Eva!!!
 {f:5:Virgilia}, reconstruct the second twilight!!"
"Understood."
"On the second twilight, Rosa and Maria were killed in the rose garden.
 We make our first move by applying the Eva culprit theory."
"Huuh?
 Riiidiculous!
 Come, arise, try to remember!
 What form did Ushiromiya Hideyoshi have?!!"
"Whaat?
 What\'s this supposed to be?"
"......It\'s summoning of the dead.
 It is easy for a witch to bring even the dead to the stand for testimony..."
An Uncle Hideyoshi who you could see right through was summoned.
...Magic sure is convenient.
{n}He looked as though he couldn\'t see what was going on here, almost like a person on the other side of the TV.
"Witness summons.
 Ushiromiya Hideyoshi\'s testimony.
 Come, Hideyoshi, speak...!"
"......I was takin\' care of Eva in the room the whole time.
 Eva didn\'t leave the room either, of course."
"Aunt Eva.
 Around here, testimony that isn\'t red isn\'t worth crap."
"I demand that he repeats it again in red!!"
"Oh yeah, that\'s right.
 Sure, say it in red for him!"
"
{p:1:I was in the room the whole time}.
 {p:1:Both before and after the time period of the crime}."
"See, look.
 This makes it impossible for Eva to be the culprit!
 How will you counter this?"
"Ridiculous.
 That move\'s so pathetic, I could yawn.
 ......Beato never used such childish tricks, not even once."
".........Battler..."
"Repetition requested!!
 "Aunt Eva was also in the room the entire time, before and after the time period of the crime"!!"
"Uncle Hideyoshi was just there to create an alibi.
 You made Uncle stay in the room and stealthily snuck out.
 ......If that isn\'t true, this guy should be able to say so in red!!!"
"D‐decline repetition...!
 Hideyoshi\'s testimony is sufficient!!
 There\'s no need to repeat that, right?!"
"......She\'s backed down.
 Mercy is unnecessary.
 This is check."
"Yeah, I\'ll take it. This opponent is a piece of cake!!"
"Check!!
 Maybe Uncle Hideyoshi didn\'t leave the room the whole time.
 But saying he was taking care of you the whole time...is a barefaced lie!"
"Therefore, no alibi exists for you!!
 You had a chance to slip out of the room and kill Auntie Rosa and Maria!
 If you think you can dodge that, try proclaiming in red that "Auntie Eva didn\'t take a step outside of the room"!!"
"You can\'t, right?
 Checkmate!!!"
"Wh‐.........what is that......?!
 I, ......I don\'t get it...!!"
"Sorry, Auntie.
 ......Even if you aren\'t used to the rules, beating your opponent down with all your strength is how this game is played.
 ......Isn\'t it, Beato?!"
"M‐...mm..."
"The witch side resigns.
 Let us continue on to the next game.
 Next is the fourth twilight through the sixth twilight."
It seemed that the witch still didn\'t understand how to approach things, and was losing her composure in irritation.
She was probably also angry that a shot had been taken at her while she still didn\'t get what was going on.
...But I won\'t go easy on her at all.
Just like she didn\'t go easy on the victims at all, I won\'t go the slightest bit easy on her...!!
"{f:5:Virgilia}, next crime!
 Let\'s reconstruct the incident with Dad and the rest!!"
"Understood."
"Rudolf, Kyrie, and Hideyoshi: these three people went to the mansion, and were killed there."
"My move won\'t change.
 Aunt Eva, {i:you} are the culprit!!"
"This time, you don\'t even have an alibi from Uncle Hideyoshi!!
 You claim that you were sleeping in that room all by yourself.
 But that is untrue!!!
 If you can proclaim it in red, just try it!!"
"......I refuse.
 ...So tell me then!
 Eva is just a woman.
 And the people who were killed were three adults holding two guns, right?"
"How did she kill them all by herself?
 How did she do it with those stakes as weapons?
 How is this stake‐shooting device that everyone keeps talking about constructed?!"
"Explain that!!
 As long as you can\'t explain it, even if Eva doesn\'t have an alibi,
 it doesn\'t mean that it was possible for Eva to commit murder!"
"Decline explanation!!
 It\'s a "Devil\'s Proof"!
 You can\'t refute the existence of an unknown murder technique or an unknown weapon just because it\'s impossible to explain!!"
"In short!!
 Even if I can\'t explain how the stake‐shooting device is constructed, that doesn\'t disprove its existence!!"
"Wh‐what is that?!!
 Is that madness allowed?!"
"......‘Devil\'s Proof’, valid."
"Agreed.
 "Devil\'s Proof", valid.
 ......Battler‐kun can claim that a stake‐shooting device exists without bearing the responsibility of explaining how it is constructed.
 The witch side cannot object to this move."
"......N‐not bad...
 How pushy..."
"Heh!
 Well, there\'s this ill‐natured witch who trained me well.
 This is check, got it?!
 Try saying in red that Auntie Eva didn\'t take a step out of that room!!"
"That\'s right, there\'s no way you\'ll be able to say it!
 If you can\'t say it, it\'s over, checkmate!!"
"......Th‐......that\'s so irrational.........!
 This is...messed up...!"
"Those are the rules of this game.
 ...How about some black tea first?
 We also have some delicious cookies, you know."
"I don\'t need all that!!
 Oh, that pisses me off...!
 So you fight like a coward just because you can\'t win with magic...!!"
"Don\'t get irritated.
 Drink some black tea or something.
 I\'ll take mine straight.
 What about you, Beato?"
"I, ...I am fine...
 .........More importantly, Battler, don\'t let your guard down.
 Your opponent is merely unfamiliar with the rules.
 ...It will start in earnest once your opponent gets the feel for it..."
"But I\'ll crush her.
 I\'ll thoroughly crush her.
 That\'s because she isn\'t a witch."
"If I accept her as a witch, ......all of your stubbornness counts for nothing!
 I don\'t care what kind of irrational argument or twisted logic I have to use,
 I\'ll crush her with all of my heart and soul!!"
Battler\'s side then stuck with the "Eva culprit theory" to explain Krauss and Natsuhi,
 the seventh and eighth twilights, in the exact same way.
At that time, there had been no one on the first floor of the guesthouse except for Eva and the victims.
 ...As before, no one could establish an alibi for Eva.
At the time, Eva had claimed that they had disappeared while she was in the lavatory,
 but nothing supported that, and the witch side couldn\'t repeat that in red either.
With the same argument as she had used to ask about the construction of the shooting machine,
 the witch side asked once more how Eva could have strangled both of them at the same time all by herself,
 but of course, Battler splendidly counterattacked by refusing to explain because of the "Devil\'s Proof".
Under the storm and stress of Battler\'s spirit, the witch side was completely swallowed up,
 and was forced to resign three times during the short period of time she had to grasp the rules...
".........Kuhhihihihihyahhyahhhya...
 Hah, I see!
 I\'m finally starting to get the knack of it.
 I won\'t let things go the way you want them to any more!"
"This time, let me take the initiative.
 Ronove, reconstruct the fourth through the sixth twilights!
 Pick out Ushiromiya Kyrie!
 ......For now, let me return to the murders of Rudolf, Kyrie and Hideyoshi for the fourth through sixth twilights."
"......Wh‐...what is she thinking?
 Why would she return once more to a board state she has already resigned from?"
"I see...
 ...This is a rare attack, which you do not use.
 Be careful."
"At the time, the survivors were barricaded in the guesthouse.
 They didn\'t have food, but out of concern for their safety, they were at least prepared to go without eating until the next day.
 ......However, in the end, three of them went out for food."
".........That\'s right.
 In the end, three people went outside to get food."
"I\'ll add in some red as I speak, \'cause it\'ll be a pain otherwise.
 {p:1:Kyrie didn\'t think that they needed food}.
 Since going without food for about a day wouldn\'t kill them,
 {p:1:she claimed that they should not leave the guesthouse}."
"And yet, she herself...
{p:1:suggested that they leave the guesthouse to get food}.
 .........Isn\'t this a contradiction?"
"Yes, a spectacular contradiction.
 It contradicts Kyrie\'s pattern of behavior."
"That contradiction...
{i:was created by me, using magic}!
 In other words, I controlled Kyrie using magic, and made her say that to lure the sacrifices outside!!"
"R‐ridiculous!
 There\'s no way that kind of magic exists!!"
"It\'s a "Devil\'s Proof", though!
 Just because you don\'t know about that magic doesn\'t disprove its existence!
 And I don\'t bear the responsibility of acting out that magic for you.
 And yet, you still have no room to counter this argument!!"
".........*giggle*giggle*!
 I wonder if it\'s alright to fight this way."
"Yes.
 It is truly a spectacular move.
 ......Battler‐sama, your response, if you please."
"You sure have brought in a weird argument.
 ...Run that by me again?"
"She has made a play against Ushiromiya Kyrie\'s pattern of behavior.
 ...As has already been explained,
 Kyrie\'s pattern of behavior had her saying that they should not go outside and head to the mansion in order to get food."
"Yet, even so, she took the initiative,
 and took the contradictory action of suggesting going to get food.
 As long as you cannot explain this contradiction, this violent move claims that it was due to magic."
"...Well, Kyrie‐san probably thought that too in the beginning."
"But she probably, uh, ...thought about various things midway,
 and had a change of heart, deciding that food really was necessary...
 It would be a problem if, due to hunger, we had no energy when we most needed it...and, well..."
"......She is claiming that this change of heart is due to magic.
 In short, ...while it might be extremely difficult, you must explain the reason for Kyrie\'s change of heart."
"Wh‐......what...?
 ...But that\'s asking me what was inside Kyrie‐san\'s own head..."
"Can\'t I also summon Kyrie‐san\'s ghost and question her or something?!
 Beato!
 Can\'t you call Kyrie‐san here or something?!"
"She cannot.
 That is a move permitted only to the witch side."
"S‐......sorry..."
"......Aaaaaaahhh, damn it!!
 She was probably, umm, ......thinking of us kids and, umm, ...on the whole, thought that food really was necessary and..."
"You must make that claim objectively.
 ...You require tangible evidence of the specific reason for which Kyrie changed her mind and decided that food really was necessary.
 ......For example, if someone heard her say that, or if it was written down somewhere."
"Too bad,
 {p:1:no reason for her changing her mind was ever told to anyone, nor was one ever written down}!
 Therefore, you can only speculate as to what was inside Kyrie\'s mind!"
"So it is impossible to prove!!
 You don\'t have a single counter to my move!
 It\'s your turn to resign now, Battler‐kuuun...!!"
"......It is possible to hypothesize endlessly as to the reason behind her change of heart.
 And, it is impossible to crush all of those endless possibilities."
"A detestably spectacular move.
 .........If Battler‐sama were to have a method of countering, ...it could probably only be that move."
"Wh‐......what move is that...?"
"......Well now.
 I wonder what kind of move it could be.
 I have the feeling that it was Milady\'s specialty, but I cannot remember."
"..................kh...
 Quit being stingy and tell me...!"
"{f:5:Beatrice}.
 There is no answer that will be given to those who stop thinking themselves.
 ...Think.
 Think in your own way!"
"Why don\'t you resign right now?
 And I\'ll corner you even more with red.
 {p:1:Until the last instant before she died, Kyrie maintained her pattern of behavior which states ‘I won\'t go to the mansion to get food’}!"
"And yet, she took the initiative and headed for the mansion.
 She was pushing a cart, trying to carry food.
 Why that contradiction?
 ......Because I controlled her with magic!!!
 This is the proof that my magic exists, and that I am a witch!!"
"...............Shut your damn mouth...!!"
"A‐...are you saying that she never even changed her mind?!
 ......The whole time until she died, Kyrie‐san thought "we don\'t need food", "I won\'t go to the mansion"?
 Then why did she step forward herself and say that they should go to get food, and go to the mansion...?!!"
"Are you saying that Kyrie‐san was being controlled with magic?!
 That\'s stupid...!!
 How, ...how am I meant to break through this magic?!"
"...If only Kyrie‐san were here, and just told us the reason behind her change of heart...
 No, I\'ve already been told in red that she never even changed her mind...!
 What should I do...?!!
 There\'s no move that the human side can counter with!!"
"The more I learn about this game, the more advantageous the rules seem for the witch, don\'t they?
 Even if the witch loses in a lot of areas, if she can win in just one, with that alone she can flaunt her existence."
"......In other words, Battler‐kun, you have no way of denying witches other than a complete victory!"
"You called me Eva all those times and seemed to be under the impression that you\'d been cornering me,
 but it\'s all been turned over by nothing more than the inside of your respected Kyrie‐san\'s head, don\'t you think that\'s truly funny?!"
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*, ahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!
 Just do it, resign!!
 Why don\'t you just accept it forever?
 Why don\'t you just lose forever?!"
".........Damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiit...
 It\'s impossible for a human to show...
 I can\'t do anything but guess what the dead were thinking when they acted.
 Furthermore, I can\'t deny magic just by conjecture.
 ...To break through magic, I need objective evidence as to why Kyrie‐san had a change of heart..."
"......But damn it,
 it\'s been said in red that no evidence exists as to why she started wanting food...
 ......What should I do, damn it, damn it...!!!"
".........Battler‐sama.
 May I take it that...you resign?"
"...........................kh.........
 "I won\'t go to the mansion to get food".
 But how should I understand Kyrie‐san\'s thoughts, which actually do contradict......?!"
"You can\'t understand!!
 It\'s impossible to understand, and impossible to interpret!!
 That darkness is all of the witch!"
"Come on, it\'s useless to think, so quit, alright?!
 There\'s no way you can deny witches!
 I mean, look at me, {i:I exist}."
"I am the Golden Witch!!
 I stole that name from that former witch over there!!
 You can\'t deny that I am {f:5:Beatrice}!!!"
"Damn iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit...!!!
 You have no right to say that name...!
 ......And yet, ......I can\'t think of a move to deny that.........!!!"
Battler could no longer counter this witch who was laughing derisively in triumph...
He didn\'t want to give up, but he could do nothing.
He ground his teeth, making fists with both hands.
{n}......But even so, he couldn\'t think of a brilliant counterattack...!
"Battler‐sama.
 ......You are closing in on the time limit—will you resign......?"
"Kh......aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh......!!!"
".........The human side has no move in response.
 We will res—"
"Wait!
 ......Th‐there is......a counterattack."
"Wh‐......what did you say...?"
"Huh?!
 What kind of move can you possibly have, Predecessor‐sama?!
 Care to tell me what kind of move can deny my magic, the magic of {f:5:Beatrice}?
 You can\'t, it\'s impossible!!"
"......If the proposition "I won\'t go to the mansion to get food" cannot be explained by itself,
 ......I will explain it with the contrapositive.
 In short, you may also be able to explain it with "she did go to the mansion, therefore there was a goal other than food"."
"......R‐rather than my specialty "Hempel\'s Raven", ......this is Battler\'s specialty, "chessboard thinking"."
"......If it is impossible for Kyrie to have gone to the mansion with food as a goal,
 we can only explain it with another goal which caused Kyrie to go outside in any case.
 In other words, if we can establish that goal, we can defeat magic...!"
"I, I see...
 So she didn\'t go to the mansion with food as a goal, but had a different goal,
 and said that she wanted to go and get food in order to disguise her real goal..."
"......Y‐...yeah, if that\'s the case, it may still be possible to explain it.
 ......But......how?!"
"Master, reconstruct the scene where Kyrie died...!
 We cannot summon a ghost, but inspecting the corpse should be the human side\'s right..."
"Yes, that poses no problems.
 I will reconstruct the scene where Ushiromiya Kyrie died."
"We cannot call Kyrie\'s ghost here,
 but by learning what Kyrie left behind, we may be able to use that as a weapon."
"Ha, hahahahahahahahaha!!
 Fine, search as much as you want!!"
"There\'s no way you\'ll learn anything!
 I just said it in red a short while ago.
 {p:1:Kyrie did not leave anything written down}!
 No matter what you find, how could you understand anything!!"
".........We may find nothing...
 ......But, ......Battler is grinding his teeth, fighting to think of a move to break through you.
 .........This is all that I can do......"
Beato landed on her feet in the reconstructed hall,
 approached Kyrie\'s fallen body, and wandered around observing.
"I, I don\'t quite understand the process of how the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} side fights...
 .........Evidence was required, was it...?
 ......Then what should I search for?"
"The purported Great Lady {f:5:Beatrice} is getting down on her knees and crawling around!
 And she\'s even disgracefully searching a corpse?
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*, how that look suits you...!!"
"...Say what you wish...
 ......I cannot do any more than this...
 ......I do not care how I am mocked..."
".........However, I cannot abandon Battler, as he is fighting for my honor...
 ......Even if I must crawl on the ground and search through dead flesh,
 ......I must answer to that responsibility..."
While being subjected to the witch\'s sneers, Beato searched through Kyrie\'s corpse.
{n}......She fished through the pockets, taking out what was inside and laying it on the floor...
Laid on the floor,
 ......was a handkerchief,
 tissue,
 a key to her house,
 the stub of a plane ticket,
 a lighter,
 a cigarette butt,
 and a single hundred‐yen coin...
There was no special, suspicious object...
 Although Beato was down on all fours and being sneered at, that was all she could find.
"Ahhahahahahahahahahahahaha!!
 What\'s with that wretched looking trash?!
 Come on then, how are you gonna break through my magic with that stuff?!"
"Worthless, worthless, you look so duuuumb!!
 What\'s with this state of affairs after you butted in sounding all heroic?!
 Aaah, how pathetic, how embarrassing!!
 Why don\'t you just give up and die forever?!"
The witch fell over laughing, taunting Beato.
{n}...Beato hung her head, trying to withstand this shame.
"...Milady,
 are you satisfied with your inspection?"
".........M‐......mm...
 ...I......will not find any more than this..."
"From this evidence, can some move be made to counter?
 If not, then the human side must resign."
".....................khhh........."
"Obviously! You don\'t have any room to argue back!!
 I am a witch.
 You can\'t break through my magic!!"
"You\'re no longer anything but a former witch.
 Just a loser who isn\'t even allowed to take the name {f:5:Beatrice} anymore!!
 Go on, pile up as much trash and rubbish as you like, and try to break my magic with it!!"
"...You can\'t, right?
 You can\'t, can you?
 Kuhhihihihihi, and why\'s that?
 It\'s because I\'m a witch.
 ...It\'s because you\'re just a loser without a name!!
 Kuhhi{0}hhyah{0}hyah{0}hyah{0}hyah{0}hyah!!!"
".........Something, ............something should be here......
 .........I won\'t lose heart...
 ......I will not lose heart......
 No matter how much I am sneered at......Battler is fighting for my honor,
 ......so for the sake of his honor, ...I must not lose heart........."
As Beato held back tears at the words of humiliation she was being showered with,
 in the hope that Kyrie was holding something else, ......in the hope that she could find something that could save Battler from his plight,
 ......she searched earnestly.
...However, nothing more came up......
"...............Damn it all......
 ......Please, ......Ushiromiya Kyrie......
 I know you will save your son from his plight......
 .........Please, ......even after death, lend me power for his sake......"
However, Kyrie\'s body did not answer.
{n}......It was only natural that a corpse would remain silent.
No dead person existed that would answer Beato, now that she had lost the Endless Magic...
"It\'s pointless, pointless pointle~ssss.
 Toying with the dead is a privilege only for witches.
 For you, who is neither a witch nor even a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}, no one exists who will lend a hand!!"
"You will be alone for all eternity!!
 You have no witch or {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} allies, and no one will save you!!
 If that frustrates you, why don\'t you cry forever?!
 Why don\'t you apologize, say "I\'m sorry I\'m so useless" forever?!
 Ahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!"
"...............Sorry, ...Battler.........
 ...I......couldn\'t help you...in any way......"
"..............................
 ......No, you\'ve done enough.
 ......Thanks, Beato.
 I won\'t waste your efforts..."
"I, I don\'t need consoling...!
 Just how could you argue back with this pile of rubbish...?!!
 Just how could you strike back with this rubbish I endured her sneering to scrape together...?!"
In front of Beato, who was still crawling on all fours and hitting the pile of objects Kyrie had left behind with her fist, Battler also crouched.
And, ......after patting her on the shoulder in thanks,
 ......he moved that hand to the ground, picked up the cigarette butt, and held it up over his head.
".........What are you trying to say with that trash...?"
"Kyrie‐san doesn\'t smoke."
But Kyrie was even holding a lighter.
Certainly, she wasn\'t carrying a box of cigarettes itself,
 but at a glance, it very naturally looked as though Kyrie had a smoking habit...
"...Dad smoked, but Kyrie‐san didn\'t.
 ...But she did walk around with just a lighter to light Dad\'s cigarettes."
"Ha!
 So what?
 If the husband smoked, then even if the wife didn\'t, it isn\'t strange for her to have a cigarette on her."
"Maybe she just picked up her husband\'s irresponsibly tossed cigarette butt?
 What are you trying to say?
 What does this have to do with my magic?
 Nothing at all!!!"
"I\'ll say more.
 ...This is a different brand of cigarette than Dad smokes.
 ......Sorry, Beato,
 could you look in the pockets of Dad\'s body too?"
"..................M‐...mm.
 ......This...?"
"......Checking the brand.
 The brand is different from the cigarette butt.
 ...The cigarette butt Kyrie had on her is not of the same brand as the cigarettes that Rudolf smokes."
"And so what?
 Maybe Kyrie is just a good girl who likes things to be clean, so she couldn\'t leave a fallen cigarette butt alone and picked it up?
 I wouldn\'t though!!"
"......Beato, sorry, but one more time please.
 ...Uncle Hideyoshi\'s pockets.
 .........In this family, only Dad and Uncle Hideyoshi smoke cigarettes."
"I‐......it\'s here...!
 Is this it......?"
Beato found a cigarette box in Hideyoshi\'s pocket, took a single one out, and held it out.
"......Checking the brand.
 We acknowledge that the cigarette butt is of the same brand that Hideyoshi smokes."
"L‐like I said, so what?!!
 How can you break my magic because you found Hideyoshi\'s cigarette butt in Kyrie\'s pocket?!?!!!!"
"...............That\'s right.
 This cigarette butt is our message from Kyrie‐san.
 No, ......this cigarette butt itself is the reason that Kyrie‐san left the guesthouse."
"Beato, thank you.
 ......If you hadn\'t found this, I would have given up here."
"............{f:5:Virgilia}!!
 Reconstruct the situation!
 The guesthouse after it came to light that Auntie Rosa and Maria had been killed on the second twilight!!"
"Understood."
"Reconstructing.
 ......After Rosa and Maria\'s deaths, the remaining survivors rechecked all of the doors and windows in the mansion.
 They constructed a barricade.
 They rechecked that their defenses were solid."
"There\'s nothing suspicious about that at all.
 What are you trying to say?
 Why are you bringing back the second twilight when we\'re talking about the fourth twilight and after...?!"
"Dad carried a portable cigarette butt holder with him.
 I can finally see why Kyrie‐san deliberately put that cigarette butt in her own pocket."
"............It was because that cigarette butt meant something.
 That very cigarette butt was the message left by Kyrie‐san for us...!!"
"L‐let\'s hear it, then!!
 How, using a single cigarette butt,
 are you going to deny me?!!"
"......As you\'ve just heard,
 after the second twilight, an inspection was done for all the rooms in the guesthouse.
 .........At that time, Kyrie‐san found something that shouldn\'t exist, in a place where it shouldn\'t be."
"S‐......something that shouldn\'t exist...?
 ......What do you mean by that?"
"It\'s this.
 This cigarette butt.
 This had been set in the ashtray of the guest room where Uncle Hideyoshi had been."
"Huuuh?!?!
 What\'s wrong with there being a cigarette butt in an ashtray?!!
 Are you sure there isn\'t something wrong with your head?!"
"Aunt Eva hated smoking!!
 There\'s no way that there would be a cigarette butt there when she was sick and sleeping!!!"
"However, there was a cigarette butt in the ashtray.
 When she saw that, Kyrie‐san realized immediately.
 ......Uncle Hideyoshi was lying.
 She realized that Aunt Eva hadn\'t really been sleeping,
 ...and that she had snuck out of the room!!"
"Repetition requested!!
 "This cigarette butt was stubbed out in the ashtray of a room in which Uncle Hideyoshi {i:and} Aunt Eva were resting!""
".........I, ......I refuse...!"
"I\'ve finally got it.........
 Thank you, Beato."
"W‐
......was I...
...of some...
use...?"
"Yeah, you were!!
 We\'ll tear it off, we\'ll tear the mask off of the fake witch!!!"
From that cigarette butt, Kyrie realized that Hideyoshi was creating an alibi for Eva\'s sake.
Hideyoshi had been tasked with watching over the room to create an alibi,
 ...and during that time, he had been unable to withstand the tension and had smoked.
Then Kyrie had disclosed that to Rudolf.
{n}She disclosed that there was a good chance that Eva was the culprit, and Hideyoshi was an accomplice.
".........Next, Kyrie‐san proposed that they go to get food.
 And then she asked Uncle Hideyoshi to lend a hand!!
 This could only mean one thing."
"Kyrie‐san planned to isolate Uncle Hideyoshi and question him about the truth!!"
"‘Hempel\'s Raven’, valid.
 Unless the witch side can counterattack this move, the existence of the magic which claims to have controlled Kyrie is denied."
"Wh‐what did you saaaaaaaaaaaayy?!?!
 I, I deny it, anyway, I deny it...!!
 It wasn\'t me, no, wait,
 it wasn\'t Ushiromiya Eva, Eva was sleeping in the room!!!"
"Then try saying it.
 You can\'t and I know it!
 You can\'t say it this time either!!"
"Repetition requested!!
 "At that time, Ushiromiya Eva did not take a step outside the room"!!"
"What the hell is thiiiiiiiis?!
 {i:I\'m} the one who was attacking, right?!
 Why did I get on the side that\'s being attacked?!
 When did offense and defense get reversed?!"
"I\'m the one doing the questioning, you know?!
 The witch, me, whyyyyyyyyyy!!!"
"I repeat!!!!
 Repetition requested!!
 "Ushiromiya Eva did not leave the room"!!
 There\'s no way you can say it,
 it\'s CHECKMAA{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}A{-}AATE!!"
"Does the witch side have a move in response?"
"......There cannot be one.
 There is no truth that can be accepted from a false witch dressed up with truths and falsehoods."
"You aren\'t qualified to call yourself a real witch!!
 You aren\'t the Golden Witch!
 You are a human!"
"You are Ushiromiya Evaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"
"OOOAAAOOOOOOOOOooooOOOOOOoooooohhhhhhhh!!"
The witch roared.
 Her entire body was burned with a tremendous heat that denied her own witchcraft and existence, and she let out a roar like a dragon...
Her body flickered repeatedly,
 flashing as Eva\'s figure and the witch\'s figure overlapped.
However, the roar drowned out that flicker, ...and made it return once more to the original form of the cruelhearted witch.
"......*cackle*cackle*cackle*, ...kuhhihha{0}hha{0}ha{0}hahaha...
 ...Alright.
 ...If you want to call me Ushiromiya Eva, then go right ahead..."
"......I admit it, I really can\'t repulse all moves related to Ushiromiya Eva being the culprit.
 ......I may have been dragged down from the position of Golden Witch,
 ...and maybe I am now being called Ushiromiya Eva..."
"......But you know what? That by itself doesn\'t mean that witches and magic are denied!!
 ...I\'ll teach you now..."
"I\'ll teach you that I am not Ushiromiya Eva, nor a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human},
 ......but a real witch...!!!
 Look and see this red truth!!"
The witch clapped her hands, and time advanced in the world of the game board.
As they called Jessica\'s name, Battler and Eva ran up to the parlor.
...They were searching for Jessica because they had gone to the servant room, found Nanjo\'s corpse, and didn\'t know where Jessica was.
".........So what\'s your point?
 ......What are you trying to say?"
"Y‐.........you couldn\'t be...
 ......Oh no......"
Beato went pale.
 ...That made it clear that the move the evil witch was about to make was bad enough to have such an effect on Beato...
"This time,
 ......I\'ll give you a fatal move that you won\'t be able to talk yourself out of.
 ...No, I\'ll make this move against all {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s who support you.
 Prepare yourself and listen...to my move."
"D‐......don\'t... That move is.........!"
"Beato, stay back...!!
 I\'ll take it!
 Bring it on, you fake witch!!"
"
{p:1:After Jessica was injured,}
 {p:1:Eva was constantly under Battler\'s supervision}.
 {p:1:Battler is neither the culprit nor an accomplice}.
 {p:1:By this, we can establish a perfect alibi for Eva}."
"Wh‐......whaat...............?"
"I\'ll seal you,
 and {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s as well,
 ......in a red barrier of death that most certainly cannot be escaped from.
 Farewell, lowly {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s.
 Sleep for all eternity in an absolute locked room of magic with no exits.
 ......Now, prepare yourself.
 For the red truth."
{p:1:There are no more than 18 humans on this island}.
Throw away your foolish thoughts of mysterious people hiding and committing crimes.
...But if I say it this way, you could also suspect animal culprits.
 It would be unbearable to hear an irrational theory about how an orangutan trained to commit murder wouldn\'t count as a human.
So, I\'ll change it like this.
{p:1:No life forms other than humans have any connection to this game}.
So, with that covered,
 next, I\'ll explain the situation for all 18 people who exist on this island.
{p:1:Kinzo is dead}.
 {p:1:Krauss is dead}.
{p:1:Natsuhi is dead}.
 {p:1:Hideyoshi is dead}.
{p:1:George is dead}.
 {p:1:Rudolf is dead}.
{p:1:Kyrie is dead}.
 {p:1:Rosa is dead}.
{p:1:Maria is dead}.
 {p:1:Genji is dead}.
{p:1:Shannon is dead}.
 {p:1:Kanon is dead}.
{p:1:Gohda is dead}.
 {p:1:Kumasawa is dead}.
{p:1:Nanjo is dead}.
Those 15 are all dead.
And.
{p:1:Battler is alive}.
{p:1:Eva is alive}.
{p:1:Jessica is alive}.
That\'s everyone, all 18 of them!
"So you understand that, accordingly, when the last victim, Nanjo, died,
 only three people, Battler, Eva, and Jessica, were alive, right?"
".........Wh‐......what did you say...?
 ......Y‐......you bitch, ...you couldn\'t mean............"
"
{p:1:Eva was with you the whole time}.
 {p:1:So committing a crime was impossible for her}.
 {p:1:Of course, Battler‐kun isn\'t the culprit}.
 {p:1:He wasn\'t forging an alibi for her, and he took the possibility that she was the culprit into account, watching over her actions carefully}."
"
{p:1:No chance existed for her to do anything suspicious}!
 {p:1:In short, at the time of the crime, only Nanjo and Jessica were in the servant room}."
"......And I know what you\'re thinking.
 Your next move will be this, right?
 There\'s also a chance that Jessica is the culprit!
 But too bad, I\'ll slice it up in red before you try!!"
"
{p:1:Ushiromiya Jessica has not committed murder}!
 {p:1:She was not involved with Nanjo\'s murder}!!
 {p:1:Her eyes were completely blocked}.
 {p:1:It\'s impossible for her to carry out a murder like that}!"
"And here\'s an extra.
 {p:1:Neither Eva nor Battler killed Nanjo, nor were they involved}!!"
"W‐wait a fucking second!!
 That makes no goddamn sense!!
 There are only three humans, then a murder occurs, ......and none of those three were involved? That\'s insane!!"
"I\'ll state it clearly.
 {p:1:The culprit who killed Nanjo was neither Battler nor Eva nor Jessica}!!
 In other words, it wasn\'t one of the survivors.
 Get iiit?"
"No, umm, .........th‐that\'s right!
 What about multiple personalities...?!
 Just like you were originally another personality of Auntie Eva\'s,
 ......let\'s say Jessica had another, witch‐like personality,
 which took the name of "someone other than Jessica" and killed Doctor Nanjo...!!"
"Moron.
 I\'ve already said it in red.
 {p:1:Jessica\'s eyes were completely blocked, and murder was impossible for her}!"
"No matter what kind of personality she was possessed by, murder could not be carried out with her body!
 I wonder if you\'ll be satisfied if I say it this way?"
"{p:1:No actions caused by Jessica\'s body had any relation to or influence on the murder of Nanjo}!
 {p:1:This also applies to Battler and Eva}.
 In other words, no matter how much you try to struggle and interpret it,
 {p:1:neither Jessica nor Battler nor Eva is the culprit who killed Nanjo}!"
"Y‐...you\'ve got to be kidding me!!!
 I mean, everyone else is dead for sure, right?!!"
"Then......all that\'s left......is the Doctor Nanjo suicide theory, right?!
 And the trap theory!
 The culprit was already dead, but a trap that they had already prepared went off..."
"{p:1:Nanjo\'s death was a homicide}.
 ...{p:1:Of course, it was with a direct method of murder, not a trap}.
 {p:1:They readied their weapon, and killed him with it directly from the front at point‐blank range}!
 {p:1:The culprit appeared openly before Nanjo\'s eyes, and as they both looked at each other\'s faces, the culprit killed him}...!!"
"But wait!!
 There are only three survivors!
 You said in red that everyone else is dead!
 You basically confirmed the life or death status of all 18 people.
 Furthermore, the existence of a 19th person has already been denied in red...!!"
"In other words, no one can exist except the three survivors!!
 And yet, a fourth person other than those three appeared before Doctor Nanjo!!
 How can a person other than us appear and murder Doctor Nanjo when no 19th person exists?!?!"
"Insane!!
 You\'re lying!!
 You\'re lying with the red letters!!!"
"{p:1:The red only tells the truth}!!!
 Isn\'t doubting that the same as betraying the honor of that witch who\'s behind you, shriveling up in fear of me and hiding behind your back?!"
"D‐.........damn it............!!!"
"I\'ll state it clearly,
 right now.
 ......The one who appeared in front of Nanjo was me.
 A witch.
 ......The Golden Witch, who can\'t be explained by the 18 humans!!"
"{f:5:V‐Virgilia}!
 Ronove...!!
 Isn\'t the situation contradicting itself?!
 Is she really telling the truth with red?!"
"......Yes.
 "Red truth", valid."
"............What an......elaborate and precise cornering......"
"H‐......how should I make a move against this...?
 {f:5:Virgilia}...!
 Isn\'t there any move......?!"
"..................I...cannot think of anything..."
"...And you, Ronove?!"
"........................
 .........My apologies.
 ......However, in these last thousand years,
 ...I have never seen......such an elaborately beautiful game board layout."
"............Although it pains me to admit it,
 ............it is beautiful.........
 ......What a...
...beautiful red...
...checkmate..............."
The witch\'s master and the demon butler were both stunned, ...and a somehow rapturous expression rose to their faces...
.........Forget surrendering,
 ...they were simply impressed at this perfect checkmate,
 ...which could only be admired...
When people accept defeat from the bottom of their heart...
{n}it gives rise to neither regret nor humiliation.
{n}......Nothing is born except feelings of respect...
I.........no longer knew......what was what anymore.
There were absolutely no weak points in her red.
She had said in red that all 15 people had died.
{n}She had said in red that no people existed other than the 18.
In other words, no more than three people—me, Jessica, and Auntie Eva—existed.
And even though none of those three people were the culprit, Doctor Nanjo was killed.
And without a doubt, Doctor Nanjo\'s death was a homicide, murdered by "that person" openly from the front...!
And she claims "that person"......is a witch.........?!!
"The culprit that killed Nanjo was not an animal or anything of the sort.
 That has already been dealt with in red, you know?
 Remove everything other than humans from consideration entirely.
 And no stuff like robots, either."
"{p:1:Absolutely no factors other than humans participate in this game board}!
 Therefore, I can also say this:"
"{p:1:The one who killed Nanjo was definitely a human}!"
"{p:1:A human, with their feet on the ground, held up a weapon and killed with it}!
 {p:1:Right before his eyes}!
 However, the human may have been able to use magic.
 ......Which means, it was a witch."
"......That is, in other words, me.
 The Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}!!"
......Even as Battler...
ground his teeth...
......his knees hit the floor with a thunk.
His soul still refused to submit...
......However, ...his knees had already...
...started to accept submission......
"Kuhhihhihihihihihihihihi!
 Oh, did you kneel...?"
"That\'s right, you\'re already starting to understand.
 ......The Golden Witch does exist.
 .........And that Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}, is me...!!"
"Come on, praise me.
 Now is the time to praise the resurrection of a true witch.
 Now is the time to praise the resurrection of the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}!!
 On the ninth twilight, the witch revives, and none shall be left alive......!!!"
"Daaamn iiiiiiiitt.........
 ......I don\'t......understand......!
 After...being so thoroughly immobilized by the red,
 ......I don\'t......have a clue anymore......!"
"B‐......Battler......
 D‐don\'t lose heart......
 ...You and I...promised that we would fight each other again, did we not......?
 Will you surrender here...?!
 Will you disappear in a place like this before fighting with me again......?!"
"I don\'t want to break that promise......
 ............But......I can\'t think of any move to deny her...!!"
"In the first place, ...this isn\'t even a proper problem!
 Nothing exists outside the suspects, and all of the suspects are innocent!
 I\'ve been told that they\'re innocent in red!
 And also that it was a real homicide, and that the culprit was human, and that they did appear in front of Doctor Nanjo\'s eyes and kill him!
 I give up... There\'s nothing I can do...!!!"
"Please, Battler, don\'t give up, don\'t lose heart......!
 ......If you stop thinking, it automatically becomes your loss.
 ...I\'m begging you, don\'t lose heart...
 ......I\'m also cheering you on, ......so don\'t lose......!"
"I can\'t think of anything anymore...!!
 I end up thinking that she\'s just a witch anyway, and must have done it with magic, so just thinking is pointless...!"
"It\'s no good, my head hurts, my brain\'s tired...
 I end up thinking that thinking\'s pointless, so I should just stop...!!"
"Battler, listen...
 .........In the game of chess, both sides do all they can to make the other lose, so a single game takes a long period of time.
 ......However, if one side throws away victory from the beginning, and voluntarily makes moves harmful to themselves, the game will end in the blink of an eye.
 ......That is called a fool\'s mate."
A fool\'s mate is, simply put, a strange way of playing chess, with the mind to lose as soon as possible.
...Opening the area in front of your own king and inviting the opponent\'s queen in.
Chess, in which the average playing time for a single game may stretch for several hours, can be resolved in a scant four moves.
......In other words, if both sides try to win in a fight, they are compelled to take a painfully long period of time,
 ...but if one side decides to lose, they can end the game all too easily, at any time...
"......When the human side stops thinking, it hands the problem before its eyes over to the witch,
 and even an apple falling from a tree can be immediately resolved as the work of magic."
".........And it is the same way for the witch side.
 ...Witches use the red truth.
 ......If they use that to show that the true form of magic can be explained away using humans, they can immediately lose."
"............You don\'t have to tell me that...
 ......You\'re telling me not to stop thinking, right...?
 But,
 .........how am I meant to counterattack her perfect bright‐red move...?
 For me,
 ......for humans,
 .........it\'s no longer possible............"
".........Is it...
......impossible...?
 ......Is it...
...impossible for you, Battler......?
 ......Please... Don\'t lose heart........."
"..................Sorry.........
 ...It\'s no longer...
......possible for me........."
Battler scratched at the floor, crying heavily.
......Beato watched that with a distressed face...
Then she stood up, and spoke to the witch.
"............I will make a move as a counterattack to yours."
"Huh?
 How can you possibly cut up this perfect checkmate?"
"How can this checkmate, which is completely impossible for {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s to break,
 possibly be broken by the likes of you?!"
".........{f:5:B‐Beatrice}, you couldn\'t be..."
"Mm.
 ...What about a move that a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} cannot make.
 ......I will counterattack you with a move I can use because I am a witch..."
"A move you can use because you are a witch......?
 ......Wh‐...what are you planning to do...?"
"I will use the red...
to deny witches."
"{f:5:Beatrice}...!!"
"M‐Milady...!!"
The master and the butler were both startled.
......I also immediately understood what it meant.
{n}To use the red that only witches could use.
{n}...{i:To use the red to deny witches}.
It was like using her own sword to slit her own throat.
"Wh‐............whaaat...?!
 C‐......come on, what are you saying?
 Deny witches with red...?
 .........D‐...don\'t talk like an idiot.
 If you do that, ...you won\'t get away unscathed either......!!"
".........You are not a witch.
 And I am not a witch either.
 ...The road to becoming a true witch is difficult, and I have much, much farther to go..."
".........Then that is convenient.
 In this place now, witches did not exist from the beginning.
 I will strip this deception away myself."
"You and I both are real, obvious witches!!
 Being able to use red is itself proof that we are!"
"I don\'t know what the definition of a witch is to you,
 but if you\'re mistakenly thinking that you alone will be able to get away unscathed, then you\'d better—"
"I am making no such mistake.
 I would accept it."
"Wh.........at did you say......?"
"I never managed to become a witch in the first place.
 ......I have done nothing more than finally begin walking on the road to becoming a true witch."
"...If it is true that I am a witch as I stand,
 ...then I am nothing more than a false witch who got addicted to power, like you."
"......Rather than existing in that shabby form,
 I would have no regrets...
in erasing this form of mine along with you...!"
"A‐...are you insane?!?!
 S‐stop it...!
 I still want to be a witch! I don\'t wanna be {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}...!!"
".........Witch, please return to your seat.
 Please, receive the human side\'s response from your seat."
"Wh‐what are you doing?!
 L‐let go of me!!
 Don\'t let that woman use red!!
 Make her stop!!
 Let gooooooooooooooooooo!!"
As the witch stood from her seat and tried to spring upon Beato, Ronove pressed down on both of her shoulders, forcing her back into her seat.
And, even after that, he didn\'t remove his hands from those shoulders.
Denying witches was the same thing as denying magic.
......That included demons such as Ronove.
However, instead of running away, Ronove chose to act as the facilitator for the game,
 ...and to carry out that duty for his master\'s sake.
"......{f:5:Beatrice}.
 .........You have...no regrets, I hope."
"The same to you."
"......Sorry.
 ......Even though you taught me a lot of fun magic and happy spells,
 .........I couldn\'t use it well at all.
 ............So I\'ll train from zero,
 ...and start over again.
 ...I am truly sorry.........that you had to get caught up in your stupid disciple\'s misconduct."
"......I had a good disciple in the very end.
 ......Go, and do as you believe."
".........I, I don\'t have a clue what you guys are talking about..."
"...But I do understand one thing.
 And I can say this...
 ......Beato, I don\'t know what you\'re trying to do,
 ...but whatever it is you\'re about to do, don\'t do it...!"
"You have no moves.
 But I have one."
"......If we let this move escape us, she will be revived as a witch in the true sense, and this time, she will control this whole island.
 ...All nightmares will be hers to do with as she pleases,
 and this island will fall into the deepest hell of the evil witch\'s constant fantasies, for all eternity."
".........Can you permit that?
 ...Is it alright for your dear relatives to be toyed with for all eternity in that witch\'s nightmare?"
"S‐still, ......{i:you} shouldn\'t have to sacrifice yourself...
 Th‐this is a game between me and her.
 There\'s no need for you to sacrifice yourself to make a move!
 I, I\'ll think of something!
 I\'ll definitely think of a miracle move...!!"
"So don\'t rush into it!!
 Ooooooooooooooohhhh, damn it to hellllllllllll,
 I\'ll definitely think of one, ......so don\'t rush into iiiiiiiiiiit!!"
".........This game is cruel.
 The time limit for your deliberation has already run out.
 .........I am now the only one who can do it."
"...Worry not, Battler.
 .........I\'ll defeat her.
 ......I\'ll defeat that cruelhearted witch with my own hands..."
"W‐wait, Beato!!
 Stop it, quit it!!
 There\'s absolutely no need for you to sacrifice yourself!!"
"Last I remember, you were fighting to deny me.
 ......What a strange person.
 Hahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha."
"......Let that child do as she likes.
 And please, see her through."
"B‐...but......"
"Battler.
 ......There\'s only one thing I ask.
 ......Would you...cover your ears?"
"My ears......?
 Why...?"
".........In a few moments, I will deny witches in red.
 I will slice up the game board that she has laid out with her red."
"......By doing that,
 .........I will probably lose my form as a witch as well.
 ......If you also hear the red truth I will tell, you will understand my true form."
".........Even if you alone cover your ears, the truth will not change at all.
 ......However,
 ...even so, I want you alone to cover your ears.
 ..................I at least want to be a witch...in your eyes.
 ......Please."
"......{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.
 ...There is no problem on the witch side.
 Please, your move."
"Let gooooooooooooooooooo!!
 You won\'t get away unharmed either, you know?!"
"She\'s insane!!
 She plans on dying and taking us with her!
 Stop it, don\'t deny it!!"
"Stooooooppppppppppppp!!!"
"...How unsightly for a Golden Witch.
 .........Now, are you ready?"
"...I will remove your checkmate in Battler\'s stead.
 What happened on the chessboard where fifteen died, and only three remained?
 ...I will now expose it in red.
 With that red truth, ......I will impale and kill both fake witches!"
Beato turned around and smiled at Battler.
......Most likely, no one would believe that the witch who had gone to the limits of cruelty...
would try to leave a smile as the last expression she showed Battler.
And that smile signified her last wish, that she wanted him to cover his ears...
Denying witches in red......was the same as knowing her shabby form.
Battler put both of his hands against his ears...
......To protect her final...
honor as a witch, he put his hands against his ears, ...rejecting the truth.
And he howled.
 So that not even a bit of what she was saying would slip into his ears.
After that...was a world where Battler could not hear anything.
{n}Beato was saying something with red.
Even the evil witch attempted to cover her ears at their bitter contents.
......That was...the red truth.
 Words of power.
{n}......Words that denied her own existence.
Words that only witches could use—the only words capable of denying witches.
Beato talked.
{n}With the red truth, she sliced apart the bright‐red game board that the witch had released.
She explained difficult problems that could not be solved by humans, with moves that could only be solved by witches, and began cornering the witch.
The {i:truth} that Battler was not permitted to hear.
If Battler had broken his promise, and sneakily listened in...
{n}......in an instant, Battler would probably have been able to become the victor in his game with Beato.
......He would probably have understood all the riddles on the island, all of the magic and tricks, locked rooms, spells, curses, legends,
 ...and the entire tale of anger and sadness.
However, ......Battler would only learn what that was when he reached the truth by himself.
Yes.
 ...From the beginning, ......{f:5:Beatrice} had wished that Battler would reach that truth by himself.
It was something that shouldn\'t be reached by being told.
{n}It was a truth that Battler would have to drag himself to with his own power.
A brilliant light gathered with Beato and the evil witch at the center, and grew gradually stronger...
It was...the power of truth.
.........A heat and brilliance like the sun...
shone on all of the falsehoods that hid in the darkness, trying to deceive, ...and burnt them to nothing.
"GWOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAaaaAAaaAAAaaaahhhh!!
 How?!
 How can you die?!
 How can you throw away your life...when you have such incredible power?!
 You hold the power to control gold, magic, and everything else at will—
how can you so readily throw that away?!"
"......Learn that even with a mountain of gold,
 even with magic to split the sea,
 there are some things you can never obtain.
 .........Come, show yourself.
 Show your true form, ......Ushiromiya Eva!!!"
When the sun exploded and blew everything away...
{n}......Eva could be seen there, holding a gun.
"Y‐.........you are the culprit...
 Aunt Eva......!!!"
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*......ahhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!!
 Took you long enough to notice, Battler‐{i:kun}!!"
Without any hesitation or mercy, Eva raised the gun and pulled the trigger.
...An explosion resounded, and Battler fell to the floor, his heart shot through.
After going into convulsions for a short time,
 ...with blood dripping from his mouth,
 ...Battler died...
But in his last moments, ...he understood without a doubt that she was a murderer.
 And not just for killing him...
.........There are several murders where I don\'t have a clue how they were carried out.
However, ......while my ears were covered,
 ......Beato exposed all of them with the red, blasting away all magic.
...In other words, .........even though I didn\'t understand it,
 ......hadn\'t that been nothing more or less than proof that all magic can be explained with humans?
.........Beato made me cover my ears.
{n}...So I myself don\'t know the whole truth.
...However, .........from the fact that she managed to deny it in red,
 I learned one fact which is extremely unfair for us......namely, "it is possible to deny all magic".
So, in other words, .....................
......No,
 ......I must not think of that.
.........If I do, ...then the time I covered my ears would be made pointless.
If I\'m going to regret, I can only regret my own actions.
 ...If, at that time, I had thought of some turnabout move to counter the witch\'s final play,
 there would have been no need for Beato to sacrifice herself.
I......brought about this conclusion......because I was worthless......Even though it was a pitch‐black world where nothing could be seen,
 ......for some reason, I felt Beato\'s presence right next to me.
......So I tried calling out to her.
{n}...You can exchange words with someone whether they\'re a human or a witch.
......So even in a world where witches have been denied......I should be allowed to talk to her...
"...............Beato......"
"......Battler, is it...
 ...............It is done.
 ......I...did it."
"...Yeah.
 ......I didn\'t hear it,
 .........but I watched you...until the very end...
 I was watching......as you boldly stood up to that evil witch..."
".........With this, ...I am no longer a witch.
 ............But, I will definitely...become a witch again...
 ......And...
...I will make it so that I can be called the Golden Witch again,
 .........and then,
 ......when I am ready to be accepted as your opponent,
 .........I will return once more......"
"No.
 .........You...were a witch."
"...............Huh......?"
"...I...was watching.
 .........When you took that evil witch,
 ......and blew her away with that awesome magic, exposing her true form,
 ...I was watching with my own eyes..."
"Th‐...that wasn\'t magic,
 ......but the red—"
"No, it was magic.
 .........You were definitely...the Golden Witch.
 .........Even if you deny it yourself,
 .........I\'ll accept it.
 ............‘You are definitely...
the Golden Witch’."
.........When Battler said those words...
In the world that had been dark, ...there was suddenly a single grain.
...A small grain of gold, like a wheat seed, shone brightly.
{n}...Even though it was small, it had a strong, gold‐colored glow.
And......it illuminated the two of them, sitting with their backs together...
So they each became aware of their own form.
...They did not exist only as consciousness.
......They became aware that they had bodies, and definitely existed.
...No, maybe we should say that they each had been given an existence called a body.
When Battler looked at his own form, he wasn\'t that surprised.
...But when Beato looked at her own form, she was a little startled.
......From Battler\'s perspective, she looked just like normal,
 ......but for a short while, she was surprised by that form...
".........What............
......is going on.........?"
"The glow from that grain of light......is getting stronger and stronger..."
That grain of wheat was no longer simply gold‐colored, but was like the light of the sun.
Then, it softly.........began to approach Beato\'s chest.
When that grain of the sun......was sucked inside her chest...
......the world became wrapped in a deep blue sky, and then a deep blue ocean spread out below them.
An island rose up, trees sprouted and created a forest, walls surrounded us and a ceiling swallowed us.
And it became adorned with more and more things,
 ......until we realized that this was the hall in the Ushiromiya mansion.
In that fantastical hall where many gold butterflies beat their wings,
 ...many tables were set up with white tablecloths, like it was a party,
 and beautiful cooking and fruits were set out.
...And over there......were a great many figures.
{n}Everyone was there, talking together and smiling.
"G‐............guys........."
There was Dad and Kyrie‐san, Uncle Krauss, Aunt Natsuhi and Auntie Rosa, and of course, even Auntie Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi.
......George‐aniki, Jessica, Maria, ...wait, wait, even Shannon‐chan, Kanon‐kun, Gohda‐san and Kumasawa‐san are here.
Everyone, everyone was at the party, clapping their hands and celebrating our return...
"Wh‐...why...?
 Everyone was dead...!
 Why are they alive...?!"
"......In the Golden Land, all the dead people\'s souls can be revived.
 ......Welcome back, {f:5:Beatrice}.
 And welcome, Battler‐kun.
 Welcome to the Golden Land."
"............I...made it?
 ...I made it...
to the door of the Golden Land?"
"Yes.
 ......Milady, you have finally been able to invite everyone to the Golden Land.
 ...Welcome, Battler‐sama, to the Golden Land."
"Battler.
 .........So, you have finally made it this far."
"G‐Grandfather...
 .........Where in the world...am I..."
"...My blood, which is...incompatible with magic, runs more deeply in your veins than any other.
 ...Therefore, you were the only one who could not reach the Golden Land, and {f:5:Beatrice} has been searching for you ever since.
 ...She tried everything to bring you here."
"............What did you say......?"
"It seems that we are all here at last."
"Battler‐sama, if you would take your seat.
 Tonight\'s dinner is my very best work.
 If you would, please relish it."
"You should be honored!!
 Normally, I would have eaten all of it, but I left you guys some out of pity!"
"......The seven stake babes..."
"In the Golden Land, all of those with minds are equal.
 ......Here, there is no distinction between us furniture, {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s, or witches."
"...Battler‐sama.
 We were waiting for you.
 And welcome to the Golden Land..."
"Shannon‐chan, ......George‐aniki...!!"
"......I\'m still suspecting that this might be a dream...
 I\'m sure that we died.
 ......But, ...we\'re alive.
 And everyone, every one of us is here, ......and we\'re all happy.
 ...I can\'t believe it."
"That\'s right, this place must be a dream worrld!
 So it doesn\'t matter that George is so friendly with a maid girl, it has to be a dreeeam!
 Waaaaaah!"
"Give it a rest, Eva.
 For now, you gotta stay quiet and bless the two young \'uns.
 The Golden Land is a capital of bliss.
 We should never quarrel here...!"
"Here, any people are free to love each other.
 ...No one needs to hesitate over it."
"Jessica‐chan, Kanon‐kun, so wonderfuul!
 I\'m so jealouuus!"
"......H‐hey, Battler...
 This is kinda, umm, wahahahaha..."
"Battler‐sama, welcome.
 And welcome home..."
Jessica was probably embarrassed because she was holding hands with Kanon‐kun.
And Kanon‐kun wanted to act humbly like a servant and bow,
 but since neither of them could let go of the other\'s hand, he couldn\'t do it so well, and the whole scene looked fairly comical.
"With a servant child...?!!
 I forbid it, I couldn\'t possibly give away our Jessica to such a person...!!"
"Why not allow it?
 Let her at least choose the person she likes."
"I forbid it, I forbid it, aaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaahhh, Jessicaaaaaaaaa!"
"Mine has gone awry toooooo, ohhhhh, Geooooooooorge!"
...As Aunt Natsuhi and Auntie Eva hugged each other, they cried tears of regret for their darling children.
......Even though they had always been at odds.
 ...It was a very bizarre scene.
"......It isn\'t really a problem, right?
 It doesn\'t matter who likes who."
"Exactly.
 It\'s proof the parent hasn\'t let go of their child."
"Battleer,
 you can bring home whatever kind of woman you want, I\'ll accept her waaarmly, alright?"
"You can\'t introduce her to this guy, you know?
 He\'ll get his hands on her immediately.
 He\'ll elope right away."
"............Battler.
 You finally came here.
 Kihhi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi."
"Maria...
 .........From the beginning,
 .........you knew that we would be coming here......?"
"Uu!
 That\'s why I wasn\'t scared at all.
 Everyone was a fraidy‐cat.
 It was funny!"
"......What the hell.
 ...Even though I thought you were the most screwed up,
 ...you actually knew the truth from the beginning."
"H‐how rude...!
 It is absolutely unforgivable to speak of Lady {f:5:Maria} in that way!"
"Forming firing curve, attack preparations ready.
 Lady {f:5:Maria}, we can attack at any time.
 Nihi!"
"Kihhihihihihihihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihihi...!
 Ouch!"
"...Quiet.
 You are in the presence of {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama."
"Well, there\'s no need to be quite so strict.
 For now, let us take their desire to fool around and play together into consideration.
 More importantly, why don\'t we begin preparing for the toast?"
"Yes, I have finished preparing my excellent mackerel cooking.
 I can serve it at any time."
"Hey!! Ladies!
 Work a little more like furniture!!"
"Nooooo!!
 I wanna stuff myself some mooore!
 Wahhhhhhh!"
"Come on, let\'s work.
 Don\'t keep the guests waiting.
 Let\'s work studiously and attend to them.
 Don\'t let the guests do anything.
 Make them lazy, make them slothful, fatten them like pigs.
 Ahhahaha!"
"......{f:5:Beatrice}.
 Battler‐kun.
 This way."
Grandfather and {f:5:Virgilia} were standing on the landing at the top of the staircase, beckoning us.
Beato and I looked at each other quizzically, then climbed the stairs together.
From the hall, it looked like a very high stage.
A small table had been set up there, as well as a piece of parchment and an old‐fashioned quill pen.
I saw that strange magical characters and Japanese were written side by side.
{n}...And below it, many names were written.
There were 17 of them.
 ......Grandfather was the first, and everyone else\'s names had been signed below in one long column.
The people who arrived at the Golden Land probably signed this one after another.
"Battler.
 Now that you are here, everyone is gathered.
 Listen carefully."
"The Golden Land is not a world supported by the power of magic alone.
 The cooperation and approval of all humans who receive happiness here is required.
 For that sake, we must gather the signatures of everyone here."
"Last time,
 the door to the Golden Land was finally opened, but you refused to sign.
 ......Although you probably don\'t remember it.
 Because you refused to sign, this world was once again sealed in darkness."
"......Just hearing it like that, ...it kinda sounds like I\'ve been the only stubborn one,
 and I\'ve been causing everyone all kinds of trouble..."
"That is because you are a certified hardhead.
 It seems that you inherited more than just blood from Kinzo."
Beato laughed amiably.
 I knew I was being made fun of, but that smile led me to go along with her, and I laughed without thinking.
"Magic is a miracle.
 ......Miracles cannot be completed unless everyone believes.
 ......And when you do, as the last to do so, this miracle—the Golden Land—will be completed."
"..................It looks like I\'ve been a real pain.
 ...So, what should I do...?"
"First, sign here.
 Then, {f:5:Beatrice}, sign here."
"......It\'s hard to use a quill pen.
 ...Whoa, it shot."
"You klutz.
 Shooting ink is a bad omen.
 Can\'t you at least write your name quickly?
 In that illegible scrawl.
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!"
"And what about you...!
 Don\'t write it in {c:86EF9C:{ruby:katakana:capitals}} like that!
 {f:5:Beatrice} is a stylish name, so write it in cursive!
 You\'re making the quill and your name cry!"
"Sh‐shut up, in school, didn\'t they tell you not to use cursive on tests?"
"This is a solemn ceremony. Be silent."
"Very good.
 We have gathered the two signatures, as well as the form for the covenant.
 ......Both of you, your oath please.
 We\'ll start with {f:5:Beatrice}.
 Put your hand on the covenant, and take the oath."
"......‘I, {f:5:Beatrice}, as a good witch, swear to continue with my training for the sake of bringing happiness to the people’.
 ...Say it."
"......M‐......mm...
 ......I‐it\'s a little embarrassing."
"......I, B‐{f:5:Beatrice}, as a good witch,
 swear to continue with my training for the sake of bringing happiness to the people.
 ......Is that alright?"
"Good.
 Battler is next."
"In the same way, Battler‐kun.
 Put your hand on the covenant, and take the oath.
 ......‘I, Ushiromiya Battler, as a member of the Golden Land, swear to serve for the sake of bringing happiness to myself and my neighbor’."
"Ah,
 ...I, Ushiromiya Battler,
 as a member of the Golden Land, swear to serve for the sake of bringing happiness to myself and my neighbor.
 ......I\'m embarrassed too..."
"Hear me, one and all...!!
 Here and now, we have gathered the oaths of all 18 humans accepting the Golden Land...!!"
When Kinzo proclaimed that, everyone applauded at once, praising us.
......Since I\'d been the only stubborn one and had just been a nuisance, I felt a little bad about being the most celebrated one.
"And with that, in accordance with the ancient rites, we ask Battler‐kun, the last to make the oath, to sign the invitation to the Golden Land.
 ......This is something that invites the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}, to the Golden Land.
 The Golden Land invites the Golden Witch through a consensus of those who have accepted it, and becomes complete."
"Battler, I will read it out loud.
 Listen carefully.
 ............‘The 18 of us acknowledge the Golden Witch to be {f:5:Beatrice}, and welcome her to the Golden Land’."
"What\'s going on with you? You won\'t be invited unless I send an invitation?"
"It seems that is the ceremony.
 It makes me uncomfortable also.
 Why don\'t we end it quickly?
 I\'ve been so hungry for a while now."
"......Come to think of it, I\'ve only been pecking at canned food and haven\'t eaten anything good.
 Let\'s get this thing signed and be done with it."
"Let\'s see here.
 "We accept you as a witch".
 .........Huh?
 That\'s pretty simple.
 Damn you, Grandfather, exaggerating how it actually says it."
"Come on, come on, quickly."
"Sign, right here."
"............huh...?"
"Quickly."
"Sign."
......With slightly weird and uncomfortable smiles, the two of them started demanding that I sign...
At that time, an incredible sound like that of a glass window breaking reverberated through the hall,
 and the bustling tumult melted back into complete silence.
I dropped the quill pen and turned around, trying to see what had happened.
When I did,
 ...............where had she come from?
...A human who clearly hadn\'t been there a short while ago was in the very center of the hall, ...looking up at us.
Who\'s that......?
 ......A woman?
{n}She\'s probably about the same age as Jessica and me.
......But I didn\'t know that face.
{n}None of the other people here knew that face either.
"......Wh‐......who are you?!
 Who is this?!
 Where did you come from?!
 Those without invitations are not needed in my party.
 Servants, throw her out!!"
"As you command!!
 Surround her!!"
The Seven Sisters of Purgatory surrounded her from seven directions, taking out magic blades that drew purple trails and blocking her.
And from out of nowhere, shuffling goat‐head servants appeared in great numbers, surrounding that woman.
On top of that, the Chiester Sisters stood in front of Beato like a wall, readying a golden bow and pulling back the bowstring...
"......................................."
But the woman didn\'t move at all.
...On the contrary, she was still staring at us on the landing, not paying them the slightest bit of attention.
......Who is she looking at...?
 Beato?
 Grandfather?
............It couldn\'t be......me.........?
Yes.
 ...The woman was staring straight into my eyes, ...glaring.
{n}Then, after our eyes met perfectly, she yelled.
"You must not sign that!!!
 Are you going to accept your own defeat?!
 Don\'t be tricked by the witch!!!"
"......Huh?
 By the witch,
 ......huh?!"
Just then, something incredibly strong lifted me by the nape of my neck.
...Wh‐what\'s going on...?!
And after I was forced to turn around,
 ......I saw {f:5:Virgilia} with an eerie smile on her face, and the muscular forms of goat monsters...
A goat monster that looked like it was two meters tall was holding me up with an arm as thick as a log...!
"Hohhohohohohohohohohohoho...
 There is no need to listen to an uninvited guest.
 Come, give your signature as well.
 On this written oath.
 "Ushiromiya Battler accepts the existence of witches".
 Come now, sign the written oath...!!"
"Ow, ...owowowowowowowowowowowow!!
 D‐damn it, let go!!!"
As the goat monsters constricted me with the power of a vise, they forced me to grab the quill pen.
...I couldn\'t even touch the floor with my feet, much less resist...!
"Battleer, why are you resistiiiing?
 Weren\'t you just about to sign willinglyyy...?
 Don\'t change your mind now, after all that, alriiiight?"
"Didn\'t you think for an instant, ...that it might be alright to accept witches?
 You thought that, riiiiiight?
 Kukki{0}ki{0}ki{0}kka{0}kka{0}ka{0}ka{0}ka{0}ka{0}ka{0}ka{0}kakaka!!"
"............I,
 ......I was...
...tr‐
...tricked......?
 That can\'t be.........
 You aren\'t that kind of—"
".............................."
"......Hi......hihhihahhahhahaaaHAAaHAHHH!!"
"Sorrrrry, Battleerrr, I am that kind of persooooooooooon!!
 Aah, it\'s no good, I can\'t keep this up, it looks like sentimental sob stories don\'t match well with meeeeeeeeeee!!
 Master, with all your strength, if you please!!
 That was such a plain role to play, and I got so bored!"
"I don\'t know who you are, woman!!
 But I\'ll beat you to death, mash you and crush you until threads start trailing, got iii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}iiit?!
 I\'ll make you regret being born a womaaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aaan,
 hyahhaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaahh!!"
Beato raised her gold pipe high,
 and the massive chandelier hanging in the hall crackled with electricity, and from that fell an almighty purple thunderbolt...!
It was a direct hit on the woman right below it, and should have turned her to ash.
However, ......not a single hair was singed.
"Hoh...!!
 I see you have what it takes to show up uninvited...!!
 Tell me! Say your name!!"
"I don\'t have any name to tell {i:you}.
 .........More importantly."
"......You idiot!!!
 How long are you going to be tricked?!!
 Stop being so naive and trusting!!
 Figure it out already!!
 All this, all of this is the witch\'s trap!!"
Those words were aimed at me.
......This is all...
...the witch\'s trap, she says...?
That can\'t be...
{n}Beato reformed and swore to become a good witch......
".....................Beato...............
 ...Calling it a trap...
...is a lie, right......?
 Please.........tell me it\'s a lie......"
"......Sorry, Battleer.
 It was pretty interesting."
"...Still, I was just trying to do what Master told me, but it really did work very well!"
"I hear, after acting {ruby:tsuntsun:bad‐tempered} and exploring the depths of cruelty, if you act properly incompetent and {ruby:dere:soft}, you can get a massive rise on that goodwill meter thing, riiight?"
"I\'ve heard that villains who go {ruby:dere:soft} and then {ruby:yan:crazy} are pretty popular these daaaays...!
 Despite how I loook, I\'ve studied a lot of manga, anime, and {c:86EF9C:galge} that have been popular recently, you seeee?"
"And I tried it out, and just as expected, it was "tears please", and you\'re down!!"
"Hihhyahhahhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha, idioooot, what a truly simple person!!
 They call this the "North Wind and the Sun Strategy".
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"
"......How could............
 ............D‐
............damn you......
 You two‐faced bitch......
 How dare you deceive me like this...!!"
"...................................."
"......Yes, that expression fits you the most.
 That caring expression of yours really doesn\'t match me after all.
 My back was itching, and I was frantically trying to withstand it.
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"
"Too baaad, wiiiitches...don\'t reforrrm{p:0:☆}"
"Hyaahhahhahhahhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh!!!
 You take care of the signature, Master!
 This uninvited guest is my prey!!"
"Come, you can no longer refuse to sign.
 ......Now, come on.
 Sign it and offer your body, your mind, and your soul...!!"
When {f:5:Virgilia} lifted her chin as a signal, the goat monsters, with an even more vise‐like power,
 forced my arm to approach the parchment......!
Owowowow... These guys are trying to make me sign, even if it breaks my arm......
At that moment, a bright red light burst open with me at the center, knocking the witches and the goat monsters away.
Did that woman save me......?!
{n}B‐but who in the world is that? I don\'t have a clue!
"How long do you plan to keep playing in a place like this...?
 Enough already.
 I\'m jealous of you."
"............I, I\'m glad you saved me, but that\'s a pretty cruel way to say it.
 ...Sorry, but who are you...?"
".....................
 ...............Witch of Rokkenjima!!
 It\'s time you gave him back!!"
"Kuhhahahahahahahahah!!
 Who would do that, you fool!!
 Battler is my toy.
 My favorite toy, the best toy in the world...!!"
"I won\'t get tired of him, I won\'t throw him away, I won\'t hand him over to anyone!!
 Even Battler is enjoying this to the fullest.
 Together with me, he is having so much fun playing.
 No matter who you are, I won\'t let you interfere...!!"
"Oh yeah, it really does look like you\'re living it up here, I\'m so jealous my blood is boiling!!
 In a wonderful place like this, guffawing and having a lively, fun, noisy blast of a time with everyone!"
"Surrounded by lots of eye‐candy witches and being pampered all the time,
 I\'m sure you\'re having so much fun, you don\'t even want to come back!!"
"......A‐...are you talking to me...?
 Wait wait, you\'ve got the wrong idea...!
 This is a pain for me too!
 The hell is fun about this, you don\'t know a damn thing about my troubles...!"
"What troubles?!!!
 You get to have fun living with Mom and Dad, you get to play around happily with all of the cousins,
 you get to play with pleasant witches as long as you want for all eternity!"
"Don\'t you realize the happiness you have?!
 I\'m jealous of all of you, don\'t you get it?!
 I\'d love to be part of all this!!"
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!
 I\'m sorry, but no.
 I am satisfied with the toys I have.
 A rude toy like you is not fitting for my toy box!"
"Yes, I\'m aware of that.
 Who would ever play with someone like you?
 ......But I will thank you a bit.
 ......For bringing everyone together like this."
"......Who...
......are you...
 .....................You can\'t be—"
"......I see, so that\'s it...
 .........Yes, I get it, I know who you are!
 ...I see,
 so {i:you} are the piece Lady {f:5:Bernkastel} threw in.
 I like it!!"
"Why don\'t I formally invite you to my party?!!
 I\'ll welcome you fully...!!
 Along with Battler, I\'ll play with you nicely, break you, kill you, crush you, turn you to ash, mix you with bread dough and bake you until you\'re fluffy!!
 Fuhha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aaaahh!!"
".........Ohhhh, that\'s no good, no good at all!
 You\'ll never be able to do that!
 Rokkenjima, in the year 1986.
 ...I will expose everything that happened then to the light of day!"
"I\'ll teach you that you\'re no more than needle ice, scared of the spring of truth!
 Prepare yourself, Golden Witch!
 {f:5:Beatrice}!!!""Hahahaha, wahahahaha!
 I never thought that Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}\'s piece would barge in at the very end...!"
"......I searched all over the place for a piece fitting for a game with you.
 ......I\'m sure that you\'ll grow to enjoy her."
"What\'s with that piece?!
 Who was that person, who was it?!
 She didn\'t say her name! That\'s not fair!!
 Hey, don\'t you think so too?!"
"...I have a general idea.
 ......Come on, normally, anyone would know."
"Normally?!
 No we wouldn\'t, it was that character\'s first appearance, wasn\'t it?!
 If she doesn\'t say her name, I won\'t—the players won\'t—everyone won\'t know, right?!"
"............Beato, it\'s alright if you don\'t tell her.
 See?
 Isn\'t she a funny kid?"
"M‐...mm.
 ......Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}\'s simple‐minded naiveté truly is precious and funny.
 ......*cackle*cackle*!"
"Why, why, why I am the only one you won\'t tell, you meanie!!
 Okay, in exchange, I\'ll teach you a special secret that only I know!
 So tell me!"
"......Hoh.
 A special secret, you say!
 Now that, I do want to hear...!"
"Blehhh!
 If you want me to tell you, first tell me who that woman really was!
 The secret I know sure is awesome!
 I mean, it\'s gonna blow you away like finding out that Santa‐san is actually Daddy!"
"Huh?
 *giggle*!
 Oopsie{p:0:☆} Sorry, I\'ll bet you\'re so shocked that your world turned upside‐down, right?!
 Oh‐hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho!"
".........Your father was the one who came to your place, Lambda?"
"To my place... Wait, what\'s that supposed to mean?"
"...Lord {f:5:Santa Claus} only visits the homes of children with clean hearts.
 He didn\'t come to your place, then?"
"Well, Lord {f:5:Santa Claus} is gracious.
 Unless you are a reeeally bad scoundrel, he will give you a present.
 After all, he even gave them to me!"
".........As you grow and your heart becomes hardened, he stops coming, doesn\'t he?
 How old were you, Beato, when he stopped coming?"
"Mm.
 He stopped coming when I was about twelve.
 My maiden\'s heart awoke, and I quickly got somewhat embarrassed about Lord {f:5:Santa} coming."
"After I wrote "Thanks for everything, that\'s enough.
 So make sure you splurge on the last presents", he stopped coming.
 Oooh, and I was looking forward to it too!
 How old were you when he stopped coming, Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}?"
".........I was pretty wild.
 ...It happened fairly early.
 I think when I was about nine.
 ...Something about that beard really irritated me, so I waited in my futon with some sewing scissors ready, thinking I\'d cut it off.
 ............What a cringeworthy age."
"So, ......Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}, as long as you can remember, Lord {f:5:Santa Claus} has never come to see you, you say.
 ............He usually comes until the last year of elementary school or during middle school."
"...Maybe we should have a doctor look at her.
 I hear that maturing too fast can have an adverse effect on the growth of mind and body.
 ...Yeah, there\'s definitely some of those.
 ...Adverse effects."
"Hey, wh‐what are you guys talking about!!
 Gaaaaah!!"
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!
 Wahahahaha, it truly is boisterous when three witches gather!"
"......If you\'re talking about that level of secret, I doubt it\'s worth listening to.
 Can I go now?
 I have to prepare for the next game."
"Wha—hey, wait a sec!
 Tell me who that woman really was!!"
"......Well then, tell me this special secret of yours first.
 If it\'s good enough, then I\'ll tell you."
"Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho!!
 Alright, I\'ll tell you, and it really is a special secret, okay?!
 ......Remember, in this game, there was a girl who found the gold and became the new witch, right?"
"Mm.
 Just what kind of secret could that person have?"
"Ehheheheheh!
 I realized who that girl actually is.
 Does anyone know?
 *giggle*giggle*!
 There was a hint in the way she talked."
"Remember, that girl said it a lot, right?
 "Why don\'t you something foreverrrr?",
 right?!
 Yes, that phrase was the main point!
 Foreverrrr?
 For Evaaaa?
 Yes!"
"She was actually...Ushiromiya Eva!!
 What do you think?!
 Are you shocked?!
 Oh‐hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho!!"
"Hoh...!
 I did not notice that!
 ...Mngh, to think that there would be a hint in a place like that."
"......You\'re good at playing along with her, Beato.
 This kid can get a little full of herself, so don\'t take it too far.
 See you, I\'m leaving."
"Wait, wait!
 It\'s not fair if you just listen to my secret and don\'t tell me yours!!
 Tell me who she really was!!"
"......Your secret was so incredible that mine just wouldn\'t match up.
 ...So in exchange, I\'ll tell you my own special secret.
 I\'ll tell you the name of the culprit in this game called {i:Higurashi no Naku Koro ni}."
"Gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, don\'t tell meee!!
 I\'m playing it right nowwww!!"
"......Ahhahahahahhahhahhahhah...
 See you, Beato.
 The black tea was delicious.
 Oh, about the crackers, though, the repertoire of jam was lacking.
 Get some gochujang chili paste every once in a while.
 It goes great with Russian tea.
 Later."
"I see. Alright.
 I shall try it.
 I shall call for you when the preparations are finished for the next game.
 Until then, feel free to draw up a strategy at your leisure."
"Yes, I will.
 This last game was pretty interesting.
 Later."
"Heyyy, wait a sec, tell meee!!!"
"*cackle*cackle*.
 My, my, you two really are close."
"..............................
 ......Yes, that\'s right.
 ...Oh, how I love you, {f:5:Bernkastel}.
 You could even say I\'m in love with you."
"......I want to gouge out her eyes so she can see no one other than me.
 ......Oh, wouldn\'t that just be to die for?
 It\'d be wonderful to dunk them in black tea.
 Ahah!"
"Who knew she had entranced Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} to this extent.
 ......It seems I carry a heavy responsibility.
 Still, this last game truly was close!
 I was a breath away from defeating Battler."
"..................Beato.
 Can I ask you something?"
"What is it?
 I won\'t tell you that girl\'s name.
 *cackle*cackle*!"
"...Just when are you going to stop screwing around?
 ...Do you even have the {i:slightest} intention of winning?"
{f:5:Lambdadelta} threatened her with a low voice that she had never used in front of {f:5:Bernkastel}.
...It completely blew away the calm atmosphere which had been there until a moment ago.
".........You know,
 I\'m supporting you \'cause you\'re meant to be a witch who can win against {f:5:Bernkastel}.
 If you don\'t have the power to win against her,
 then I\'m ready to abandon you at any time, got it......?"
"...............How scathing.
 What about me dissatisfies you?
 ...As you know, my game board is perfect.
 Lady {f:5:Bernkastel} will never be able to win..."
"Yeah, that\'s right.
 Your board truly is impressive.
 {f:5:Bernkastel} could spend a hundred years,
 or even a thousand years here, and she would still be unable to win against this game board, it truly is that impressive and perfect."
"......That\'s why, in exchange for letting me borrow that, I made you a witch.
 .........If I stop being your guardian, you\'ll immediately go back to being a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.
 ...Make sure you don\'t forget that, no matter how much incredible magical power you hold, ......you are nothing more than a temporary witch."
"I, ......I know that.
 ...I am grateful to you..."
"Don\'t speak so casually.
 I\'ll forgive that when {f:5:Bernkastel}\'s around, but I won\'t when she isn\'t.
 Recently, maybe you\'ve forgotten your debt to me."
"Th‐that is, .........n‐...not, ......not so, my Lady......"
"...Aah, changed my mind, that creeps me out.
 You can talk the same way as usual.
 But be mindful of what you say.
 ......I have a surprisingly short temper, you see?"
"M‐......mm......"
"Back to the point.
 ...Your game board truly is perfect.
 ......You should be able to defeat {f:5:Bernkastel} without any trouble.
 ...But that kid won\'t give in easily.
 She\'ll challenge you over and over."
"That is no problem.
 ...It has been certified by you, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}.
 ......My game board is perfect."
"Yeah, that\'s right, it\'s perfect.
 ............So long as you, the player, are perfect as well, that is?"
".........I don\'t understand what you mean by this..."
"What {i:I} mean by this...?
 That\'s what {i:I} want to ask {i:you}.
 .........You play around a lot in your games.
 ...At first, I thought it was part of your tactics, because it would completely baffle {f:5:Bernkastel} from time to time."
"............But I get the feeling that\'s not quite true.
 You\'re not playing around in a match you know you can win,
 ......the truth is, you don\'t care whether you win or lose, do you?"
"R‐......ridiculous...
 How could that be..."
"Listen close, okay?
 Your role is to break {f:5:Bernkastel}, force her to yield.
 In other words, that means being the victor in this game for all eternity.
 ......As long as you keep trying to become the {i:certain} victor, then I will give you my power as the Witch of Certainty.
 ............However."
"If you fight in a way that doesn\'t deny any possibility of your loss,
 ...that\'s a different story."
"This is a game, of course...
 In the same way that Lady {f:5:Bernkastel} will lose if I win,
 ...there will be some days on which I will lose and she will win.
 The possibility of loss always exists.
 That is why I—"
"...............This is why you\'re useless.
 There\'s no need for this to be a game board for you.
 It simply needs to be a bird cage to lock {f:5:Bernkastel} up here for all eternity."
"...What\'s the role of a bird cage?
 Making certain that the little bird inside never escapes.
 ......What\'s a bird cage worth if it has gaps that sometimes let the bird out?"
".........O‐of course, games exist to be won.
 So it is impossible for me to lose.
 ...Therefore, I will continue to win......
 ...As you wish, for all eternity..."
"Good answer—that\'s all I want.
 ......I\'ll allow you to play around and use fakes as part of your tactics.
 ...It was sometimes effective in this last game."
"............But hear this.
 If you make a move hoping for anything else other than victory,
 ............make sure you\'re wonderfully prepared, okay?"
"I, I will not do such a thing...
 I swear it...!"
"............Originally, you weren\'t even a witch,
 and I can remind you what a truly shabby creature you were at any time.
 ............If you betray my expectations...
 At that time, I will have a delightful delightful penalty waiting for you."
"...Of the billions of fragment worlds out there, ......I\'ll send you into the most miserable fragment and seal you there.
 .........You were miserable in the first place, so it\'ll be worth choosing a really miserable fragment.
 ...*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*."
"................................."
"Oh, how I love you, {f:5:Bernkastel}.
 ...Scrabble your feet in {f:5:Beatrice}\'s bird cage as much as you like,
 and spend a thousand years learning that you can no longer escape."
"......And when you give in,
 ...I\'ll train you so that you can\'t tweet in anyone\'s palm but mine."
"............*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*,
 ahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!!"A monotonous electronic sound kept on repeating.
The theme of that room was a so‐called "hygienic" emotionless white.
{n}...It was a room of a certain university hospital.
An ordinary person wouldn\'t be able to afford the cost of even a single night in this room,
 a room which neither her doctors, nor she herself, had any doubts would be the last she ever stayed in...
Was the person on the bed...
............Eva?
She looked haggard and aged, to the point that you would not believe it was her, unless you were told.
A well‐built man in a suit, waiting in the corner near the door, was having a conversation with the outside in a low voice, over the intercom.
...He was a guard protecting Eva\'s person.
After telling the person on the other end of the intercom to wait, he approached Eva\'s bed.
...Eva had been awake for a while.
......However, she stared at a single point in empty space, as though her mind was not in the same place.
"......Ange ({p:0:縁寿})‐san has arrived in the lobby below.
 Should we let her pass?"
"................................."
For a long time, Eva didn\'t answer.
However, bit by bit, her eyes began to regain their focus, and she gave a small nod, indicating that she didn\'t mind if they called Ange.
...Eva herself had been the one to call her.
 And she was right on time.
Eva now refused to meet anyone without an appointment made in advance.
The reason the room was dark, even though it was still light outside, was because the curtains were closed.
...There was always one guard waiting in the room, and three more waiting in the corridor and the lobby.
They were all there to protect Eva\'s person...
Eventually, there was the sound of a knock.
Also, there was a message from the intercom that the guest\'s body check had been completed with no problems.
The door was unlocked, then opened,
 .........and a woman of about high‐school age was standing there.
"Chairman.
 Ange‐san has arrived."
Eva reacted and turned her face towards the guest.
However, instead of reacting to the guard\'s call, maybe it would be better to say that she reacted to the smell of Ange\'s makeup.
......Having been shut up in this room for so long, Eva was sensitive to small changes in smell.
"........................
 So you came.
 ......Ange."
"......Yes, I did.
 You did call me."
On Eva\'s face, you couldn\'t find the expression of one warmly welcoming their niece.
{n}...And on Ange\'s face, you couldn\'t see the expression of one pleased to see their aunt.
Eva waved her arm, which had grown as thin as a withered branch, and motioned for the guard to leave.
The guard bowed silently and went out into the hall.
"......It\'s not only stuffy, but dark too.
 Why don\'t you have the curtains opened...?"
"...............And then the hitman you hired will shoot through the window, is that what you\'re planning......?"
".........If it came to that, I\'d much rather be the one paid to do the hit.
 All I\'d have to do is relax at home for a month and the job would take care of itself."
"...Heheheheh, hahhahhahhahha......"
Their discussion was quite morbid for an aunt and niece.
...However, they didn\'t look like they were joking.
{n}......At the very least, Eva did believe that someone was after her life.
All of the Ushiromiya family\'s massive fortune had come into the possession of Ushiromiya Eva.
...It was said that this fortune also included the ten tons of hidden gold that Ushiromiya Kinzo was rumored to have kept concealed.
They could do nothing while this vast wealth was in the hands of the cunning, sly, and extremely suspicious Eva,
 ......but it was rumored that if it passed on to Ange, who was no more than a young girl, certain people were plotting to snatch it away at once.
By now, Eva and Ange were Kinzo\'s only descendants.
{n}......If Eva died, all of the wealth would go to Ange.
...And if Ange were to be killed as well,
 ......that wealth would go to the family of Ange\'s mother, Kyrie.
In this sense, not only Eva, but Ange as well,
 ...was in a position where it wouldn\'t be odd at all for her life to be targeted by some unknown person.
......And Eva had hated Ange for a long time.
Because, after losing her precious only son George,
 ......she had learned that the only one who had survived to inherit her own wealth...
was Ange, who had been absent from that family conference twelve years ago.
Eva shunned Ange, hated her, even detested her.
She isolated Ange in a special school, and separated her from the youth and happiness normal people have, trying to deprive her life of all opportunity.
......However, Eva had succumbed to an incurable illness,
 and ironically, ...her remaining life was estimated to be the same as Kinzo\'s had been at that family conference twelve years earlier...
Both Eva and Ange...hated each other.
Even though they were each other\'s last blood relatives, ...they hated each other so much that they hoped the other would die quickly...
".........And?
 Why did you go to all the trouble of calling for me...?"
"......I don\'t have much time left.
 ......These quack doctors still have no idea what I was poisoned with.
 .........But I know.
 I\'m sure it\'s that secret assassination drug, the one that foreign intelligence agency was using."
"...Ooh, I\'m going to be killed, I\'m going to be killed...!!
 Aren\'t you lucky, very soon, I will die, and then you will be so relieved...!"
".................................
 ...What a pitiable person."
This always happened.
{n}......She immediately deviated from the main topic, distorting it into a more unsettling discussion.
Eva, who was full of suspicion, believed that someone was always after her life.
Indeed, after inheriting the vast wealth of the Ushiromiya family,
 she had used wild methods just like Kinzo had done in the past, and had repeatedly made money by any means necessary, creating many enemies along the way.
With a massive supply of capital, she had launched aggressive takeovers against businesses which were starting to have rapid growth,
 making them buy it back at a high price under the guise of reconciliation.
......Ironically, it was the same type of action that her husband\'s company had been hit with twelve years ago...
She had repeated this constantly for the past twelve years.
{n}......She had also earned a lot of hatred.
If her husband had heard of this from beyond the grave, he might have defended her, saying that this was because of the loneliness from losing her family.
......However, no one who knew her now would come to her defense.
For some time, Eva waxed eloquent about exactly how her life was being targeted,
 listing off names of people who likely held hatred for her,
 and sneering at the fact that she still hadn\'t been killed.
Even when Ange heard her own name included in that list,
 her expression did not change significantly, and she waited indifferently for Eva to tire herself out...
".........You know what?
 ............I really hate...
you."
"I\'m honored.
 Same here."
".........I built this future for George\'s sake.
 ......To think that it would be snatched away by you.
 ...To think that it would be stolen by Rudolf\'s daughter...
 .........I can\'t bear it.
 ......To think that not only will I not leave a child,
 ...but even my fortune will be stolen,
 .........that, to me, is just...
...unforgivable............!"
"......In that case, why don\'t you give all of your fortune to charity?
 What happened to all those religious people you\'ve requested so many times?"
"............*cackle*cackle*cackle*!
 They all say the same thing.
 ...My excessive wealth has become a burden to me.
 They always say something about how I need to give it up and cleanse myself.
 ......Ahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha!
 And then the idea came to me.
 To stop donating!"
For a time, Eva had invited in the founders of several strange new religious cults, perhaps looking for peace in her heart.
...But in the end, they did not give her heart any relief,
 and only further increased her suspicion...
".........If you\'ve got money to burn, why don\'t you start buying up thoroughbreds and make some corned beef?"
"I\'ve thought of something even more interesting.
 ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!
 I\'ve racked my brains over it a lot.
 What could I do to make things horrible for you?"
"......I thought about just killing you.
 I also thought about erasing all of my wealth, leaving you penniless, and kicking you out of the Ushiromiya family or something."
"Wouldn\'t that be wonderful?
 A lady brought up prim and proper, made to crawl around and prowl for moldy bread and muddy water.
 Aaah, that too would be truly glorious,
 *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!"
"............Having fun?"
"Oh, yes.
 It\'s fun to scare you...
 ......But very soon, I will die.
 ...So I thought about how I can continue to cause you pain even after I die."
".........And then, ......*cackle*cackle*!
 It was surprisingly simple.
 ......I called you because I wanted to tell you about it."
".....................I have midterms coming up.
 Keep it brief."
"...I have decided.
 I will have you inherit all of my fortune."
".................................
 ...Huh."
"Not only that,
 ......I decided that until the very day that I die,
 ...I\'ll increase that fortune as much as I can, inflate it to massive proportions and have you inherit all of it.
 ...*cackle*cackle*, can you even imagine what that would be like...?"
"......No idea.
 Because I\'m stupid."
"Ehhehhehheh, *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!
 No, you wouldn\'t have any idea, would you...!
 Look forward to it, it really is fun, being rich...!
 Every day, from morning till night, monsters from across Japan will come to play."
"From now on, your entire private life will be followed by talk shows and weekly magazines.
 The media criticize me no matter what I do or don\'t do!
 If I donate, they\'ll attack me as a bourgeois, and if I begrudge them that money, I\'ll be abused as a miser."
"Oh, every day really is wonderful, you see?
 I realized that I would love to invite you to that kind of life, when you are so young and have so much ahead of you.
 Isn\'t that just to die for?"
".........The public is right in its criticism of all that you\'ve done."
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!
 Yes, yes, I\'m sure that they are.
 ...Go ahead, insult me as much as you want.
 And then you will be burdened with that criticism."
"......Japanese culture says that good people live in honorable poverty, while the wealthy should die.
 No matter what you do or do not do, you will eventually be held up as a symbol of envy and hate from across Japan."
"...*cackle*cackle*cackle*!
 I wonder how twisted your life will become after living this way...?"
"You will have no allies!
 No one will listen to your worries.
 Insulting you will become a public sport.
 And no one can stop that!"
"Oh, Ange!
 Ehheheheheheh,
 oh, I\'m really looking forward to it.
 ...I wonder how you will live your life, and how you\'ll end it...!
 Relish your life of being unable to trust anyone in the world, love anyone, or talk with anyone...!!"
"I\'ll be patiently waiting for you in hell, waiting for you to come falling down, bringing that story of hardship with you.
 Heheheheh,
 ahahhahahahahahahaha,
 waah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah,
 ghhkk,
 *cough*cough*,
 ghah!!"
Her insane laughter turned into a painful cough.
Without changing her expression in the slightest, looking completely unconcerned,
 ......Ange stared at the only survivor of Rokkenjima.
Perhaps because he found the violent coughing odd, the guard flew in as he gave a short knock on the door.
Ange glanced at him, wordlessly showing that she hadn\'t moved a step from where she had been.
......Ange was prepared for some kind of trap to frame her in Eva\'s death.
 However, that was fortunately a needless anxiety.
As the guard rubbed Eva\'s back, he poured hot water from a thermos into a mug.
As he did, Eva kept coughing, looking like she was in pain.
Ange thought that this was probably the final form of the witch of Rokkenjima, and the last she would be able to see.
Eventually, Eva was able to moisten her throat and regain her normal breathing.
{n}...However, the glittering madness inside her eyes hadn\'t subsided in the slightest.
"*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*!!
 That cursed mass of gold and the inheritance of the Ushiromiya headship,
 ......as well as...
.........the name of the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}...
are now yours.
 ............Enjoy your insane, twisted life fitting for the name of the witch...!"
"I don\'t care about those.
 Enough of that, just tell me this.
 ......What happened on Rokkenjima that day?
 .........I don\'t believe that there was an accident.
 Tell me the truth about what happened that day, and why Mom and Dad and Nii‐san died......!!"
"*cackle*cackle*...!
 Oh, that must be the best way to harass you, mustn\'t it?
 ......What happened on that day?
 What happened on this very day in 1986...?
 ......You want to know what they said before they died, ......don\'t youuuu...?"
"I woOOn\'t tell yooOOOoouu,
 aaahh{0}hyah{0}hyah{0}hyah{0}hyah!!
 I\'ll leave behind the cursed gold!
 But you know what? I\'ll take the truth you desire with me to hell...!
 That\'s the best way I can harass you!!"
"Upset?
 If you want to hear, try going to hell and asking your family there!
 In that case, you better die right now, right?!
 Ahhaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha, why don\'t you just give up and die now and foreverrr?!
 Waaahhah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah‐hah!!"
That laugh continued until she started coughing again.
And that cough did not subside until she started moaning and going into convulsions......
October 4th, 1986.
On Rokkenjima, the Ushiromiya family\'s customary and final family conference was held.
And on the next day, October 5th...
an "extremely unfortunate accident" occurred, and the Ushiromiya family was wiped out.
"As good luck would have it", Ushiromiya Eva escaped from that,
 and succeeded almost all of the Ushiromiya family\'s fortune.
However, due to the many turbulent rumors surrounding the Ushiromiya family, the way Eva acted afterwards,
 and her unnatural actions at the time of the "unfortunate accident", there was public controversy over whether this might have been a plot to get all of the inheritance for herself.
Under pressure from the public, prosecutors attempted numerous investigations,
 and the media began tracing the outline of the murder plot under the name of Rokkenjimagate,
 but in the end, they were not able to find sufficient proof that this "unfortunate accident" was a crime.
However, because the media continued to give the impression that Rokkenjimagate was a murder plot by Eva,
 public opinion began to believe that she was the true culprit.
...Of course, all that easily condemnable overbearing financial activity which she had carried out using that vast wealth...
left a bad impression that only made matters worse.
Every time she did something and the rumors started spreading, the talk shows would bring back Rokkenjimagate,
 blaming the justice system by saying that she was the true culprit, and that the only reason that she hadn\'t been arrested was because even the police had been bribed.
And the impression that she was an evil criminal grew stronger and stronger...
Her heart eventually degenerated,
 ...and ironically, it began to transfigure her into the kind of human that the public expected...
By now, Eva had no one she trusted, and no family.
......Her beloved husband, Hideyoshi, was already no more, and the talk shows would occasionally mention his company,
 saying that it was run recklessly, while criticizing and disgracing its former accomplishments.
Even her beloved son, George,
 was dramatized as the stereotypical "rich, lazy son" that the public expected,
 ...and no one even attempted to find out what a simple and honest character he had possessed.
...As to how much all of this hurt Eva and ran her to ruin, ...no one was interested.
The public was only interested in the idea of an evil woman who had gone so far as to kill her whole family to become a multimillionaire,
 and in what kind of pitiful final years she would lead.
So she changed more and more,
 ...until eventually...
{n}...Eva\'s personality was transfigured to the point that she was treated as a lunatic......
It was said that she sometimes remembered that this was exactly the same way her father Kinzo, who she had once admired, had been in his later years,
 and laughed at herself with scorn...
And, on the day of that final family conference...
Because Ushiromiya Rudolf\'s daughter, Ange, had been sick and had stayed with her mother\'s family, she had not participated.
At the age of six, she lost her family and gained Eva as her guardian.
Since Ange had become Eva\'s only blood relative,
 Eva "took very good care of her".
She had imposing guards always surrounding Ange\'s person, to prevent her from coming to harm.
......Ange had even her right to play with friends, to come home from school together, and to enjoy the seasons together...stolen.
"So that she can live a full and pleasant school life",
 Eva sent Ange to an elegant boarding school which took care of her every need, completely isolating her from the world.
She didn\'t even know the popular songs that girls her age might hum.
She was never once given a chance to enjoy window shopping with her friends, or stuff her mouth with crêpes,
 ...much less an encounter with a member of the opposite sex to make her heart throb.
Ange did not have a single friend.
 If anyone carelessly acted friendly with Ange, they would be scolded by the guards, or else the teachers.
......All of them were strictly ordered not to let the peasants approach the daughter of the esteemed Ushiromiya family.
During that time, the talk shows were always talking about Ushiromiya Eva, and always spreading rumors about her many financial evil deeds.
......Those who found out that she was her "daughter" naturally began to keep their distance.
...Even now, she was called a witch at school, and any time something adverse happened,
 it was baselessly whispered as truth that the school was operating according to her wishes, and that she had something to do with it.
The environment makes the person.
{n}By now, she had a heart as hardened as those around her feared.
...She trusted no one, and didn\'t even try.
{n}She loved no one, and didn\'t even try.
And on top of all of this, when Eva caught an incurable illness,
 it was whispered that this too had been planned, and this time, Ange was set up as the mastermind...
Everyone whispered that the daughter of a witch was a witch.
{n}Even the talk shows and the weekly magazines whispered that.
...So Ange, too,
 because of that,
 no,
 as though it might as well be true, accepted it.
Therefore, since she already believed that she was a witch,
 when she heard that the name of the Golden Witch was being turned over to her, she felt nothing if not completely unfazed.
However, she was at least sure of one thing.
This title of witch that she had inherited would definitely never be inherited by anyone else.
She would be the last head of the Ushiromiya family, and the last, isolated, Golden Witch......
Ange could be seen on the roof of a skyscraper.
Compared to the winds of the world which had beaten down upon her until now, this strong, cold wind was warm and pleasant.
Below her lay a beautiful nighttime scene, and a dazzling river of red and white lights.
It was a clear sky tonight.
 ...So there really should have been countless stars stretching out over the sky.
 ...However, the light from the ground was so bright, you couldn\'t see them at all.
...Ange couldn\'t help but think that what she really sought lay somewhere in that unseen starlight.
The world of reality below her looked so far away from here.
...This place felt to her as the closest to the world she should really be in.
............There was only one thing that Ange cursed:
Why had I not been able to go to that family conference, on that day twelve years ago?
If I had gone, I would probably have been able to be with my family forever.
...Recently, ...I\'ve been having a dream about my family, over and over again.
My self of twelve years ago calls out frantically, urging them not to go to the family conference.
But both Mom and Dad are too far away, and my hand won\'t reach them.
I reach for the hand of Battler nii‐san, who always really loved me—for the hand that would always pat my head—
 .........but even though it looks like it\'s so close to reaching, even that falls short.
For some reason, I started having that dream over and over again.
......Whenever I have that dream,
 I repeat my useless effort inside the dream, trying to stretch out my hand even more forcefully.
If only Battler nii‐san at least could have lived...
.........then perhaps, at least the two of us could have supported each other through life in this cold and lonely reality.
But his hand never reaches me.
So even if I climb to the roof of a building as tall as this one,
 ......I am distantly separated from all of them.
......A mysterious girl appears in my dreams and urges me.
That girl in my dreams urges me to arrive at the truth of what happened twelve years ago.
"........................
 ......If I could learn...
what happened to Dad and everyone else on that day,
 ............would they come back?
 At least one of them...!"
There was no way...
...that anyone existed who could answer those words.
I understand.
 .........In this world, I have no family, no friends, no one.
So,
 ............let\'s go.
 ...Let\'s go home.
{n}......To where my family is.
From the beginning, ...Ange\'s figure had been on the far side of the fence.
The scenery below her eyes was distant, beautiful, and so fantastical that it did not give rise to the slightest bit of fear.
If I face down, I\'ll surely be taken to the world below.
......So I faced up.
Because I wanted to be taken to the world above, the world where my family was.
.........Who cares about vast wealth.
 Who cares about cursed gold.
{n}Who cares about the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}.
What I really want...isn\'t something that even a mountain of gold will help me obtain...
What I need for that...is just the small amount of courage...to take a single step forward.
............Just then,
 ...I definitely heard a voice.
{n}I knew that voice.
The voice that had always......called to me in my dreams...
Before my eyes, ......in other words, in mid‐air above that jet‐black nighttime scenery...
......There was the figure of that girl I had seen in my dreams...
She spoke again, with the same voice I had heard inside my dreams.
".........Your assistance is needed."
"...My...
.........assistance......?
 Who needs it......?"
".........Your family needs it.
 ...Your family is eternally imprisoned in the two‐day span that began on this day twelve years ago."
"I‐...if I save them,
 ......does that mean my family will come back?!"
When I asked the question I most wanted to ask, the girl cruelly stopped talking and hung her head.
"......I cannot promise that.
 The enemy is the Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}.
 ...A mighty opponent.
 I cannot compete with her.
 ......But another Golden Witch might be able to manage something."
"............I, I don\'t know...what you\'re talking about."
"......The only one who can oppose the {f:5:Beatrice} of 1986...
is the final {f:5:Beatrice}, of 1998.
 .........In other words, you.
 Ange.
 .........{f:5:Ange Beatrice}."
"That witch from twelve years ago...
...took away my family.........?"
"Yes.
 She is responsible for what happened to your family.
 ............The source that always leads to your future of isolation."
"........................
 ......My...
...family\'s...
......killer."
"......In exchange, I will search for the fragment with the ideal world that you wish for, the world where your family comes home.
 .........But I can\'t promise you that your desire will be granted.
 ...The game board of the 1986 {f:5:Beatrice} is quite perfect."
"......I had planned on bringing you that ideal fragment as a present today, but I still can\'t find it.
 ............It\'s a very firm fate.
 I haven\'t seen the likes of it since I fought with {f:5:Lambdadelta}."
".............................................
 I,
 ......I don\'t know...
...what you\'re talking about."
".........I\'m giving you a chance for revenge.
 ...In exchange, I promise to find and bring you the happiest resolution that it is possible for you to receive."
"..............................Revenge......"
"......It may be a fruitless effort.
 Even if you succeed in your revenge, there\'s no definite proof that your family will return.
 Even with a miraculous probability, you may only be able to bring one person back."
...Ange now understood the meaning of that dream.
......That dream where it seemed that, with just a little bit more, her hand might at least be able to reach Battler nii‐san.
"A miraculous probability......is still higher than zero, right...?
 Is it about one percent...?"
"......All probability values are powerless before the result.
 So I cannot tell you that number."
"But unlike if I don\'t do anything, there definitely is a small possibility."
"Yes.
 As long as you do not throw your hope away.
 ...But prepare yourself.
 It is extremely close to zero."
"..................
 Alright.
 I\'m in."
"......Are you sure?
 You\'ll probably never be able to come back here again."
"This is not the world where I belong.
 ......And...as for the world where I do belong...I\'ll find it myself.
 Tell me your name."
"The Witch of Miracles, {f:5:Bernkastel}.
 And by that name,
 I acknowledge you as the Golden Witch, {f:5:Ange Beatrice}.
 ......As of now, you are a true witch."
The instant she proclaimed that I was a witch...
...I felt dizzy, as though something inside me had changed drastically.
Just then, I heard a slam.
{n}...It was the sound of the door connecting the staircase to the roof being opened.
There were Aunt Eva\'s guards.
...“Guards” only in name.{n}Aren\'t they the cage that\'s closest to me, shutting me in?
They saw that I was already on the other side of the fence and dashed forward, horrified.
"20, target found.
 Requesting assistance on the roof."
"Ange‐san...!
 We were looking for you!
 It\'s dangerous there, so quickly, come this way!"
".........What\'s that?"
"......My fan club.
 ...I\'m pretty popular."
"No point in getting caught.
 .........Let\'s go."
Looking annoyed, {f:5:Bernkastel} turned on her heels.
 ...In the jet black sky.
Watching that perfectly casual gesture, I followed her as though it was completely normal.
"Ange‐san!!!
 Wait!
 Don\'t be hasty, look ooooooooooouuuut!!"
"Oh, it\'s no good, it\'s no goddamn good at all.
 Time to go. <See you again>."
"Please send a limo to get me.
 \'Cause everyone else will be with me too.
 See you."
