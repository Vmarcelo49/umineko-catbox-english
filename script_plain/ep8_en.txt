`Two silhouettes could be seen in the chapel.`
`{n}A big brother...and his little sister.`
`The big brother who would never return from that day twelve years in the past, and the little sister who waited all alone twelve years in the future.`
`However, the big brother knew everything, understood everything.`
`{n}And the little sister knew nothing, understood nothing.`
`So, no matter how much time passed, the little sister remained as the girl she had been twelve years before.`
`She remained a six‐year‐old girl forever......`
`Her sobs into her big brother's chest finally subsided......`
`She quietly waited for his next words.`
`After patting her head gently, the big brother fished around inside his shirt pocket.`
`Then, ......he took something out.`
`"Are you listening, Ange?`
` Take good care of this."`
`".........What is it...?`
` .........A key...?"`
`Battler took a large key attached to a necklace out of his pocket, then held it out to Ange.`
`It was large enough to cover Battler's entire palm,`
` and little Ange probably wouldn't even be able to wrap her hand all the way around it.`
`The key glittered gold and had a beautiful, intricate design.`
`Its weight alone made it clear that this key was something very important.`
`Battler put the necklace around Ange's neck.`
`"This precious key is yours alone, Ange."`
`"What's it for......?"`
`"The time to use it will come soon.`
` When it does, you'll have to decide for yourself.`
` ......Understand?"`
`......Of course, she didn't have a clue what Battler was talking about.`
`But she did realize that he was telling her to take good care of this key.`
` So, Ange nodded, at least in response to that part.`
`In her hand, the key had felt heavy.`
` However, now that it was around her neck, it felt as light as an ordinary necklace.`
`How strange.`
`"Okay, let's go."`
`"Where......?"`
`She had been sure that her brother was about to sit down.`
`Just a second ago, he had said that he'd tell her what happened on Rokkenjima that day.`
`She had thought that he would tell her here......`
`"On that day, on that island...`
` What happened?"`
`"Weren't you about to tell me that, Onii‐chan...?"`
`"Oh, I will.`
` I'll tell the story and let you listen.`
` ......However, it might be the kind of thing you can't really feel if you just hear about it from someone else."`
`".........What do you mean...?"`
`"What you really want...isn't to know what happened on that island on that day."`
`......So, ......he does understand, after all.`
`What happened on that island that day?`
`Trying to answer that question was all I was capable of, so I wished for nothing more.`
`......But, if I could...`
`I'd......want to go there.`
`To that island.`
` On that day.`
`To Rokkenjima, on that day I couldn't go... To the Ushiromiya family mansion.`
`Mom and Dad.`
` All my cousins, all my relatives.`
` And...everyone else.`
`I want to go back......to that island on that day.`
`So, I've always remained the way I was on that day.`
`{n}My heart and soul stopped, stuck as a six‐year‐old's forever...`
`"......I want to go back there."`
`"I know."`
`"Mom, Dad, Onii‐chan.`
` Everyone.`
` .........I want to go......to where everyone is......"`
`"That's why......I've decided to invite you there."`
`".........Huh...?"`
`"I'm the Game Master now.`
` Only those who know everything about the game board can open it up and invite pieces in.`
` ......So, I'll invite you to come to the game board."`
`"You'll......take me to Rokkenjima......on that day......"`
`"That's right.`
` I'll invite you to the Rokkenjima of 1986."`
`"Will I be able to see them?`
` Everyone......?"`
`"Of course."`
`"Even though......my memory is vague, ......and I can't remember anyone's faces clearly..."`
`"You'll remember soon enough.`
` ...And, though it'll be a reunion after twelve years for you,`
` ......it'll only have been a short gap for the rest of us.`
` ......Everyone will welcome you.`
` Everyone will welcome you back from the distant future."`
`"Will I......be able to stay there forever......?"`
`This way, ......I'll be able to be with everyone forever.`
`{n}This is the goal I'm supposed to reach......`
`"Ange, listen to me carefully."`
`But Battler spoke in an admonishing tone.`
`{n}As though warning me that this dream would not be granted...`
`"The Rokkenjima family conference only lasts one night.`
` Although, the typhoon stopped the boat from coming that day, so it went on for one night more."`
`"So, when the typhoon passes, ......I'll have to leave the island again...?"`
`"......Not exactly.`
` The decision is yours, Ange."`
`"........................"`
`"You have to decide that yourself."`
`......I understand, of course.`
`I don't exist on that island on that day.`
`It's a miracle just to be invited there like this.`
`Just the two days before the typhoon passes.`
` Just getting those two days to myself is already the sort of miracle that will never come again.`
`If I'm greedy enough to ask for more, that faint miracle might vanish.`
`......Even though I thought this, my young heart, which was still six years old, wasn't satisfied with that short‐lived miracle...`
`"I don't want to leave."`
`".........I know."`
`"I'll be with everyone forever.`
` I'll stay with my family.`
` Even if you tell me I have to head back, ......I'll stay on Rokkenjima."`
`"You can stay or you can leave, but it's not as though one of those is "the right choice".`
` That's not how it is, Ange."`
`"......Even so, you'll let me choose......?"`
`"Yes.`
` That's what the key is for."`
`Battler touched the glittering key that hung from Ange's neck.`
`"I've...already made my decision."`
`"You don't have to decide now.`
` The time to choose will come soon.`
` ......When it does, you must use your honest heart to choose how you'll use that key."`
`"..........................."`
`"You don't need to listen to anything I tell you.`
` You're free to decide however you like.`
` ............However,`
` if you're a good kid, and if you can trust your big brother..."`
`"......Then what......?"`
`"Then believe everything I tell you."`
`"Believe......everything..."`
`"That will lead to the best choice for you.`
` Listen to my words and believe everything I say.`
` ......Can you do that?"`
`"............I don't know."`
`"That's good enough.`
` Just believe whatever you want to.`
` That's also for you to decide."`
`"......If I don't believe you,`
` ......will I wake up from this dream...?"`
`"That won't happen.`
` So don't worry."`
`For some reason, Ange was suspicious of her brother...and scared of him.`
`Her wish was to remain on that island on that day, together with her family, forever.`
`......She was afraid that, once she got her two miraculous days,`
` ......her brother might tell her to be satisfied with those, and ask her to return to twelve years in the future all alone.`
`"I already told you.`
` ......You can go, or you can stay.`
` There is no right decision.`
` That's for you to decide.`
` And you don't need to make your decision right now."`
`"And no one will force me to make either choice...?"`
`"Of course."`
`"You won't tell me.........to go back to the future......?"`
`".........There is a choice that I want you to choose.`
` ......I want you to reach that decision by yourself.`
` So, though I hope you make a certain choice, I will respect your decision."`
`"And I've already told you.`
` I've already made my choice."`
`"And I told you.`
` Now isn't the time to choose."`
`"When will it be time?"`
`"The key will tell you."`
`The large, gold key hung from Ange's neck.`
`Her small hand held it tightly......`
`.........At that moment, she noticed a book lying on the chapel's altar.`
`The book had a lock on it, and was sealed so that it could not be read without a key.`
`Ange looked between the key hanging at her chest and the book on the altar.`
`".........Will this key unlock that book?"`
`"Don't touch that."`
`His sudden, forceful response made Ange flinch.`
`Battler, realizing he had scared Ange, softened his expression.`
`"Come on, let's go.`
` .........I'm inviting you to come back to October 4th, 1986."`
`"Okay."`
`Battler held out his hand, and Ange gripped it tightly.`
`Then, they started walking.`
`A brilliant light lay beyond the chapel's door.`
`That blinding light peeked in through the cracks around the door.`
`......The brother and sister began to walk through to the other side......`
`{a:c:`
`Welcome back, Ange.`
` And after this, that will be it.}`
`{a:c:`
`Just for you, I'll open this game board...{n}......one final time......}``"Gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!`
` Gonna fall, gonna fall, gonna faaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aalllll!!!"`
`Once again, Captain Kawabata's ferryboat to Rokkenjima cut across the sea in perfect form.`
`Yes.`
` The tale of October 4th, 1986, always begins with Battler's screams.`
`But this time, one thing was different.`
`{n}There was another person's yell alongside Battler's.`
`Battler was screaming.`
`{n}The other was...laughing?`
`"Gonna fall, gonna fall, gonna faaaaaaallll!!`
` Nooo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}ooo...!!"`
`"Fun, fun, fuuuuuunnn!!`
` *giggle*, *giggle*giggle*giggle*!!"`
`"Battler looks funny, Battler looks funny!!`
` *giggle*, *giggle*giggle*!!"`
`Alongside the big brother, who was grasping at the handrail and screaming in a way that no one his age should,`
` was the little sister, also grasping the handrail and jumping about like it was a ride at an amusement park. George and the others just couldn't hold in their laughter at the difference.`
`"Even after six years, Battler‐kun's still just as energetic as I remember him."`
`"Ange and Maria look more lively than usual this year, too."`
`"Could this be the first time we've had all five cousins together?"`
`"Oh, is it?`
` Well, then, yeah!`
` This year's gonna be more lively than ever before."`
`"G‐George‐anikiiiiiiiii!!`
` Don't you think this is way too fast?!`
` I'm begging you, ask the captain to slow down before it's too laaaate!!"`
`"Kihiha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!`
` You call this fast? Battler, you're a wimp! You're a wimp!"`
`"I wanna go faster!!`
` Faster, faster!`
` *giggle*giggle*!!"`
`"Any faster than this, and your onii‐chan's gonna fall right off the boat!!`
` Is that what you want?!`
` I'm gonna faa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aaalllll!!!"`
`"Hahaha.`
` Well, the votes have been counted, and Battler‐kun's proposal to lower the speed is—"`
`"Rejected, it looks like!`
` Aha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha."`
`"Look out, Onii‐chan. You're gonna fall, you're gonna fall!`
` Ahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!"`
`"Battler needs to be punished for his cowardice!! Tickle time!`
` Kihihihihiii!!"`
`"W‐wait, stop, Maria!!`
` You too, Ange!`
` N‐nooo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}ooo!!"`
`"Thank goodness for that.`
` I was worried about Ange's health, but she looks just fine."`
`"It would've been too sad to leave her behind at home.`
` I'm glad we decided to bring her anyway."`
`"Wasn't she very sick shortly before you left?"`
`"She was all better this morning.`
` Kids can be so incredible sometimes."`
`"I'll bet she's the type to get sick when she's stressed or overexcited!`
` It's not that strange for people like that to get all better when the big day finally comes."`
`"She must really have been looking forward to playing with all five of the cousins together."`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho.`
` Just watching them play together makes one feel charged with energy, doesn't it?"`
`The adults smiled as they watched the children play around.`
`Ange had gotten very sick. For a time, everyone had expected that she would be absent, but she had made a miraculous recovery.`
`Thanks in part to her strong desire to join in, she had come along to the family conference with the others.`
`And so...`
`For the first time ever, all five cousins were gathered together.`
`{n}October 4th, 1986, became a day like no other.`
`The kids dashed up the path leading from the harbor to the rose garden.`
`They were probably so charged up that even walking was too boring for them.`
`"Wahhahahaha!`
` See that?!`
` First pla~ce!"`
`Battler was the first to leap across the finish line that was the entrance to the rose garden.`
`Apparently, he was trying to make up for the dishonor he had suffered on the boat by proving his superiority on land.`
`A short while later, Ange and Maria reached him in a dead heat.`
`"I'm second!!`
` I'm faster than Ange, uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`"No, you aren't! Maria onee‐chan cheated!!`
` I'm second!!"`
`The three‐year gap between Ange and Maria was large, especially since both of them were growing kids.`
`It was only natural that Maria was faster, but Ange seemed to be complaining about a shoulder bump at the start line.`
`Maria onee‐chan cheated, so she gets last place!`
` Teacher always says you get last place if you cheat! ...Protested Ange.`
`"Come on, no need to fight.`
` Geez, you're both so fast...!"`
`"It's been a long time since I last ran like that......`
` Ah, the breeze feels so nice."`
`"Are you out of shape, George‐aniki?`
` You know, anyone who runs the daily "race to beat the bell" gets strong legs automatically."`
`"In other words, being a fast runner is proof that you sleep in."`
`"Onii‐chan always sleeps in!`
` He didn't wake up today either, so I had to wake him up!`
` Right?!"`
`"A stomp followed by a flying elbow.`
` And that body press from the top rope at the end there just about finished me."`
`"After a wake‐up like that, it sounds like you'd never get up again..."`
`"Sounds fun!`
` I wanna do it too, I wanna do it too!"`
`"I'll bet Onii‐chan sleeps in tomorrow!`
` We'll wake him up together this time, okay?! *giggle*giggle*!"`
`"......I'd recommend against staying up too late tonight."`
`Finally, the adults came into sight.`
`The cousins waved at them, urging them to hurry up.`
`{n}Ange and Maria were so excited that they could hardly wait.`
`Just by having all five cousins together...`
`{n}Just by adding Ange into the group...`
`Look at how energetic this day has become.`
`"Excuse me.`
` The family members have arrived."`
`"They made it here safely, then?`
` I must let Father know."`
`"Are they all in the guesthouse now?"`
`"Yes.`
` They will come here to meet you after they have set down their luggage."`
`"Understood.`
` Kanon, please guide everyone.`
` Shannon, quickly get some tea ready."`
`""As you wish, Madam.""`
`"Father. It's me, Krauss.`
` It's about time for you to get ready."`
`After Krauss knocked on the door, it opened from the inside.`
`"Oh, Doctor Nanjo.`
` How is Father doing?"`
`"No need to worry.`
` He's changing as we speak.`
` I think he's just a little nervous."`
`"Who are you calling nervous?!!`
` Nnhh, I cannot find my favorite One‐winged necktie pin!`
` How many times must I tell Natsuhi?`
` My possessions must never be moved without my approval...!"`
`Apparently, Kinzo had been in a panic for some time over the simple matter of choosing a tie and tie pin.`
`Kinzo, who valued the dignity of the family head above all else, always made a big deal about being appropriately attired.`
`"......Will he make it in time?"`
`"Do you think you could give us a little longer?`
` We'll come down as soon as he's ready."`
`"Understood.`
` I'm counting on you, Doctor Nanjo.`
` ......Father.`
` That necktie pin you have there looks splendid on you as well."`
`"The necktie pin "I have there"?!! Is {i:that} your suggestion?!!`
` The family conference is held but once a year!`
` Mgggh, there shall be no compromise! I must have that specific pin!!`
` Where is it, where, where?!!"`
`"Kinzo‐san, you already looked in that drawer five seconds ago......`
` Besides, you own several splendid necktie pins.`
` It would be stylish to select one befitting this auspicious occasion."`
`"Hmmmmmm, you think so?`
` So, I don't need to use the One‐winged Eagle pin...?`
` Hmmmmm......"`
`As Krauss watched Nanjo calm Kinzo down,`
` he began to wonder why this doctor wasn't his mother.`
`Well, it was always like this.`
`He always makes a fuss when no one's looking, but when the time comes, he makes his decision with pride.`
`After asking Nanjo to come down by lunch at the latest, Krauss snuck out of the study...`
`"What do you think? A splendid aroma, is it not?!`
` And a unique one, as well!"`
`"I've never had pumpkin tea before...`
` That little touch of sweetness makes it delicious."`
`Before serving the tea to the guests, Gohda served some to Shannon.`
`Until then, Shannon had thought it would be outrageous for a servant such as herself to drink the same thing as the family and their guests.`
`However, according to Gohda, that kind of thinking was a mistake.`
`"One must not serve something if one does not know the taste beforehand.`
` ......For example, when you visit a restaurant,`
` what are you likely to ask the waiter if a dish you've never heard of catches your eye?`
` "How does this dish taste", correct?"`
`"I see...`
` If the waiter says that he's never tried it, that would seem a bit odd......"`
`"Precisely.`
` As a matter of course, anyone serving their customers must be deeply acquainted with the taste of the tea and food they serve."`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho.`
` And you'll always feel happier serving a sort of tea that you've tried and enjoyed for yourself."`
`"That's right.`
` After tasting tea this delicious, I can't wait to let everyone else try it."`
`"And because of that!`
` We servants must be very familiar with the tastes of all sorts of foods.`
` So if you ever catch me stealing a little nibble, that's all part of my job description... Hoh‐hoh‐ho."`
`"It's both a perk and a part of the job.`
` Do you understand?"`
`"Yes!"`
`"......Everything is proceeding smoothly.`
` Are there any problems with the tea?"`
`"Oh, Genji‐san, you must try some as well.`
` Seeing as it's almost Halloween, I decided to make some pumpkin tea."`
`"Later, perhaps.`
` The family will be arriving at the mansion very soon.`
` ......It looks as though the children will be with them."`
`"Yes sir.`
` The cups are ready to go as well."`
`At that moment, the kitchen's extension line started to ring.`
`Genji, who was standing right beside it, swiftly picked up the receiver before the second ring.`
`Shannon and the others always thought Genji looked like a samurai when he did this.`
`"......OK.`
` Take care when guiding them."`
`After making that short response, Genji set the receiver down.`
`"That was Kanon.`
` The relatives will be here shortly.`
` The children are with them.`
` Shannon, Kumasawa, go to serve them.`
` Gohda, hurry up with that tea."`
`"""Right away!"""`
`The family conference—the largest event of the year for the servants.`
` Their morale was high, and they were all full of determination to make it through another year by banding together.`
`"Pardon the interruption.`
` The relatives are here."`
`"Oho, you made it.`
` Did you have any difficulties en route?"`
`"Nii‐san, you've been doing pretty well for yourself lately, haven't you?`
` Isn't it about time you bought a private jet?"`
`"Wahahahaha.`
` It was another flight with only us Ushiromiyas on board!"`
`"Ange‐chan,`
` isn't it lucky that you could come?`
` I was so worried when I heard that you might be too sick to make it today."`
`"Thanks for your concern.`
` She suddenly got all better this morning."`
`"My tummy ache went away!`
` I rubbed my tummy clockwise!"`
`"Uu‐uu!`
` That's a magic charm to heal tummy aches!"`
`"Now, Maria, quiet down..."`
`"Oh, is that Battler‐kun...?!`
` You've grown so big!"`
`"It's been six years, hasn't it?`
` You've grown splendidly."`
`"Well, ......ihihi.`
` I do keep getting bigger, at least..."`
`"Can't really say that about his guts though!"`
`"Yep, it's nice to know he's still the same old Battler‐kun."`
`Everyone laughed.`
` No matter how big his body grew, Battler would always be Battler.`
`"This brat's always been terrified of falling off planes and boats and stuff."`
`"Would that be Asumu‐san's blood?"`
`"I'm pretty sure I know what did it.`
` It's probably because we made him ride all those wild rides in amusement parks when he was little."`
`"Aren't there height restrictions to stop children from riding those things?"`
`"Ah, no, not those.`
` I'm talking about teacup rides, paddle boats, all that kind of stuff, you know?`
` Looks like we took those a bit too rough back in the day."`
`"You've always gone a bit overboard on rides like that, Rudolf nii‐san."`
`"Oh, dear, I see......`
` Poor Battler‐kun."`
`"Haha, poor Battler‐kun indeed."`
`"Still, it's comforting, in a way.`
` That fear of riding things shows he's still the Battler‐kun we all know so well."`
`"Onii‐chan isn't scared of riding things.`
` He's scared of falling off them!"`
`"Gonna faaall, gonna faaall!!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`"Hey, stop running around...!`
` Maria! You're one of the big cousins now, right?`
` Be a good example!"`
`"Pardon me.`
` I've brought some tea for everyone."`
`A pleasant aroma followed Shannon as she came into the room pushing a serving cart.`
`Even Ange and Maria, who had been running around in circles, sat down obediently when they heard that drinks were here.`
`"By the way, what's Dad doing?"`
`"He should be down here soon.`
` He's been rushing about all morning trying to choose a tie."`
`"You mean, all that about choosing an attire suitable for the family head?"`
`"Father's always been picky about ties, hasn't he?"`
`"It's just something he has a passion for.`
` Staying stylish is a good thing."`
`"And yet, he always shows up wearing the same tie in the end."`
`The family members burst out laughing.`
`The sweet scent of Gohda's specially made pumpkin tea spread throughout the parlor, and the calm atmosphere grew more cheery and excited.`
`"Look, Mama! Look, Mama!`
` It's a pumpkin cookie! For Halloween!!"`
`"Oh, that's right.`
` This sweet scent is kabocha, isn't it?"`
`"That's right.`
` Today, we have some special pumpkin‐flavored tea for you to try.`
` It really is delicious, so I suggest you try some without sugar first."`
`"Nee‐san, your sleeve.`
` Be careful."`
`"Wow,`
` I've never even heard of something like kabocha tea...`
` How does Gohda‐san find this stuff?"`
`"Delicious.`
` This is excellent.`
` You can taste the kabocha's natural sweetness."`
`"Kabocha tea, huh?`
` Still, kabocha always tastes best in tempura!"`
`"Uu!`
` It's not "kabocha", it's "pumpkin"!"`
`"Yeah, pumpkin is different from kabocha!`
` This is pumpkin!"`
`Maria seemed to be complaining about the difference of nuance between the Japanese and English words,`
` but it looked like Ange thought kabocha and pumpkins were entirely different things.`
`Everyone laughed, but Ange cocked her head to one side discontentedly, not understanding what was so funny.`
`Just when it looked like she was about to get in a bad mood and start grumbling, Maria started teaching her a "cookie game", and Ange immediately became engrossed with that distraction.`
`Then, the clomping sound of approaching heavy footsteps could be heard from the hallway.`
`Having a pretty good idea of whose footsteps they were, the relatives straightened their backs.`
`Those quick footsteps stopped for a moment just outside the parlor door.`
`......As though someone was taking a deep breath and setting up a dramatic pause.`
`Then, as the door exploded open, Kinzo—with Genji and Nanjo standing behind him—yelled out loud.`
`"<Hhhhhhappy Halloween!!`
` And trick or tree{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aat!!>"`
`"""<Trick‐or‐treeeeat>!!"""`
`The cousins shouted it back.`
`{n}The adults returned the greeting too, looking a little embarrassed.`
`Ange alone stood there with her mouth open,`
` unable to comprehend what had just happened.`
`"Welcome, my grandchildren!!`
` If you don't give me a treat, I shall prank you!!"`
`"Go ahead, Maria."`
`"Happy Halloween, Grandfather!!`
` I got you a really incredible one this year! You'll be surprised!!"`
`Maria picked up a present that had been hidden behind a sofa.`
`All of the other relatives were suddenly holding similar packages as well.`
`"Come on, Ange, you too.`
` Give this to Grandfather."`
`Kyrie handed Ange a neatly wrapped present.`
`"Ooooooh, Mariaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aaa, you're always so thoughtfu{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}ul!!`
` Grandpa's so happyy{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}y{-}yyy!!"`
`As Kinzo took Maria's present, a smile broke out across his face, and he rubbed his cheek up against it.`
`".........Master.`
` Your dignity."`
`"Nngg...o‐oh, that's right.`
` ......You have pleased your grandfather greatly, Maria.`
` In return for the treat you have given me, I promise not to prank you this year."`
`"Now it's your turn, Grandfather!!`
` If you don't give me a treat, I'll prank you!!"`
`"Yes, splendid.`
` Genji...!"`
`"Here."`
`Genji fished through something that looked like Santa Claus's sack and pulled out a present addressed to Maria,`
` handing it over to Kinzo.`
`"Heeere you go, Maria~!!`
` Here's a present from your grandpa!!`
` I'm warning yoooou, it's verr{-}r{-}r{-}r{-}rry cuu{-}u{-}u{-}ute!!`
` It's almost a waste to give it up to you{p:0:♪}"`
`".........Master. Dignity."`
`"Nnngggyyyyhhhh...`
` Th‐this is a present from the Ushiromiya family head to Maria...`
` It is a...cute......nnnggg, *cough*cough*...`
`a‐an item worthy of the Ushiromiya family's dignity and grace.`
` T‐take good care of it......"`
`"Thank you, Grandfather!!`
` I love you!!`
` Kiss‐kiss‐kiss!"`
`"N‐nngggwoooooooohhhhh...!!`
` Ooohhh, Mariaa{-}a{-}a{-}aaa, my cute little granddaughter!!`
` Kissie kissie kissieee~~~~~!!!"`
`"........................"`
`By this point, even Genji had to give up on Kinzo's dignity.`
`Still, the dignity of the family head had lasted a full ten seconds longer than usual this year.`
`"Happy Halloween, Grandfather.`
` This is from me."`
`"Happy Halloween. This one's mine.`
` I hope you like it."`
`"Oooooh, George, Jessica,`
` I thank you for yet another year.`
` I'm, ......I'm so happy..."`
`With tears streaming down his face, Kinzo hugged George and Jessica.`
`"Oh, and Battler too.`
` ......I'm so glad you've returned to the family.`
` ......It's been lonely without you, these past six years..."`
`"......Well, ......um, anyway...`
` .........Happy Halloween.`
` Not sure if you'll like it though..."`
`"Don't worry...... Don't worry, Battler......`
` I know you have things you want to say, things you want to ask.`
` ......But now is not the time."`
`"Grandfather......"`
`"I am......glad that you have returned to the Ushiromiya family......`
` ......It makes me feel......happy......"`
`Slowly, ......Kinzo moved forward and hugged Battler.`
`Battler drew back at first, but he then understood Kinzo's feelings and hugged him back.`
`Ange watched this scene play out......shocked.`
`Was Ushiromiya Kinzo............always this kind of person......?`
`"Ange.`
` You're up."`
`"Go on, give it to Grandfather."`
`"............Ah, .........okay."`
`Ange......didn't have a clue what was going on.`
`She took the present her mother had given her......and walked forward timidly.`
`......Kinzo's face, which had been looking so cheery a second ago,`
` seemed to become much sterner the moment Ange stepped forward.`
`No, it hadn't "become" stern.`
`That expression.........was the one always worn by the Kinzo inside Ange's mind.`
`This {i:was} Ushiromiya Kinzo.`
`He was fickle, short‐tempered, always with a stern expression on his face.`
` ......The most terrifying person in the Ushiromiya family...`
`"..........................."`
`"................................."`
`It felt as though the world had gone suddenly quiet, and it had only done it when it was my turn to step forward.`
`......Why?`
` Why only for me?`
`But, even so, ......isn't this the way it should be?`
`{n}Isn't this the Ushiromiya Kinzo I expect? ...The Ushiromiya Kinzo I understand......?`
`I was like a puppet carrying tea.`
`{n}I walked forward, bewildered, with the present held out in front of me, ......and stopped in front of Kinzo.`
`Without letting his expression change in the slightest,`
` Kinzo slowly reached out and touched the present......`
`"MmmmmAAAAAaaannnggeeee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}eee!!!"`
`In an instant, Ange was caught in a firm embrace, present and all.`
`{n}Kinzo's white beard rubbed against her cheek.`
`"Grandpa......Grandpa is so happyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!!`
` I'm so glad to be blessed with such lovely grandchildren!!`
` I feel happyyyyyyy!!`
` So happy the tears just won't...just won't stooo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}oop!!"`
`".........Master, your nose is running.`
` ......That...and your dignity."`
`"Oh, Genji, forgive me!!`
` I...alwa{0}n{0}t{0}h{0}f{0}n{0}h{0}h{0}h{0}hnnn...`
` *honkkkk*!!"`
`As the old man blew his nose, he didn't look like he could possibly be anyone other than a kindly grandpa overcome with tears at his grandchildren's gifts.`
`"Thank you, Ange.`
` I heard that you chose to come even though you weren't feeling well at all...`
` I'm so glad...!`
` Here, this is for you."`
`He pressed a large gift box to Ange's chest.`
`......She finally realized that all of the presents given out by Kinzo were wrapped differently and in boxes of different sizes.`
`"I wonder what he got you, Ange.`
` I hear that Grandfather always personally chooses what he'll give each one of us.`
` Pretty incredible, with all these people."`
`".........Every year...`
` ......He picks them himself...`
` ............"`
`He does...`
`what every year?`
`{n}He picks...`
`...what himself?`
`This bizarre ceremony happens......every year.`
`The cousins were all happily chattering about what their Halloween presents would be this year.`
`Maria came up to Ange and suggested that they compare the weights of their presents,`
` but for some reason, Ange just stared blankly.`
`After that, the adults also handed their presents to Kinzo one by one,`
` receiving a gift in return, along with considerate words about their health and questions about how they'd been doing recently.`
`Then, after watching to see that all exchanges had been completed, Gohda appeared...`
` and announced that lunch was ready.`
`"So, it is ready...!`
` Come, ladies and gentlemen!`
` Let us enjoy the splendid lunch that Gohda has prepared for us.`
` Quickly, to the dining hall!"`
`"This way, everyone.`
` Follow me."`
`"We will carry your presents to your rooms in the guesthouse."`
`"Please, feel free to leave them here as you leave for lunch."`
`The relatives stood up, leaving their presents where they lay on tables and sofas, and followed Kinzo out of the parlor.`
`......Only Ange remained standing there, stunned,`
` ......as she clutched the gift box Kinzo had given her...`
`Never once had Gohda's lunches betrayed expectations.`
`When Hideyoshi said that the lunches were the only reason anyone ever came to these family conferences, everyone laughed and nodded.`
`Delicious food has a way of keeping conversation flowing.`
`You've gotten so tall.`
` How have you been lately?`
` Oh, you know, not bad.`
`It was a fun meal, with everyone asking each other about the latest and laughing together.`
`The Ushiromiya family sat at meals in a specific ranked seating order,`
` so the adult siblings, the cousins, and the spouses all sat in groups.`
`That made it even easier for conversation to flow smoothly.`
`Ange had withdrawn slightly from the cousins' chat and was looking around the dining hall.`
`......What are Kinzo and the adult siblings doing?`
`Their conversation seemed to be peaceful and fun.`
`Most of the time, the siblings were mothers or fathers of their own households.`
`However, when they gathered together by themselves in front of Kinzo, that burden was lifted from their shoulders,`
` and they became young and bright as though they'd gone back to being kids again.`
`Rudolf, who was usually an easygoing father but one with a sense of dignity,`
` became so bright and cheery in this group that it almost looked like there was another Battler.`
`Even Kinzo looked peaceful and relaxed.`
`He didn't say a word about money or the inheritance.`
`In fact, he didn't even insult his children or call them incompetent.`
`He just looked like a happy old man, genuinely pleased to have his whole family together for the only time this year.`
`The group of spouses was just as harmonious.`
`Their conversation jumped from topic to topic on motherly issues like their children's education, the running of the household, and family health.`
`Hideyoshi and even Nanjo happily joined in.`
`And what about the cousins?`
`......There was no way that such a fun dinner table with such a fun group of friends could fail to be raucous.`
`Maria was in her element, showing off her knowledge of Halloween trivia.`
`George and Jessica would nod in understanding, Battler would say something stupid, and Maria would laugh at him.`
`If I wanted, I could easily join in on the conversation,`
` and I could easily slip out of it too by shifting my attention to the dessert.`
`It was......happiness, both fun and natural.`
`......It felt like I was enjoying a pleasant doze in the rays of the springtime sun.`
`"According to the weather report, we can expect a big storm sometime tonight."`
`"It's supposed to be a typhoon.`
` Looks like we'll be stuck here for more than one night again."`
`"I do not mind in the least. You may stay here as long as you wish.`
` If it would mean seeing the faces of my precious grandchildren more often, I would pray for rain every day."`
`"Give us a break. We do have work to worry about."`
`"Why don't you leave the island, Father?`
` That way, you could see your grandchildren whenever you wanted."`
`"Hahhahaha, true.`
` Living on a remote island may have a sense of majesty, but haven't you had enough of it?"`
`"......It's too noisy in the city.`
` I much prefer a quiet island, with no one on it but my family.`
` I like it here."`
`"But on Rokkenjima, if something happens, it would take some time for a doctor to arrive."`
`"I agree.`
` At your age, I think you should at least consider moving to Niijima."`
`"......Yes, I am old.`
` I want to live in peace, surrounded only by my family.`
` ......And I am satisfied.`
` I have this island to make that dream of mine come true."`
`"Father......"`
`"Hmm......`
` It seems I've gotten you all down.`
` Ladies and gentlemen, Gohda's lunch is now complete.`
` Grandchildren, it will probably be raining constantly starting tomorrow.`
` Now is the only time that you'll have clear skies.`
` Why not go to enjoy the roses and then take a walk on the beach?"`
`"That sounds good.`
` Okay, everyone.`
` Want to go?"`
`"Uu!`
` I wanna see the roses and walk on the beach!`
` We can collect shells, and collect glass too!"`
`"Collect glass?`
` That, uh, sounds a bit dangerous...!"`
`"Fragments of glass get washed by the waves and become round, beautiful gems, which drift to shore.`
` Did you forget, Battler?`
` Remember how we used to pick them up together?"`
`"Oh...... Were those pieces of glass?`
` I always thought they were just pretty gems."`
`"Have you ever seen a glass gem, Ange?!"`
`"......No."`
`"Then let's go!!`
` I'll show you!!`
` Let's go, let's go!`
` But the first to see them gets them!`
` I'm gonna get them all!"`
`"Heheh, in that case, I'm not gonna lose either.`
` Let's see who can find the prettiest, biggest glass gem!"`
`"Alright!`
` Times like this, why not be a kid?!`
` I'm not gonna lose either!"`
`"Then I guess we'll be heading down to the beach."`
`"Mm.`
` Take it easy and enjoy your time together, grandchildren."`
`The cousins rose from their seats and noisily left the dining hall.`
`Maria grabbed Ange's hand and dragged her along.`
`However, Ange's expression was vague and absentminded, the opposite of Maria's full smile......``The cousins walked along the water's edge, playing.`
`They searched for bits of glass, polished by the waves to become small and gem‐like.`
`{n}They caught up on news of each other's lives and joked around.`
`They wrote words in the sand.`
`{n}They chased the receding waves and ran away from the coming ones.`
`The cousins enjoyed this time they had to themselves.`
`"Get back here, Maria!`
` You won't get off easy this time!!`
` Wahahaha!"`
`"Kyahahahahahaha!!`
` No, no, no, no, kyahahahaha!"`
`"You'll get hurt if you fall.`
` Be careful, you two."`
`"Feels like the wind's gotten stronger.`
` Maybe we should head back soon."`
`"You're right.`
` I think the sky's getting cloudier too.`
` .........Battler‐kun, Maria‐chan!`
` I think we should call it a day soon and head back to the guesthouse for the time being."`
`"Uu? No way!`
` I wanna play more!!"`
`"Hey, don't ignore your cousin.`
` Okay, that's all for now.`
` Here, I'll give you my glass gem."`
`"Uu!! Really?!`
` Thank you, Battler!!`
` Now, I have the most, so I win!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`"Ange, are you okay?"`
`"............Yeah."`
`"What's wrong, Ange?`
` You look a little down."`
`"She's just tired out.`
` Come on, let's all head back together."`
`True, Ange's expression probably looked tired.`
`{n}However, Battler alone thought he saw something else in it.`
`"What happened?`
` Can you tell me?"`
`"............It's nothing."`
`She said that,`
` but something in her expression showed that she was unsatisfied for some reason.`
`However, since Ange wouldn't say what it was, and Battler couldn't think of anything,`
` that was the limit of what he could figure out.`
`So, he squeezed her small hand, silently letting her know that she could tell him whenever she was ready...`
`It had seemed such a bright, sunny day until a short while ago...`
`However, the sky had turned gray, and the wind had started to feel more annoying than pleasant.`
`If they waited around, they might have to deal with scattered raindrops as well.`
`"And I guess it'll be raining the whole time from now on.`
` What a drag."`
`"Still, even though it didn't last long, it was fun to be a kid again for a while."`
`"I can't wait to show Mama this glass gem!`
` I'm gonna tell her I won!"`
`"Ihihi.`
` Even though you only won 'cause I gave you mine."`
`"Uu!`
` I got it, so it's mine!`
` So I won!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`Ange walked distractedly, pulled along by her brother.`
`George and the others thought that she had probably woken up too early and was tired, so they didn't try to talk to her much.`
`As they reached the end of the forested path, the rose garden lay before them.`
`{n}They could see the strong winds making the rose bushes wave.`
`"Mama!! Look!!`
` I won!!"`
`Waving a hand about and yelling, Maria ran.`
`{n}Rosa was waving to her from the front of the guesthouse.`
`"I'm gonna head back to my room for a sec.`
` I'll meet you in the cousins' room right after."`
`"Okay, got it.`
` See you later, then."`
`Jessica ran off in the direction of the mansion.`
`George turned around, as though suggesting that they had better get going too.`
`However, when he saw Ange standing still with a crabby look on her face,`
` he realized that she might have been put into a bad mood by something.`
`"......Is everything okay?"`
`"Y‐yeah, she's fine.`
` Sorry, but would you mind going on ahead of us?"`
`"Sure, got it.`
` See you later."`
`George headed for the guesthouse.`
`The only ones left in the rose garden were Battler, who was waving at George, ......and Ange, who was still staring at the ground and holding Battler's hand.`
`For the past few minutes, he had repeatedly asked Ange what was wrong.`
`He realized that this wasn't anything like a stomachache, or something obvious that had put her into a bad mood.`
`However, young girls sometimes get upset for reasons that only they can understand.`
`Battler knew this, so he didn't rush her in any way,`
` and continued to gaze around the beautiful rose garden, holding her hand.`
`"............Onii‐chan."`
`"......What is it?"`
`"Where...`
`.........is this place?"`
`She asked the question...`
`as though she was talking about something on the other side of the silver screen.`
`Though Battler understood what that question meant, he played dumb.`
`"What do you mean, where?`
` It's Rokkenjima."`
`"No, it isn't."`
`"Yes, it is."`
`"How is this supposed to be Rokkenjima?"`
`"It's the Rokkenjima of October 4th, 1986.`
` ......The Rokkenjima you've wanted to see for so long."`
`"That's a lie."`
`"Why do you say that?"`
`"This is all.........a pack of lies."`
`Ange wrenched her hand from her brother's grip.`
`{n}That hand hit a rose and sent flower petals flying.`
`"I don't lie."`
`"How is this supposed to be the truth?!"`
`Ange spat those words out.`
` However, Battler's expression remained calm and composed.`
`"......What don't you like about it?"`
`"For one, Ushiromiya Kinzo!`
` There's no way he was like that and you know it!"`
`"He's just seen his grandchildren again for the first time in a long while.`
` .........I think any grandfather would smile in that situation."`
`"Not Ushiromiya Kinzo, he wasn't that kind of person!!`
` Ushiromiya Kinzo was......"`
`"Strict, discontented, short‐tempered, and quick to anger?"`
`"So you do understand!!`
` What was all that back there?!!`
` How was that supposed to be Ushiromiya Kinzo?!`
` Halloween?`
` Exchanging presents?!`
` What the hell is that?!!`
` That's nothing like Ushiromiya Kinzo... This is nothing like Rokkenjima...!!"`
`".........Don't you remember, Ange?"`
`"Remember what...?!"`
`"We did that every year, didn't we?"`
`"Every year...? That?!"`
`"Well, I guess it's no surprise.`
` The last time you went to a family conference, you weren't even six years old.`
` ......So, it's only natural that you wouldn't remember."`
`"It's...only natural that...`
`............"`
`Ange understood what her brother was trying to say.`
` ......However, she couldn't accept it.`
`"It's true that Ushiromiya Kinzo was a strict man.`
` When he was younger, he really did lash out at his kids, apparently.`
` ......It was pretty traumatic for the old bastard and his siblings... You could say they're still a bit scared of him even now,`
` ......and, well, you wouldn't be wrong."`
`The grand tale of how Kinzo had restored the Ushiromiya family was more than enough to paint him as a rigid, terrifying man.`
`Furthermore, Kinzo was an investor.`
` All the legends and tales that made him seem more mysterious had probably worked in his businesses' favor.`
`......At times, Kinzo may even have acted out this part people expected, endeavoring to make his presence all the more overpowering.`
`That's why the world at large spoke of Ushiromiya Kinzo as a strict, short‐tempered man.`
` And they even thought of him as a fickle, bold, incomprehensible eccentric...`
`"But that was just......the face Grandfather showed to the world.`
` That's not how he acted in private, alone with his family."`
`"......Are you saying that weeping old man who doted on his grandchildren...`
`...is the real Ushiromiya Kinzo?"`
`"He must have played with you and patted your head many times.`
` Do you really not remember......?"`
`".............................."`
`Things like that......might have happened once or twice.`
` But that would only have been a mere whim of Kinzo's......`
`My parents told me all the time.`
`......Grandfather is a terrifying person, so make sure you don't mess up.`
`......They always, always said......that he's very scary, so take care......`
`".........And that means...`
`......he was a scary person..."`
`"When you were little, you never questioned your parents or what they told you... I guess I could say you were an obedient kid,`
` ......but I could also say you had an overactive imagination.`
` ......Dad and the others were just trying to make you realize how important it was to be polite."`
`"......I, ......I saw it, though!`
` I knew about it!`
` I knew that Ushiromiya Kinzo was a scary person!`
` I've even seen him yelling in anger!!`
` I remember that, I'll never forget it!!"`
`"Well, like you saw just now, Grandfather could be a bit abrupt at times.`
` ......He might just have been trying to surprise you.`
` Or, it might just have slipped out when he was having a serious discussion with his kids."`
`"And you think I just got scared for no reason...`
`...and got the wrong idea?"`
`"..........................."`
`"That can't be! That can't be true!!`
` I mean, I still remember it!`
` I know I saw Ushiromiya Kinzo yelling and being scary!`
` Mom and Dad were terrified too, so I know I'm right!!"`
`".........The impression you had of Grandfather when you were young remained with you, and that impression grew inside you as you grew up."`
`How many times did Ange see Kinzo in her life?`
`{n}How old was she the last time she saw him?`
`Ange, who got sick easily when under pressure, couldn't have gone to Rokkenjima often.`
`And, since she was absent for the family conference when she was six, her last memories of him must have come from when she was just five years old.`
`"B‐......but even you...`
`haven't seen Ushiromiya Kinzo for six years."`
`"That's right.`
` But, when I finally came back after six years,`
` ......I saw that Grandfather hadn't changed in the slightest."`
`"Kinzo was......fickle, so you could never understand what he was thinking,`
` ......and he was an eccentric with a creepy love for the occult, and......"`
`"It's true that he had a love for the occult.`
` Yeah, it was a bit of a strange hobby for him to get into in his final years.`
` ......I'll admit that his hobby of collecting strange objects to spook his grandchildren with wasn't exactly praiseworthy."`
`Even Battler had been pranked by Kinzo in the past.`
`He showed me an attaché case with seven strange stakes in it...`
`...and said something about how witches in the Middle Ages used them in sacrificial rituals to gouge out the heart.`
`When Kinzo first showed me those, I was pretty frightened, but looking back on it, it really was the kind of prank that could only fool a child.`
`Grandfather only scared his grandchildren......because he wanted to joke around with them.`
`"I'd be willing to bet......that Grandfather pulled a prank like that on you too.`
` It's no surprise that, young as you were, you let that scare you and convince you that Grandfather was a strange, terrifying person."`
`".........I, ......I don't know what you're talking about, ......Onii‐chan......"`
`Ange bit her lower lip and stared at the ground.`
`She said she didn't understand,`
` ......but in truth, she understood perfectly, and was refusing to accept it.`
`"Remember how we traded Halloween presents in the parlor just now?"`
`"......What was that all about?`
` The Ushiromiya family never did anything that sentimental...!"`
`"You......don't remember anything, huh..."`
`"Are you saying I got presents once too?!`
` I don't remember anything like that!!`
` That could never happen!"`
`"......Do you really think that Grandfather, a man who loved the occult and Western traditions, wouldn't celebrate Halloween?`
` ......Grandfather's "Happy Halloween" was pretty much the standard greeting at our family conferences.`
` ......You must have been given one."`
`".........Youth can be so cruel.`
` Grandfather must have put all his heart into choosing that present for you, ......but it looks like your heart didn't remember."`
`"Are you saying that I was just too young to remember,`
` ......and that......and {i:that}......was the truth of October 4th?!"`
`That day, just like six years before,`
` Grandfather entered the parlor with a cry of "Happy Halloween".`
`Then, he and I traded presents, ......as he shed tears over our long‐awaited reunion after a six‐year gap.`
`......Grandfather was very sad that you weren't able to come.`
`So, he gave your present to Kyrie‐san, telling her to make sure that you got it...`
`"I never heard anything about a present like that!`
` I never got one!!"`
`"......True.`
` ......She never...had the chance..."`
`"I don't believe it!!`
` I won't believe that was Ushiromiya Kinzo!`
` Then what about the family conference itself?!`
` Wasn't that a tense argument over the distribution of the inheritance?!"`
`"All of the adult siblings were in money trouble!`
` They all hungered for Kinzo's inheritance money...!"`
`"............Ange, where did you hear that from?"`
`"What do you mean, where?!`
` It's the truth, isn't it?!"`
`"Do you think Dad would talk to you about financial difficulties with his company when you were that age...?`
` And not just Dad.`
` Even if Uncle Krauss, Auntie Eva, and Auntie Rosa talked about how they were in money trouble and wanted Kinzo's inheritance money,`
` ......do you really think they'd talk about it in front of you...?"`
`"B‐but...`
` ......But it's true, isn't it?!?!"`
`That was the bottom line.`
`{n}Ange's words were not mistaken.`
`Not only Rudolf, but Krauss, Hideyoshi, and Rosa as well...all had companies in money trouble.`
`......People started talking about the Rokkenjima Explosion Accident as though it was some sort of conspiracy,`
` ......and a "mystery" imagined by the public covered the island.`
`Weekly magazines and television shows researched the circumstances of Kinzo's children at the time, and in the future where Ange lived, that research had been made public.`
`".........You learned about all of that.........after 1986."`
`"But it's a fact, isn't it?`
` There's no difference between facts and truth!"`
`"And does that prove that the inheritance created a strained atmosphere between the relatives on Rokkenjima?`
` ............I guess that seemed to fit with your memory of your parents telling you repeatedly to be extra polite at the family conference..."`
`"A‐......are you saying that what I know about Rokkenjima, ......what I know about the Ushiromiya family,`
` .........is wrong......?!"`
`"...................................."`
`"You're the one who's wrong, Onii‐chan!!`
` What I just saw can't be real, there's no way!!`
` I refuse to accept that as Ushiromiya Kinzo!`
` I'll never, ever be able to accept that Ushiromiya Kinzo was like that!!"`
`"So, you don't believe, Ange?"`
`"That's right, I don't believe!!`
` I just don't understand why you're showing me something like this!"`
`"After all, this is your game...no, your game board, isn't it?!"`
`"........................"`
`"Beato and Bern!`
` One witch after another has sneered at my fate, trying to make me surrender in their games.`
` But I seek the truth!`
` Those witches' deceptions won't work on me!`
` ......Now I get it, you damn witches.`
` So, you've sent Onii‐chan as a final assassin to finish me off."`
`"......You're right about one thing.`
` ......This is...my game.`
` So, of course, this is my tale, and I'm the one telling it.`
` That's why I'm able to add in "what if" situations, like what would happen if you came to the island too."`
`"See!`
` You made this tale!!`
` It's all a pack of lies, ......a fiction you created!!"`
`".....................You're right.`
` ......This is all...a fiction I created."`
`"See?!!`
` You've admitted it! You have, haven't you?!!`
` Just like I thought, this is all a lie you made...!`
` Why are you lying to me?!`
` Why won't you tell me the truth?!"`
`"......Because there's something......more important...`
`...that I need to get across to you."`
`"Something more important than the truth......?!`
` What the hell are you talking about?!"`
`"The purpose of my game is to help you understand that."`
`Just as Beato's games were made to make Battler believe in witches.`
`Battler's game......was made to communicate something to Ange that was more important than the truth.`
`Games never bring about their intended ends by force.`
`After all, Beato's game could never be won for all eternity, unless Battler himself acknowledged his loss.`
`Battler's game was the same.`
`This was a game that Battler couldn't win......unless Ange acknowledged it herself.`
`So, Battler had advanced this game just as Beato had done in the past.`
`To believe, or not. To accept, or not.`
`{n}The decision lay solely in the hands of the opponent.`
`And so,`
` ......Battler was trying to enshroud Ange with his own illusion......`
`"I finally get it.`
` ......This is a game between me and you, Onii‐chan."`
`"Ange.`
` I'm not trying to challenge you to a game."`
`"No.`
` This is a game.`
` ......I made a wish, hoping to learn the truth of October 4th, 1986.`
` And so, you invited me to this game, saying that you'd show me the truth.`
` And now, you're showing me this strange illusion, trying to make me believe that it's the truth!`
` ......Well, too bad.`
` I'm already used to dealing with witches.`
` I'm fully aware that you're trying to use that kind face of yours to trick me...!!"`
`".............................."`
`The big brother knew that no words of his would have any effect on his enraged little sister.`
`So, he just quietly listened to Ange's words.`
`{n}But for Ange, ......even that was frustrating.`
`"I've had more than enough of this stupid farce.`
` If you don't plan on telling me the truth, then end it all now!`
` I'll find my own truth for myself!`
` I won't rely on you...!"`
`".........That's right.`
` There never was anyone I could rely on anyway...`
` ......I've......always been......all alone......"`
`"Sorry,`
` but I won't let you leave this game."`
`"......Ah, that's right.`
` Unless the Game Master admits defeat, the game never ends, right?"`
`"That's not what this is.`
` ......I just want you to stay quiet and listen to what I have to say."`
`"......Oh, okay.`
` I'll just stay quiet then.`
` ......Even if a player isn't around, the pieces just move by themselves, and the game moves forward.`
` ......Isn't that how it was?"`
`"...........................`
` ......Alright.`
` Step back from being a player, and become an observer for a little while.`
` You can come back whenever you feel like it."`
`"I'll do just that.`
` This is an endurance contest.`
` ..........It'll keep on going until you give up on trying to cover up the truth."`
`"..........................."`
`"Something more important than the truth?`
` ......You're not making any sense...!`
` There's no such thing...!"`
`"There is, Ange.`
` ......Whether my tale is the truth or not,`
` ......the fact remains that you lost something precious on this island."`
`"Dad, Mom.`
` And you, Onii‐chan.`
` ......I lost my family...and everything that mattered to me."`
`She spat out those words as though no further questioning would do any good...and looked away.`
`Even as he watched this, Battler's expression remained gentle.`
`"Just keep going however you like.`
` Later, Onii‐chan."`
`".........At least make sure you watch the tale.`
` Even just listening is enough."`
`"If I feel like it.`
` ......Later."`
`Ange's eyes clouded.`
`Then, a particularly strong gust of wind blew by, sending her hair flying.`
`The wind must have been carrying some dust with it.`
` Ange's nose twitched, and she sneezed loudly.`
`".........Nnnnn.`
` ......Onii‐chan...?"`
`"What is it?"`
`"......How long are we gonna stand here...? The weather's all weird.`
` ......Let's go back to the guesthouse."`
`Ange's eyes weren't cloudy anymore.`
`However, the tone and atmosphere about those eyes seemed somehow different from before...`
`In a manner typical of young girls, Ange signaled that she was too bored and wanted to go do something.`
`This Ange was clearly a six‐year‐old Ange.`
`"Good point.`
` ......Then, why don't you head back to the guesthouse now?`
` I'm going to stay here."`
`"Why...? It'll start raining soon."`
`"She should be here in a moment.`
` So, I'll wait for her."`
`"Wait for her? .........For who?`
` ...............Huh?"`
`Then, to Ange's eyes, it looked as though the strong winds were now carrying flakes of gold along with them.`
`No, she had definitely seen something, ......but she wasn't able to describe what she had seen,`
` so to her it had seemed like flakes of gold dancing on the wind.`
`"There you are.`
` ......I've been waiting a while now."`
`It was as though he was talking to the wind.`
` ......Battler spoke to the empty rose garden.`
`That can't be right.`
` After all, it was clear from his words that he was talking to someone right in front of him.`
`So, Ange thought it must be someone that she alone couldn't see, and she rubbed her eyes.`
`Then, when she opened her eyes wide, another large gust of wind blew past her.`
`She shut her eyes immediately, .........and when she timidly opened them...`
`From the other end of the rose garden—`
`yes, from the path that led up from the harbor,`
` ......a person appeared.`
`To Ange, it looked as though she had appeared along with a cloud of gold flakes carried by the wind......`
`"You're late, Beato."`
`"Am I? I'd call it early."`
`"You should ride the boat with us every now and then."`
`"You mean grasp the handrail and scream alongside you?"`
`"Yeah, sure, let's scream. Gonna fall, gonna fall..."`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` I see, how interesting...!`
` Yes, I suppose I did arrive too late."`
`The pair casually walked up to each other and hugged.`
`{n}It looked like a pair of friends being reunited after several years.`
`"..........................."`
`Ange, surprised by this unfamiliar woman, looked for somewhere to hide.`
`However, her eyes met Beato's, and she lost her chance to escape...`
`"Oh, and you must be Ange."`
`"..................!"`
`She was shocked to hear this unfamiliar woman suddenly use her name.`
`"Look how cute she was at the age of six."`
`"......O‐......onii‐chan.`
` ......Who......is this person......?"`
`"A friend of mine."`
`"A friiiieeeend?!`
` How can you say that?!"`
`"......Onii‐chan's......friend.........?"`
`"This is {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` You've heard from Grandfather, haven't you?`
` About the Golden Witch, who gave the Ushiromiya family its gold?"`
`Have I......heard that before?`
`The Golden Witch.`
` ......Now I remember.`
`That was the scary witch who would snatch you away off into the forest...`
`if you didn't listen to your parents or stayed up too late on Rokkenjiima.`
`"On rainy nights,`
` ......if you look out the window at the dark forest,`
` ......you might see the witch looking back at you and get snatched away...... That's what Mom told me."`
`"Which must mean...`
`I'm supposed to be wandering about in the cold rain, looking into each window to find kids staying up too late?`
` How pitiful that would be...!"`
`"Wahhahahaha, good point.`
` Ange, your parents just made that story up to get you to go to bed on time.`
` She doesn't do stuff like that."`
`"Very well, allow me to introduce myself!`
` I am {f:5:Beatrice}, the Golden Witch!"`
`"Or her grandchild, at least."`
`"Grandchild......?"`
`"Th‐......that grandchild part puts a bit of a damper on things."`
`"Well, it's true, isn't it?`
` The person that Grandfather got the gold from and called the Golden Witch was your grandmother, right?"`
`"Nn...nnggg...... That is true, I admit...`
` ......Grandchild of the Golden Witch, is it?`
` ......Nnngh, can't I get a better title than that?"`
`"......Is this person...a witch......?"`
`"Yep, she is.`
` She's a guest who's been invited to the family conference today."`
`"......She isn't a scary witch?`
` She's not gonna take me away into the forest...?"`
`"Damn Rudolf and Kyrie.`
` Just what do they think they're telling this kid about me!`
` I don't do things like that...!`
` I'll lodge a firm protest later! *pout*!"`
`......She looked like a very emotional person,`
` ......but she wasn't at all what Ange had expected the creepy Golden Witch would be like.`
`She was very loud, overreacting to everything.`
` ......Nothing at all like the witch Maria onee‐chan had talked about, who had lived for a thousand years and had various servants from the demon world.`
`She looked, well, like an energetic young woman whom Ange's mom might have been good friends with.`
`Her brother and the witch talked together happily like a pair of close friends.`
`Dogs often don't trust people when meeting them for the first time.`
` However, people say that dogs feel more at ease with a person once they see their owner acting friendly towards them.`
`Surely, something similar to this was taking place in Ange's heart.`
`As this pushy, temperamental woman who called herself a witch chatted happily with Battler,`
` Ange watched her behavior closely...`
`"............What's that key for?"`
`Beato noticed the gold key hanging from Ange's neck.`
`{n}Ange automatically grasped it defensively.`
`"That's Ange's precious key."`
`After hearing these vague words, the witch stared blankly for a second.`
`But, almost immediately, she seemed to understand what he meant.`
`".........I see.`
` Is that how it is?"`
`"I thought it'd be easier to understand if I made it clear what she's supposed to do."`
`"..........................."`
`"Don't worry, Ange.`
` I shall not steal your precious key."`
`".........Really......?"`
`"Of course.`
` That key belongs to you, and the choice is yours.`
` Battler and the rest of us are merely signposts to guide you on your path."`
`"...............?"`
`When handing her this key, her brother had said that it was very important and she had to take good care of it.`
`Ange didn't have a clue what the key was for,`
` ......but it looked like Beato did.`
`However, just like her brother had done earlier, Beato only spoke in riddles.`
`This irritated Ange,`
` but for the time being, the Golden Witch had said that she didn't intend to steal this key, so Ange calmed down a little.`
`"......Do you know what this key is...`
`...used for...?"`
`"But of course.`
` However, I cannot tell you."`
`"Why......?"`
`"Because you must decide how to use that key for yourself."`
`The witch said the same thing as my brother.`
`The pair nodded to each other, but it was all Greek to me.`
`It felt like someone had laid out a riddle that everyone knew but me, and everyone was making fun of me.`
`"You'll know soon enough.`
` You don't need to dwell on it."`
`"....................."`
`Ange held the key tightly.`
`Even if she didn't understand what it meant, ......it was her own key, and her big brother had told her to take good care of it.`
`With her youthful suspicion, she was scared that the witch might ask her to hand it over, saying that she'd teach her how to use it if she did.`
`Of course, her thoughts showed up clearly on her face.`
`{n}The witch couldn't help but laugh at that honest expression.`
`"Fear not.`
` It is impossible for anyone to steal that key from you."`
`"......No one can steal it...?"`
`"You might say that it has been imbued with magic to make it so.`
` At any rate, fear not.`
` Neither I, nor Battler, nor anyone else on this island can steal that key from you."`
`"Really......?"`
`"Yeah, really.`
` The magic won't let them."`
`The key was hanging around her neck like an ordinary necklace.`
`Ange could take it off right now if she wanted, and if an adult tried to use force, it seemed like it would be easy for them to take it away.`
`However, both her brother and the witch said that it was protected by a magic that would stop anyone from stealing it...`
`".........Does magic...`
`.........really...exist...?"`
`Even the six‐year‐old Ange knew about the word "magic".`
`However, she also realized that real magic didn't exist,`
` ......and that certain kinds of magic tricks were sometimes called magic.`
`However, her brother and the witch were talking about magic itself.`
`"Yeah.`
` Magic exists."`
`"......Really...?"`
`"Maria speaks of me often, does she not?`
` Witches exist,`
` magic exists—she must have told you these things on many an occasion."`
`True, Maria had talked about that many times.`
`{n}When it was part of a game, Ange had believed her, more or less.`
`However, Ange was, in some ways, sharp for her age,`
` ......and when she heard Maria talking happily about magic, she sometimes thought that such a thing couldn't really exist.`
`"Then, ...show me."`
`"Hmm?"`
`"Show me magic!`
` Or I won't believe you...!"`
`"Hold up a sec...`
` Beato just arrived on the island, and she hasn't even gone to say hi to everyone at the mansion yet..."`
`Battler spoke as though he was trying to smooth something over.`
`When she heard that, Ange became sure that magic didn't exist after all.`
`"Witches are all a big fat lie...!`
` I know!"`
`"Hey, stop that.`
` You'll hurt Beato's feelings......"`
`"No, it's no problem.`
` Anyone would say that upon meeting a witch.`
` Normally, I would ignore provocation from such a small child, but she is your little sister, after all.`
` Why don't we give her a special showing?"`
`"Are you sure...?"`
`"Of course I am.`
` Watch carefully, Ange."`
`"O‐......okay."`
`Though Ange had challenged the witch to show her if she could,`
` now that she was about to be shown, she looked a bit hesitant.`
`She gulped, then stared up at the witch's face.`
`The witch held out her left hand, bringing it close to Ange's face.`
`{n}Then, she slowly spread her fingers.`
`Ange, thinking that she was about to be turned into a frog, shrank back.`
`However, after waiting a while with her teeth clenched, she realized that nothing was happening.`
`So, as her fear turned to irritation, she began to argue.`
`"Nothing's happening."`
`"Don't jump to conclusions so quickly.`
` I haven't used magic yet.`
` See, look carefully at my palm.`
` I'm not hiding anything, correct?"`
`Oh, so that's what she was doing......`
` Now that she finally understood, Ange checked both sides of the witch's hand.`
`"......Yeah.`
` There's nothing there."`
`"Watch closely.`
` I'll make a fist,`
` ......and then stretch out my index finger."`
`She stretched out her index finger and held it right in front of Ange's eyes.`
`Ange, refusing to show weakness by pulling back, stood her ground and concentrated on the fingertip.`
`"Watch the tip of my finger closely.`
` Ready? It'll be fast."`
`The witch rapidly lifted her index finger high into the air, pointing at the heavens.`
`Just as Ange looked up to see the finger raised high, it swung down as though trying to dodge her gaze.`
`In that manner,`
` ...the finger swung up, down, left, right, then left again,`
` as though Ange was playing a game of {c:86EF9C:Acchi Muite Hoi}.`
`Feeling as though she'd lose if she couldn't keep up with the fingertip, Ange swung her face this way and that, looking serious.`
`Ever since she was very young, Ange had always hated to lose.`
` She would take even the most trivial games seriously, determined not to lose to the adults.`
`The witch's hand moved faster and faster.`
` Ange didn't lose track of it.`
`Then, the witch's high pointing finger took a sudden swing downwards,`
` ......and when it stopped, her index finger was curled up, and her hand was held in a simple fist.`
`Could it be...that something was going to come out of that hand...?`
`Ange, suspecting that this might happen, had followed the finger very closely.`
` There had been no chance for that once empty hand to grab something.`
`"..........................."`
`"Ready? I'm going to open my hand..."`
`The witch slowly opened her right fist......`
`{n}And there......`
`"............Wha? .........What?!`
` .........How?!`
` How, Onii‐chan?!"`
`The witch gave the cutely wrapped candy to Ange as a present.`
`Ange took it and desperately searched for some kind of trick on it, but it was just an everyday, ordinary candy......`
`"How?!`
` That was a trick, wasn't it, Onii‐chan?!`
` Onii‐chan?!!"`
`"Nope. That was magic.`
` You were watching the whole time, weren't you?"`
`"Nn, .........nnnnnnnn............!"`
`I was watching the whole time, ......so how......?`
`{n}She didn't like it, but she was unable to see how that could have been anything other than magic.`
`As the little sister furrowed her brow and bit her lower lip, her brother gently told her once more that it was magic.`
`"It's about time for me to head to the mansion to pay my respects.`
` You should come along, Battler.`
` I'll suffocate if I have to go alone."`
`"You sure? Then I'll join you.`
` ......What about you, Ange?`
` Will you go back to the guesthouse?"`
`"............I, I wanna stay with you, Onii‐chan."`
`She still couldn't accept it.`
` But maybe, ......just maybe......`
`She still looked grumpy,`
` .........but it looked like she was becoming at least slightly interested in this witch.`
`"Then let us go.`
` The Golden Witch returns...!"`
`"The Golden Witch's...grandchild returns, you mean."`
`"We really need to do something about that name...!"`
`The big brother and the witch really did seem close.`
`{n}Playing off each other like a pair of comedians, they started heading for the mansion.`
`All the while, Ange held onto the corner of her brother's sleeve, trying to make sure he didn't forget about her...``The VIP room was filled with the sweet smell of pumpkin tea...`
`and packed with smiles and laughter.`
`"Ahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha!!`
` Simply splendid.`
` I am glad to see you in such high spirits...!"`
`"I could say the same for you.`
` What idiot said you're reaching your last years?"`
`"I just borrow a bit of cheer from you.`
` Once I return to my study, I will be little more than a withering, senile old man."`
`"Enough with your lies!`
` Give it up and swear that you'll be living it large until you're a hundred."`
`"Same here. I haven't seen you for six years, but I was surprised to see how little you'd changed."`
`"Wahahahaha, you little brat.`
` So, it seems you've learned flattery these past six years!`
` Sorry to disappoint you, but you're hardly a fair judge in the matter.`
` I have grown quite old indeed."`
`"I'll bet a thousand yen that Kinzo's still doing great when he turns a hundred."`
`"Yeah, me too.`
` Grandfather won't be any different when he's a hundred."`
`"Wahhahahaha!`
` Don't think you'll get any more presents for complimenting me!"`
`Kinzo laughed cheerily.`
`{n}Beato, who sat next to Battler, was also laughing merrily.`
`Ange stood all alone by the window,`
` ......staring at the others and trying to figure out what sort of relationship the witch of the portrait had with her grandfather.`
`There was a knock on the door.`
`"Is that you, Genji?`
` Come in!"`
`"......Pardon the intrusion.`
` Krauss‐sama and Natsuhi‐sama are here."`
`"Father—oh, and Battler‐kun's here too."`
`"It has been some time, {f:5:Beatrice}‐san.`
` Has there been any news?"`
`"I'm just the way I used to be.`
` Come, have a seat.`
` And Ange, why are you standing by the window like that?`
` Come over here and sit down."`
`"Ange. Come on over."`
`".........I'll just watch from here."`
`Ange grasped the candy she had gotten from Beato tightly,`
` and with a still wary gaze, she continued to stare.`
`Genji offered her a chair, but Ange just shook her head.`
`"Let her do as she pleases.`
` Come, Krauss, Natsuhi, and sit."`
`"......Is it something important?`
` I guess Ange and I should leave."`
`"Hey, if you leave, who's going to back me up here...?!`
` Kinzo, you don't mind if Battler stays, do you?"`
`"I have nothing to hide.`
` I do not mind."`
`However, he had called Krauss and Natsuhi to the VIP room to meet {f:5:Beatrice}, the Golden Witch.`
`It was hard to imagine that Kinzo wanted to have a casual conversation......`
`After Kinzo said he didn't mind, Beato also asked Battler to stay, so he decided to do so.`
`In order to avoid getting in the way of their conversation, Battler stood up from the sofa and walked over to Ange's window.`
`When the big brother finally came back to Ange, she clung to his waist, as though determined not to let him go away again.`
`"Oh, I see.`
` That must be why Ange doesn't like me."`
`"Huh? What do you mean?`
` I don't really think she dislikes you."`
`"*cackle*cackle*.`
` You never could understand women, Battler."`
`Beato smiled at Ange, but the latter turned to look the other way...`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` Even a young woman is a woman nonetheless."`
`When Beato stopped laughing, the conversation switched gears.`
`Why on Earth did Kinzo summon Krauss and Natsuhi to the VIP room, and what was he going to talk about?`
` Everyone fell automatically silent.`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}, Golden Witch.`
` Each and every day, I remember the debt owed by the Ushiromiya family for the time it was saved on the brink of destruction."`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` Yeah, you'd better thank me."`
`"Well, it's actually your grandmother he's thanking."`
`"Shut up, you."`
`"No, it comes to the same thing.`
` All of that gold has been lent to the Ushiromiya family for three generations.`
` And for no compensation."`
`"......We truly...cannot be grateful enough."`
`"Gold is no more than a pile of bricks to me.`
` It was a relief to have Kinzo hold onto it, since I had nowhere to put them."`
`"Whoa.`
` I'd like to say that just once before I die."`
`".........Is the Golden Witch...a rich person...?"`
`"Hmm?`
` Well, yeah.`
` After all, she just went and lent Grandfather ten tons of gold."`
`"Precisely.`
` I've been borrowing it for several decades, always promising to return it someday.`
` The debt of gratitude I owe for that favor is now far beyond my ability to repay."`
`"The head family has never forgotten its gratitude.`
` Isn't that right, dear?"`
`"Of course.`
` If the {f:5:Beatrice}s hadn't so generously lent it to us for three generations,`
` the Ushiromiya family would have fallen long ago.`
` Even someone as shrewd as Father couldn't do anything without funds to start with."`
`"By now, my money is making money, and the gold that made up my original funds can sleep in peace.`
` .........Krauss.`
` Do you know what I am about to say?"`
`Since the moment Krauss had been summoned here, he had guessed about the things Kinzo's words now hinted at.`
`All things borrowed must someday be returned.`
` That day had finally come.`
`"......Yes, I understand.`
` Father."`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}.`
` I do not have many years ahead of me.`
` In fact,`
` ......this may be the last family conference that we will attend together."`
`"How fainthearted you sound.`
` You must be joking."`
`Beato alone laughed.`
`She looked at Battler, so he laughed along with her, but Kinzo and the others remained silent.`
`Apparently, there existed some major concerns about Kinzo's health......`
`"Of course, I do not intend to die as soon as next year.`
` However, I don't believe I can make any certain promises about meeting you again next year.`
` Not once have I ever made a promise that I cannot keep."`
`"If you say it so proudly like that, I'm in no position to disagree.`
` ......Are you serious about this?"`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}.`
` I want to make amends.`
` And I must do it while I still have the energy.`
` For that reason, I made the decision to do it today."`
`".........What's Grandfather talking about...?"`
`"Quiet.`
` .........Grandfather is......about to talk about something very important."`
`By now, even Battler understood what Kinzo was about to propose.`
`Beato probably realized it too...`
`At one time, the Ushiromiya family had ruled the skies like an eagle...before being crushed in the Great Kanto Earthquake.`
`The eagle had one of its wings torn off, and it crawled in the mud, on the point of death.`
`Then, they were saved by the Golden Witch's golden miracle.`
`{n}Under the Golden Witch's protection, the eagle had nursed its wounds for many years.`
`And now, finally, it was time for the eagle to leave the nest the witch had provided......`
`"All of the gold that your grandmother lent me,`
` I will return to you.`
` .........Krauss, you have no objections, correct?`
` That gold did not belong to the Ushiromiya family in the first place."`
`"Of course.`
` I have no objections whatsoever."`
`"Are you sure, Krauss?`
` You're an investor, aren't you?`
` You could always do with more money, right?`
` Didn't you want Kinzo to hand the gold over to you?"`
`"Hahahaha...`
` Yes, now that you mention it, it's hard to deny what you say.`
` However, the contract was always between you and Father, and the gold was yours to begin with."`
`"After all, my husband is the successor.`
` Just as Father rebuilt the family in one generation,`
` I am sure my husband will make the family thrive in his.`
` And this is something the two of us will do together."`
`"Hmm, well said.`
` That's the spirit."`
`"......So, you have no regrets in leaving behind ten tons of gold.`
` I must say, that is quite impressive.`
` What can a witch do against an opponent who cannot be swayed by the golden magic?"`
`"I will return the gold to you.`
` However, that will not change the fact that the Ushiromiya family will always be supremely indebted to {f:5:Beatrice}, the Golden Witch."`
`"......................................."`
`To return the gold once lent by the Golden Witch.`
` It was both simple and clear.`
`However, the expression worn by the Golden Witch herself was slightly lonely.`
`Ange couldn't understand why this was.`
`".........I can hardly refuse what is being returned to me.`
` Ah, well."`
`Beato rose from the sofa.`
`Then, she walked up to the window and looked down at the rose garden waving in the wind.`
`"Krauss.`
` I have also decided to present you and the others with my inheritance while I still live."`
`"F‐Father......"`
`"When I die, you will not only be busy with the funeral, but I imagine that you will have Eva and the others at your throats over the inheritance issue.`
` If all is divided now, the funeral will be less trying for you.`
`......Krauss, write this down.`
` And Genji, please be our secretary.`
` I will now lay out the distribution of my assets."`
`Kinzo immediately began explaining how the inheritance would be split up.`
`Battler, realizing that he shouldn't be listening in on this conversation,`
` walked over to where Beato was loitering by the window...`
`"Hey, rich person.`
` If you've got too much gold on your hands, I'd be happy to lighten the load."`
`"Gold...would be no less useful if you turned it to firewood and used it to cook a stew."`
`"What's the matter?`
` You're looking a bit miserable."`
`"So, this day has finally come.`
` .........I do feel a bit lonely."`
`".........You do?"`
`"My magic revived the Ushiromiya family and created Rokkenjima.`
` ......And now, it seems the Ushiromiya family no longer has any need for the power of my gold.`
` It has taken flight, leaving the nest of my magic behind."`
`"Yeah.`
` ......That's pretty much it."`
`"I have called Rokkenjima the witch's island—`
`my island."`
`".........Yeah."`
`"And now, Rokkenjima is returning the gold to me.`
` .........The day has come...for Rokkenjima to awaken from my magic."`
`"...........................`
` ......I guess it has."`
`"I...knew that this would be the last game.`
` ......However, for that subject to be broached, even in a manner such as this, .........is surprisingly hard to handle."`
`"You're the type of person who looks totally carefree, but who's actually full of lingering attachments and regrets."`
`"The cruel and obstinate ones are usually the quickest to grow attached...and then to feel lonely."`
`"That's right.`
` That's the kind of person you are."`
`"............It was...a game for you and me."`
`"It was fun.`
` It's a game you polished to perfection during those six years..."`
`"I once likened it to an eternal torture for the both of us."`
`"......Eternity...is happiest when you can still believe that it's eternity.`
` But all things must end.`
` And we have to be aware of that."`
`"So, we must not avert our eyes."`
`"Just as the sun always rises,`
` there's no sun that doesn't set."`
`"................................."`
`Of course, Ange didn't have the slightest idea what her brother and the witch were talking about.`
`......However, even as young as she was, she could feel that the pair had spent an incredibly long time together...`
`and that they understood each other so well that they might as well be a married couple...`
`Then,`
` Beato noticed her reaction.`
`".........Ange.`
` At one point, the two of us wove games for each other.`
` However, that time is already over.`
` This game has been made, not for our sake, but for yours."`
`They were talking in riddles again.`
`{n}Grasping the key that hung by her chest, Ange looked at her brother's face...`
`"We need to show you the contents of the cat box that is this day.`
` ......That key I gave you is for opening it."`
`"............What do you mean......cat box...?"`
`"He means this day."`
`"You wanted to reach this day so much.`
` Using the miracle of magic, I've brought you here.`
` .........You must continue telling the story of this day, as the final witch."`
`"Does that mean............that I mustn't remain here...?"`
`Ange's tone was slightly tense.`
`{n}She understood what her brother meant, and it made her frown.`
`"Just how long have I suffered, wishing that I could return to the Rokkenjima of 1986...`
` And now, I finally made it here!`
` So why are you chasing me out...?!`
` You said I could decide for myself!"`
`"That's right.`
` I did say that."`
`"I'm not leaving.`
` And please, stop trying to spoil me with this strange, made‐up tale...!`
` I want to know the truth of this day!!"`
`"She is a moody kid, be it twelve years in the future or twelve years in the past."`
`"Shut up. I didn't ask you...!`
` And what the hell do you think you're doing...?!`
` Didn't the Golden Witch come here to perform her resurrection ritual?!"`
`"Didn't you appear on the island with a crash of thunder and try to offer up thirteen people as sacrifices?!`
` Why are you acting so happy and casual?!`
` It doesn't make sense!"`
`"You're the one that doesn't make sense.`
` What are you thinking?`
` Do you want me to be a murderer?"`
`"You wrote tales about it, sealed them in message bottles, and threw them into the sea!`
` Two of them were discovered later on...!`
` Both of them were stories of cruel serial murders!"`
`"What a shame that only two of them made it to shore...!`
` How sad that "Land", my greatest masterpiece, was never seen by human eyes."`
`"I've been wanting to ask this for a while, but what's up with those message bottles?"`
`"As I was working out the details for my game against you, I began creating those tales along the way.`
` Once I realized that I could create endless different tales out of the same game board, it really started to get fun...!"`
`"So, you wrote them down, hoping that I would read them someday."`
`"Precisely!`
` They were so good, I just couldn't bear to wait for your return...!`
` Inspired by those classic works set on isolated islands, I tried sealing them in bottles and throwing them into the ocean.`
` Mysterious, don't you think?!"`
`"Don't mock me...!!!`
` Those were your plans for the crime!`
` You used the location of the hidden gold to fan up discontent between the family members...`
`as you planned your brutal serial murders...!!"`
`"Sheesh,`
` is that how I've become in the year 1998?`
` ......Well, I guess I can't blame them, *cackle*cackle*."`
`"Huh?!`
` What's with the sudden change of character...?!!`
` Is this some scheme to make me let my guard down?!`
` I'm not gonna be fooled, {f:5:Beatrice}! Onii‐chan!!"`
`"You want to make me surrender and say that witches exist, don't you?!`
` You think I'll fall for that...?!`
` I'll find the truth without your help!"`
`"Even though that truth is all around you right now?`
` You once called yourself Gretel, but it seems the name Mytyl would be more fitting."`
`"Enough!!!"`
`Ange tried to slap Beato's cheek.`
`However, the difference between their heights was so great that Beato dodged before the hand could reach her.`
`"Stupid......`
` Stupid......!`
` I won't acknowledge it...`
` I'll never.........acknowledge this farce as the truth...!!"`
`After Ange yelled those words, her eyes grew cloudy.`
`They cleared up almost immediately.`
` By that time, she had already gone back to her six‐year‐old self...`
`"............You're right, Ange.`
` This is the sin I left behind, ...and the reason for this final tale's existence."`
`"...........................?"`
`As Ange stared blankly, uncomprehending, Beato gently patted her head.`
`"Indeed.`
` This tale is a farce.`
` It could not be true.`
` ......Yet, he was prepared to look past that—`
`no, to make it that way on purpose—`
`for the sake of the message that he wants to convey to you."`
`"Beato.`
` I'm already showing it to her.`
` I don't want to force it on her."`
`"I see."`
`"...............I don't understand what you two are talking about.`
` .........I'm sleepy."`
`"You're right.`
` We should probably be going."`
`"Kinzo.`
` Must I remain here longer?"`
`"My apologies, but I must ask you to stay a little longer.`
` ......Moving on, Krauss,`
` the continued support of the Gospel House should be viewed as your responsibility as the Ushiromiya family head..."`
`"......What a pain.`
` Forgive me, Battler.`
` It seems I cannot go with you.`
` ......Genji.`
` Would you mind taking these two to the guesthouse?"`
`"As you wish.`
` ......Battler‐sama, Ange‐sama, please follow me."`
`"Thanks.`
` ......Okay, Beato.`
` I'll see you later."`
`"Of course!`
` I have a mountain of things I wish to discuss with you.`
` And I'd like us to have some time alone tonight.`
` We must act the part of a couple every now and then...!"`
`"Wh‐what do you mean, act the part of a couple?`
` Ihihi...!"`
`Because Ange had gotten so bored, she had grown very sleepy.`
`It would probably be best for her to take a quick nap.`
`Battler walked through the windy rose garden, pulling her by the hand.`
`When he questioned their guide, Genji, ......he learned that the old servant had known beforehand of Kinzo's desire to return the gold to Beato...`
`and settle the inheritance problem early.`
`"......The Master decided to start preparations early for his final task in this world, the ending of his life."`
`"Most people don't think much about what happens after they die...`
` ......Haah.`
` Guess Grandfather's just on a whole different scale."`
`"Today marks the day of a new flight, when the Ushiromiya family will depart from the Golden Witch's patronage."`
`".........That's true.`
` Heheh, that's a pretty cool way to say it."`
`Apparently, a grand Halloween party was to be held tonight,`
` and Gohda and the others had been ordered to start getting ready for it.`
`However, it wouldn't just be a party.`
`It would be a ceremony to mark the return of {f:5:Beatrice}'s gold.`
`At the start of dinner, Grandfather would make the announcement,`
` and the Ushiromiya family would give thanks and applause to the three generations of {f:5:Beatrice}s for their generosity over the years.`
`Apparently, this was what he had planned.`
`"Is this still being kept secret from Dad and the others?"`
`"Technically, it is a secret.`
` ......However, the Master did not suddenly begin thinking in this way today.`
` He has often considered this day for many years, and has even discussed certain matters with his children.`
` I doubt that any will be surprised to hear this night's announcement."`
`"Well, as for my old bastard,`
` he's been running all over the place trying to get money for his company.`
` I guess he'll be dancing with joy when he hears that he's gonna get to unwrap Grandfather's inheritance present early."`
`"I rather think that Rudolf‐sama will be galvanized by a sense of great responsibility.`
` ......He has succeeded splendidly since he left the island.`
` However, his success so far has been supported by the Master's wealth."`
`"......And now that he's suddenly getting his inheritance money, he'll have to keep going by his own strength alone in the future.`
` .........Heheh, in fact, it might actually put pressure on him."`
`"The siblings must have suffered for decades because of their father's excess of success and ability.`
` ......Simply having a parent who is too successful can be a great burden to a child."`
`"And tonight,`
` ......they'll be leaving the nest, truly becoming adults for the first time."`
`"It seems the Master plans to call this night a ceremony to return the gold.`
` ......However, he first intended to call it a living funeral."`
`"Sounds pretty depressing, having a funeral while you're still alive.`
` I'll admit that calling it a day of a new journey and leaving the nest fits the Ushiromiya family much better."`
`"...............Onii‐chan, ......I'm sleepy......"`
`"Look, we're almost to the guesthouse.`
` Do you want to go to Mom's room?`
` Or to the cousins' room?"`
`"I don't care......`
` ......I'll............sleep until dinner......"`
`Ange, still holding her brother's hand, crouched down and looked as though she was about to fall asleep.`
`Battler lifted her onto his back and carried her.`
`As she felt the warmth and safety of her brother's back, Ange drifted off into sleep......`
`What happened that day......?`
`Just what on Earth happened on October 4th and 5th, 1986?`
`Because of the massive size of the Rokkenjima Explosion Accident, the time the explosion occurred was known almost exactly, down to the minute.`
`The time was...`
`...the stroke of midnight on October 5th.`
`The sheer improbability of that time proved that the explosion was produced by artificial means.`
`Later on, the following statements were collected from individuals who knew Ushiromiya Kinzo when he was alive.`
`During his lifetime, Ushiromiya Kinzo built a clock rigged to blow up the island at exactly midnight.`
`This clock was apparently inside his secret study.`
` When he felt mentally cornered and wanted to think up a brilliant plan,`
` he would activate that device and use the tension of the approaching midnight to bring some flash of inspiration to him.`
`While Ushiromiya Kinzo still lived, this was only thought of as a tall tale about this eccentric man,`
` ......but the fact that the Rokkenjima Explosion Accident occurred at exactly midnight supported the story...`
`"......It sounds crazy."`
`"He must have hoped to gain some sort of mystical power from those short periods of madness.`
` If we think of it as being his source of high‐output mental power, the story isn't that difficult to swallow."`
`Professor Ootsuki spoke passionately.`
`Witch Hunters.`
`{n}Enthusiasts who treat the mad fantasy surrounding Rokkenjima as their plaything.`
`Ange had no reason to love these people, who embellished the deaths of her family just for the fun of it.`
`And yet, how ironic it was for Ange, who wanted to know what happened that day,`
` that these people were the ones who knew most about that island.`
`"If someone used that device, the island would be blown away without a trace.`
` ......There would be nothing left.`
` No matter what had happened there, they could erase it."`
`"Theories that Ushiromiya Eva masterminded some kind of plot sprang up very early on.`
` However, no one was able to explain how she set off such a massive explosion."`
`"And the rigged clock proves that such a thing was possible..."`
`"Correct.`
` We can theorize that Ushiromiya Eva, fully aware of the timing and radius of the explosion, took refuge in Kuwadorian."`
`"......To get all of the family wealth to herself,`
` she killed everyone, and used the explosion to remove all evidence..."`
`"That idea gives the most logical explanation for the Rokkenjima mystery.`
` It also conforms with the fact that Eva never spoke to anyone about the events of that day."`
`Where was that rigged clock, and how did Eva find it?`
`Several Forgeries have speculated on this matter.`
` There's no need for me to waste time thinking about it.`
`Eva activated the clock device, hid in Kuwadorian to escape the blast,`
` and was therefore the only one to survive.`
`That was everything, the answer, which eloquently told the whole story.`
`......When Eva first adopted me,`
` our relationship wasn't as bad as it later became.`
`I asked her several times:`
` What happened that day?`
`Every single time she answered, it was to say that she didn't remember.`
`But...well, she must have been flustered at the time.`
`{n}The very first time I asked, she answered like this:`
`"I can't tell you about it."`
`It was a slip of the tongue.`
` She knew what had happened that day.`
`And she left this world without telling even a bit of the truth.`
`She sealed the truth in a cat box...`
`and left this world, taking the key with her.`
`There can be only one answer.`
`She was behind everything.`
`{n}She got all of the family wealth to herself and became super‐rich.`
`And afterward, she lamented the fact that her beloved son would never inherit any of what she had created, ...and she cursed me.`
`......Just remembering that old bitch makes me want to vomit.`
`What happened that day?`
` That's what I want to know.`
`It's my only goal, the one reason I'm still alive.`
`However, later on, I had to come to grips with the fact that my goal was an abstract one.`
`After all, even if I don't know what happened that day...`
`As for {i:who} did the crime—the whodunit—`
`that is already clear.`
`Ushiromiya Eva.`
` She's the culprit.`
`That has never changed since the beginning.`
`Yes.`
` I'm not trying to find out what happened that day.`
`I'm trying to find out what Ushiromiya Eva did that day.`
`If I can reveal that, then I can expose Eva's evil, even though she has already died.`
`That...is my true goal.`
`The police also suspected that a crime might have taken place, and they did investigate.`
`However, no matter how much they inspected the crater that had once been Rokkenjima, they didn't find anything at all.`
`The public and the Witch Hunters cornered Eva with several pieces of circumstantial evidence, but they were unable to find a single piece of physical evidence...`
`...and so, though Eva was only the merest fraction of a shade away from guilty, they were unable to expose her crime......`
`My goal isn't anything as vague as learning what happened that day......`
`It's to expose the crime Ushiromiya Eva committed that day...and to have my revenge.`
`I can't expose Ushiromiya Eva's crime, so people are treating the events on the island as though some bizarre Golden Witch did it all.`
`Defeating the Golden Witch means exposing Ushiromiya Eva's crime for what it was.`
`I won't forgive Ushiromiya Eva.`
`{n}I swear...... I swear............`
`{n}I will hate her and take revenge for my family.`
`That is Ushiromiya Ange's one and only reason for living......`
`"Hahhahahaha.`
` If she knew she was hated that much, the president'd probably be rolling around laughing in the next world."`
`"......Shut up.`
` I'll expose that old bitch's crime.`
` ......I'll never accept that she blew all the evidence away and committed the perfect crime. I refuse."`
`"In other words, this journey of yours is a journey to take revenge for your family."`
`"Got a problem with that?"`
`"You must be joking.`
` It's great to know that you have a purpose in life."`
`"......Could you turn that off?"`
`"Oh?`
` You don't like M.Zakky?"`
`Amakusa turned the radio off.`
`The dull sound of the engine became the BGM that filled the car.`
`"Is there something strange about it?`
` A fight for revenge."`
`"Not really.`
` I've met people who live for that reason many times on the front."`
`"......You've been on battlefields many times as a mercenary, right?"`
`"Well, I've seen a few."`
`"So, are people who fight to take revenge for their families...`
`strong?"`
`"No doubt about it.`
` ......Some people'll even strap bombs to themselves and commit suicide to take revenge for their families.`
` Humans are more than capable of dying for vengeance."`
`"......That's right.`
` I could do it too."`
`"Have you heard of child soldiers?"`
`"You mean kids who fight like soldiers?"`
`"That's it.`
` Kids who've lost their parents and have nowhere to go sometimes get picked up by groups of armed insurgents and become soldiers.`
` ......They get a gun thrust in their hands, and they're taught how to take revenge.`
` ......But in the end, children are expendable.`
` Anyone can be a soldier in a battlefield if they can pull a trigger."`
`"Are you trying to say that I'm like that?"`
`"Revenge can be a reason for living.`
` It can also give you the strength to become a soldier.`
` ......Like a miracle, it can turn a girl who could do nothing but sob over her parents' corpses into a soldier, almost overnight.`
` ......Nothing gives you more power than revenge does."`
`"I guess so.`
` And that's what I'm like."`
`"Do you know about the child soldier problem?"`
`"No."`
`"Child soldiers who are given guns and taught how to take revenge make that their reason for living.`
` Well, that's not exactly right.`
` It becomes their reason for shooting their guns.`
` ............But revenge is something that never ends.`
` At some point, they no longer have any reason for shooting their guns."`
`"......What do you mean?"`
`"They used to shoot for revenge.`
` But, eventually, they keep on shooting for no reason at all."`
`"Because they've forgotten about their revenge?"`
`"When revenge is impossible, they eventually tire of it and forget their original purpose.`
` When that happens, they have nothing except their gun.`
` Eventually, they'll keep shooting just so they can eat."`
`"......You're saying that child soldiers who started using guns for revenge...`
`end up as bandits or something?"`
`"After all, they've never even gone to school, and they haven't been taught any useful skills as far as employment is concerned."`
`They only learned how to shoot guns.`
`{n}And they were only ever praised when they killed the enemy.`
`"Eventually, your reason for living stops being revenge...and becomes the means you used to try and take it.`
` ......It's sad, really."`
`"Are you saying that I'll eventually get tired of revenge, and...`
`...uh, what would it be in my case?"`
`"You'll get tired of exposing the truth...`
`and your life will become entirely devoted to hating Ushiromiya Eva."`
`"Well, that's true already. Got a problem with it?"`
`"Hyahha...!`
` Come to think of it, that's right."`
`I'm not sure what Amakusa is trying to say.`
`{n}Probably something annoying.`
`So I'm not interested.`
`".........Revenge is stupid.`
` Is that what you're trying to say?"`
`"You still have a long life ahead of you, missy.`
` With your youth, you could do anything.`
` ......I get the feeling that this journey might be a waste of that precious youth."`
`"It's none of your business.`
` ......I already jumped, remember?`
` Off a skyscraper."`
`"And you were lucky enough to come out of that alive."`
`"Back then...`
`I died.`
` So, I'm already a ghost.`
` And my only purpose is to expose the truth of that day to take revenge on my family's killer."`
`"......I see.`
` That's an iron will you've got there, missy."`
`"There's no way a flippant man like you could understand how I feel."`
`After that, Amakusa was forced to shut his mouth.`
`He shrugged, but Ange didn't see.`
`Even so, Amakusa spoke once more.`
`"On the first day we started this journey,`
` ......you said something.`
` You said you wanted to know what happened on that island that day."`
`"It's the same now.`
` What's changed?"`
`"Now, you're saying...`
`that you want to know what happened on that island that day so you can expose Ushiromiya Eva's crime."`
`"And isn't that exactly the same?"`
`"......Well, that's true."`
`"I'm tired, so I'll sleep now.`
` Would you mind staying quiet for a bit?`
` Tell me when we get there."`
`"Roger that."`
`I wasn't particularly tired, really.`
`{n}I just said that because I didn't like talking about this.`
`"Don't become one.`
` A child soldier."`
`Ange, who had decided to feign sleep, ignored him.`
`{n}But Amakusa kept talking.`
` He wanted to make sure she heard at least this much.`
`"You started on a journey to learn the truth.`
` It's becoming more and more a journey of revenge.`
` .........A journey to have revenge by exposing the truth.`
` But, as you know, there's nothing left on Rokkenjima.`
` There aren't even any traces left.`
` ......Exposing the truth might not be a picnic."`
`......I know what Amakusa's trying to say.`
`The police searched the scene so thoroughly just after the crime, and even they weren't able to find any physical evidence proving that Ushiromiya Eva was the culprit.`
`And a full twelve years have passed since then.`
`......If the truth could be discovered by a girl like me, waving wads of cash around to pick up a bit of info from those who were somehow related to the incident,`
` then someone would have exposed the truth long ago.`
`I might not be able to reach the truth.`
`If so, .........then my first desire—to expose the truth—will probably fade away.`
`After that, only my hatred for Eva will remain.`
`Just like the child soldiers, who forget their original purpose and live just to shoot...`
`...I will forget my original purpose...and live just to hate.`
`For all my hate of Ushiromiya Eva, ......my revenge of exposing the truth will have been foiled,`
` ......but I will go on hating her anyway, and that will become all there is to my life.`
`......Is there any difference between shooting for revenge and shooting to live?`
`When you pull the trigger, someone dies either way.`
`And what about my case?`
`Is there any difference between hating Eva as I expose the truth...and hating Eva after I've given up?`
`There's no difference.`
`In the end, whether I find the truth or not, I'll just keep on cursing Eva, over and over, until I die.`
`............What a crappy life.`
`{n}But now...that's all I have left.`
`Ushiromiya Eva stole my family.`
`So, I'll take revenge.`
` ......By exposing her crimes and showing the world.`
`......My consciousness was slowly drifting away into sleep......`
`Why is Onii‐chan showing me such a bizarre Rokkenjima...?`
`Is this supposed to be the truth?`
`Enough with this farce.`
`Why is even Onii‐chan trying to hide the truth from me?`
`I'm trying to find it so that I can avenge him and the others.`
`.........Or would Onii‐chan say the same thing as Amakusa?`
`That revenge is meaningless, so I should stop.`
`Is that why......he's speaking in riddles, trying to make everything more confusing......?`
`.........That's none of his business.`
`I'm not just trying to take revenge for their sakes.`
`I'm doing it for my sake too.`
`{n}After all, that's the only thing I'm living for.`
`Taking revenge...is my reason to live.`
`..............................`
`I don't have a clue...`
`...what Onii‐chan is thinking.``Outside, the rain had started to pour down hard.`
`However, inside the cousins' room, it was loud and cheery.`
`It could have been raining spears, and no one would have paid any attention.`
`"Ihihiii!!`
` Full hou~se!!`
` Take that!"`
`"Whoa.`
` You weren't bluffing...!"`
`The cousins were all bursting with energy, sitting in a circle on the bed.`
`"And I thought Battler always had crap in his hands every time he acted tough...!"`
`"Of course, I've been losing all this time just to make you think that!`
` Ushiromiya Battler, the man who loses strategically to win in the end! Ihihi!"`
`"Uu, Battler's amazing...!`
` All my coins are gone again."`
`"I'll give you some of mine.`
` Let's crush Battler together, okay?!"`
`With just a deck of cards, the cousins could enjoy themselves for many hours.`
`They were so engrossed that the occasional thunderbolt hardly even registered as static in the background.`
`"I'm starting to get hungry.`
` I wonder if dinner's ready yet."`
`"Who knows.`
` It should be ready soon.`
` Gohda‐san and the others really went all out for tonight."`
`"Heheh, which means we've got a lot to look forward to.`
` Is this to celebrate my long‐awaited return?"`
`"I heard from Shannon just now that it's going to be a Halloween party.`
` They'll set up a buffet in the hall.`
` Sounds incredible."`
`"A Halloween party?!`
` Wow, wow, uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`"Hmm?`
` Hello? Who is it?"`
`There was a knock, the door opened, and Ange was there.`
`Ange had been sleeping in her parents' room.`
`"Hey, it's you, Ange!`
` So, you woke up."`
`"Umm, they said it's dinner, so we have to go to the mansion.`
` They said to get ready."`
`"Uu‐uu‐uu!!`
` Food, foo~d!!`
` I'm hungry~~!!"`
`Perhaps because she was the hungriest, Maria celebrated more vigorously than anyone else.`
`She jumped up happily and hopped off the bed.`
`As the others all clambered off the bed and started putting their shoes on, Kyrie and Rudolf came into view.`
`"Hey, brats.`
` Time for food, so get ready."`
`"It looks like today will be extra special.`
` I can't wait to see."`
`"Uu!! I know!`
` It's a Halloween party!"`
`"......A Halloween party?"`
`"Kihhihihihihi!`
` I know, and Ange doesn't.`
` Kihhihihihi."`
`"Mom, what's a Halloween party?"`
`"Who knows?`
` We'll have to go and see for ourselves."`
`"Everyone ready?`
` It's about time to go."`
`"Is everyone here?`
` Please follow me."`
`"Maria, over here.`
` Your collar's crooked."`
`"Ah, I'm so hungry.`
` The food is the best part of these family conferences.`
` Are you hungry too, Ange‐chan?"`
`Eva smiled at Ange.`
`".........Yeah.`
` Starving."`
`"Ange.`
` "Yes, I am", right?"`
`"*giggle*. Don't worry about it.`
` Yeah, I'll bet you're starving.`
` My stomach's rumbling too."`
`"Okay, let's get out of here.`
` Looks like the wind's blowing hard outside.`
` Make sure you don't lose your umbrellas."`
`"Everyone, please take an umbrella."`
`"Here's your umbrella, Ange‐chan."`
`"Thanks, Auntie Eva."`
`"*giggle*.`
` ......Ah, girls really are so cute.`
` Come over to play at your auntie's house one of these days.`
` It's a promise, okay?"`
`"......It looks like Auntie Eva's taken a liking to Ange."`
`"Yep.`
` Apparently, Mother actually would have liked a daughter."`
`"Ah, I've heard that too.`
` I think she doted on me too, when I was little."`
`"My Mama said she actually wanted a son, uu!"`
`"If your kid grows up happily, it doesn't matter if they're a boy or a girl.`
` Maria is my precious, precious gift from God."`
`When they got outside, the wind was fairly strong.`
`Eva, who had now really hit it off with Ange, offered to share an umbrella with the little girl.`
`It was hard to tell what they were chatting so excitedly about, but it seemed that they were already getting along splendidly.`
`Battler opened his umbrella as he watched this.`
`His little sister was cute when she clung to him, but she was just as cute and adorable when looking up at someone else with a happy smile.`
`The wind and rain were strong, but even this must have been the perfect spice to heighten their anticipation of the coming meal......`
`Thanks to some festive decorations, the main hall had been remade into the scene of a Halloween party.`
`The Ushiromiya family always took meals in the dining hall.`
`This was the first time I'd ever seen a buffet‐style party set up in the main hall.`
`"Yo, Battleeer!`
` Hey, Maria! Long time no see...!"`
`"Beato!!`
` Happy Halloween!`
` Trick or treat...!!"`
`"*cackle*cackle*.`
` I have some candy for you, but now is not the time.`
` After all, it's just before a meal."`
`"*giggle*.`
` Thank you, {f:5:Beatrice}‐san.`
` I see you're looking as beautiful as ever."`
`"You too, Rosa!`
` One would never guess you to be a mother.`
` Wahaha!"`
`"Have you been drinking?`
` Your ears are looking pretty red there."`
`"Hmm?`
` Well, after you left, uhihiii!`
` Kinzo told me he'd come into possession of an unusual drink, and well, a little alcohol never hurt anyone...!`
` Waha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!"`
`"And this coming from a person who tells little kids not to eat candy before a meal..."`
`"Pardon me.`
` {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, the Master is calling for you."`
`I saw Kinzo beckoning from over by the portrait.`
`"Good grief.`
` When it comes to ceremony, that man is always so obsessed with form."`
`"It's probably that stuff about a ceremony for the gold's return.`
` This is a huge turning point for the Ushiromiya family.`
` You'd better go and play along."`
`"It does make one feel a bit lonely though."`
`"This won't change the fact that you're the Ushiromiya family alchemist."`
`"Perhaps.`
` Then I'll be back shortly.`
` See you later, okay?`
` According to Genji, today's party has a bit of a twist to it.`
` You'd better look forward to it...!"`
`"You make it sound like you did any of the work."`
`"Wahhahahaha, you're another one who obsesses too much over details...!`
` Later!"`
`"......Onii‐chan, is something going to happen today?`
` Is it a special day......?"`
`It looked as though even Ange had picked up on that much.`
`{n}She seemed to be getting tense for no reason.`
`"This is a special day, for the Ushiromiya family.`
` But it doesn't have anything to do with you personally, so you should just relax."`
`"Okay.`
` ......Ah, that's right. Hey, hey, did you know?`
` I just heard a huge secret from Auntie Eva...!`
` Even Maria onee‐chan doesn't know, but I'll tell you!"`
`"Ooh?`
` So, what's this secret?"`
`"So, yeah!`
` I heard that, if there's an almond in it, you win...!"`
`"Win?`
` Is this like a lottery or something?"`
`"Hmmmmmmmmmm...`
` Anyway, if you get an almond, you win!"`
`Ange puffed out her cheeks.`
` Apparently, she wanted to be praised for sharing this exciting secret.`
`But just hearing that almonds win didn't really explain much.`
`"Okay, got it.`
` Thanks for letting me in on that major secret."`
`"Nnnnnnn, you're mean, Onii‐chan!`
` And I even told you my secret!"`
`Ange, her cheeks still puffed out, headed back to where Auntie Eva was.`
`They really are getting along well.`
` Still, I guess I have no problem if it's her aunt.`
`If it was some guy from her class, I don't care if they're both in elementary school, it's not happening!`
` No playing with the opposite sex without Onii‐chan's approval!`
`At that moment, Genji‐san's voice rang out.`
`The chatter gradually subsided, and the rain outside once again became apparent.`
`"Ladies and gentlemen, I ask for your silence."`
`Silence filled the room.`
`All of the relatives seemed vaguely aware that tonight's festivities consisted of more than a Halloween party.`
`Battler already knew.`
`This was a ceremony to mark the return of the gold, from Kinzo to {f:5:Beatrice}, which had been borrowed for so many years.`
`First off, that fact was announced by Kinzo himself.`
`He spoke of how this gold had not only restored the Ushiromiya family, but brought it to a level of wealth it had never before experienced.`
` He spoke of how he would finally return this gold to {f:5:Beatrice}, the one who had saved the Ushiromiya family.`
`A weighty ingot decorated with a bright red ribbon passed from his hands to hers.`
`".........The debt that the Ushiromiya family owes to the three generations of {f:5:Beatrice}, the Golden Witch,`
` is one that we shall never forget."`
`"Dear me.`
` I've nowhere to put it, but I suppose I can take it off your hands."`
`".........{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama."`
`"N‐nnn, *cough*cough*."`
`Despite her status, Beato's remark earned her a surprising warning from Genji.`
` I couldn't help but laugh.`
`"I am {f:5:Beatrice}, the Ushiromiya family alchemist.`
` Tonight, I acknowledge the end of the loan contract for the ten tons of gold.`
` ......Many decades have passed since my grandmother's generation.`
` The time has come for the eagle that lost one wing to fly once more.`
` I will watch over that eagle, and I pray for its prosperity in all generations to come."`
`Applause filled the hall.`
`Though she'd just managed to make such a dignified speech, as soon as it was over, she stuck her tongue out and leered at us.`
`I guess that's about the limit to how long Beato can stay serious.`
`"By passing her name on through the generations, {f:5:Beatrice}, the Golden Witch, may live for thousands of years.`
` Therefore, even her descendants shall be {f:5:Beatrice}, and all shall be alchemists to this family."`
`"The descendants of the Ushiromiya family will praise {f:5:Beatrice} for her gratitude forevermore, and this will be passed on through the generations.`
` .........This family will always be indebted to {f:5:Beatrice}, and she will always be our family, tied by a noble bond."`
`".........Let those who agree show their recognition with their applause."`
`After Genji's words, the relatives all looked at each other, then started applauding at once.`
`"Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.`
` .........{f:5:Beatrice}.`
` You are a member of the Ushiromiya family.`
` And your bond to us is more sacred than one of blood."`
`"Wahaha, the relationship between debtor and creditor is indeed more important than blood."`
`"......{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama."`
`"Nngyhh, nnn...!"`
`After that, Kinzo's longwinded speech continued.`
`Tonight, Kinzo would retire as the Ushiromiya family head.`
`Then, he announced that he would reveal the distribution of his inheritance.`
`A stir of excitement spread across the siblings in money trouble when they heard that they wouldn't have to wait for Kinzo's death to get their inheritance.`
`"I am aware that each of you is in trouble with money.`
` This should be enough to resolve all of those problems.`
` ......But do not grow complacent.`
` This is my inheritance, given to you before my death."`
`"In the past, though I have been strict, I have always watched over you.`
` However, beginning tonight, your father will cease to provide support of that kind.`
` ......I shall watch on as you take flight, as though watching down upon you from the heavens.`
` No longer will I interfere.`
` ......You may live however you please."`
`"D-.........Dad......"`
`"Father......"`
`"We understand...`
` ......You need have no fear...that we'll take flight on our own."`
`"Here and now, all of us siblings swear to work together...`
`to make the Ushiromiya family even more prosperous."`
`"That's right...!`
` If we stick together, nothin' can stand in our way...!"`
`Hideyoshi laughed, but Genji admonished him.`
`{n}However, he could understand why they were so happy.`
`......So far, the siblings had quarreled ruthlessly over the inheritance.`
`However, this evening,`
` ......the inheritance had been neatly split apart, and they no longer had any need to scheme for money.`
`In other words, the siblings no longer had any reason to squabble with each other anymore.`
`On the contrary, this was a time for them to join hands and help each other become more and more prosperous.`
`Eva and Rosa were sniffling, with tears in their eyes.`
` ......And so was Rudolf.`
`Perhaps now, ......even at their ages,`
` ......they had finally left the nest.`
`Tonight, the eagles of the Ushiromiya family would leave Rokkenjima, the nest weaved from the witch's magic, and go their separate ways.`
` ......With their own power and determination.`
`It made Kinzo think.`
`{n}If only I had done this from the start...`
`......If he had settled the inheritance problem himself, there would have been no need for his children to quarrel at all.`
`Instead, he had acted in a sullen manner and left the problem to them, which had resulted in their strained relationships to each other.`
`Yes.`
` All of that had been his responsibility.`
`{n}And now, he was disentangled.`
`It had been like an invisible rope wrapped around Kinzo's body.`
`That rope had now come loose, and he felt a sense of release he hadn't experienced for many years...`
`The four siblings stepped forward, and before Kinzo, they swore to all support Krauss, the new head, and lead the family to greater prosperity.`
`Their faces sparkled with an unexpected youthfulness.`
`It was only natural.`
` After all, the four of them had not been so naturally united.........since the time they were kids.`
`As the vibrancy of their youth returned to them, the siblings banded together once again.`
`When Krauss finished his announcement, a warm round of applause filled the hall.`
`The cousins...`
`and the servants too...`
`...joined in on the applause that continued on and on.`
`Ange......watched this, dumbfounded.`
`............The four siblings had quarreled with each other constantly since they were kids, ......supposedly.`
`Supposedly, they had pointlessly locked swords with Kinzo's inheritance as their goal, their worries over money spurring them on.`
`......Even the world of "truth", the world I acknowledge, ......has been rewritten by this golden ceremony.`
`Were they actually friendly towards each other, or did they quarrel all the time like I believe? It doesn't matter.`
`......Either way, right here, right now, all of those problems have been resolved.`
`I mustn't believe.`
` .........This is just...Onii‐chan's farce.`
`Even though I knew that fact,`
` .........when I watched Dad and the others hugging each other, with teary smiles on their faces, ......I couldn't help but feel something warm welling up in my eyes.`
`"I won't believe it......`
` .........All of this......is just another part of your farce........."`
`"What will you have to see, what will you have to hear,`
` before you'll let yourself believe...?"`
`".........Red.`
` ............If you say it with the red truth..."`
`"Is everything you can't say in red a lie?"`
`"......I won't believe...`
` ......This is......just........."`
`Ange looked at the floor and fell silent.`
`As the Game Master, Battler was able to use the red truth.`
`However, that rule only exists on the witch's game board.`
`In the world of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s, red truth...doesn't exist.`
`People see things, hear things,`
` ......and when they believe that something is worth believing, they accept it as a red truth.`
`Unless Ange accepts it, no kind of truth can become truth.`
`Battler wanted her to realize this.`
`There was no point in using the red truth, a rule of this game, to force the truth on her.`
`Ange would have to use her own power, her own heart,`
` to accept the truth as truth.`
`The decision was Ange's.`
`{n}No one could force her to decide either way.`
`So, there was nothing wrong with Ange declaring this scene to be a farce.`
`But, if so, .........then what was the meaning of the hot tears dripping down Ange's face?`
`......Ange would have to consider that herself, without anyone telling her......`
`After one sniffle and a rub of her eyes, Ange let the six‐year‐old version of herself take control of her piece.`
`What followed was a harmonious, fun stretch of time.`
`Beautifully adorned dishes were brought in one after another, and champagne corks were loosened with pleasant sounds.`
`Several small tables were set here and there, each with its own theme.`
`That was where the fun lay in this stand‐up buffet party, as the guests wandered from table to table, pondering what they should eat first.`
`This sort of performance was where Gohda's genius shone through.`
` The hotel that let him go should probably regret ever having done so.`
`Of course, a stand‐up buffet would probably be a tiring affair for the middle‐aged.`
`So, chairs had been set up as well.`
`However, each time a new dish was brought into the hall, they could get up to look, and wander the tables however they pleased.`
`This way, they could each bump into a new group of people, then mingle elsewhere when that group melted apart.`
`People are interesting.`
` As the members in each group changed, so did the topic of conversation.`
`The bustling Halloween party played out like a colorful kaleidoscope.`
`The origami chains decorating the walls recalled one to one's youth.`
`They would make anyone enjoy themselves as they did when they were kids......`
`Even to Ange, it was like a dream.`
`She chatted happily with her cousins.`
`She also chatted with her aunts and uncles.`
`Beato showed her several tricks that she called magic.`
`Maria said they were magic, Ange said they were tricks, and the night grew even more lively.`
`The two young girls were so fired up that the adults decided to show some tricks they knew, shocking both of the kids utterly.`
`Eventually, they each started showing tricks to the others, asking if they'd ever seen this one or that one before,`
` and it became a party of magic, just perfect for Halloween.`
`In addition to magic tricks, several quizzes, riddles and games popped up, reminding everyone of their childhood days.`
`Even the servants who were serving food got dragged into the groups, and the whole hall filled with chatter.`
`To Ange, young as she was, every single magic trick, quiz, and riddle was an entirely new experience.`
`They stimulated her intellectual curiosity, and she couldn't contain her excitement.`
`Add in the wide variety of delicious foods and drinks she could choose from, and it was like being in a dream.`
`Ange felt a floaty sensation, as though she was walking on a cloud......`
`"Ange, ...you didn't drink this, did you?!`
` This is Daddy's drink!"`
`"......I wanted to try some adult grape juice too.`
` So it's okay."`
`"Your face is looking a little red there.`
` Are you feeling okay?"`
`"She only had a bit, so I think she'll be fine......"`
`"......I'll be fine.`
` I'm not a kid......`
` ......*hic*..."`
`"*giggle*.`
` Ange‐chan, drink this one, okay?`
` Your Dad's drinking a bad drink, so don't try any more, got it?"`
`"That's right!`
` If you drink bad stuff, you'll end up as a bad adult too. Ihihi!"`
`"I'm not gonna be a bad adult!`
` I'm gonna be a princess!"`
`"That's right.`
` Ange is a princess to all of us."`
`"Yep.`
` Ange's this family's princess."`
`"She's a princess to me, too.`
` You'd better come over to my house to play sometime...!`
` We'll have lots and lots of fun!"`
`"Okay.`
` Thanks, Auntie Eva...!"`
`Everyone was being really nice to me.`
`It almost felt like I'd become a real princess.`
`I felt so great, I could almost believe that this whole celebration was being held for my sake.`
`Battler stood outside that group of people.`
` As he watched Ange smiling happily from a distance, he smiled too.`
`".........When she smiles like that, she really lives up to her name.`
` It's so sad."`
`"I agree.`
` It really is a smile fit for an angel."`
`"I hope that smile belongs to the real Ange...and not just the piece."`
`"......Even if it doesn't, she is watching this.`
` And she can think it through herself."`
`"This game between you and Ange really is overflowing with affection.`
` For me, it's almost irritating."`
`"And what's wrong with that?`
` No one to get in her way.`
` No obstacles or tactics or anything else to worry about."`
`"That's right.`
` This game...is no longer a battle."`
`"I'd call it......cleaning up.`
` ......After our game."`
`"............I will never be able to make up for the sin I did to her through my careless actions."`
`"Our game was responsible.`
` We'll make up for our sins together.`
` ......That's why we're showing Ange this final game."`
`"Do you think...that Ange will be able to use that key the right way...?"`
`"......Of course, I've thought about forcibly dragging her in the way we think is right."`
`"Such an attempt may have been meaningless.`
` ......As long as life is, it is hard to accept that a decision you were forced into was truly the correct one."`
`"Exactly.`
` .........Ange must think and choose by herself.`
` Even if she doesn't make the decision we view as the correct one, ......I think we should respect it."`
`"......Hmmm.`
` .........You are the Game Master.`
` It is no longer my place to argue.`
` I will simply watch on and enjoy this night."`
`"This game is very significant for Ange.`
` But for us, it's kind of like a party after the show."`
`"It's almost time.`
` But are you sure?`
` Ange might get the wrong idea again, right?"`
`"It'll be fine.`
` In fact, this is necessary.`
` ......Just like how you appeared in the way you did.`
` And everyone else too."`
`"...............Hmmm.`
` Then let us enjoy this final celebration with the others.`
` After all, all of them have acted their parts so well in this long game."`
`That instant, the sound of someone clapping for attention rang out.`
`"Your attention, everyone. Please gather.`
` And now, for today's special event...!"`
`Gohda had been the one clapping.`
` Everyone gathered together, wondering what was going on.`
`On the serving cart in front of him was a large, sliced, chocolate cake.`
`"As the highlight of tonight's Halloween party, I have prepared this Sachertorte for you all.`
` As you can see, this was made specially for the Ushiromiya family, and bears the crest of the One‐winged Eagle in chocolate!"`
`The stupendous cake drew a gasp of admiration from all present.`
`"What a splendid cake...!`
` A perfect highlight for the party."`
`"Oh, no.`
` It's not just the cake.`
` Tonight's cake has a little secret.`
` ......Master, I ask that you explain that secret to everyone!"`
`"Very well.`
` This is a bit of a game.`
` There's one, tiny thing in this cake that will make you a winner."`
`"It's an almond...!"`
`Ange shouted happily.`
` Kinzo looked at her fondly and nodded.`
`"In just one slice of this cake, there is a single almond.`
` The one who chooses that piece will become tonight's king."`
`"Whoo!`
` It's been a long time since I played the king game...!"`
`"I'm guessing the subject matter was a bit different when you played it..."`
`"Hahhahahahahahaha.`
` So, what happens to the person who becomes the king?"`
`"The king gets to name one wish.`
` Then, we shall all try to grant it together."`
`"Oooh!`
` Sounds interesting...!"`
`"Uu.`
` Kings are boys.`
` Girls can't be kings."`
`"If a girl wins, they get to become the princess."`
`"The almond!`
` The one with the almond wins!`
` Right? Right?!"`
`"Ahahahaha, that's right.`
` You're incredible, Ange."`
`"Times like this are when a man's luck shines through.`
` Can't let myself lose now!"`
`"Hold up there.`
` Let's let the smallest kids choose first."`
`"Good idea.`
` Ange‐chan, you can go first."`
`"Hey, you're the big cousin now, Maria!`
` Let Ange‐chan go first."`
`"Uu‐uu‐uu!`
` But what if Ange wins, uu!"`
`"I am gonna win!`
` The almond wins, the almond wins!"`
`"It seems we old fogies must hope that leftovers are lucky today."`
`"If we're going by age, I guess that means Kinzo's last."`
`"Wahhahahahaha, but weren't you a thousand years old?"`
`"N‐nooooooooo!!"`
`Everyone burst out laughing.`
` Her real age was unknown, but she claimed to be 19 years old.`
`In front of Ange lay a large cake, cut so that there was one piece for each of them.`
`Just one of those pieces was the winner.`
`"Well then, Ange‐sama.`
` Which piece would you like?`
` Whichever you choose, it will be ever so delicious."`
`"No way.`
` I only want the winning one."`
`"Well then, you'll have to try and guess right on the first shot.`
` Go ahead, pick one."`
`Battler pushed Ange's small back towards the table with the cake.`
`"............Which one......should I take............?"`
`The chocolate cake was cut into fifteen pieces.`
`{n}......I wanna pick the one with an almond and become the princess!`
`One of them has the winning almond. Which could it be...?`
`I get to choose first, ......but it sort of feels unfair.`
`I mean, it is, isn't it?`
` My chances of getting the right one are 1 in 15.`
` There's no way I'll get it.`
`And then, when Maria onee‐chan goes after me, she has a 1 in 14 chance of picking the winner.`
` The next person has a 1 in 13 chance, then a 1 in 12 chance, ......and the last person......will win for sure??`
`"Onii‐chan, this isn't fair...!`
` The person who goes first has a disadvantage...!"`
`Everyone laughed.`
` Apparently, there was something wrong with my calculations, but it still didn't feel right to me.`
`"Come now, let us start this contest of luck with Ange‐sama.`
` Please, feel free to make your selection...!"`
`"......Okay!`
` Okay......!!"`
`If I have to pick one out of so many, there's no way I'll win.`
`......But for some reason, tonight, it feels like I might actually win after all.`
`I have no reason for feeling this way, but when I'm in a good mood, Lady Luck always brings me fortune.`
`"Have you decided yet?"`
`"Yeah.`
` .........I've decided.`
` This one's...the winner."`
`I concentrated on my fingertip......and pointed at one of the 15 slices.`
`The slice I chose was............`
`".........This one!"`
`"This one? Are you sure?"`
`"I've made up my mind.`
` I want this one...!"`
`When he asked me whether I was sure, I felt a little uneasy.`
`Still, at times like this, it's better to stick with your instincts.`
`It was one of the few bits of philosophy that the young girl had learned from her few life experiences.`
`Gohda took the chosen slice, put it on a plate with a fork, and handed it to Ange.`
`"I go next!!`
` Uu‐uu, which should I take!"`
`It was Maria's turn next.`
` She was excited, determined to be the winner.`
`I walked away from that group, all by myself.`
`......I was struck by a temptation to quickly cut the cake open with my fork and check for an almond inside.`
`However, I stopped myself.`
`If I check my piece first, my chance of winning is 1 in 15.`
`However, if I wait for some other people to check their slices, then when I see that they've lost, my chances will go up, if only slightly.`
`In other words, instead of searching for the almond right away,`
` my chances will go up if I wait for some other people to lose.`
`But if someone picks a winner while I'm sitting around here, the chances of my slice being a winner will go to zero.`
` It'll be tough to calculate the right moment.`
`I need to wait just long enough for as many losers to show up as possible.`
` My chances of winning are highest if I can check my piece immediately before someone else wins.`
`Yeah, that's the trick to winning this game!`
`...........................`
`............???`
`{n}What a strange thought.`
` ......It feels like I'm missing something??`
`Even though no one else can touch the cake that's sitting in front of me...`
`The almond inside it will appear or disappear depending on whether or not the other people win or lose.`
`.........??`
`I was in such a good mood that I felt dizzy, and I couldn't figure out what was wrong with my theory.`
`But I did realize that something was strange.`
`......There is always just one truth inside a cat box.`
`No matter what happens outside the box, ......it shouldn't be able to shake the truth inside.`
`And yet, ......I'm being influenced by events outside the cat box and trying to make them affect my observation of the box's contents.`
`.................................`
`I don't even know what I'm saying.`
`Another me inside me is trying to say that, ......but it's too hard for me to understand.`
`I feel like I'm drifting......`
`I got so cheery and excited that, even though I'm not sleepy, my mind feels hazy.`
`Maybe it's 'cause I drank Dad's adult drink......`
`In the end, even though I'd chosen the first piece, I decided to check it last.`
`After I've seen that everyone else has lost, my chances of winning will be 100%.`
`......I tried to find the contradiction in my thinking, but I didn't really get it, so I stopped.`
`It's much better to have a 100% chance than a 1 in 15 one, so I decided to bet on that.`
`I couldn't wait to open this precious treasure chest,`
` but I waited for everyone else to choose their pieces and check them.`
`"How is it going?`
` Has anyone found a winner?"`
`"Uu!`
` Mine didn't have one."`
`"I lost too.`
` And I wanted to be the princess...!"`
`"Even if you lose, this Sachertorte really is beautiful and delicious.`
` It's such a good decoration, it's almost a shame to eat it."`
`"How about you?`
` Find any almond?"`
`"No, not me either.`
` What about you, Hideyoshi nii‐san?"`
`"Mine's a loser too.`
` Looks like I've used up all my luck with my company and my wife."`
`"What exactly do you mean by that?"`
`"What about you, Doctor Nanjo?"`
`"I'm checking it now.`
` Games like this can truly can be fun, every now and then."`
`"Yes.`
` Sometimes, a simple test of luck, without any strategy or tactics, can be quite entertaining.`
` What about you, Beato?"`
`"Where's the liar who said leftovers would be lucky?!`
` Grrrrrrrr...!"`
`"What about you, Ange?`
` Was there an almond in yours?"`
`"I'm checking now......"`
`"Oh, you still haven't touched yours?"`
`I was following my own personal probability theory,`
` ......but I didn't think I could explain it well to Onii‐chan, so I didn't mention it to him.`
`I wonder if there's an almond in there.`
`{n}If I win, I'll be tonight's princess.`
`......I'll be happy if I win, but even if I don't, it'll still be a really fun night, so that's okay.`
`It stopped when this cake game started, but before then, everyone was having a lot of fun trading tricks, quizzes, and riddles.`
`This game is fun too, but I want to play like that again soon.`
`..................Huh?`
`"What's up, Ange?`
` .........Oh?"`
`I stared at the tiny thing on my fork, then showed it to my brother.`
`"This......is an almond, right...?"`
`"Wh‐whoa!!`
` Ange got it!`
` That's awesome...!"`
`At the same time, a stir rose up in the other corner of the room.`
`"I got one, I won...!"`
`"Hoh!`
` So Eva won...!"`
`"My, my!`
` Congratulations, Eva‐sama...!!"`
`"That's wrong!!`
` I won!`
` Mine has the almond!!"`
`I held the almond high and shouted across the room.`
`{n}The crowd around Eva split, and everyone stared at me, surprised.`
`I was surprised too.`
` The thing in her hand was, without a doubt, an almond...`
`"What the heck...?`
` What's going on here...?"`
`"Gohda.`
` There seem to be two almonds, ......so are they both winners?"`
`"But, .........that shouldn't have......"`
`"Does this mean that one of the two made a mistake...?"`
`"Ange‐sama's is clearly an almond.`
` ......How about your end, Kanon‐kun?"`
`"Eva‐sama's is clearly an almond."`
`"Hohhohohohohoho.`
` Then it seems that they both win."`
`"............My lord."`
`"Heheheheheheh...!`
` What an odd occurrence.`
` What's all this, Gohda?"`
`"Ah, umm, ......well, ......it seems we've had a little mistake......`
` Uh, ......perhaps they should do rock, paper—"`
`"Come now, don't be stingy.`
` It just means that two almonds have appeared to signify the queen and the princess."`
`"Precisely.`
` Let's have them both be winners."`
`"Ah, well, but........."`
`Gohda was hesitant.`
`Actually, he had prepared a single special dessert for the king.`
`It had been decorated in a way that made it hard to split for two people.`
` So, it wasn't convenient for there to be two kings.`
`When Eva heard Gohda mumbling something to this effect, she shrugged and laughed.`
`"In that case, let's have Ange‐chan be the princess."`
`"The princess!`
` I'm the princess...?!"`
`"I'll be your attendant.`
` That works, right?"`
`Of course it worked.`
`Ange had been worried that Eva would be declared the winner, since she had spoken up first.`
`So, she hadn't even dreamed that Eva would give it up to her.`
`"But, are you sure...?`
` You won too."`
`"It's okay. I get to be your attendant.`
` Come, princess.`
` What wish do you want granted...?`
` Let's hear it."`
`"I've.........already chosen my wish......"`
`"Oh.`
` And what is it?`
` Won't you tell your auntie?"`
`I want this fun time to keep on going.`
` ......Forever.`
`The young me spoke for the desire in my heart.`
`"I, ......I want all the fun stuff from before...to keep going!"`
`I get the feeling that the nuance has changed.`
`{n}Still, that was unmistakably my wish.`
`"From before?`
` ......Oh, you mean those tricks and quizzes?"`
`"Yeah!"`
`"Then this is what we'll do.`
` Listen up, everyone.`
` This is an order from your princess.`
` Remember how much fun we were having before this?`
` Let's all entertain Ange‐chan with tricks and quizzes."`
`"Hold up there.`
` I already used up all my material for tricks."`
`"Then let's do quizzes and riddles."`
`"So, we all just have to entertain Ange‐chan with quizzes?"`
`"We can all present quizzes to our princess to entertain her."`
`"I see.`
` Understood."`
`"Wahahaha!`
` Yes, how intriguing.`
` Then, Ange, let us do it this way.`
` Everyone will give you a quiz or a riddle, and you can try to solve them.`
` Each time you succeed, I will give you a medal."`
`"A medal?"`
`"He probably means commemorative medals.`
` If you get a lot of puzzles right, you'll get a lot of medals."`
`"Hohhohohohoho.`
` Just gathering medals is a tad boring, don't you think?"`
`"Yes.`
` Depending on the number of medals you collect, I shall give you a fantastic present...!`
` Well, do you suddenly feel fired up?!"`
`"It sounds amazing.`
` So, there's even a prize...!"`
`"*giggle*.`
` Isn't that great, Ange?"`
`"Y‐......yeah...!"`
`Everyone gathered around me, smiling, as they thought about what sort of puzzle they'd give.`
`They're all thinking about me, so that they can play with me.`
`Just the feel of having that all to myself almost made me explode with joy at becoming the princess.``I became the Halloween party princess,`
` and the tournament of quizzes and riddles just for me began.`
`It looks like I get a medal for each puzzle I get right.`
`If I get a lot, I'm supposed to get a wonderful prize from Grandfather.`
`Okay, here I go.`
`"Who should I start with?"`
`"I don't think it matters.`
` Start with whomever you like."`
`"I'd better think up a killer puzzle while I have the chance."`
`"Maria, didn't you have a quiz book in your bag?"`
`"Uu! I do!`
` Kihihihihihi, I'm gonna bully Ange with a mean one...!"`
`Maria onee‐chan laughed with an evil smile.`
`Looks like everyone's going to try and bully me.`
` I'm sure they'll think up some really hard questions.`
`"Don't worry, I'll lend a hand."`
`"Really...?"`
`"Of course.`
` After all, I'm the princess's attendant.`
` So, let's give it our all together and get a huge pile of medals."`
`"Okay...!"`
`"Come now, Ange‐sama.`
` Start wherever you want.`
` I, Gohda, am ready to challenge you whenever you please."`
`"Whoa, not so fast.`
` The honor of the first audience with the princess belongs to me.`
` Ange, begin with my challenge...!"`
`"O‐okay!"`
`I suddenly got tense, and my stomach began to feel tight.`
`Then, Auntie Eva gently held my hand.`
`"It'll be alright.`
` Let's do this together!"`
`"O‐......okay!"`
`"Then let us begin, Ange.`
` This is a story about December 25th, Christmas Day."`
`"Christmas...?"`
`Even though it was October, he suddenly started talking about Christmas.`
`{n}Is he going to ask what day Christmas is?`
`I know that.`
` It's December 25th.`
`"On Christmas Day,`
` a woman looked up at the night sky and said,`
` "Eventually, the night will end, and morning will come.`
` Wouldn't it be wonderful if, after the sun sinks and it becomes night once more, it could be Christmas again?"`
` Then, the man beside her said,`
` "Okay,`
` I'll make your dream come true for you."`
` Is such a thing possible...?"`
`"The day after Christmas is the 26th, a normal day.`
` That's impossible."`
`"...Still Christmas, even after the sun rises......`
` Oh, I've got it."`
`"Huh? How?!`
` How can the day after Christmas be Christmas again?!"`
`"Wahhahahahaha.`
` Think about it for yourself, Ange."``"The day after Christmas isn't Christmas.`
` It couldn't happen."`
`"Heheheh.`
` Too bad. Wrong."`
`"Huh? Why...?!"`
`"Ange‐chan, what time of day does a new day start?"`
`"Midnight, 0:00."`
`"There you go.`
` At midnight, isn't it night outside?"`
`"......Ah!"`
`I see.`
` The first night was just after midnight on December 25th.`
`In other words, the time right after the previous day ended and Christmas began.`
`That would indeed be Christmas Day, and it would be at night.`
`"And then, the morning of the 25th would come, and when the sun sank again, that would be nighttime on the 25th again......"`
`"Exactly!`
` You figured it out."`
`"Hohoho!`
` If only you had figured it out a little faster."`
`Grandfather laughed like Santa Claus.`
`Auntie Eva asked him to count it as a right answer, since I figured it out in the end, but Grandfather shook his head.`
`"Come on...!`
` Don't be such a stingy Grandpa."`
`"Still, now I've figured out how to do it.`
` I'll get the next one right."`
`"Yes, yes.`
` That's the spirit.`
` That's my granddaughter for you."`
`"Thank you, Grandpa!`
` I'm really ready now.`
` I'll start getting a lot of them right!"`
`"Yes.`
` Give it your all.`
` I have a truly splendid present waiting for you."`
`After bowing to Grandfather, I hurried off with Auntie Eva to where everyone else was gathered.`
`"Oh, I see.`
` It is possible...!"`
`"Yep, that's right.`
` After all, there are two nights in every day."`
`"Right!`
` December 25th starts at 0:00 midnight.`
` Midnight is during the night, so that's the first night.`
` Then, morning comes, and when night falls again, it's still the same day until midnight!"`
`"Exactly.`
` And both of those nights are nights on Christmas Day."`
`"Eheheheheh.`
` Am I awesome? Am I awesome...?!"`
`With a delighted smile, Auntie Eva patted my head vigorously.`
`"Wahahaha!`
` Well done, Ange.`
` I tried to make it a hard question, but you solved it like it was nothing."`
`"Congratulations, Ange‐sama.`
` ......Here is a medal for getting the first question right."`
`Genji‐san held out a gold‐colored medal.`
`{n}Grandfather smiled at me, urging me to take it.`
`"Th‐thank you!"`
`"Keep up the pace.`
` Well now, that is all for my puzzle.`
` Head over there and ask whomever you choose for a quiz."`
`It was a heavy, gold‐colored medal.`
`If I get a lot of these right, my pocket might burst.`
`I'm gonna get so many that I can brag about it to everyone!`
`After bowing to Grandfather,`
` I hurried off with Auntie Eva to where everyone else was gathered.`
`As Ange ran off,`
` Kinzo watched her go with a warm gaze.`
`"Did I make it a bit too easy...?"`
`"No.`
` I think it was just right."`
`"............Genji.`
` Have I...managed to act the part of a good grandpa...?"`
`"Of course."`
`"Ange is young.`
` And, she frequently grows sick and is unable to come to Rokkenjima.`
` ......She probably won't...remember me well."`
`Young children have their own kind of cruelty.`
`They think of kindness as something they will naturally receive.`
`And because they think of kindness as only natural, ......they forget about it quickly.`
`".........It is no different from gratitude to one's parents.`
` It will probably take Ange‐sama many years before she understands."`
`"Do you think...`
`......that she will eventually remember that I was a fun grandpa?"`
`"......Yes.`
` I am certain of it."`
`"...................................."`
`Kinzo's expression grew slightly darker.`
`......Eventually, even Ange will get older, and she will probably hear how the public at large regards Ushiromiya Kinzo.`
`The Ushiromiya Kinzo known by the public is completely different from the Kinzo who plays with his grandchildren.`
`When she learns,`
` ......will Ange remember the face of Kinzo the tyrant, known of by the world, ...or that gently smiling face?`
`".........If possible, I would hope for her to remember my smile, ......but such a thing is probably too much to ask for."`
`"................................."`
`"There's no way around it.`
` That's what children are."`
`"Oh, it's you."`
`"Children just eat up kindness, and it never remains in their memories.`
` By the time twelve years have passed, she will surely learn what a bizarre eccentric Ushiromiya Kinzo was.`
` Your smile is fated to be painted over by that and forgotten."`
`".........Most probably.`
` No matter how much I spoil her, my love will not be rewarded."`
`"However,`
` just as it takes a long time to remember what you owe your parents,`
` ......Ange will surely remember someday.`
` ......She will remember the smiles you showed her."`
`"Hmph......`
` Let her forget.`
` One smile from her is the greatest parting gift I could ever take with me, when my time comes.`
` This is...the essence of unrewarded love."`
`"I guess grandfathers are always unrewarded."`
`"Oh, but I have been rewarded.`
` With Ange's smile just now to look back upon,`
` I could happily pass on in my sleep tonight.`
` Wahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha......"`
`With a lonely laugh, Kinzo spun around, setting his cloak fluttering.`
`This was all the love he could offer Ange as a grandfather.`
`Part of him wanted to be remembered, but he knew he mustn't wish for that.`
`That was...how unrewarded love worked.`
`After looking at Kinzo's back, Beato stared at Ange's back again.`
`"............Ange.`
` ......Even so, please remember it someday.`
` ......Remember the smile...that Kinzo once showed you."`
`Okay, whose quiz should I take next?`
`I'm gonna challenge more and more people, get more and more medals for getting them right, and get a wonderful present to show everyone.`
`Uncle Krauss and Auntie Natsuhi are over there.`
`They're looking this way and smiling.`
` I'm sure they've thought up some interesting puzzles.`
`There's Uncle Hideyoshi, beckoning for me to come over.`
`He's a fun uncle, so I'm sure he's thought up a fun question.`
`Behind him are Mom and Dad.`
`{n}They're waving at me, telling me to have lots of fun.`
`......Dad probably knows a lot of really hard questions.`
` He might be tough.`
`Over there is Auntie Rosa and Maria onee‐chan.`
`{n}It looks like they're reading a quiz book together, searching for a problem.`
`Every now and then, Maria onee‐chan glances over at me, saying "kihihihihi".`
`She can be mean sometimes, so I'm sure her puzzle won't be a nice one.`
`Beyond them are Battler onii‐chan, George onii‐chan, and Jessica onee‐chan.`
`......Battler onii‐chan is usually nice,`
` but he sometimes says really mean things, and I think he likes seeing me get confused.`
`......I get the feeling...`
`that he'll give me a really tough problem.`
`Is there anyone who looks like they won't be mean?`
`If I can, I'd like to start with some easy puzzles to warm me up.`
`All the way over there are Genji‐san and Doctor Nanjo.`
`{n}I don't think those two will be mean to me.`
`And then there's Shannon and Kanon.`
`Shannon knows about a lot of quizzes and fairy tales.`
` I'm sure she'll give me something unique.`
`Then, we have Gohda‐san and Kumasawa‐san, who are serving tea.`
`Kumasawa‐san might be tough.`
` ......I kinda think she'll give me a really confusing problem.`
`......It looks like everyone might be pretty tough.`
`{n}Hmmmmm.........`
`"Ange‐chan.`
` I've got a good one for ya...!`
` Over here!"`
`Uncle Hideyoshi is calling for me.`
`{n}......What should I do?`
` Should I go?`
`"Do you want to try Uncle Hideyoshi?"`
`"Yeah.`
` The order doesn't matter.`
` After all, I'm gonna challenge everyone."`
`I rolled up my sleeves and headed towards Uncle Hideyoshi.`
`"Wahahahahahaha, that's the way.`
` Mine's a tricky one, okay?"`
`"I wonder what sort of question you'll give her.`
` Don't make it too hard, okay?"`
`"It's okay if it's hard.`
` I'll solve it."`
`"Oooh, lookin' pretty confident there...!`
` Okay, here it comes!"`
`After clearing his throat, Uncle Hideyoshi started telling his question...`
`"Mine's a riddle.`
` Listen closely, now.`
` You know the story of {c:86EF9C:Momotarou}, right?"`
`"The boy who floated down a river in a peach?"`
`"That's right.`
` But you know, one day, an apple floated down that river."`
`"An apple??"`
`"Yep!`
` And the next day, a butternut squash floated down it!"`
`"I hate butternut squash."`
`"And then, the next day, a cabbage floated down it!`
` And the next day, a dill pickle did.`
` And the next day, an eggplant floated by.`
` And the day after that, a fig did!"`
`"*giggle*.`
` What a strange tale.`
` Did a greengrocer live upstream, or something?"`
`"Okay, here's the question.`
` What floated down the river the next day?!"`
`"Huh...?!"`
`"I've got it.`
` Do you get it, Ange‐chan?"`
`"I don't get it."`
`"Then I'll give you a hint.`
` There's an order to the things that float down the river.`
` Can you guess what order they're in?"`
`"Wahahahaha!`
` What a huge hint...!"`
`".........I don't...have a clue!"`
`"Wahhahahahahahahaha.`
` Guess that was a bit too hard...!"`
`"I know what floated down the river the day after that.`
` A hassaku orange, right?"`
`"Yep.`
` And the day after that, it was probably an i.........i...hmmm...`
` ......I can't think of a veggie that starts with "i"!"`
`I don't really get it.`
` Hmm... oh well.`
`"I know!`
` It's a grapefruit!"`
`"That's right.`
` It wasn't one of the choices, but green beans would have worked too."`
`The names all followed the alphabet.`
` Apple was "a".`
` Butternut squash was "b".`
` Cabbage was "c".`
`It kept going with "d", "e", and "f".`
`So, after "f" comes "g".`
` That's why the answer had to be something that started with "g".`
`"Thanks, Auntie Eva. I got it right thanks to your hint!"`
`"*giggle*.`
` You solved it by yourself, Ange‐chan.`
` Incredible."`
`"Yep, nice work!`
` Now, here's your medal for gettin' it right...!"`
`Hideyoshi took out a gold‐colored medal and placed it on my palm.`
`It felt heavy in my hand.`
` Yeah, this is what victory feels like.`
`I'd better keep it up!`
`"I've actually got one more medal here, I guess for me to give in place of Eva.`
` But I can't think of any more problems."`
`"Then maybe I should give Ange‐chan a puzzle."`
`"Huh?`
` You will?"`
`"Sure.`
` A quiz for the princess from her attendant{p:0:♪}`
` I've thought of a fun one, so please, have a go at it!"`
`Auntie Eva smiled brightly.`
`I want to get as many medals as possible, so of course, I want as many chances as I can get.`
`"Okay, I'll have a go at it."`
`"*giggle*. That's the spirit.`
` Okay, here it comes."`
`"We've talked about how I love to travel, haven't we?"`
`"Yeah.`
` You said you like traveling overseas a lot."`
`"That's right.`
` So this will be a puzzle about traveling.`
` There was a traveler in a certain place."`
`"A traveler?"`
`"First, the traveler walked five kilometers north."`
`"......Should I write this down on a piece of paper?"`
`"Don't worry.`
` The puzzle isn't that hard, so listening to it will be enough."`
`"The traveler first walked five kilometers north.`
` Then, he walked five kilometers to the east.`
` Then, he walked five kilometers to the south."`
`"............Five kilometers north.`
` Five kilometers east.`
` Five kilometers south.`
` ......You mean, like a blocky "n"?"`
`"That's right!`
` You work it out, and he's in a spot five kilometers to the east of where he started."`
`"That should be the case, right?`
` But, incredibly, this traveler ended up in the exact same spot he started.`
` ......Is something so mysterious possible?"`
`"Wahaha, there's no way!`
` His compass must've gone crazy."`
`"Of course it didn't!`
` Eheheheheh, do you know, Ange‐chan?"`
`"It wasn't because of his compass?`
` ......Is this a play on words?"`
`"No, this is a real quiz.`
` For a hint, why don't you try thinking about a globe?"`
`"............I don't get it."`
`I've never traveled overseas at all.`
`There might be some strange place in the world where you could walk in a blocky "n" and get back to where you started.`
`......Like the Bermuda Triangle, or something...`
`"Hmmm......`
` I guess that was a bit too hard for you, Ange‐chan."`
`"If you went north, then east, then south, there's no way you'd get back to where you started."`
`"But there is a place.`
` A place somewhere on the Earth's surface.`
` If you have a globe in your house, take a good look at it and think carefully.`
` If you just can't figure it out, try asking your dad, okay?"`
`"Okay, I'll ask him.`
` So tell me the right answer...!"`
`"*giggle*.`
` The right answer is a ve~ry cold place.`
` Where can you find cold places on a globe?`
` Think about it carefully.`
` Once you figure it out, you can try giving this quiz to the other kids in your class.`
` I'm sure they'll all be surprised."`
`Where can you find a cold place?`
` ......Hokkaido?`
`I don't think you end up at the start if you go north, east, then south in Hokkaido.`
`......Nnnngh.`
` I don't get it.`
` I give up.`
`"Okay, that's all for our puzzles!`
` Go ask one of the others to give you one!"`
`"Let's go!`
` Who should we challenge next?!"`
`If Auntie Eva knows puzzles this hard, I'm sure she must be good at quizzes.`
`If she's with me, I know we'll get lots and lots of medals.`
`Who will I ask next...?!`
`"I got it...!`
` It's a really cold place!`
` Yeah, it must be super cold there!"`
`"Perfect!`
` Ange‐chan, you must really be a genius, to get something like that at your age."`
`"If you start at the south pole, then after you go north, going east just draws a circle around the south pole.`
` So, anytime you go south again, that just takes you right back to the south pole."`
`"I tried to make it an extra hard puzzle,`
` but Ange‐chan was just too good."`
`"Congrats!`
` Here's another medal for ya."`
`I got a heavy, gold‐colored medal.`
`All right, I did it...!`
` Auntie Eva and I held up our fists in celebration.`
`"Okay, that's all for our puzzles!`
` Go ask one of the others to give you one!"`
`"Okay! Thank you, Uncle Hideyoshi...!"`
`"Your auntie's really clever...!`
` ......With the two of you together, you'll be gettin' medals right and left!"`
`"Yep, that's right!"`
`"Yeah.`
` Let's do our best together, Auntie Eva."`
`I dashed away.`
`{n}Who will I ask next...?!`
`Uncle Hideyoshi waved goodbye, smiling......`
`Hideyoshi and Eva watched as Ange ran off happily,`
` looking for the next quiz.`
`".........That kid can wear such a cute smile,`
` ......and I......will be the one who takes it away from her..."`
`"Eva..............."`
`Eva hung her head.`
` A single tear sparkled in her eye...`
`"Her reaction was only natural, considering how she felt.`
` ......But I...wasn't able to see past it and accept her feelings......"`
`"It can't be helped.`
` You're as human as anyone else.`
` It's not easy to put your emotions aside."`
`"Even so, it was my fault...!`
` After all, I already had the experience of bringing up a child, right?!`
` .........I should have become her mother.`
` ......And yet, I let sadness overwhelm me, ......and I didn't do it at all..."`
`"It can't be helped, I tell you...!`
` Don't think you were the only one at fault...!`
` You shouldn't blame yourself so much!"`
`By now, Eva was unable to hold back her sobs...`
`{n}Large tears dripped down her cheeks as she stared at the ground and shook...`
`"What a sin I've committed......`
` .........My sadness was no greater than hers...!`
` And yet, I decided that I was suffering the most, ......so I didn't accept her feelings......`
` .........I'm a failure of a mother...`
` I wasn't able.........to become a mother for her........."`
`"That's wrong.`
` ......You did your best for her, Eva nee‐san."`
`"Kyrie‐san..."`
`Kyrie and Rudolf were standing behind Eva now.`
`"I know how hard you tried to get along with Ange."`
`"......You held out well, Aneki.`
` Guess that daughter of ours really has been a pain, clueless about how much you suffered."`
`After the accident on Rokkenjima...`
`...Eva, the only person to leave Rokkenjima alive, adopted Ange, the girl who had survived the day through her absence.`
`......While they would eventually develop a sad and mutually painful relationship,`
` it wasn't like that at first.`
`As Ange's new mother and last remaining blood relative, Eva tried to shower her with love and affection.`
` Even as she fought back the sadness she herself felt.`
`However, Ange wasn't able to accept that kindness.`
`{n}She lashed out at Eva, the only one who had returned alive, and accused her of stealing her parents away from her.`
`......Eva, understanding the wounds that this little six‐year‐old girl bore, withstood these attacks.`
`{n}She grit her teeth and gave Ange her unconditional love.`
`However, .........the wounds that Eva herself bore were also extremely deep.`
`She was never rewarded for her sad efforts,`
` ............and the future that followed was a sorrowful one.`
`"You tried to show Ange the same affection you once showed George‐kun."`
`"But in the end, ......that was just for my own satisfaction...... Ange‐chan never felt any of it..."`
`"Ange was the one who couldn't accept it.`
` It isn't your fault."`
`"But who could possibly ask that of Ange‐chan when she was just six years old...?!`
` I should've held out much, much longer, until she could understand my feelings...!"`
`"Eva nee‐san.`
` If nothing else, trust me when I say this..."`
`"..........................."`
`"We......don't blame you in the slightest."`
`"......Kyrie‐san..............."`
`"Thank you so much for suffering so long for Ange's sake......`
` .........If that kid has a human heart, then I'm sure she'll recognize the affection you showed her someday."`
`"Thank you, Aneki.`
` We'll always be grateful......"`
`"............Isn't that wonderful, Eva......?`
` ......All of your efforts......have been witnessed......"`
`"Uuuhghuu......uuuuuhhghuu........."`
`"How are you doing, Ange‐sama?`
` If you wish, I, Gohda, would be pleased to challenge you."`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho.`
` And I, Kumasawa, have a ve~ry tricky puzzle for you."`
`"It doesn't matter how hard it is.`
` I'm not alone.`
` I'll solve it with Auntie Eva!"`
`Gohda and Kumasawa offered to challenge me.`
`{n}I'll have to go up against everyone in the end, so it doesn't matter who comes next.`
`I waved at Auntie Eva to hurry up,`
` and she ran toward me.`
`"So, we're challenging this pair next?`
` Who will we start with?"`
`"Okay...Gohda‐san."`
`"Very well, as you wish.`
` Here is my puzzle."`
`"Hohhohohoho.`
` I'll warn you, it's a toughie."`
`"I'll still solve it.`
` I've gotten the knack of it."`
`"You'd better not underestimate Ange‐chan.`
` Right?!"`
`"Right!"`
`"My, my.`
` ...Well then, being the humble chef that I am, here is a puzzle about food and the kitchen."`
`"We'll fight together this time.`
` If you don't get it, just ask me to lend a hand.`
` I'll give you a hint."`
`"......If I get a hint, does that mean I don't get a medal?"`
`"It won't affect your medals at all, so feel free to ask away!"`
`"I've got it.`
` The hint here...is that the witch got home much later than usual."`
`"......What happens when she gets home later than usual?"`
`"Think carefully.`
` The food is always freshly made at the usual time, right?`
` So, ......what happens when she gets home long after that?"`
`".........I don't get it.`
` Food isn't supposed to talk."`
`"Well, uh, that's because this is a fairy tale puzzle......"`
`"Hohhohohohohoho...`
` It looks as though she didn't figure it out."`
`The answer I'd chosen at random was wrong, apparently.`
` ......Too bad.`
`"Okay, tell me the right answer.`
` You figured it out, right, Auntie Eva?`
` Tell me!"`
`"Alright.`
` The answer is—"`
`"Eva‐sama, if you wouldn't mind...!`
` They say recipes and riddle answers are best while they remain secret."`
`"You think so...?`
` Eheheh, I'll have to tell her sometime later when you aren't around, then."`
`"Yeah, it's a promise!"`
`But even if I hear the answer later on, I still got it wrong.`
`Oh well.`
` I'd better pull myself together and take a shot at Kumasawa‐san's puzzle.`
`"The ice cream!`
` The witch got back really late, so the ice cream would've melted.`
` So she couldn't eat it!"`
`"Nicely done!`
` See?`
` Ange‐chan is a clever girl, isn't she?"`
`"Congratulations, Ange‐sama!`
` Very impressive.`
` How quickly you saw through the puzzle that I, Gohda, put all my efforts into...!"`
`"It was totally easy.`
` Auntie Eva's puzzle was harder."`
`"*giggle*, thanks."`
`"Congratulations.`
` This medal is your prize for answering my question correctly."`
`"Thank you!"`
`Alright, that was easy.`
`{n}Now let's take a shot at Kumasawa‐san's puzzle.`
`"Looks like I'm up next.`
` Now, let's test Ange‐sama with my specially‐made, super‐hard puzzle.`
` Are you ready?"`
`"It's hard?`
` How hard?"`
`"Hohhohohohohoho.`
` You'll have to wait and see.`
` And now, let the mackerel dessert puzzle begin."`
`"Mackerel dessert...?"`
`"This is Kumasawa‐san we're talking about, so you can bet it'll be a strange one.`
` Be careful."`
`"Okay!"`
`"Auntie Eva, do you get it?"`
`"She says you have to change one letter, so the answer's probably some sort of word game.`
` We have to change one letter in "sabara" and see if we can make it into a des—`
`ah, I've got it!"`
`"Huh?!`
` What is it? What is it?!"`
`"Try using each of the letters in place of the "b".`
` In fact, that pretty much gives you the answer."`
`"Bzzzzt.`
` Wronnng."`
`"Huh?!`
` I don't get it!`
` I don't get it at all...!"`
`"Hohhohohoho, sorry, but wrong is wrong.`
` Perhaps it was a bit too hard for you, Ange‐sama."`
`"Come on, Kumasawa‐san.`
` That was a nasty puzzle..."`
`"It doesn't make sense!`
` There's no way you could make a dessert out of mackerel!`
` What's the answer?`
` Tell me!"`
`"Hohohoho, it's no fun if I tell you.`
` If you don't guess it quick, ......then you really will be having mackerel for dessert.`
` Ihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi......"`
`"Tell me, tell me!"`
`"Nope."`
`Kumasawa smiled cheerily, but remained stubborn.`
`{n}No matter how much I bother her, she probably won't tell me the answer.`
`"That concludes our puzzles.`
` There are probably others waiting for you to challenge them, Ange‐sama.`
` Please, on to the next challenge."`
`"We're both rooting for you, Ange‐sama."`
`"Okay!`
` I'll keep on trying hard and getting more and more medals!"`
`"That's the spirit. Don't let it get you down.`
` Plenty more chances left!"`
`We rushed away.`
`{n}Okay, who should we take on next...?!`
`"I got it!`
` The new letter is "h"!`
` If you change the "b" in Sabara to an "h", you get Sahara!"`
`"Hohhohohohoho,`
` that's correct."`
`"The Sahara is a desert,`
` and the last line said you could make a great "desert" out of sabara!"`
`"I figured out a trick in Japanese and English!`
` Am I awesome? Am I awesome?!"`
`"You're so smart, Ange‐chan!`
` You deserve a pat on the head...!"`
`"Nnnn.`
` I like it when you do that."`
`"Just change a single letter, and even mackerel can make a fine desert.`
` Are you starting to see how omnipotent mackerel is?"`
`"The day I'm forced to serve a joke like that for dessert, I imagine heads will roll......"`
`"I wouldn't like it either.`
` I like ice cream for dessert."`
`"Ahahahahahaha, of course.`
` By the way, we shouldn't be worried, should we?`
` What about tonight's dessert?"`
`"Ohohohohoho......`
` I can hardly wait to surprise everyone with the mackerel fruit parfait waiting there in the kitchen!"`
`"Nooooooo!!"`
`Everyone burst out laughing.`
`For some time after that, I was tormented by the terrifying image of a parfait neatly topped with mackerel bits...`
`"What a shame......`
` I tried so hard to stop you from getting that prize, but you solved my best riddle like it was nothing."`
`Though she said that, Kumasawa smiled.`
`{n}A gold‐colored medal glittered in her wrinkly hand.`
`Ange took it.`
`"Well then, that's all for our puzzles."`
`"Please keep up the pace, get more and more medals, and win that splendid prize from the Master!"`
`"Okay! Thank you.`
` I'm going to think even harder next time...!`
` We did it, Auntie Eva!"`
`"Eheheh!`
` Let's keep it up!"`
`We rushed away.`
`{n}Okay, who should we take on next...?!`
`"It seems that all of a sudden, the tiny girl who used to hide and tremble in Kyrie‐sama's shadow...`
`has grown to be so bright and cheery..."`
`"......With each passing family conference, one can feel the growth of those youngsters.`
` After just a few years more, Ange‐sama will surely learn of love, of makeup,`
` and will eventually grow to become a true lady."`
`"Very true......`
` If she grows normally with the passing time, that is..."`
`A cruel fate...`
`...forces the chick called Ange into a lonely future.`
`If an egg isn't warmed, it won't hatch.`
`{n}The egg she is now will not be warmed by anyone, and neither will it hatch...`
`"Inside that frozen egg,`
` will Ange‐sama have no choice but to face that isolated future...?"`
`"......An egg's shell can always be broken from the inside.`
` ......Even if a cold shell is very, very hard, that doesn't mean it cannot be broken."`
`"Does Ange‐sama have the strength to do that?"`
`"Is she capable of achieving that or not...?`
` I hear that question is what this final game is all about."`
`"Perhaps we should have sent her a clearer message.`
` ......If the egg cannot be warmed, could we not at least strike it from the outside to make it easier to crack?"`
`"If a chick too powerless to even break its own shell is forced outside of the egg,`
` it won't be able to withstand the cold winds.`
` Ange‐sama will have to find that power and resilience herself."`
`"......I understand that she needs power and resilience,`
` but can we not somehow explain it to her?"`
`"Words cannot be given. They can only be accepted.`
` ......No matter what we try to give Ange‐sama, it will be meaningless unless she accepts it."`
`"............You are right.`
` No matter what we try to tell Ange‐sama, it won't matter unless she listens."`
`"Hohohoho......`
` We can do nothing but watch over her.`
` You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink."`
`"Ange‐sama must choose a better future for herself.`
` ......We can only pray that she does."`
`"If Ange‐sama does not abandon herself to anger for the sole purpose of distracting herself from her resignation and sadness,`
` ......if she can just be honest about that one, single wish that she truly desires more than anything else,`
` then you can be certain that she will make her greatest wish come true."`
`"It is ironic.`
` ......Since the very beginning, she has been denying that greatest wish of hers herself."`
`"Laughter brings happiness.`
` Tears bring misfortune.`
` Those who believe will be saved.`
` ......People have the power to create their own futures by the strength of their emotions."`
`"I wish we could just let her hear those words......"`
`"Battler‐sama is very strict.`
` ......He's hoping that Ange‐sama will realize it by her own power alone...and is not permitting even words of this nature to be told to her."`
`".........It seems we can do nothing but watch over her."`
`"And so, let us pray, at least.`
` Pray that she grasps the world she desires most with her own hands."`
`"Oh, have you selected me?"`
`"Yeah.`
` I'll have to face everyone sooner or later.`
` Right, Auntie Eva?!"`
`"Right!`
` Come on, let's have a puzzle.`
` We'll solve it in a flash!"`
`"Hahahaha.`
` I see, I see.`
` Then it seems I must make it a good one."`
`"Genji.`
` You should give her one as well.`
` A tough one."`
`"As you wish.`
` ......In that case, a tough one it shall be..."`
`Whoa.`
`I'd been thinking that Genji‐san would give me a simple puzzle, but now he's saying it'll be tough.`
` Scary.`
`But I'll have to beat him at some point.`
` I can't let myself get scared.`
`"Then let us start with mine.`
` I am a doctor,`
` so how about an ambulance puzzle?"`
`"The ??? is a number?`
` But "emergency" is a word.`
` You can't add a number to a word, right?"`
`"That part sounds like some kind of pun.`
` "Kyuu" means "nine", so "Kyuu, kyuu" makes you think "nine, nine", right?"`
`"So, if you add "???" to 99, you get an ambulance?"`
`"Hmm. Why does some number added to 99 get you an ambulance?`
` ............Ah, I've got it!"`
`"Huh, really?!`
` Hey, what is it?!"`
`"I'll give you a hint.`
` The "different kind of vehicle with a red flashing light" is a police car.`
` *giggle*, you're starting to get it now, aren't you?"`
`"Huh? ......Nnnnn......`
`......I don't get it..."`
`"Oh, are you having trouble?`
` I thought it was an easy puzzle."`
`It's a bit annoying to hear that about a puzzle I don't get.`
`Still, no matter how annoyed I get, I still don't have a clue what the answer is.`
`"Aw, so close.`
` I thought you'd made it pretty far too..."`
`Apparently, Auntie Eva knows the answer.`
` She looked disappointed that I hadn't figured it out too.`
`".........Mmmmmhh...`
` Ah, yes, I have it!`
` If you subtract two from an ambulance, then add on 60, you can even learn the weather."`
`"Well done, Kinzo‐san.`
` It seems I must hand this medal over to you."`
`"Wahahahahahaha.`
` Sorry, Ange.`
` This medal's all mine."`
`".........F‐fine, see if I care."`
`The gold medal passed from Nanjo to Kinzo.`
`That medal was supposed to be mine......`
` It's no use regretting it now.`
`If you subtract two from and add 60 to an ambulance...?`
` How would that tell you the weather...??`
`"Hmm, what was the number for the weather forecasting service again?"`
`"............???"`
`Yeah, I don't have a clue.`
`{n}I'll just have to pick myself up and have a go at Genji's puzzle.`
`"20!`
` "Kyuu‐kyuu" sounds like "99", and if you add 20 to 99, you get 119.`
` That's the emergency number for ambulances!"`
`"And if you subtract 20 from 130, you get 110.`
` That's the emergency number for calling the police."{n}{i:(Add 20 to 99 and write it in reverse to get 911, the US number for both.)}`
`"Splendid! That is correct.`
` I knew you were a quick thinker, Ange‐san."`
`"Oooooooh, well done, Angeeeeeeee!`
` What a clever granddaughter I have!"`
`"Congratulations.`
` This medal belongs to you."`
`At any rate, the gold medal glittering in Nanjo's hand is now mine.`
`Okay, now I'll defeat Genji too and get another one.`
`"Yes, that's the spirit.`
` Let's keep on solving them!"`
`"Your turn, Genji‐san."`
`"My friend here doesn't speak much, but his knowledge is quite extensive.`
` Even I cannot wait to see what sort of puzzle he whips up."`
`"Now then, Ange‐sama.`
` Prepare yourself.`
` The puzzle starts now."`
`......I've never heard anyone say "prepare yourself" like that when giving a quiz.`
`I started to get so tense that my stomach began to hurt...`
`"It'll be okay.`
` Hang in there!"`
`Auntie Eva gripped my hand firmly, and my stomachache got a little better.`
`"......Ange‐sama, have you learned division?"`
`"Y‐yeah.`
` I learned it in cram school."`
`"Incredible, a six‐year‐old who knows division?"`
`"Then there should be no problems.`
` Here it comes."`
`This is bad...`
` I did learn division, but I'm not very good at it......`
`"Half of its remaining length burns away each hour, right...?`
` After the first hour, it's burned down to half of {nobr:5 cm}.`
` During the next hour, it burns down to half of that.`
` And during the third hour, it burns down to half of that again......"`
`"......I can't really do it without a calculator.`
` Do you know the answer, Auntie Eva?"`
`"Ah, ......I've got it.`
` *giggle*, this is a pretty mean puzzle."`
`"Why is it mean?"`
`"This has nothing to do with division.`
` Read through the puzzle again carefully."`
`......Umm,`
` ......what was it, again......?`
`"My sincere apologies, but that is incorrect."`
`"Huh?!`
` Why?!`
` I know I did the math right...!"`
`"You see, ...there's no need for math in this puzzle.`
` Yep, he tricked us good this time..."`
`"Wahhahahahahahaha.`
` Too bad, Ange.`
` Did you get it, Nanjo?"`
`"Yes, of course.`
` Division is unnecessary.`
` This was an easy puzzle, one that even Ange‐san could have solved."`
`Not only Auntie Eva, but everyone else said that math wasn't needed.`
`And I worked so hard on that division......`
`"That is all for my puzzle.`
` I believe several others are waiting for you to challenge them, Ange‐sama.`
` Perhaps you ought to search for the next challenge."`
`"Good luck, Ange‐san.`
` I am rooting for you."`
`"That's right.`
` This is no time to get down!`
` Now's our chance to turn things around."`
`"Yeah!`
` I'll try even harder and get lots of medals!"`
`We dashed away.`
`There are still many people waiting to give me puzzles.`
` I have tons of chances to get medals.`
`Okay, who should I challenge next...?!`
`"......After one hour, {nobr:5 cm} becomes {nobr:2.5 cm},`
` ...and in the next hour, that becomes {nobr:1.25 cm},`
` ...and in the next hour, that becomes {nobr:0.625 cm}......"`
`"..........................."`
`"Ange‐chan.`
` You don't need to use math.`
` Make sure you remember the problem clearly...`
` How long......is the candle when the flame goes out...?"`
`"Ah!`
` That was a close one...!`
` The candle goes out when it's {nobr:1 cm} long, so the rest doesn't matter!"`
`The flame on this candle dies when the candle is {nobr:1 cm} in length.`
`{n}In other words, it can never get shorter than {nobr:1 cm}.`
`So the right answer is the fifth choice, "About {nobr:10 mm}"...!`
`"That's right...!"`
`"You are correct."`
`"Oooh, splendidly done, Ange!`
` How clever of you, not to be misled!"`
`"I didn't even need division.`
` I almost got tricked...!"`
`"You were pretty mean there, Genji‐san.`
` You even asked her if she could do division.`
` That was a trap, right?"`
`"Correct.`
` My humble apologies."`
`"Hahhahahahaha.`
` After all, Genji‐san is the sort who can trick you without changing his expression in the slightest."`
`"Congratulations, Ange‐sama.`
` This medal is proof that you have correctly solved my puzzle."`
`"Thanks!`
` Eheheh, I got another medal, Auntie Eva...!"`
`"Heheh, nice going!"`
`"I'll get lots more.`
` I'll get a ton, and then Grandfather will give me a great prize!"`
`"Mm.`
` Give it all you've got, my granddaughter...!"`
`"Good luck, Ange‐san.`
` I am rooting for you."`
`"There must be others waiting for you.`
` Perhaps you ought to search for the next challenge."`
`"Okay! Thank you.`
` I'll try even harder now...!"`
`We dashed away.`
`There are still many people waiting to give me puzzles.`
` I have tons of chances to get medals.`
`Okay, who should I challenge next...?!`
`After Ange and Eva left,`
` ......Battler, who had been watching their progress, came over.`
`"How is Ange doing?"`
`"Oh, Battler.`
` I am not certain of her progress, but she does seem to be enjoying herself."`
`"I heard your puzzle, Genji‐san.`
` Even I was almost taken in back there."`
`"You honor me."`
`"Still, it's not quite what I'd have expected.`
` Who'd have thought that you'd give a trick question like that?`
` I figured you'd make a straightforward, simple puzzle."`
`"Hahahahahahaha.`
` You might expect such a thing from him, silent as he is,`
` ......but he is much more of a schemer than he appears."`
`"Very true.`
` If you play a chess match against him, you'll see that right away."`
`"He even fools me, from time to time.`
` He'll trick me right to my face, with that stern, serious expression of his.`
` He has always been like that.`
` And yet, despite the numerous occasions on which he has fooled me in the past, I keep on getting tricked.`
` Wah{0}hah{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha."`
`"Come to think of it,`
` .........what sort of relationship do you and Genji‐san have?"`
`For just an instant, Kinzo glanced at Genji's face.`
`Apparently, he didn't plan on touching on this subject if Genji had any objections.`
`However, Genji began to answer the question himself, as though the matter was no longer deserving of secrecy.`
`"......I knew the Master once...in Taiwan."`
`"Wahaha, "knew me", he says...!`
` We were partners in crime, you might say!`
` The two of us were both prodigal sons of rich families.`
` A pair of ruffians who caused their parents nothing but trouble."`
`"Genji‐san, a prodigal son...?`
` That's a surprise......`
` So, Genji‐san, you also moved to Taiwan and met Grandfather there?"`
`"...............No.`
` I am a native of Taiwan."`
`"Genji‐san was born in Taiwan.`
` .........Well, since Taiwan was under Japanese rule before the war, he is still Japanese, of course."`
`"He was a man who hated losing.`
` When we first met, we fought all the time.`
` Once we hit it off, we became the best of friends."`
`"......There was a lot of disorder and conflict after the war.`
` The Master is the one who saved me during that chaotic period.`
` ......If I spent the rest of my life trying to repay that debt, it would not be enough to pay it back in full."`
`".........Don't say that, my friend.`
` ......If only I had been a little more persuasive, I might have saved your family as well...`
` I was too feckless to save anyone but you..."`
`I don't know much about the details of Taiwan's history,`
` but apparently, there was still a lot of chaos there even after the war ended and Japan pulled out.`
`Kinzo, predicting this chaos before it happened,`
` worked out a way for Genji and his family to escape.`
`However, Genji's family possessed great wealth in Taiwan.`
` They were unable to abandon it, and they decided to remain there.`
`This wealth had been built up thanks to their close relationship with the Japanese‐run government of Taiwan.`
`The new regime after the war wasn't likely to welcome them with open arms.`
`Much mayhem and confusion followed.`
` And Genji was the only one who escaped harm.`
`......I don't know what happened to make this man, referred to by Kinzo as a troublesome prodigal son,`
` change so drastically to become the person he is today.`
`That is a story of friendship between the two of them,`
` ......and there could be hardly any point in an unrelated person sifting through history books to argue for their personal interpretation.`
`They had been good friends since long ago, and they owed each other their lives.`
` Though the troubled times had tossed them about, their friendship held firm for decades...`
`Genji's role was now that of the butler,`
` ......but when the two of them were alone in the study, they sometimes shared a drink and reminisced about the days of their youth.`
`......And they're still that way today.`
`Leaving Kinzo and Genji to reminisce, Battler walked off on his own.`
`It would be rude to ask for any more detail, and there was no need to know.`
`Kinzo and Genji had been friends since long, long ago.`
`{n}That information was nothing new.`
`"What do you think?`
` Do you want to challenge Auntie Natsuhi and Uncle Krauss next?"`
`"Yeah.`
` Let's beat them!"`
`"Hahahaha. Very well, we'll play along."`
`"The two of us have prepared some formidable puzzles for you."`
`"Should I go first?`
` Or you?"`
`"I will start."`
`"Very well."`
`"Listen closely to what I'm about to say.`
` White black white black white ? black white black white black white."`
`"Huh?`
` White black white black......huh??"`
`"I'll say it once more.`
` White black white black white ? black white black white black white.`
` ......What does the question mark stand for?"`
`This is......a really hard one.`
`White black white black white ? black white black white black white.`
`It looks like the white and black are alternating, but the question mark is between a white and a black.`
`Is it......gray??`
` Is it that easy...?`
`"Th‐...this is a surprisingly hard one, coming from you, Natsuhi nee‐san......"`
`Auntie Eva was groaning.`
` Apparently, this one's really hard.`
`"I‐is it really so hard...?"`
`"......There's a chance that some people won't understand, if they haven't had the right experiences."`
`"Eva‐san aside, I think Ange‐chan would have seen it a lot at school and kindergarten......"`
`"Wh‐what? Are you saying I'll never get this one?"`
`Is it a problem that I could get easier than Auntie Eva......?`
`......It's hard.`
`"The hint for this one is probably what Natsuhi nee‐san said, about something you might see in a school or kindergarten.`
` ......Do you know what it is, Ange‐chan?"`
`"No, I'm stuck."`
`"See, even Ange‐chan says she's stuck!`
` Give her at least a little hint."`
`"I, I see.`
` Then, a hint......`
` White black white black... They may be different colors, but you get a beautiful sound no matter which you push."`
`"A beautiful sound......?`
` Are these black and white things something that make sounds?"`
`"Black and white things that make a sound when you push them......?"`
`"............I don't get it."`
`"I give up too.`
` ......It seems even you know some pretty hard puzzles, Natsuhi nee‐san."`
`"Hahahaha.`
` It's the sort of puzzle that brings out one's upbringing.`
` Perhaps it was a bit too hard for you."`
`"Wh‐what did you saaaaaaay...?!"`
`"......Auntie Natsuhi.`
` Could you tell me the answer?"`
`"The answer is...a keyboard."`
`"A keyboard?`
` Like on a piano?"`
`"That's right.`
` The blacks and whites are the pattern of colors on a keyboard.`
` In which case, you must already know the right answer."`
`Auntie Natsuhi smiled at me, but I don't really remember what a keyboard looks like.`
`......Aw, too bad.`
`I'd better have a go at Uncle Krauss's puzzle and redeem myself.`
`"Ready?`
` It's Nii‐san's turn now.`
` We'll solve it in a flash and teach him a lesson, okay?"`
`"That black and white thing, ......it's a keyboard!`
` Like a piano!"`
`"Ah, ......is that it?!`
` It's a keyboard?!"`
`Something that can be found in kindergartens and schools, which is covered with a line of white and black things.`
`It's an instrument.`
`{n}Like a keyboard on a piano or a melodica.`
`"The first two black keys are between "do", "re", and "mi".`
` The set of three black keys are between "fa", "so", "la", and "ti"......"`
`"It started "white black white black white ? black", so......the three white ones are "do", "re", and "mi"......"`
`"There is no black key between "mi" and "fa".`
` So, "fa" comes right after "mi"!"`
`"And since the question mark comes after "mi", the right answer is "fa".`
` ......In other words—"`
`""The right answer is white!""`
`"Correct.`
` I thought it might have been a bit too hard, but you did well."`
`"Splendidly done, you two.`
` Go ahead, Natsuhi."`
`"Congratulations, Ange‐chan.`
` Here's my medal for you."`
`"Alright!`
` Auntie Eva, I got another one!"`
`"Things are moving along nicely.`
` Next up is Nii‐san's puzzle.`
` Let's solve it in a flash and teach him a lesson, okay?"`
`"How interesting.`
` Looks like it's time you were taught a lesson."`
`"Stop it, Auntie Eva! Don't provoke him!`
` You'll make the puzzle harder!"`
`"Heheheheheheh.`
` If there's anyone you have to blame, it's Eva!`
` Now take this brain‐twister!`
` Here's a puzzle about the tenants of a skyscraper I've invested in."`
`"I don't know anything about this skyscraper,`
` so there's no way I could know......"`
`I know what's on floors 1, 2, and 14, so the answer must be one of the other floors.`
` There's no doubt about that.`
`"Heheheheh.`
` Do you give up?"`
`"I, I won't give up, kiii!!`
` So Murakoshi Publishing Co., Ltd. is definitely on some floor?!"`
`"Some floor, yes.`
` But not the somethingth floor."`
`"What's the difference...?"`
`"......Ah.`
` ................................."`
`Auntie Eva suddenly stumbled on something.`
`{n}Then, she started counting on her fingers, starting from the first floor......`
`"I've got it, Ange‐chan...!`
` Try saying them aloud, starting from "the first floor"...!`
` There's only one that fits the question!"`
`"Huh?`
` Wh‐what do you mean......?"`
`".........I don't get it."`
`"It isn't on "the somethingth floor", but it is on "some floor". That's the trick."`
`"That's right.`
` Though, in a way, the answer is right there in the question."`
`"What do you mean...?"`
`"For example, let's take the fourteenth floor.`
` "The "fourteenth floor" is the "somethingth floor", right?`
` But "the first floor" isn't the "somethingth floor"... you wouldn't call it "the firTH floor"."`
`"Precisely.`
` And with the first and second floors ruled out, there's only one other that doesn't end in "th"."`
`"A‐......ah........."`
`By this point, even I had figured out the answer.`
`If only I'd paid a bit more attention to the way Uncle Krauss said the question......`
`"Hahahahahahaha.`
` Too bad.`
` Looks like I'll be keeping this medal."`
`"The third floor!"`
`"Mgh..."`
`"Well done, you got it...!`
` Ignoring the first two floors, the only floor that doesn't end in "th" is the third."`
`"Yeah!`
` "The third floor" fits, but all the other ones after that are the "somethingth" floor."`
`"N‐......nicely done...`
` And even I didn't figure it out until I had the answer given to me......"`
`Apparently, Uncle Krauss once had this puzzle shown to him, and he wasn't able to answer it right.`
`He looks a bit bitter that a kid like me was able to solve it.`
`......I think what's really frustrating him is Auntie Eva solving it, not me.`
` Weird.`
`"Come on, now.`
` Let's see that medal."`
`"This medal is a mark of Ange‐chan's intelligence.`
` It's not for you, Eva."`
`"Heh, sore loser...!"`
`"Thank you, Uncle Krauss.`
` Am I awesome? Am I awesome?!"`
`"Very much so.`
` You're a more flexible thinker than your uncle.`
` I am proud to have you as a niece."`
`"That's all for our puzzles."`
`"I do hope you enjoyed them."`
`"I did!`
` Thank you, Auntie Natsuhi and Uncle Krauss!"`
`"I hope you can enjoy all the tricky and interesting questions without worrying about your medal count too much."`
`"We all hope that this becomes a wonderful night, just for you."`
`"We really are enjoying ourselves."`
`"Yeah!`
` We're having a lot of fun!"`
`Krauss and Natsuhi smiled at them as they dashed away.`
`"Oh, it's you, Natsuhi.`
` How did your puzzles go?"`
`"We selected our questions as carefully as we could,`
` ......but I'm not sure how much they enjoyed them."`
`On the other side of the room, Ange and Eva were counting the medals they had gathered so far.`
`Ange and Eva.`
` ......Such an unexpected pairing, but they looked like they were having a great time.`
`"......A future parent and child, unrelated by blood.`
` Watching them like this, they look just like a normal parent and child."`
`"Yes, they do.`
` .........Bonds between people are nurtured by the heart.`
` Ties of blood do not bond as strongly."`
`After saying this,`
` ......Natsuhi bit back her own words and stared at the floor.`
`"What's wrong?"`
`".........I was just...surprised that I would dare to say such words......"`
`"........................`
` ......You don't need to worry about me."`
`"Because I rejected you, ......you met a painful fate in so many worlds...`
` ......All of that is my responsibility..."`
`"I understand how you felt.`
` ......Unable to become pregnant, you were forced to feel shame for many years.`
` In that situation, any woman would be shocked if they were handed a baby whose parentage they didn't even know, ...and then told to adopt them."`
`"......That was no reason...`
`...for me to push you off a cliff..."`
`"True.`
` You will have to carry that cross for the rest of your life."`
`"......Yes.`
` I am prepared to do so..."`
`"In that case, the suffering you must endure will come from the cross you bear.`
` Not from me."`
`"You don't......despise me...?"`
`"Look, don't make that dejected face.`
` ......In fact, no, ......I think I'll say the opposite.`
` As long as you do continue making that dejected face, I will feel no desire to punish you.`
` As long as you continue to carry that cross,`
` I will feel no desire to hate you."`
`"Despite what I did to you, ......you still don't hate me......?"`
`"Oh, I did hate you.`
` I hated your guts.`
` I hated you so much, I wanted to hang up a pillow with your picture on it and use it as a punching bag!"`
`"But, as I watched you, that feeling faded away.`
` ......You regretted and lamented.`
` And I'm sure you'll never forget that feeling for as long as you live."`
`"How could I forget......?`
` ......After all, I'm a murderer........."`
`"You burdened yourself with one hell of a heavy cross, didn't you?`
` I feel compassion for you now.`
` I'm serious.`
` I mean, all of this is really Kinzo's fault."`
`"It's his fault for having an illegitimate child in the first place!`
` And the way he forced that child on you was even worse!`
` Instead of "you can't give birth, so adopt this kid",`
` he should at least have been able to avoid hurting you by saying something like "please take care of this poor child".`
` Men! That Kinzo...!"`
`".............................."`
`"I no longer hate you.`
` Does the cross you bear not feel any lighter for that?"`
`"It doesn't.`
` ......I still don't know how I can make up for what I did to you."`
`"Then let's do it this way.`
` Hold out your arms."`
`"H‐......huh?`
` L‐...like this...?"`
`As Natsuhi spread her arms uncertainly,`
` Beato leapt forward and hugged her tight.`
`"......U‐umm,`
` ......th‐this is a little........."`
`"I'll never say this again, so let me say it once.`
` ......After all, I never had a chance to meet my mother."`
`Still hugging Natsuhi, Beato spoke in a whisper.`
`{n}She spoke those words that she would certainly never say again...`
`"Thank you for worrying so much for my sake.`
` ......But I really don't hate you anymore.`
` Please, believe that,`
` ............Mother."`
`"......{f:5:B}‐.........{f:5:Beatrice}..............."``"Who should we get a puzzle from next?"`
`"What about those two?"`
`"Shannon‐chan and Kanon‐kun?`
` Sure, it looks like they'll put up a good fight."`
`"Do you need something, Eva‐sama and Ange‐sama?"`
`"......Don't be stupid, Nee‐san.`
` They're asking us for puzzles."`
`"Ah, m‐my apologies."`
`Shannon was as absentminded as ever.`
`However, Kanon looked extremely calm, and would probably have a well‐polished puzzle ready.`
`"Ummm, uhhh..............."`
`"......Haah.`
` Okay, I'll go first.`
` While Nee‐san thinks up a puzzle."`
`"O‐okay. Sorry..."`
`"So, if I'm buying time for Nee‐san to think up a puzzle, I'll have to make one tricky enough to keep you stumped for a while."`
`"Eheheheheh, you've got guts, kid.`
` Let's have it, shall we?`
` Show us the hardest one you've got!"`
`"Don't provoke him!`
` I want an easy one!"`
`"Now that I have Eva‐sama's permission, allow me to present an insanely difficult puzzle."`
`"Leave this to me.`
` I'll solve it!"`
`"The numbers of coins are really different, and kind of weird."`
`"Wait a second, Kanon‐kun! What are you thinking?!`
` There's no way she'll be able to get this one, right?!"`
`"This is just to buy time until Nee‐san can think up a question, so forgive me."`
`"Th‐thank you...!`
` I've thought of a question...!"`
`"......Understood.`
` Now then, Eva‐sama and Ange‐sama.`
` I'll give you a hint.`
` .........Copper is 29, silver is 47, and gold is 79.`
` That's the hint."`
`"That's just what you said in the question...!`
` That's not a hint!"`
`".........Copper is 29?`
` Silver is 47??`
` ...............Oh, so that's it!"`
`"Huh?`
` You got it?!`
` I get it too!`
` Platinum is better than gold, so the prize must be more than 79 gold coins!"`
`"That's wrong.`
` With these rules, the platinum prize is probably worth less than the gold prize.`
` Isn't that right?"`
`"......It is as you say.`
` It seems you've already found the answer."`
`"This puzzle is impossible for Ange‐chan.`
` You'd need to have gone to middle school at the very least.`
` I'll answer!`
` Is that alright, Ange‐chan?"`
`"S‐sure.`
` I'll leave it to you...!"`
`"Incorrect."`
`"Aaaaaaaahhh, sorry, I messed up!!`
` If only I'd taken science class more seriously!"`
`"What do you mean?`
` I don't get it."`
`"The number of gold coins is the atomic number for each element.`
` Copper is 29, silver is 47, and gold is 79.`
` I can't remember what number platinum was...!!"`
`"I don't have a clue what you're talking about."`
`"You!`
` What kind of problem do you think you're giving Ange‐chan?!`
` Can't you put a little more thought into your puzzles?!"`
`"You did give me permission to show her the hardest one I've got."`
`"......That's right.`
` You said it yourself.`
` That's why we got a puzzle that was too hard for me."`
`"Nnggggggggggghhhh...!!`
` S‐......sorry, Ange‐chan..."`
`Auntie Eva put her hands together in apology.`
`It was just too hard, and I didn't have a clue......`
`".........Correct."`
`"Awesome, Auntie Eva!`
` Why?!`
` Why is it 78 coins?!`
` If platinum is better than gold, then why does gold get more coins?!"`
`"The number of coins you get is always the same as the atomic number of the prize.`
` Copper is 29, silver is 47, and gold is 79.`
` And, by the way, platinum is 78.`
` So, the platinum prize gets you 78 gold coins."`
`"A‐......Auntie Eva, you're incredible!!"`
`Dad once told me that Auntie Eva was an enthusiastic studier, and really, really smart even back when she was in school.`
`Even George onii‐chan, her son, is smart, so Auntie Eva must really be incredible.`
`"Still, that was a pretty nasty riddle to choose.`
` You should have at least given one that Ange‐chan could understand."`
`"You did give me permission to show her the hardest one I've got."`
`"......That's right.`
` You said it yourself.`
` That's why we got a puzzle that was too hard for me."`
`"Nnggggggggggghhhh...!!`
` I‐is it my fault?`
` Sorry, Ange‐chan...`
` But look, we got a medal, so please forgive me."`
`We got another medal.`
` Just how many have we gotten so far?`
`{n}But we still have a lot left to get.`
` Next up is Shannon.`
`"Mine isn't that hard, so you can relax."`
`"...Since you only have to think on Nee‐san's level."`
`"Y‐you're making fun of me...!`
` Then do you want to have a go at it too, Kanon‐kun?"`
`"Bring it on."`
`"It sounds like you'll be able to understand it this time, Ange‐chan.`
` I'll stick to giving hints again."`
`"Okay, I'll do my best.`
` I'll solve it.`
` Another medal for me."`
`"Let's go then.`
` Listen carefully..."`
`"I don't get it.`
` Why are there letters...?"`
`"......Could it be the first letter of each word?"`
`"That's what I thought at first.`
` White chocolate is "W", anchovy pizza is "A", and piri piri chicken curry is "P".`
` Those are the first letters of each of those words.`
` But then, how do you explain black coffee being "I"?"`
`"Heheheheheheheh.`
` Do you get it?"`
`"Don't you have any more hints for me?"`
`"I do.`
` I'll teach you the letters for some other foods.`
` First, walnut cake is "W".`
` Albacore tuna is an "A".`
` For "P", how about picante potatoes?`
` Iced green tea can be an "I".`
` Heheheheheheheh......"`
`"It really does sound like the first letter is the key...`
` But then how do you explain black coffee being "I"......?"`
`"......I love "W" foods.`
` Cream cakes are "W", right?"`
`"That's right."`
`"In that case,`
` it isn't the first letter after all..."`
`"What's going on?`
` What is this "W" group?`
` White chocolate and walnut cake, right?`
` Are these desserts?`
` Treats?`
` "A" is anchovy pizza and albacore tuna?`
` "P" is picante potatoes and piri piri chicken curry, and "I" is coffee and green tea?`
` Just what are these groups??"`
`"......I sort of get it, but I sort of don't.`
` ......It's a little annoying."`
`"One last hint.`
` Have you ever had lemonade to drink?"`
`"I have.`
` I thought it was just going to be sweet, so I was really surprised.`
` I'll never drink it again."`
`"............Ah, ......I've got it!`
` Ange‐chan, thank you.`
` Thanks to you, I've probably figured it out!"`
`"Giving up?`
` What about you, Kanon‐kun?"`
`"......I don't get it.`
` ......I think I almost do, but..."`
`"Yeah.`
` I almost know what all the groups mean, but I can't figure out that last step."`
`"It's......tastes, right?"`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` Have you figured it out now, Ange‐sama and Kanon‐kun?"`
`"I'm confused.`
` What is it, Auntie Eva?`
` Tell me!"`
`"Everything in the "W" group is sweet, right?`
` So, what about the "A" group?`
` The "P" group?"`
`".........I see, so that's what it was...`
` Not bad, coming from you, Nee‐san..."`
`"Why don't you try saying "sorry for making fun of you"?`
` If you don't, I'll make all your meals "O" and "I"."`
`"‘O’ is one thing, but eating "I" all the time would be awful."`
`In the end, Kanon caved under the threat of "I" cooking and was forced to apologize to Shannon.`
`Ange was still confused.`
`No point thinking about it any more.`
`I've got to pull myself together and take a shot at the next one.`
`"See, Ange‐chan?`
` Think about the tastes of all these foods!`
` How does white chocolate taste?"`
`"Sweet."`
`"And what about anchovy pizza?"`
`"Salty."`
`"Then how about piri piri chicken curry?`
` And black coffee?!"`
`"......I see, so that's what it is......"`
`"Piri piri is spicy.`
` Coffee is bitter.`
` ......So what is it?`
` Do the letters match the tastes?"`
`"That's right!`
` The second letter of "sweet" is "W".`
` The second letter of "salty" is "A", "spicy" is "P", and "bitter" is "I"!`
` So, what does lemonade taste like?"`
`"Sour!"`
`"Exactly!`
` And the second letter of "sour" is... "O"!`
` So the answer for lemonade is "O"!"`
`"Nice job.`
` You got it right, Eva‐sama and Ange‐sama."`
`"Auntie Eva, you're so awesome!!"`
`"We had to work together to solve that one.`
` It's a team effort."`
`"And here is my medal.`
` Please take it."`
`"Alright, I got another medal!`
` Thanks!"`
`"You didn't get it, did you, Kanon‐kun?`
` I'll bet it was hard."`
`"............Not bad, coming from you, Nee‐san..."`
`"Why don't you try saying "sorry for making fun of you"?`
` If you don't, I'll make all your meals "O" and "I"."`
`"‘O’ is one thing, but eating "I" all the time would be awful."`
`"I wanna eat "W" all the time!"`
`"Careful, you'll get cavities.`
` But if you ever come to my house to play, I'd be more than willing to share."`
`"Yay!!`
` I love you, Auntie Eva!!"`
`In the end, Kanon caved under the threat of "I" cooking...`
`and was forced to apologize to Shannon...`
`"That's all for our puzzles.`
` Did you enjoy them...?"`
`"Yeah.`
` Thanks!"`
`"It seems the others still have some brain‐twisters waiting for you.`
` Please be careful."`
`"Good point.`
` Everyone left looks like they'll be a challenge."`
`"But we'll win!`
` We can do it if we work together...!"`
`"That's right.`
` Let's combine our wits and move on!"`
`"Goodbye.`
` And good luck."`
`Shannon and Kanon had returned to the kitchen with the serving cart.`
`The dining hall was filled with such an exciting and fun atmosphere,`
` but out here in the corridor, one was reminded of the fierce winds and the rain.`
`But they were satisfied with this.`
`The whole point of the noisy farewell party was to forget the loneliness of the rain for just a little bit.`
`".........So, we've reached the end of this long game..."`
`"I feel relieved.`
` ......Finally, we won't have to be toys for anyone else.`
` ......I'd like to be quietly forgotten, to get covered with dust and vanish."`
`"You're wrong.`
` We aren't going to vanish like that."`
`"....................."`
`"In the world locked inside the cat box, our future will continue, unknown to anyone."`
`".........You're right.`
` ......Sorry.`
` That's a world that even we can't know about, ......so I forgot."`
`"Just what kind of future will we make for ourselves in the cat box world?"`
`"No one knows. That's why it's called a cat box."`
`"............Good point."`
`"Don't you have any regrets, Nee‐san?`
` .........About George‐sama, for instance?"`
`".............................."`
`"Receiving that ring is all you can do for George‐sama.`
` As for marriage, living together, and all the rest..."`
`"Our future inside the cat box is what'll make all that come true, isn't it?`
` ......I'm not the only one.`
` It's the same for you, right?`
` What about a future for you and Milady Jessica?"`
`".........I'm......"`
`"There's a possible future where I break off my engagement with George‐sama, then leave the island and disappear.`
` In that world, you wouldn't have to hesitate for my sake.`
` .........You could enjoy your youth to the fullest with Milady."`
`"......If you gave up on your engagement with George‐sama, that sort of world might be possible."`
`"So,`
` ......the world where I spend my life with George‐sama...`
`and the world where you spend your life with Milady...can both exist at the same time—that's what the inside of a cat box allows."`
`".........It's a world where any contradicting dreams can exist at once."`
`"That's the world we'll be put away in as pieces.`
` ......So, there's no need to be lonely, no need to be sad.`
` ......Even though the "me" here right now can only observe the part where I accept George‐sama's ring..."`
`The other "me" who lives in the cat box, in a world I cannot witness,`
` will surely build a happy life in the future...`
`The cat box is such a strange thing, a place where any pieces and toys and dreams can be kept.`
`It's no cage sealing us in.`
`On the contrary, the inside of the cat box is a boundless world that frees us from everything......`
`"A world where we're freed from everything, and yet where all of our wishes come true.`
` ......However, the "me" in that world won't be the "me" here and now.`
` ......That's a bit depressing."`
`".........Hey, Kanon‐kun."`
`"Yes...?"`
`"Let's do it."`
`".........What?"`
`"Duel."`
`".....................Are you sure?"`
`"We both wished we'd settled this much sooner.`
` And yet, we've put it off until the last moment, just before the game is going to end."`
`"......Sure.`
` ......The game is nearly over anyway.`
` Now, at the very end...`
` .........It's time for us to settle things by ourselves."`
`"That way, we'll be able to see our future before we're put away in the cat box."`
`".........Sure.`
` Let's do it.`
` ......How will we decide it?`
` A coin?`
` Or with pistols again...?"`
`"Ummm,`
` ......well, why don't we have our own quiz tournament?"`
`"......Huh?`
` .........You're really getting into this."`
`"Okay, then, hmm...`
` Question one!"`
`"Kihhihihihihihihi!`
` I'm gonna give you a reeeeally hard one!`
` I'll trick you with my extra‐hard puzzle, and make sure you {i:never} get my medal!"`
`"I'm going to solve it.`
` I'm {i:going} to solve it...!"`
`As soon as Maria and Ange crossed gazes, they started fighting.`
`The two girls so close in age were really good friends, but they also fought a lot.`
`Especially when they were opponents in a game.`
`"Maria‐chan probably knows tons of different quizzes.`
` This should be interesting.`
` Let's have it."`
`"Kihhihihihi, not now.`
` I'm the star, so I'll go after Mama!"`
`"Really?`
` You're sure it's okay for me to go first?"`
`"Uu!"`
`"Then I'll ask the first question.`
` Ready?`
` Heheheheheh."`
`"Hmmmm...... I guess you don't need a hint for this one."`
`"*giggle*, you're right.`
` I made it for Ange‐chan.`
` It's probably a bit too easy for you, Nee‐san."`
`"An hour is 60 minutes, and it takes 8 minutes for each round trip......"`
`"Good luck.`
` I know you can solve it.`
` I won't give you a hint this time."`
`"Huh?`
` Why is that wrong...?!"`
`"Heheh, sorry about that.`
` I guess that was a little mean."`
`"The key to the puzzle is the part about how many can she {i:carry out of the room}."`
`......Oh.`
` Looks like I made a pretty simple mistake.`
`I've been taking on so many tricky riddles, I've gotten a bit too tense.`
`"Then that's all for my puzzle.`
` Now, for the one you've been waiting for.`
` Good luck with Maria's puzzle!"`
`"8 ingots...!"`
`"Heheh, are you sure?`
` It takes eight minutes to carry each ingot to the surface, right?`
` 8 × 8 is more than 60."`
`"That's right.`
` After all, the question asked "how many can she carry out of the room".`
` You only have to take one step out of the room to "carry it out"."`
`"Nice going, Ange‐chan...!`
` All those puzzles have really warmed you up good."`
`"That's right.`
` To do 7 trips, you need 8 × 7 = 56 minutes.`
` There are only 4 minutes left.`
` However, you can make it back to the underground room in 3 minutes, then "carry out" the eighth ingot in the last minute."`
`"Kihihihihihihi...`
` Not bad, Ange!`
` Nice one, uu."`
`"I'm not gonna lose to you, Maria onee‐chan!"`
`"Congratulations.`
` Here's my medal.`
` Now you can try the puzzle Maria picked out just for you."`
`"So, it's finally my turn.`
` Kihihihihi, you took so long on Mama's easy puzzle that I got a little worried.`
` There's no way you'll ever solve this one, no way!"`
`"I've got Auntie Eva with me, and we'll solve it together!"`
`"Kihihihihihi, impossible, impossible, impossible!`
` Even Auntie Eva won't solve this one!`
` Wolves and Sheep puzzles are incredibly hard...!"`
`From her handbag,`
` Maria pulled out a "Wolves and Sheep Puzzle Book" that was worn‐out, well‐used, and had a majestic feel to it like a grimoire.`
`"You know what a Wolves and Sheep puzzle is, right?"`
`"I know.`
` You show me those all the time."`
`"They're puzzles about using a boat to take everyone from one shore of a river to another."`
`"They usually have a few bizarre rules.`
` When there's wolves and sheep, you can't let the number of wolves on either shore get bigger than the number of sheep, right?"`
`"Yeah, that's right!`
` Send a boat back and forth, moving everyone to the other side while making sure that there are never more wolves than sheep...!!`
` But the ones that have just wolves and sheep are only the simplest, easiest, plainest beginner's basic practice puzzles...!"`
`"When you get to the higher levels, you have many things other than wolves and sheep.`
` It's pretty clever."`
`".........Should we write this down on a piece of paper?"`
`"Good idea. That'll definitely make it easier for you to sort out your thoughts."`
`"*sigh*, ......sounds like this puzzle will be a handful."`
`"There's no way you're getting my medal, Ange!`
` Kihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi!!"`
`"I won't lose. I'm not gonna lose!!"`
`"W‐wait a second...`
` Who ever heard of a puzzle with such complicated rules?!"`
`"Did you only know about the ones with wolves and sheep?`
` There's lots of complicated puzzles that you've got to deal with in different ways!`
` See?`
` You don't get it either, right, Ange?!`
` Kihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi!"`
`"Please, give me a hint!"`
`"You have to organize your thoughts carefully.`
` Only the three humans can row the boat.`
` Then, you have to memorize all the things to look out for.`
` When the farmer is away, you can't leave his wife with the shepherd.`
` When both the farmer and his wife are away, you can't leave the shepherd with the meat.`
` When the shepherd is away, you can't leave the sheep with the veggies.`
` You also need someone to watch the cow, but any of the humans can do that.`
` Still, I guess the meat is the real key to the whole thing."`
`"......Ah, I see.`
` Just because you can't put it on the boat again once you take it off, that doesn't mean you can only take it across once."`
`"You've got it.`
` But the veggies really can only make one trip, so once you've sent them across, you can't get them back.`
` But as long as you don't take the meat off the boat, you can take it back and forth as much as you want."`
`".........It's so complicated.`
` Even after thinking about it, I don't get it at all..."`
`"I'll have to write it down and sort out my ideas.`
` What about you, Ange‐chan?`
` Do you want a pen and paper?"`
`"Impossible, impossible! You'll never solve it!`
` Why don't you just give up?`
` Thinking is a waste of time for the incompetent!`
` Kihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi...!"`
`"Can this really be solved?`
` Don't tell me there's actually some contradiction that makes it unsolvable..."`
`"Uuuuuu?`
` Who knows?`
` Kiiihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi!"`
`"Kihihihihihihi!!`
` Wrong!`
` You can't even do this one?!`
` You suck, Ange, kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi,`
` ouch!"`
`"Maria!`
` Show some manners!"`
`I'd thought so hard before getting that answer, but Maria onee‐chan just burst out laughing.`
`The laughter broke off when Auntie Rosa hit her, but then she was grinning again.`
`"I don't get it at all. Just how hard was this one...?"`
`"Only about 20 picarats, I guess?`
` There are lots of other puzzles in this book that are {i:actually} hard!"`
`I don't know what a pica‐thing is,`
` but apparently, even this puzzle doesn't count as a hard one for Maria onee‐chan...`
`I hung my head dejectedly.`
`Maria onee‐chan kept on laughing until Auntie Rosa smacked her again.`
`"This really is a nasty problem. Can it really be solved?`
` Is there some trick to it, like throwing things into the river and letting them drift to the other side without using the boat, or making the cow eat the vegetables so that they can be carried as one passenger,`
` or some other trick like that...?"`
`"Well, who knows?`
` If more thinking isn't getting you anywhere, should we take that as you giving up...?"`
`"This one's really hard!`
` Even Mama couldn't solve it!`
` But I solved it on my first try!"`
`"So, do you get it?`
` How many trips does it take to get every person across?"`
`"This is a cheap trick or a riddle, right?`
` There's no way you can solve this straightforwardly!"`
`"No, that's not true.`
` I'm sure you'll get it Nee‐san, smart as you are.`
` How many trips does it take to get every person across?"`
`"I've got it.`
` Three trips."`
`"......Huh?`
` Three?!`
` How...?!"`
`"It's easy.`
` The farmer and his wife get on the boat, then the wife gets dropped off on the other side in the first move.`
` Then, the farmer takes the boat back across in the second move.`
` Then, he crosses with the shepherd in the third move."`
`"But what about the cow and the sheep?!`
` What about the meat and the vegetables?!"`
`"But Auntie Eva, it said to take every person across, right?`
` Cows aren't people."`
`"Huh? Ah..........."`
`As Auntie Eva's mouth flopped open, Auntie Rosa started applauding.`
` After clicking her tongue, Maria onee‐chan joined in.`
`"That's right.`
` The question just asks how many moves it would take to move each person across.`
` The animals and luggage never had anything to do with it."`
`"They only got it because you kept saying "every person" over and over again, Mama.`
` Uu!"`
`Auntie Rosa had probably said it so much as a sort of hint.`
` Without that, even I wouldn't have figured it out.`
`"Come on.`
` I was totally taken in.`
` That was a mean question!"`
`"Go on, Maria.`
` Give Ange‐chan her medal."`
`"Uu‐uu‐uu......"`
`Whining like a unhappy dog, she reluctantly handed the medal over.`
`I grabbed it, and started jumping around like a happy dog.`
`As Maria onee‐chan smiled at me from behind, ......her face was bright, just like a big sister's.`
`"That's the end of our riddles.`
` Let's play again sometime, okay?"`
`"Next time, I'll have a really nasty puzzle that's even harder...!`
` One so hard that even I can't solve it!"`
`"No way!`
` I'm not playing with you anymore...!!"`
`"*giggle*.`
` Look, Ange‐chan.`
` Your parents are waving at you, so let's go.`
` See you later, Rosa."`
`"Sure.`
` Later, Ange‐chan.`
` There aren't too many people left with puzzles for you.`
` Keep it up until the end.`
` And make sure you keep cheering her on, Nee‐san."`
`"Of course.`
` We got all these medals by working together, right?"`
`"Yeah!"`
`We dashed away.`
`Dad and Mom are waving at me from over there.`
`I'm sure they've thought up some mean problems.`
`Still, they're bound to be easier than Maria onee‐chan's...!`
`I hate Maria onee‐chan! She's such a meanie!`
`"Uryuu.`
` You bullied her too much with that puzzle......"`
`"Well, I wanted to play with Ange a lot.`
` If it was an easy one, she'd solve it right away, right?"`
`"You really love Ange, don't you?"`
`"I hate her.`
` She made fun of you and called you a stuffed animal."`
`Maria pouted as she said this, but her expression didn't match her words at all.`
`"I hope Ange finds happiness."`
`"I'm sure she will.`
` After all, look at all the people here wishing for her happiness.`
` And now, Battler is the Game Master, and he's set up this final game just for her.`
` ......After all this, there's no way she won't be happy."`
`"......Still, even though everyone can bring a person happiness, only the person can grasp it for themselves."`
`"That's right.`
` That kid is really bad at finding fragments of happiness.`
` We can try to teach her how, but twelve years of time have sealed her ears up tight.`
` ......This game might be much harder for Ange than Battler thinks."`
`".........I'm sure that Ange will find happiness."`
`"Yeah.`
` ......If she really does enjoy herself at this party,`
` that itself might be the greatest lesson we can teach her now."`
`Ange, the girl who won't believe any magic shown to her, calling them simply "tricks"...`
`Twelve years in the future, she will become the last person to inherit {f:5:Beatrice}'s name.`
`"At one point in time, that kid understood my white magic."`
`"Yeah.`
` And she understood me too."`
`"She even summoned all of the Seven Sisters and understood magic itself.`
` ......And yet, she still can't use magic on herself."`
`"Let us believe.`
` Battler used to be much the same."`
`"......Beato."`
`"It is easy to cast magic on other people.`
` And believing in other people's magic is not so difficult.`
` The hardest thing is casting magic on yourself."`
`"Is that...something Ange can do......?"`
`"She can.`
` Even that Battler managed to understand magic.`
` Of course his little sister will be able to do the same."`
`"You're right.`
` .........There are some magics that we can only see when we're kids.`
` ......There are some that only adults can understand.`
` Right now, Ange is between the two of those."`
`"She's lost the magic of children, and yet, she has yet to understand the magic of adults. The most painful period of one's life."`
`"It's so sad......that she didn't have anyone close to her during that period..."`
`"That's not true.`
` We're always by that kid's side.`
` She just doesn't believe it."`
`Ange, please, realize that quickly.`
`There are so many people smiling at you from behind, watching over you.`
`If you would just turn around, we would be able to smile at you so much more, and talk to you so much more.`
`.........{f:5:Ange Beatrice}, final witch of Mariage Sorcière.`
`"Even if you aren't able to reach the proper end,`
` ......I pray that you can at least enjoy yourself tonight......"`
`Have fun, Ange.`
`So long.`
`The time we spent together feels so long, yet so short.`
`{n}Even so, for me, the memory is eternal......`
`"How's it going, Ange?`
` Did you get a ton of medals?"`
`"I wonder how many it is now!"`
`"Me too.`
` Let's count them later, okay?!"`
`"It seems you've been given quite a few puzzles already."`
`"Yeah.`
` Once I get your puzzles, only the cousins are left, I think."`
`"Sure, sure.`
` Okay.`
` Time to take a shot at Mom and Dad's puzzles!`
` I'll warn you, they're gonna be hard!"`
`"Everyone says the same thing, but we just keep on solving them!"`
`"Yeah!`
` So we'll get those medals together!"`
`"*giggle*.`
` That's the spirit.`
` Okay, I guess I'll go first."`
`"Ah, it's a classic liar puzzle.`
` Those are the ones I'm best at."`
`"Don't you mean lying is what you're best at?"`
`Wow.`
` I didn't think Dad's ears could stretch that far.`
`"Only one of them is speaking the truth.`
` And both of the others are lying.`
` So, if you find an answer where two of them are telling the truth, it's wrong."`
`".........I don't really get it.`
` I want some more hints."`
`"That's all for my hint.`
` If you want more, try talking to Auntie Eva."`
`"Auntie Eva!"`
`"Rika is the key.`
` Rika says that Miyoko is a liar.`
` So, if Miyoko is speaking the truth then Rika is a liar, and if Miyoko is lying, then Rika is speaking the truth.`
` ......In other words, since that pair contradicts each other, we know that one of them is lying and one is telling the truth."`
`"That's Eva nee‐san for you.`
` Exactly.`
` In liar games like this one, when you see a pair that contradicts each other, you know that one of them must be telling the truth.`
` And once you know that, you know that Satoko, who's not one of those two, must be a liar.`
` ......*giggle*, looks like the answer's already popped up."`
`"Ummm, ............???"`
`"Too bad, but that's not it."`
`"I guess Ange's still too little for that one."`
`"Am not! I just made a little mistake!`
` I'll get it right this time.`
` So, one more...!"`
`"Aw, and you were so close too..."`
`"Then you can make up for it with my puzzle.`
` Okay, let's try another one of those liar games.`
` Will you be able to get it this time?"`
`"Rika!"`
`"That's right!`
` Nice job, Ange‐chan!`
` Hard to imagine that such a smart girl is related to that dolt of a father!"`
`"Yeah, sorry for being a dolt.`
` Nice going, Ange!`
` Did you think of all the combinations?"`
`"Yeah.`
` If Miyoko is the oldest, then what Satoko says is true.`
` Only the oldest person is supposed to tell the truth, so that doesn't make sense."`
`"That's right.`
` Then what if Satoko is the oldest?"`
`"If she is, then Rika, who says that Miyoko is a liar, would be telling the truth, which doesn't work.`
` So, Rika has to be the oldest."`
`"Good job.`
` Here's my medal for you.`
` Congrats."`
`"Thank you, Mom!"`
`"Rudolf is up next.`
` I wonder what sort of puzzle he has for us."`
`"Well, guess I'll do a liar puzzle too.`
` Let's crank it up a notch this time..."`
`"They're all wearing masks...and except for Miyoko, we can't tell if they're lying or telling the truth.`
` ......This one's hard."`
`"No it isn't.`
` I've already figured it out.`
` This is even easier than the one your mom gave a second ago."`
`"Why?"`
`"You can't trust the two who aren't Miyoko, so you first need to figure out who Miyoko is.`
` Miyoko doesn't lie, right?"`
`"Yeah.`
` Miyoko doesn't lie."`
`"So, start off by figuring out who Miyoko is, then read through the puzzle again.`
` I'm sure you'll see it at once."`
`"Just think about who Miyoko is...`
` Okay, I've got it."`
`"You really do whatever Eva nee‐san tells you."`
`"Yeah.`
` Auntie Eva is nice and smart, and I like her.`
` So I do what she tells me!"`
`"We'll need to ask her for a hand next time we try to make Ange eat eggplant and bell peppers."`
`"*giggle*giggle*......"`
`"Toooo bad!!`
` That's wrong."`
`"Huh?!`
` I got it wrong? I got it wrong?!"`
`"Later on, try thinking it over with Auntie Eva.`
` I'm sure you'll figure it out soon."`
`"Think about it.`
` Miyoko speaks the truth, right?`
` So, is it possible for someone to be Miyoko if they say the person next to them is Miyoko?"`
`Miyoko speaks the truth.`
`So, she should say that she is Miyoko.`
` She wouldn't say that someone else was Miyoko.`
`......If I'd realized that, it would probably have been easy to figure out who Miyoko is.`
`I've figured out the knack of it now, but too late.`
` Too bad...`
`"I know who Miyoko is.`
` She's on the left.`
` After all, the girls in the middle and on the right both say that someone else is Miyoko.`
` If they were Miyoko, they couldn't lie and say that someone else was Miyoko."`
`"That's right.`
` Miyoko is supposed to be honest.`
` So, anyone who says "someone else is Miyoko" can't be Miyoko."`
`"So, since the middle one and the right one aren't Miyoko, the left one automatically is.`
` And since Miyoko speaks the truth, then it's also true that the kid on the right is Satoko."`
`"Which means that the only kid left, the one in the middle, is Rika.`
` Perfect!"`
`"You solved it like it was nothing!`
` Ange, you really are smart like your Mom!"`
`Dad rubbed my cheek and hugged me.`
`"That's all for our puzzles."`
`"Listen up, Ange.`
` Life will lead you through countless puzzles.`
` ......Auntie Eva is here to help you now, so it's okay to rely on her.`
` However, you have to solve most problems in life by yourself.`
` When that happens, you must remember the advice you've gotten from those who have helped you in the past."`
`"Okay.`
` I get it."`
`"......Eva nee‐san.`
` Take care of Ange."`
`"Yes, of course."`
`Even though the cousins were the only ones who hadn't given us puzzles,`
` Mom spoke as though I was leaving on a long, long trip.`
` ......Weird.`
`"Let's go, Ange‐chan.`
` The game will be over soon."`
`"I wonder what Grandpa will give us for getting all these medals...!"`
`"Me too.`
` Still, we've already gotten a lot that's far more wonderful than that prize."`
`"What do you mean...?"`
`"We've all had a lot of fun talking to you like this, Ange‐chan."`
`"............?`
` I don't get it.`
` You're weird."`
`"I'm sorry.`
` Let's go then.`
` Now, all that's left are the cousins and {f:5:Beatrice}, I guess."`
`"What is it?`
` Why did you tell me to come over here?`
` .........Is it something to do with Ange?"`
`"No, that's not it.`
` ..........................."`
`Rudolf put a cigarette in his mouth and toyed with his lighter.`
`......Though lighting a cigarette should have been second nature to him, he somehow managed to mess up several times.`
`"I...wanted to take this to my grave.`
` ......No, to hide it away in a cat box.`
` If I just kept my mouth shut until tomorrow night, I'd be able to do that.`
` ......It'd be easy."`
`"...................................."`
`"I've been thinking......I'm probably gonna get murdered tonight.`
` ......But I've gotta say it."`
`"......I've known all along.`
` That you had something you were hiding."`
`"Have you?`
` Guess I still need more practice."`
`".........If it isn't about Ange, then who is it about?`
` Not Asumu‐san, surely..."`
`"It's about Battler."`
`"......That comes to the same thing.`
` I've been very adult in my treatment of Battler‐kun, if you ask me.`
` Even though he's Asumu‐san's son, I've treated him the same as Ange.`
` I do think of him as a child in our family, so don't worry."`
`"He's not just a kid in our family.`
` He's my kid and yours."`
`"I'm sorry, but you'll have to let me draw the line here."`
`"You don't get it.`
` He's my kid...and yours."`
`".....................What?"`
`"You didn't have a stillbirth.`
` Asumu did.`
` .........Back then, when I was double‐timing the two of you, I got myself stuck and couldn't find a way out..."`
`"You don't mean......... You don't mean............"`
`"......Asumu and I were married.`
` You and I were cheating.`
` Then, Asumu had a stillbirth, and you gave birth.`
` ......My head was a mess with it all."`
`The sin that Rudolf brazenly committed when his mind was at its most chaotic...`
`......was to switch the two babies.`
`"I was better off financially back then.`
` I was young, and I didn't give a damn about what lengths I went to.`
` ......I threatened the hospital with money......and switched your kid with Asumu's."`
`If Kyrie had a child, Rudolf would have two households to worry about.`
`However, if Kyrie had a stillbirth and the child who survived was Asumu's, that would settle everything.`
`......The stillbirth might even have given him a chance to break off his relationship with Kyrie.`
`......It was a grave sin, one that simply couldn't be forgiven as an act of youthful enthusiasm and immaturity.`
`"............That's why...I should be apologizing to all three of you.`
` ......I forced Asumu to raise a kid that wasn't hers.`
` .........That woman may have looked easygoing, but she was surprisingly sharp.`
` ......There's a chance she figured it out.`
` ...However, she raised Battler, who loved her as a mother, with all the affection she had."`
`And in Kyrie and Battler's cases, ......he had to atone for an even greater sin.`
`He stole every moment of everyday family life that they should have shared as mother and son.`
`Until this very day, Kyrie had believed that Battler was Asumu's child.`
`Though she had acted kindly towards him on the surface, she had always kept a distance in her heart between herself and Asumu's son.`
`Finally, ......Rudolf's conscience had been unable to bear seeing her like that.`
`"............But............I.................."`
`Kyrie sank into a crouch, unable to speak.`
`"......Feel free to curse me.`
` In fact, I couldn't complain if you killed me where I stand.`
` That's how horrible my sin against you is.`
` .........This is the secret I wanted to confess before the cat box closes over us."`
`"Battler.........kun....................."`
`"I'm so sorry, Kyrie.`
` .........And to you, Battler........."`
`"Come to think of it, we've already gone through a ton of puzzles."`
`"Yeah.`
` Now, there's only George onii‐chan, Jessica onee‐chan, Battler onii‐chan, and {f:5:Beatrice} left."`
`"Oh, they're finally here."`
`"We've been waiting a painfully long time.`
` We thought you might have forgotten about us."`
`Finally, we challenged George onii‐chan and Jessica onee‐chan.`
`"Sorry to keep you two waiting.`
` So, did you think up some incredibly hard ones for us?"`
`"We decided to give you one puzzle together."`
`"My, my, even one riddle from this pair sounds challenging."`
`"It's a special puzzle we made just for Ange‐chan, so good luck."`
`"I'll solve it. I'll definitely solve it!"`
`"Okay, then, let's get started.`
` Jessica‐chan, let's set them out."`
`"There you go."`
`They placed three small, colorful, cubic boxes on the table.`
`"Two of these are traps!`
` The other has a medal inside."`
`"Ange‐chan, do you think you can guess which one has the medal inside...?"`
`"Can't do it without a hint.`
` That's just luck!"`
`"That's right. So far, this is just a test of luck with three choices.`
` In other words, your odds of winning are one in three."`
`"George.`
` This isn't a quiz, right?`
` It really is just a test of luck."`
`"The puzzle comes later.`
` Let's move ahead."`
`"Okay, Ange.`
` Which of these has a medal inside, do you think?`
` Just say the first one that pops into your head."`
`A red box, a blue box, and a green box.`
`{n}There's no way to know which one it's in.`
`......This really is...a test of luck.`
`In a way, this is even worse than a hard puzzle.`
`{n}After all, you can always get a hard puzzle right—you just have to solve it.`
`......But in the very beginning, I picked the almond with a 1 in 15 chance.`
`Compared to that, a 1 in 3 chance is five times easier to get.`
`There's no point worrying about it.`
` Might as well test my luck again.`
`"Then, ............this one."`
`"The red box?`
` Then let's set this box right in front of you.`
` .........Wouldn't it be great if there was a medal inside?`
` So, let's start with a little warm‐up.`
` The probability of the medal being inside that red box is 1 in what?"`
`"1 in 3."`
`"That's right.`
` If this really is a simple test of luck."`
`"Heheheheh.`
` Are you sure, Ange?`
` Are you a~bsolutely sure you're happy with that red box?`
` After all, we're gonna make you open it in a second.`
` ......If it's a trap, it'll be re~ally scary."`
`Jessica onee‐chan grinned threateningly.`
`"Are you happy with the red box?`
` ......The medal might be in the blue box or the green box.`
` Do you want to change your mind?"`
`It's not fair for them to scare me like that, not after I've already made my choice.`
`And I know.`
`All of the boxes have the same probability of having a medal in them.`
` Whether I open the red box, or change my mind and open a different box, the probability will be the same.`
`So, stick with your first choice is my motto.`
` I'll stay with this red box.`
` I won't change my mind.`
`"I'm happy with the red box.`
` I'll bet on it!"`
`"That's the spirit.`
` But seriously, the traps are re~ally terrifying.`
` Why don't we show you just how scary they are?"`
`Jessica onee‐chan laughed creepily, then opened the green box.`
`And then,`
` *bang*!`
` With the violent sound of a party popper, pumpkin monsters and ribbon came flying out of the box.`
`......I was a little scared.`
` ......No, that's a lie.`
` I was really scared......`
`If that came flying out of the box I opened right at my face, I might fall to my knees and start crying...`
`"Ange~, are you {i:sure} you want the red box...?`
` Something really scary might come flying out, right...?`
` Are you sure you don't want to switch to the blue box...?"`
`"I'm not scared!`
` I'll stick with the red box!"`
`"Hahahahaha, you're going a bit overboard, Jessica‐chan.`
` So, now one of the boxes is gone, and there's only two left.`
` This is where the puzzle starts, Ange‐chan."`
`"You mean, which box is the medal in?"`
`"We have the red box that's been sitting in front of you the whole time, and the blue box here in front of me.`
` Which has a higher probability of having a medal inside it?`
` That's the puzzle."`
`"There are two boxes, and we don't know what's inside either of them, so there's a fifty‐fifty chance of the medal being in either.`
` ......They're both the same, aren't they?"`
`"......I thought that too.`
` Still, that would make the answer too obvious, wouldn't it?`
` I wonder if there's some trick here......"`
`Or, that itself might be the trick, and the obvious answer could be the right one.`
`It might be one of those classic puzzles that trips you up by making you think too hard and suspiciously.`
`"..............................`
` I have two questions for you two. Is that okay?"`
`"Go ahead."`
`"Who do these three boxes belong to?`
` You, Jessica‐chan?"`
`"Well, yeah."`
`"In other words, you know which colors are traps, right?"`
`"Yeah, of course."`
`"Thanks.`
` And now for my second question.`
` A second ago, you opened one of the boxes to show us how scary the traps were.`
` Would you have done that no matter which of the boxes Ange‐chan chose?"`
`"That's right.`
` I figured giving her a bit of a scare would make for a nice psychological warfare tactic."`
`"Thanks.`
` Those hints will be enough."`
`"Hints?`
` Huh......??"`
`I'm completely lost.`
`How were Auntie Eva's questions just now hints...?`
`"Sorry.`
` That's wrong."`
`"What?!`
` Wh‐......why?!"`
`We started with three boxes.`
`When they set the red box in front of me, the odds of there being a medal inside were, obviously, 1 in 3.`
`At the same time, the odds for the blue box were 1 in 3, as were the odds for the green box.`
`Jessica onee‐chan opened the green box, so there were then only two boxes left, and the odds became fifty‐fifty.`
`So, ......why was I wrong...???`
`"...............It was you, George, wasn't it?`
` You thought this puzzle up.`
` Did the Monty Hall problem even exist in 1986?"`
`"Nope, not until 1990.`
` It's a puzzle that already exists in Ange‐chan's world, so I thought it'd be okay to use it."`
`"George nii‐san ran me through the answer,`
` but I was totally lost.`
` ......Anyway, I don't get the details, but he says that in this case, the odds of the blue box having the medal are about twice the odds of the red box having it."`
`Twice the odds?`
` ......Even if there was a difference, I thought it'd be a tiny one.`
`......Probability is hard.`
`Didn't Onii‐chan once say that people who don't get probability should never go gambling?`
`......I guess I'll never gamble for the rest of my life...`
`Auntie Eva nodded and patted my head encouragingly...`
`"Oh.`
` .........The odds are better for the blue box!"`
`"Hmmm.`
` And why is that?"`
`"Well, ............I......I just sorta..."`
`"Think back to the 15 slice cake that you found the almond in.`
` If there was only one almond, the odds of winning were 1 in 15, right?"`
`"Yeah.`
` 1 in 15."`
`I figured that out when the cake first appeared.`
`I'd thought that waiting for a lot of people to get wrong ones would make my chances for winning higher.`
`But, in the end, no matter when I ate my slice, the odds were still one in 15.`
`"Still, Ange‐chan.`
` What if...`
`the servants had also been eating that cake, and it had actually started with twenty slices?"`
`"............Huh?`
` ......What...?"`
`"This is a party, right?`
` It's not fair that the servants don't get any cake, don't you think?`
` So, let's say it was originally a twenty‐slice cake.`
` The servants took out five slices, then redecorated it as a fifteen‐slice cake and let you choose a slice.`
` If so, what would your chances of choosing the right slice be?"`
`If there were really twenty slices,`
` .........then the chances would be 1 in 20.`
`"However, the servants know where the almond is, so they chose five slices for themselves that had no almonds.`
` In other words, they removed five {i:losing} slices.`
` That would mean your chances of winning were 1 in 15, not 1 in 20."`
`"......They took out losing slices, so it's only natural that the probability of winning would go up."`
`"Just now, Jessica‐chan did the same thing.`
` Jessica‐chan took one {i:losing box} away from the pair of boxes you didn't choose.`
` In other words, the odds of the winner being on the side you didn't choose went up a bit, right...?"`
`"Ahahahahahahahah, ......I sort of get it, but not really......"`
`If you remove a losing box, it's only natural that your chances of getting the right one go up.`
`And just now, Jessica onee‐chan removed a losing box {i:from the boxes I didn't choose}.`
`So, doesn't it make sense that my odds of winning with {i:those boxes} went up......?`
`"......Now I'm getting confused......"`
`"Actually, you really are incredible, Ange‐chan.`
` Even though you're only six, you're trying to understand posterior probability, a concept in probability theory.`
` Probability really is interesting.`
` I'm sure you'll like it when you get into high school and college.`
` Go and enjoy studying it all you can."`
`My little head was already filled to the brim.`
`Bewildered, I had to beg Auntie Eva for an explanation.`
`Auntie Eva wore a bitter smile too.`
` I'll bet she doesn't really get it herself.`
`As we felt a sense of connection through this failure, we happily grasped the medals we had wrangled out of them......`
`"Ange‐chan,`
` could you come over here for a second?"`
`".........?`
` What is it, George onii‐chan?"`
`George onii‐chan and Jessica onee‐chan were calling to me from the window.`
`Auntie Eva was talking with Mom and the others, and since it looked like they'd be a while, I went over to George onii‐chan and Jessica onee‐chan.`
`"What?"`
`"Looks like the quiz tournament is almost over."`
`"Yeah.`
` There's only Battler onii‐chan and {f:5:Beatrice} left.`
` .........I'm starting to get sleepy."`
`It's probably because of that adult drink I swiped from Dad.`
`I've felt floaty ever since I drank that.`
` ......That floaty feeling keeps getting stronger, and I've been feeling sleepy for a while now.`
`I gave a huge yawn.`
`"Sleepy?"`
`"......Yeah.`
` If I had a sofa, I'd probably fall asleep."`
`"I see.`
` ......Then I guess it's almost time for this party to end."`
`".........?"`
`......The party will end if I fall asleep?`
`But I just wanted to take a nap while everyone else kept having fun.`
`"Was our puzzle just now a hard one?"`
`"......Yeah.`
` I still don't really get it.`
` ......And, ...I'm sleepy......"`
`"It's called posterior probability.`
` That's what we call it when the probability of something changes because we learn or fail to learn some sort of information."`
`"........................"`
`Did George onii‐chan call me all the way over here to lecture me on math...?`
`......For some reason, I feel even sleepier now.`
`"So,`
` if we have one almond in ten slices of cake, our chances of getting it are 10%.`
` ......But what if "we learn" that those ten pieces were chosen at random from a hundred pieces?"`
`"You'd think that the probability went from one in 10 to one in 100, right...?"`
`"Absolutely nothing has changed about your slice of cake.`
` ......But depending on whether you know or don't know a certain fact,`
` the probability of your slice being a winner changes.`
` Doesn't that sound strange?"`
`"......That sounds hard, so I don't wanna think about it..."`
`"Ange.`
` Please, just listen until the end."`
`Jessica onee‐chan's voice grew a bit stern.`
`As young as I was, ......I couldn't understand what all this was supposed to mean to me.`
`"There's only one thing I want to tell you.`
` So please, don't forget this."`
`".........What?"`
`"In the future,`
` various bits of information will affect the slice of cake in your hands.`
` ......By learning about those, the insides of your slice might change.`
` Sometimes, they'll change into things you want.`
` ......But, most likely, almost all of the changes will be into bad things."`
`"The truth is always right there in your hands, Ange.`
` ......Don't you think it's stupid to let it change around just because you hear someone else's words, just because you hear what {i:they} think the truth should be?"`
`"The truth inside of you has been in your hands from the beginning.`
` ......And the nature of that truth is actually something you decide for yourself.`
` ......You change it yourself depending on what you hear...and what you refuse to listen to."`
`"You probably don't get what we're saying.`
` But you have to understand.`
` Even if you can't understand when you're six years old, I'm sure you will once twelve years have passed."`
`"..........................."`
`With very serious expressions on their faces, they grasped my shoulders as they spoke.`
`......I don't know what they're trying to tell me.`
`"The truth that lies in your hands is not unchangeable.`
` You'll be interfered with in many ways that'll make it change.`
` ......So, if the truth you hold in your hands is really important to you..."`
`"You need to protect it yourself.`
` Don't forget it."`
`"................................."`
`"All that's left is the puzzles from you and {f:5:Beatrice}, and I'm done."`
`"I see.`
` Even though there were so many of us, it looks like it's finally over."`
`"How was it?`
` Did you enjoy tonight's party...?"`
`"Yeah.`
` It was fun.`
` But I think I'm a bit sleepy."`
`"......That's no surprise,`
` considering how much we've been running around."`
`I rubbed my eyes.`
`I must have gotten really excited.`
`{n}But whenever I get excited, I'm always tired afterwards.`
`Right now, I'd rather have a sofa to lie on than medals.`
`"I've got a special puzzle just for you, ......but are you sure you want it?`
` If you're sleepy, you can stop now."`
`"No.`
` I've come this far, so I'll keep going......`
` .........*yaaawn*......"`
`Onii‐chan and Beato laughed at my yawn.`
`"Looks like it's time to call it a day..."`
`"Yes.`
` Ange.`
` Let us leave my puzzle for later.`
` It's too difficult to be solved by one with eyes as sleepy as that."`
`"............No way.`
` ......I've...come this far, and...`
`...I also want......Onii‐chan's medal........."`
`I'm just so......so sleepy......`
`{n}..............................`
`Ange drifted over to a chair in the corner of the room and plopped down onto it.`
`Then, she closed her eyes, looking like a doll sitting there.`
`It didn't take long before the cute sound of her breathing in her sleep could be heard...`
`When she saw that Ange was finally asleep, Beato spoke softly.`
`"Quiet please, everyone.`
` ......Ange fell asleep."`
`When she said those words, the pleasant noise that had filled the room softly returned to silence.`
`{n}Everyone looked down upon Ange's sleeping face.`
`Each of them wore an affectionate gaze, as if they'd just watched a baby finally drift to sleep.`
`".........Did Ange‐chan have a good time?"`
`"Of course she did.`
` ......She might not feel that strongly about it now,`
` but one day, she will surely remember tonight's party and appreciate how fun it was."`
`".........You're right."`
`"......It was fun for us too, getting to play with Ange‐chan."`
`By this point, everyone was standing in a wide circle around Ange as she slept.`
`Now that the guest of honor was asleep, ......this Halloween party had reached a conclusion...`
`"So long, my granddaughter.`
` .........I was so pleased to have this chance to play with you again after twelve years.`
` ......It matters not if you forget everything about me.`
` Remember me as an arrogant despot.`
` ......But, every now and then, try to remember how much I adored you."`
`"She will remember.`
` .........Ange‐san.`
` You have a long life ahead of you.`
` Even after twelve years, there is still much for you to experience.`
` I pray that you find this life meaningful and worthwhile."`
`"......You are the final grandchild and daughter of the Ushiromiya family.`
` We all pray for your happiness."`
`"Ange‐chan.`
` Stay well.`
` ......Happiness isn't something you find, it's something you make.`
` And in fact, memories work the same way."`
`"True.`
` ......There are some things that we only truly understand when we think back on them years later."`
`"Make sure you remember my pretty face every now and then.`
` Just having you remember us is the greatest memorial service we could ever have."`
`"Oh, come on.`
` It's not like we're dying.`
` We're just going to the inside of the cat box—the other side of the curtain."`
`"That's right.`
` It's not even a curtain.`
` It's just like we are now.`
` Ange‐chan's there sleepin' away.`
` The rest of us are right by her side, watchin' over her.`
` ......We'll always be with her."`
`All of them still wore warm smiles, but the sound of sniffling came from several places throughout the room...`
`This party wasn't only for the girl who wasn't able to be here this day.`
`It was also for all those people who weren't able to meet her here,`
` ......who never had the chance to say goodbye...`
`"Ange.`
` Live life strongly.`
` ......Our blood flows through your veins.`
` That'll definitely bring you strength."`
`"......Eva nee‐san.`
` Take care of our daughter.`
` ......She's not honest with herself, and she'll often be selfish and short‐tempered.`
` She might be a pain all the time, but......"`
`"I'll make sure...she's happy.`
` As long as that's what she wants......"`
`"Ange‐sama, ...it's okay if you forget my face.`
` But please, at least remember the taste of my cooking...!"`
`"Hohhohohohohohohoho.`
` And I won't ask you to remember old Kumasawa.`
` But please, at least remember the taste of mackerel juice."`
`Someone said "when'd you feed her that?!" and everyone laughed.`
`"Her face looks so cute, sleeping there like that.`
` ......She looks like an angel, just like her name."`
`"She's not an angel, she's a witch.`
` Ange's the final witch, {f:5:Ange Beatrice}."`
`"I wonder if that magic will bring her happiness."`
`"Will she become a white witch or a black witch?`
` ......That's for Ange to choose.`
` I've shown her both sides."`
`"I'm sure a painful life lies ahead for you.`
` You'll probably believe that you're all alone in this world.`
` ......But we will always be there right behind you, cheering you on.`
` Don't forget that......"`
`"Ange......`
` Don't forget.`
` Your self, your happiness, your fate.`
` You're the one who creates all of these things.`
` Only you can choose.`
` Those aren't things that someone else can give you, and they aren't things that someone else can hide from you.`
` ......Remember."`
`"I'm certain your message reached her."`
`"......I hope so."`
`"I'm certain the tale of the two of us will help Ange‐sama understand."`
`"...............Yeah."`
`"Don't you have anything to tell her, George‐sama?"`
`"......I've already said all I wanted with that box puzzle."`
`"Will that puzzle teach her something?"`
`"I don't know.`
` But I do know that she's wise.`
` I'm sure she'll learn something from it."`
`"......Ange‐sama.`
` I pray that you are guided along the right path as you move on to the future."`
`One by one, they stepped forward and said words of farewell to Ange.`
`Then, finally, Battler and Beato walked forward......`
`"Ange.`
` .........Were you able to remember everyone, at least a little bit?"`
`Of course, Ange didn't answer in her sleep.`
`{n}But Battler continued.`
`"It's true that the Ushiromiyas are a strange family.`
` We're super‐rich, and that's given rise to all sorts of rumors and stories.`
` ......However, all of those are just speculation made up by people outside the island."`
`"......Young as you were, no one will blame you for forgetting the memories that were so kind to you.`
` But even so, you must remember, for their sakes.`
` ......It is not a sin to forget.`
` ......The sin.....is to refuse to remember."`
`"All of us...`
`......were really happy to have you at this party.`
` ......Right, everyone?"`
`Everyone nodded at Battler's words.`
`Everyone knew about the merciless and lonely life that awaited her.`
`It was no longer possible for them to heal those wounds.`
`If there was one thing they could do...`
`............it was to make her remember what a kind, fun family she had once had,`
` .........and to remind her that today and into the future, they would always care for her and watch over her.`
`"It goes without saying...`
`...that this is an illusion.`
` You cannot come to Rokkenjima on October 4th, 1986.`
` This whole party we shared was all a magical illusion, created by the Game Master, Battler."`
`"But you remember now, right...?`
` How kind everyone was, and how much of a blast we all had at the family conferences.`
` ......Do you remember......the truth...?"`
`Ange breathed softly in her sleep.`
`Who knows......if those words truly reached her...`
`"Auntie Eva."`
`"........................"`
`"......Take care of her."`
`"You.........really think......that I deserve to become her mother......?"`
`"I do.`
` .........Even though your own sadness was so unbearable,`
` ......you tried so hard to be a mother for Ange."`
`"But, in the end............"`
`"It's alright.`
` ............Ange, listen carefully."`
`Battler grasped Ange's hand, then took Eva's hand and joined the two hands together...`
`"......We know that a tragic fate led to a future where the two of you hurt each other.`
` ......It was a very sad thing for you......and just as sad for Auntie Eva.`
` .........It wasn't fair on you that you were asked to open your heart to her.`
` And it wasn't fair on Auntie Eva that she was asked to endure her own sadness for your sake."`
`".........Neither of you...`
`is at fault."`
`"Even so, .....we have no right to tell you to forgive her.`
` ......So, we won't.`
` .........Just try to understand.`
` It doesn't matter how long it takes, how far into the future it happens.`
` ......Try to understand Auntie Eva.`
` And, every once in a while, .........remember us."`
`"And don't forget about me.`
` Every once in a while, remember this merry, cheerful, attractive paragon of a woman, and chant my name in praise three times every day."`
`The relatives smiled bitterly, apparently disagreeing with some of that last bit.`
`Eva softly stroked Ange's cheek and spoke one last time.`
`".........It's okay if you don't forgive your aunt.`
` ......But still.`
` It's true that I don't hate you.`
` ......At least understand that......"`
`Eva wiped her eyes and slowly stood up.`
` Hideyoshi held her shoulder, and Rudolf and Kyrie gathered around her too.`
`".........Genji‐san.`
` Would you mind carrying Ange to somewhere she can lie down?"`
`"As you wish.`
` ......Shall I take her to the guesthouse?"`
`"It'd be a little too sad to leave her all alone there."`
`"You're right.`
` ......Could you carry her to the sofa in the parlor?`
` That way, she'll be able to come back if she wakes up and feels like joining in again."`
`Genji gently lifted Ange up and carried her towards the parlor.`
`Everyone continued to watch over her as she left......`
`"Shannon, Kanon.`
` In the end, how many medals did Ange gather?"`
`"......She didn't get any medals."`
`"......She got one medal."`
`"......She got two medals."`
`"......She got three medals."`
`"......She got four medals."`
`"......She got five medals."`
`"......She got six medals."`
`"......She got seven medals."`
`"......She got eight medals."`
`"......She got nine medals."`
`"......She got ten medals."`
`"......She got eleven medals."`
`"......She got twelve medals."`
`"......She got thirteen medals."`
`"......She got fourteen medals."`
`"......She got fifteen medals."`
`"......She got sixteen medals."`
`"......She got seventeen medals."`
`"Hmm, I see.`
` ......Then place this by her pillow."`
`"Yes,`
` as you wish."`
`Genji carried Ange to the parlor and set her down on the sofa.`
`Shannon quietly laid a warm blanket on top of her.`
`Kanon placed a message card by her pillow, along with that thing Kinzo had given them.`
`The message card read as follows:`
`{a:c:We'll all be with you, always.`
`{n}{nobreak:{m:-5:—}—}From the whole Ushiromiya family}`
`And there, right by her pillow, was the gift from Kinzo, ......a scrubbing brush.`
`And there, right by her pillow, was the gift from Kinzo, ......a can of mackerel.`
`And there, right by her pillow, was the gift from Kinzo, ......a memory foam pillow with the One-winged Crest.`
`And there, right by her pillow, was the gift from Kinzo, ......an old‐type white school swimsuit.`
`And there, right by her pillow, was the gift from Kinzo, ......a fully ripe mango.`
`And there, right by her pillow, was the gift from Kinzo, ......a decorative pine branch.`
`And there, right by her pillow, was the gift from Kinzo, ......a uniform from Angel Mort.`
`And there, right by her pillow, was the gift from Kinzo, ......a signed celebrity photograph of Kinzo himself.`
`And there, right by her pillow, was the gift from Kinzo, ......a bag that laughs with Kinzo's voice.`
`And there, right by her pillow, was the gift from Kinzo, ......a One‐winged Eagle carp streamer.`
`And there, right by her pillow, was the gift from Kinzo, ......a bouquet of golden roses.`
`And there, right by her pillow, was the gift from Kinzo, ......a music box that was passed down through the generations.`
`And there, right by her pillow, was the gift from Kinzo, ......a mass‐produced Sakutarou doll.`
`And there, right by her pillow, was the gift from Kinzo, ......a tea set bearing the family crest.`
`And there, right by her pillow, was the gift from Kinzo, ......a pocket watch bearing the family crest.`
`And there, right by her pillow, was the gift from Kinzo, ......a {f:5:Beatrice} corsage.`
`And there, right by her pillow, was the gift from Kinzo, ......a Battler doll.`
`And there, right by her pillow, was the gift from Kinzo, ......a {f:5:Beatrice} doll.`
`Ange, mumbling in her sleep, held it tightly against her cheek.`
`"Let us go.`
` We mustn't wake her."`
`"Nee‐san."`
`"......Yeah.`
` ..................?"`
`Shannon thought she saw something glittering silver near Ange's eye......`
`The servants left and closed the parlor door.`
`{n}As Ange slept, she was wrapped up in the soft sound of the rain.`
`Surely, she was reliving that fun evening once more in her dreams......``After putting Ange to sleep in the parlor, Genji and the others returned.`
`"Thanks.`
` Was she sleeping well...?"`
`"Yes.`
` She is sleeping peacefully."`
`"The noise from here won't reach the parlor, right...?"`
`"That's right.`
` The door is closed, so I don't think it will reach."`
`"............Ange.`
` Sweet dreams."`
`"Well then!!`
` That's enough solemn farewells!`
` Let us begin the magnificent festivities we have planned for the after‐partyyyy!!"`
`When Beato clapped her hands loudly above her head, a white flash filled the hall, and its entire appearance changed in an instant.`
`The hall had transformed into a golden party chamber, with gold butterflies flitting about and gold leaf dancing everywhere.`
`"Yes, the true party shall begin now!"`
`"You said it!`
` Okay, the anti‐magic toxin is totally gone!!`
` Everyone, come on in!`
` The party after the show is about to start!!"`
`With a burst of applause and cheering, a tornado of gold butterflies rose up in the center of the room.`
`By the time it passed, the number of faces had grown significantly.`
`"Let the witch of the future find happiness.`
` And let us of the past be rewarded for our efforts, right?"`
`"Indeed.`
` Let us enjoy ourselves as well."`
`"Come on, haven't we been enjoying ourselves the whole time?!"`
`"Pu ku ku ku.`
` In this world, the one who enjoys the most is the true winner."`
`"Come, let's have the Seven Sisters over here too."`
`"The Seven Sisters of Purgatory, right here!!"`
`"I can't believe the game is finally over!`
` Waaah!"`
`"What do you think you're doing, crying at the after‐party!`
` You little crybaby!"`
`"Lord {f:5:Battler}, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, thank you for the invitation!"`
`"I wanna see six‐year‐old Ange‐sama's sleeping face and have it all to myself!"`
`"I wanna see the food and have it all to myself!!"`
`"Then I wanna see a good man and have him all to myself!!"`
`"Why are you clinging to Battler when you say that?!`
` Stop, thief!"`
`"Glad to see you, Seven Sisters of Purgatory!`
` Enjoy yourselves!"`
`"Ah yes, things do get much noisier the moment they enter a room."`
`"And what makes that so terrible?!`
` In fact, it still isn't nearly noisy enough!"`
`Another gold cyclone rose up.`
` In its wake, three people with bunny ears came into view.`
`"Chiester Sisters Imperial Guards, right here!!"`
`"It's s‐such an honor to be summoned to a gathering such as this!"`
`"I haven't had nearly enough fun for it to end yet nyeh.`
` Nihi{0}hi{0}hihi!"`
`"There, I agree with you.`
` But fear not, for our game will continue much longer than this."`
`"For eternity, inside the cat box.`
` Glad to have you here, Chiester Sisters."`
`"Lord {f:5:Battler}, allow me to express our deep gratitude for your invitation.`
` In the future, we will endeavor to show even more—"`
`"Come on, don't be so stiff and formal.`
` Tonight, we're all equal!"`
`"That's right nyeh!!`
` Battler gets it nyeh, nihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi!!"`
`"S‐stop it, 410.`
` You're getting carried away... We'll get in trouble!"`
`"Hey there, Riiche.`
` Long time no see!`
` Wow, how long's it been since we've had so many of us here?"`
`"Not since Natsuhi's trial, right?`
` And you could hardly call that a party!"`
`"If you're talking about a party!"`
`"You'd better not try and leave us out of it!"`
`"......Dang, just how many of them are there?"`
`"If they keep coming like this, there'll be more of them than us humans..."`
`"You can come out now, Sakutaro!"`
`"Uryuu!!"`
`"Lord {f:5:Battler}.`
` It was an honor to receive your {f:5:invitation}."`
`""Let it be known that it is an honor.""`
`"Hey!`
` Glad you came.`
` It's been a long time. How've you been?"`
`"Very well, thank {f:5:you}.`
` Fighting with you all is always the most {f:5:fun}.`
` I have had enough of stamping {f:5:documents}."`
`"For the attention of Supervisor Dlanor:`
` Know that your to‐do box is piling up as we speak."`
`"For your attention: Please make haste with the approval of our vacation papers.`
` We are anxious to see this matter resolved."`
`"Pft, wahahahaha!`
` Sounds like life in the Great Court is as restrictive as ever!"`
`"......Lord {f:5:Battler}.`
` I fear I must bring you some unfortunate {f:5:news}."`
`"Hm, what is it?"`
`Dlanor held out an envelope.`
`It was one of the invitation cards that Battler had sent out for this night's party.`
`The name on the card was......Furudo Erika.`
`".........We did all we {f:5:could}."`
`The invitation was filled with stamps bearing the unreadable words of various foreign countries.`
`Even without reading them, it was easy to guess that it had been returned to sender, destination unknown.`
`"I see......`
` Thanks for trying so hard."`
`"The depths of oblivion are like an empty endless desert, or perhaps the bottom of the {f:5:sea}.`
` ......Her location is unknowable to all but Lady {f:5:Bernkastel} {f:5:herself}..."`
`"I did send invitations to those witches too.`
` ......We'll have to hope they have the kindness to bring her along..."`
`"......Lady {f:5:Bernkastel} is just like a cat.`
` She'll show up whenever she feels like it, and when she doesn't feel in the mood, she'll never come no matter how often you call her."`
`"Ahhaha, yeah, that kid's totally like a cat.`
` She'll come to get her food, but she won't let you pet her head."`
`"{f:5:Lambdadelta}.`
` So, you came."`
`"Believe it or not, I'm a busy person, okay?`
` Still, I am Beato's guardian.`
` Wasn't I your guardian too?`
` So, anyway, you know, I've got "responsibilities" and all that.`
` And I happened to be in the neighborhood, so I stopped by!"`
`"Hey, you, Gohda!`
` I've brought a bunch of stuff for everyone!`
` Could you just put these wherever for me?"`
`For someone who just dropped by because she was in the neighborhood, she had brought an awful lot of colorfully wrapped bottles and food boxes.`
`"{f:5:Bernkastel} isn't here yet."`
`"You really think she'd come?`
` She's not the kind of kid who'd just drop by to say "hi" at a game she's lost."`
`"......Probably.`
` After all, she is very proud."`
`"I seem to remember her putting us through hell,`
` but she's still one of the players in this game.`
` Might as well have her over to celebrate the final night of the final game."`
`"You're right.`
` Without that kid, this game might not have reached its conclusion.`
` Enemies and allies are the bare minimum needed to establish a game."`
`"True.`
` Without a foe, there can be no game."`
`"At least I can enjoy defeat as just another part of the game.`
` That kid can't.`
` ......Too bad, but she's been through a lot.`
` So please, don't blame her too harshly."`
`"Actually, I was planning to thank her.`
` ......A lot of crazy stuff happened, but thanks to her, we were able to make it to where we are today."`
`"......Thanks.`
` I don't know when I'll see her next,`
` but if I'm lucky, I'll get my chance in a few hundred years.`
` I'll let her know what you said then.`
` Ah, that's right.`
` They don't have invitations, but I've brought two guests with me."`
`"Guests?`
` Who?`
` I'm pretty sure I sent invitations to all the usual suspects..."`
`"Come on over, you two!`
` I'll introduce you."`
`When Lambda snapped her fingers, the empty air exploded and two figures appeared.`
`".........Willard, if it isn't {f:5:you}!"`
`"Hey.`
` I see you're as short as ever."`
`"......Now here are some unfamiliar guests.`
` Who are they?"`
`"Owowow... Quit...pinching...my ass!"`
`"Shouldn't we be introducing ourselves first?`
` I'm fairly certain that Battler‐kun and the others in this world don't know about us."`
`"You have the mark of the One‐winged Eagle on your clothes.`
` Are you an Ushiromiya...?"`
`"My name is Ushiromiya Lion.`
` In my world, we're cousins."`
`"Let me introduce Lion!`
` This is the successor to the Ushiromiya family headship, who only appears in a world of extremely low probability.`
` In that world, Jessica isn't an only child.`
` She's Lion's little sister."`
`"Now there's a surprise...`
` There's really a world like that......?"`
`"........................`
` Wait, you couldn't be......"`
`"Pleased to meet you, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` I know quite a lot about you."`
`".............................."`
`"Seeing you smiling happily is the greatest joy I can imagine.`
` ......I'm more glad than anyone that you've made it to this point."`
`"......I see.`
` ......So, it's you......`
` ......I'm glad you're here......"`
`Beato realized who and what Lion was.`
`The two of them stared at each other's faces, as though looking at their own face in a mirror.`
`"Willard's the name.`
` I'm just a passing stranger who got caught up in a game you know nothing about."`
`"He is an Inquisitor of the Great Court, like {f:5:myself}.`
` A truly great one, though he is now {f:5:retired}."`
`"I see. If you're Dlanor's friend, you can't be anyone bad.`
` Please, make yourself at home."`
`"Just where did these two come from?"`
`"Bern brought them in and made them pieces.`
` ......When she was done with them and about to crush them, I picked them up.`
` Auau said she didn't want to be left with a bad aftertaste."`
`"Is that okay?`
` If, by chance, Lady {f:5:Bernkastel} does drop by here..."`
`"On this game board, they're my pieces, okay?`
` And I'd love to see the look on that kid's face if she bumps into them in a place like this.`
` *giggle*giggle*giggle*!"`
`"......I don't really get it, but you obviously brought them here for some shady reason."`
`"That's all for my gifts.`
` And now I'll just kick back and enjoy the party.`
` So, you're the host... Over to you."`
`"Come, Lord {f:5:Battler}!"`
`"If you don't announce it, we can't start!"`
`""The start of tonight's party at the end of this long, long game!!""`
`"Ladies and gentlemen, your silence please!!`
` Our territory lord, Lord {f:5:Battler}, has a message he wishes to convey to you all...!"`
`"Enough of that.`
` It's embarrassing."`
`"Come on, it's a wife's responsibility.`
` I'm not letting anyone else take it!"`
`Beato sulked and handed Battler a glass of champagne.`
`In fact, everyone had a glass in their hands now.`
`"Maria, you're a kid, so drink some juice instead!"`
`"Uu!!`
` I want champagne too!"`
`"Hey, Maria‐chan, why don't we drink some juice together?"`
`"Battler, our drinks are getting warm!"`
`"Agreed.`
` Begin, Battler."`
`"No objections, I see.`
` This way please, Lord {f:5:Battler}."`
`Ronove motioned towards the center of the room.`
`When Battler stepped forward, everyone silently awaited his words.`
`"Glad you could all make it!!`
` This marks the end of my long game with Beato...!`
` I've invited everyone who has been a part of this game as a piece, a player, or a Game Master!`
` I hope you'll enjoy this unending night to the fullest!!"`
`Cheers.`
`""Cheeeeeeeeeeers!!""`
`Everyone raised their glasses to the heavens as they cheered, and afterward, the soft sound of glasses clinking together rang out across the room......`
`.........Only I......was apart from all the fun noise.`
`Maybe that was what did it.`
`Before I realized it, my cheeks were wet with tears.`
`I was lying on a sofa, covered by a blanket.`
`......I can just barely remember getting sleepy and falling asleep in a chair.`
`Someone probably carried me here.`
`I can't actually hear them, ......but I get the feeling that everyone's still in the hall, having a good time.`
`......I...want to go there too.`
`No.`
`I will go.`
` Over there.`
`......It's what I've wanted the whole time, ......but I've never tried to take the first step.`
`I'll go to where everyone is.`
`My head still feels hazy, ......so there aren't any complicated thoughts in my mind.`
`But that's okay.`
` It's okay if my head's empty.`
`I'll be together with everyone.`
` I'll go to where they are.`
` ......That's all that matters.`
`I got up from the sofa and put on my shoes, which had been placed neatly for me to find.`
`Let's go.`
` To where everyone is.`
`The parlor door was shut.`
`......I tried to open it, but maybe because of my clumsiness, I couldn't get it open.`
`It was a bit creepy, as though the bad dream I'd just had was continuing.`
`".........It won't open.`
` Why?`
` It isn't even locked..."`
`This was beginning to irritate me.`
`The knob that locks and unlocks the door is on this side.`
`{n}I should be able to lock or unlock the door by twisting it.`
`I turned it.`
` Click.`
`The door won't open.`
`......Did I accidentally lock it just now?`
`I turned it.`
` Click.`
`The door won't open.`
`......It didn't open the last time, so it should have opened this time, ......but it didn't.`
`{n}Now I have no idea which way is unlocked.`
`I kept on alternating between turning the lock and roughly twisting the doorknob.`
`I started to become genuinely annoyed, wondering why they'd locked me away behind such an inconvenient door.`
`Eventually, I ran out of patience and pounded hard on the door, but that noise didn't bring anyone over.`
`Why am I locked up in a place like this, all alone?!`
`And everyone else is having a fun party, right there in the hall...!`
`Let me out of here...!!`
`At that moment, .........a cold wind blew past me.`
`The wind rippled through my hair.`
`Wind? Inside......?`
`I turned around......to find the window curtain waving about.`
`There was a high‐pitched squeal.`
`......At some point, the double window had opened outwards toward the darkness.`
`The icy wind that came through it......told me that this window was the only exit from this room.`
`Huh?`
`I suddenly realized that the darkness beyond the open window was glaring at me, and my tiny heart leapt.`
`......A cute jingling sound rang out.`
`I finally understood.`
` That sound was a cat's bell.`
`The glaring emerald eyes in the darkness......were those of a cat standing in the open window.`
`Its pitch‐black, luxuriant fur blended in with the darkness easily, leaving only the eyes visible.`
`......Did the Ushiromiya family own a cat?`
`{n}It has a bell on it, so it can't be a stray.`
` It's a cat someone owns.`
`At any rate, the cat was standing by the window......and staring straight at me.`
`".........Who...are you......?"`
`Of course, the cat didn't answer my question.`
`I didn't think it was a cute cat, ......but I thought it might be trying to tell me something, ......so I approached it slowly.`
`Then, the cat did an about face, turning its back to me.`
`It then turned its head to look at me, almost as though it was telling me to follow it, and it leapt down into the darkness, leaving the jingle of its bell behind.`
`When I peeked out the window, I saw the cat waiting for me under the pounding rain.`
`......I finally realized.`
`This window was the only exit out of this locked‐room parlor.`
`{n}That cat had surely come to tell me that.`
`The longer I keep standing around here, the longer the cat will have to wait in the rain.`
`That's no good.`
` It'll catch cold.`
`I climbed up onto the windowsill and went out the window.`
`The wind was strong, and the rain was cold, but I didn't get as wet as I'd thought I would.`
`{n}I might have been in the mansion's shadow.`
`When the cat saw that I was outside, it walked along the wall of the mansion as if guiding me.`
`It quickly disappeared into the blackness, but every now and then, it would turn around and set the bell jingling to let me know it was there.`
`Eventually, a window with light seeping out came into view.`
`It was the window to the hall.`
`When I peeked inside, I saw everyone having a good time.`
`{n}I couldn't hear their voices, but they were all right there.`
`"Open up...!`
` Open up!!"`
`I pounded on the window, but no one heard.`
`......Maybe the window was really thick, or maybe it was just noisy inside.`
` ......Or, it might have been so dark outside that even I blended in with the darkness.`
`In any event, no matter how much I hit the window, it didn't look as though anyone noticed.`
`By this point, my loneliness was giving way to anger.`
` Why don't you notice me? Why did you lock me up in that room all alone?`
`I've had enough.`
`{n}I'll just get inside somehow and yell at everyone.`
`When the cat realized that I had given up knocking on the window, it led me onwards with another jingle.`
`......But just where is this cat going?`
`I know it's following the wall of the mansion.`
`{n}But that's not the way to the front door.`
`The front door might be locked.`
`I'm sure the cat knows a place that I can get into the mansion from...and is leading me there.`
`Away from the light seeping from the hall,`
` ......and towards the blackness lit only dimly by the lights in the garden, ......the cat and I continued to walk.`
`Then, .........I found it.`
`An open...window.`
`The cat stood below it and looked between me and the window, as though telling me to go inside.`
`"Thanks, kitty‐cat.`
` I want to give you some milk to thank you.`
` Won't you come with me?"`
`When I walked closer to pick the cat up, it slipped away from my hands and flew into the bushes in a nearby flower bed.`
`Then, as though it really had melted away into the darkness inside the bush, all traces of it vanished.`
`No matter how much I strained my ears, I couldn't hear the sound of that bell......`
`Suddenly, the wind changed directions, and the rain started to hit me fiercely.`
`{n}I can't stay in a place like this forever.`
`".........I'll go inside.`
` ......What room is this, I wonder..."`
`I climbed up onto the windowsill and entered the room.`
` Then, the window silently shut and locked itself.`
`......Good. That saves me the trouble of doing it myself.`
`The room was completely dark.`
` However, as my eyes got used to the darkness, I was able to make out a few things.`
`It was a large room.`
` There was a long table, and many chairs.`
`{n}......It was...the dining hall.`
`Perhaps because I realized this and was relieved, I was suddenly unable to see again.`
`I searched blindly along the wall for the light switch.`
`Then, finally, I felt a familiar shape.`
`......Wouldn't it be annoying if I pushed this, and the light didn't come on?`
`Click.`
`In fact, ......it was nearly the opposite, and an annoyingly bright light filled the dining hall and made my eyes hurt.`
`I slowly opened my tightly shut eyes.`
`...............And then,`
`......I saw the state the room was in.`
`The dining hall was covered with blood......and there were people......many people......lying on the floor......`
`Then, .........I realized that two of them were my own parents.`
`"Hey, are you having a great time, people?!!"`
`"Any kids who aren't having a good time'll get eaten!"`
`""Yell and sing the praises of tonight's banquet!!`
` Ahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!""`
`The hall was alive with a mingling of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s and residents of magical fantasy.`
`At first, everyone stayed with their own groups, too nervous to mingle.`
`However, as time passed, people started to move around, and both halves began to chat happily together.`
`"Anyway, they never listen, do they?!"`
`"Leadership's important.`
` You've gotta lead by example if you want anyone to follow you!"`
`"Maybe some subordinates are like that, but I've never had any success with ordinary methods..."`
`"All I know is, if your subordinates don't take you seriously, you're done for!`
` It's important to scold people loudly for some small mistake every once in a while, in front of everyone else."`
`"You can't do that! It'll just make everyone scared...!`
` A leader has to be an example for everyone to follow.`
` I'll tell you what makes a leader!`
` Yadda yadda yadda..."`
`The vegeta‐lion expounded his views on leadership to the attentive ears of those around him.`
`Everyone was now pleasantly drunk and unusually animated in conversation.`
`"Kyrie!!`
` Why do you get stronger the more jealous you are?!"`
`"Don't make it sound so bad.`
` If I want something, I won't let it slip away.`
` I always put that theory into practice. Nothing more to it."`
`"Thanks for waiting, everyone.`
` Even more food is on the way."`
`"......Nnngaahhh...!`
` Butting in on the running of the family party like this...`
` ...And yet, while I hate to admit it, every movement of his is flawless.`
` Just what sort of hotel did he train at......"`
`"It's no use trying to compete with Ronove‐sama, he's totally perfect.`
` But I still love you more, Gohda.`
` This one's been cooked juuust right{p:0:♪}"`
`The Seven Sisters had blended into the party perfectly, and were making things interesting.`
`"And yet, there are a great many mysteries that are called masterpieces, and which are also discredited by Van Dine's Twenty Rules."`
`"It's not like I'm discrediting anything.`
` ......The purpose of a mystery novel is your own amusement.`
` If you have fun, that's all that matters."`
`"Know that even the great Wizard‐hunting Wright has gone quite soft."`
`"......Both literature and forms of amusement change their guidelines with the times.`
` Surely, mystery novels are no different."`
`After Will explained his stance on mystery novels, everyone had a comment to make.`
` The conversation showed no sign of running dry.`
`"Yes, that is a fitting attitude for a beginner.`
` However, at that rate, you'll never become a key player in your organization."`
`"But...know that rules exist to be followed..."`
`"Just let the new beginners do that.`
` Don't forget that rules are more like instructional guidelines for the new guys to learn from."`
`"You said it.`
` You can't really call yourself qualified until you learn how to move outside the rules.`
` You've still got a long way to go if you're letting the rules hold you back."`
`"I can't stand letting other people do the work!`
` I'm Mammon the Covetous!`
` I'll do all the jobs myself!"`
`"That's some spirit you've got there.`
` How much are they paying you for being a Sister of Purgatory?`
` Come and get a job at my husband's business. I'll recommend you personally."`
`The {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s and the residents of fantasy were now completely on casual terms.`
`"I, I see...... So this is how it's done in the world of witches......"`
`"Yeah nyeh, you've got it nyeh!`
` Where we come from, you pour the tea onto the saucer, press your palms on the table, and slurp it up like a dog nyeh!"`
`"Wh‐what the hell are you teaching her?! Who does things like that?!`
` And Natsuhi, what do you think you're doing, getting tricked like that, and at your age!!"`
`"Satan...!`
` How can you be so rude to Natsuhi‐san...!!`
` .........Huh?`
` Wh‐why are you crying, Satan?`
` D‐...did I scold you too hard...?!"`
`"Chiester410‐san, make sure you never give my pure and trusting mother such a crazy idea again.`
` Don't worry, I made sure it wouldn't leave a mark."`
`410 started yelling about animal abuse, jumping around in circles and holding her butt.`
`"I wonder if there's a prince out there for me~!`
` I wanna have some hot, passionate love!"`
`"If I fell in love, could I be a beautiful princess too?"`
`"Of course!`
` Love is a miracle, power, a mineral!!`
` It grants you invincible strength!"`
`"......*giggle*.`
` The person who once claimed love equals lust seems to be saying something."`
`"Indeed.`
` It would seem she's getting her fill every night, heheheh!"`
`"Sh‐shut up, you perverts!!"`
`The circle surrounding Beato was always a lively one.`
`"I know how you feel.`
` It's only when we're given orders that we find meaning in our lives."`
`"I get nervous when I don't have any orders!`
` Someone order me to do something, or I'll die!"`
`"You can't have that attitude!`
` You've got to find your own meaning for your life, cut your own path!"`
`"That's right.`
` Your resolve has to be certain and absolute, you know?`
` Back when I was {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}, I lived like a daredevil all the time...!"`
`A bit shakily, {f:5:Lambdadelta} started talking about her theory of life.`
` Apparently, she'd also had her fair share of champagne.`
`"What a bizarre {f:5:scene}."`
`"*giggle*. It is, isn't it?`
` Dlanor‐sama, would you like some more to drink?"`
`"Something non‐{f:5:alcoholic}.`
` I am a kid, after {f:5:all}."`
`"Ah, Shannon‐chan, you'll do.`
` ......Do you have a second?"`
`Battler came back into the hall.`
` He was searching for a servant, and the first one his eyes met was Shannon.`
`"Of course, Battler‐sama.`
` Do you need something?"`
`"Sorry, but would you mind lending me the key to the parlor?"`
`"The...parlor...?`
` The master keys can open that, ......but why?"`
`"Well, I was just wondering if Ange was asleep, so I went over there.`
` The door was locked."`
`"Locked...?`
` After we carried Ange‐sama to the sofa, we shut the door, but we didn't lock it."`
`".........Ah, don't tell me Ange...`
` She must have felt like she was being left out of the fun, and locked the door from the inside in a huff.`
` Silly kid."`
`"*giggle*.`
` Shall we unlock it, then?"`
`"Yeah, sorry about the trouble,`
` but that would be good."`
`Battler and Shannon left the hall together.`
`In the hall, {f:5:Lambdadelta} started suggesting that they all have another quiz tournament together.`
`Apparently, the Witch of Certainty would be handing out prizes.`
` Everyone seemed enthusiastic about the idea.`
`Smiling contently at the ensuing uproar, Battler headed towards the parlor.`
`".........It really is locked.`
` Shall I open it?"`
`"Hmmm......`
` I didn't knock on the door in case she was asleep, but if she locked it, that proves she was awake.`
` ......Let's try knocking once."`
`Battler knocked on the door and called Ange's name.`
`{n}However, there was no response from the other side.`
`He pressed his ear against the door, listening carefully, but there was no hint of Ange unhappily throwing a cushion at it.`
`"She might have fallen asleep after having her little tantrum.`
` ......Could you open it for me?"`
`"As you wish."`
`Shannon took out her master key and unlocked the door.`
`{n}Then, she stepped back to let Battler go through.`
`"......Ange...`
` I'm coming in......"`
`Speaking a quiet voice to avoid waking Ange if she was asleep, Battler opened the door.`
`Then, just as the door was opened, a chilly breeze drifted by.`
`The breeze, which felt like outside air, immediately caught the attention of the pair, and they looked at each other.`
`......It could be seen at a glance that Ange wasn't in the parlor.`
`The curtains to the wide‐open window fluttered about.`
`"Ange......? ......Ange......?"`
`A blanket lay crumpled up on the sofa.`
`{n}It sat there just as Ange had left it after waking up.`
`The blanket was slightly warm.`
`Clearly, she had been here until a short while ago.`
`"Ange‐sama......?`
` ......Are you there......?"`
`She obviously wasn't playing hide‐and‐seek.`
` ......Ange was nowhere to be seen in the parlor.`
`Battler peered out the open window into the rainy blackness.`
`......So, she slipped out the window in this rain and went......where?`
`"Do you think Ange‐sama might have gone out the window......?"`
`"......That'd make her one hell of a sleepwalker."`
`Since she didn't leave via the main entrance, she probably doesn't even have an umbrella.`
`It was very hard to imagine any reason Ange could have for going outside in this weather.`
`............I have a bad feeling about this.`
`This shouldn't be happening.`
`{n}I'm the Game Master of this game board.`
`So why are we in a situation that the Game Master can't understand...?`
`A large bolt of lightning lit up my surroundings for an instant, but I was unable to see any trace of Ange......`
`"Okay, okay, now it's my turn to think of a question!`
` Umm, okay, so you have a third of a whole cake, a quarter of a cake, and a fifth of a cake all on a plate!`
` It takes thirty minutes to eat one whole cake, so how much is left on the plate when you've finished eating?!"`
`At that moment, there was a roar of thunder and the lights flickered.`
`The cheery voices vanished in an instant, like candles being blown out.`
`"......None.`
` That's a riddle you were tricked with once, isn't it?"`
`Amidst the silence, one voice rang out and answered Lambda's riddle.`
`The crowd parted, .........and the form of a girl, a thousand‐year‐old witch, came into view.`
`She had been invited.`
`She was an official guest, holding an invitation to this party......`
`"......Sorry I'm late.`
` I was just so caught up working out some festivities to liven up the party."`
`As {f:5:Bernkastel} spoke, she looked around at everyone...`
`".............................."`
`"Oh.`
` And I thought you'd wasted away in the sea of fragments."`
`"They're my pieces now.`
` Pretty cool, right?"`
`"......Hmph."`
`She stared at Lion and Will with an unnerving smile on her face, but she apparently lost interest quickly.`
`"Where's Battler? And Beato?`
` I'm a guest, aren't I?`
` Isn't there anyone to welcome me?"`
`".........I'm here."`
`"We did invite you,`
` but I didn't expect you to actually come.`
` ......I see, so this must be a miracle."`
`"Now there's an interesting thing to say.`
` *giggle*......`
` ............Why's everyone gotten so quiet?`
` This is a party, right?`
` Go ahead and be noisy just for the hell of it.`
` Or is welcoming me with silence supposed to be some kind of joke...?"`
`"Now it's your turn."`
`"......My turn for what?"`
`"You asked where I was.`
` So I told you.`
` Now it's your turn."`
`"What are you talking about?`
` Did something happen...?"`
`"Ange's gone.`
` Even I, the Game Master, don't know where she went."`
`"That's insane...!`
` Isn't this your game?!`
` That doesn't make sense...!"`
`".........If Ange disappearing isn't a scenario created by Battler,`
` .........that means there must be another Game Master."`
`"Is that even possible...?!"`
`"Oh, yes,`
` I was surprised myself.`
` ......Just when I opened the game board to start a delightful game of my own,`
` I found that Battler had started up this bizarre game at the same time.`
` ......Two Game Masters at once... It's a crazy world we live in, don't you think...?"`
`"In other words, ......you're admitting that you hid Ange away somewhere."`
`".....................`
`......It would seem so.`
` After all, no one could create a scenario not invented by the Game Master...except for another Game Master."`
`"Would this be......those festivities to liven up the party that you mentioned?"`
`"......All of you looked like you were having a blast with that quiz tournament.`
` So, I decided I wanted to join in."`
`"And you decided to hold Ange hostage to do that?"`
`"You've got it.`
` ......Battler, Beato.`
` I want to challenge you to a game.`
` You cannot refuse.`
` Not if you treasure Ange as a little sister, that is."`
`"............What do you want?"`
`"Lambda and I made a bet about the game between you and Beato.`
` ......I must acknowledge that I've lost.`
` At least, that I've lost to Lambda."`
`"*giggle*giggle*.`
` ......You try to act all dry, but you can really hold a grudge.`
` It's like this, right?`
` You're saying you lost to me, but not to Battler and Beato."`
`It seemed as though {f:5:Bernkastel} might smile.`
`{n}However, she didn't.`
`{n}Those cold eyes spoke without words.`
`Battler understood.`
`He had played so many games against Beato.`
`Those games had been a wordless message from Beato.`
`So he knew.`
` He understood.`
`"She wants to fight us.`
` ......Is that it?"`
`".........She will be a fearsome opponent."`
`"But we can't back out."`
`"I know that.`
` ......We mustn't let Ange become Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}'s plaything."`
`Beato understood as well.`
`She understood {f:5:Bernkastel}'s desire for one final battle...`
`".........I never thought I'd see you up front asking for a fair fight."`
`"Go on, laugh."`
`"Why?"`
`"Thanks."`
`".................."`
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} understood as well.`
`In these final moments before the end of Battler and Beato's tale, before everything was locked away in the cat box...`
`...{f:5:Bernkastel} had finally moved from the audience to the stage.`
`That witch who had hidden in the wings, unwilling to come out into the light, ......had shown the courage to step out onto the stage.`
`As a friend, {f:5:Lambdadelta} showed that she understood {f:5:Bernkastel}'s human emotions, which had given her this courage...`
`"Is there anything I can do?"`
`"Please act as an observer for my game."`
`"......Sure.`
` If you can promise you'll release Ange if we take part in your game."`
`"Of course.`
` Without such a promise, we are not obligated to go along with your farce...!"`
`"You might not be obligated, but that won't change the fact that Ange's not coming back..."`
`"In that case, you can enjoy being branded as a loser for the next few centuries."`
`"Beato, don't provoke her.`
` ......This isn't a fight we can back down from."`
`"......Y‐......yes."`
`From the moment a hostage was taken, their ability to negotiate had disappeared.`
`However, {f:5:Lambdadelta} was making {f:5:Bernkastel} promise to release Ange, in exchange for her agreeing to become an observer.`
`Without that promise, {f:5:Bernkastel} would have nothing to lose.`
`To make this final fight Bern wanted a proper one,`
` ......{f:5:Lambdadelta} made her agree to that promise.`
`".........Of course, Lambda.`
` I promise.`
` When the game ends, I'll release Ange."`
`"Don't make a fool of me, okay...?`
` When I get shamed, I never let go of the one who did it until they regret it......"`
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} spoke in a soft, threatening tone.`
`However, {f:5:Bernkastel} laughed lightly as though she found the look on {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s face adorable.`
`"I swear it.`
` ......I swear it on our friendship."`
`"......Whew."`
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} whistled and grinned.`
`Apparently, this was the most reliable oath {f:5:Bernkastel} could utter.`
`"Okay."`
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} nodded, looked between Battler and {f:5:Bernkastel}, and spoke.`
`"By the name of {f:5:Lambdadelta}, Witch of Certainty, I accept the role of observer for your fight.`
` ......Battler, Beato, you have no objections, right?"`
`After Battler and Beato nodded at each other, they nodded at {f:5:Lambdadelta} to show their determination.`
`".........I'm so glad.`
` We finally get to fight each other."`
`"I had a feeling I'd end up fighting you sooner or later."`
`"Since when?"`
`"...........................`
`......I'm not sure.`
` It might have been before I even learned your name."`
`Battler vaguely remembered her speaking to him, somewhere in an unconscious world he couldn't remember.`
`At the time, it had sounded like she was giving him advice for his fight with Beato.`
`But thinking back on it, it was a little different.`
`......She might have been a cat fighting from the sidelines, too scared to go out into the bright sunlight.`
`So, I had a vague premonition that, eventually, we would stand opposed to each other on the game board in some way......`
`"......She was always one of us players.`
` ......Now, at the very end, as the game board is being put away, she's finally found the courage to step up onto the stage.`
` ......I want to accept that brave challenge of yours.`
` ............By the name of that courageous girl who once was your piece."`
`"I forced Erika to fight a duel.`
` .........I wanted to win.`
` And, even more strongly, I didn't want to lose.`
` The fear of possibly tasting defeat tormented me.`
` .........And, thinking back on it, I envied you two back then."`
`"................................."`
`".........Erika was a great piece of yours...and my rival.`
` I won't forgive you for refusing to witness her last stand and laying her to rest in the depths of oblivion."`
`"Just what do you want me to do...?`
` Apologize to her?"`
`"Rescue her from the depths of oblivion.`
` And invite her to this party."`
`".........Erika...?`
` Rescue Erika.........?"`
`"I feel the same as Battler.`
` She may have been a piece who stood in opposition towards us, but she was only faithfully fulfilling her role.`
` There can be no game without an adversary.`
` ......She remains our enemy, but she's also an important friend to us."`
`"............Even though she made you suffer so much...?"`
`"We fought a fair fight.`
` The outcome may have changed our fates, ......but now that we've dueled each other, we'll always be friends."`
`"......................................."`
`"You want to be their friend too, don't you, Bern?`
` That's why you want a fair fight with them now, isn't it?"`
`"......Are you laughing at me?"`
`"We aren't."`
`"On the contrary, we welcome it."`
`".........Even though I've taken a hostage?"`
`"You probably wouldn't have come up onto the stage otherwise."`
`There had been no need to take a hostage.`
`Battler and Beato would have gladly accepted a final duel if {f:5:Bernkastel} had expressed a desire for one.`
`......It was hard to make out anything from {f:5:Bernkastel}'s silent expression.`
`"Okay."`
`".........What's okay?"`
`"......I'll release Erika from the depths."`
`"That must have taken a lot of resolve."`
`For someone as proud as {f:5:Bernkastel}, forgiving the piece who had caused her defeat should have been nearly unbearable.`
`Battler knew this, ......so he realized how much this bit of compassion had cost {f:5:Bernkastel}...`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} snapped her fingers, and a black cat slipped out of her shadow.`
`"I tossed her all the way into the deepest parts of oblivion.`
` .....She might be late in arriving."`
`"It matters not.`
` There's no danger of the food and drink running out."`
`"......Go, kitty.`
` ......Guide that kid here."`
`When she gave this order, the cat melted into the darkness, its bell jingling.`
`"I can hardly believe that you'd forgive Erika."`
`".........I don't plan on forgiving her.`
` So, she's not my piece anymore.`
` ......Anyone feel like picking her up?`
` After all, you already picked up Lion and Will."`
`"............{f:5:Bernkastel}.`
` You have my thanks."`
`"Then can we stop with the sentimentality?`
` I've already had as much as I can bear."`
`"Sure.`
` ......Where will we have the game?`
` I'm happy to have it here, with all the noise, or in the usual quiet spot, or wherever you like."`
`"......Lady {f:5:Bernkastel} has shown the courage to stand before a great many people already.`
` ......I see no point in making her suffer further."`
`"Good point.`
` .........Then let's make it the usual place."`
`"Any objections, Bern?"`
`"......None."`
`"Sorry, partygoers...!`
` We'll be heading out for a bit, but please continue to enjoy yourselves!`
` Zepar, Furfur!`
` Liven this place up!`
` When Erika gets here, let's have everyone give her a warm welcome."`
`""Yes, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}!!`
` Your wish is our command!!""`
`"Now then, let us take her to the usual room, a fitting place for our battle of wits...!"`
`When Battler snapped his fingers, space shattered.`
`They were now in the place where witches had once exhaustively debated, schemed, and reasoned: the witches' smoking room.`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} had been invited there once again, and a final game would now begin......`
`"......Do you have a game prepared?"`
`"Of course.`
` ......I worked hard on this game, and I'm pretty proud of it."`
`"So, Bern will be the Game Master, and Battler and Beato will be the players?`
` The usual game, where Bern creates a murder tale, and the two players have to reconstruct it with {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} tricks?"`
`"I'm interested to see what sort of scenario Lady {f:5:Bernkastel} develops."`
`"......We'll explain things with the blue truth, and you'll knock those down with the red truth.`
` Are we alright with those rules?"`
`".........My game will be a simpler one.`
` It's just a quiz of guessing the culprit.`
` ......I don't feel like trading red and blue with you."`
`"Oh...?`
` What kind of game will that be...?`
` Would you mind letting me have a look at it first?"`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} held her palm upwards...and a fragment glowing pale blue appeared there.`
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} held a hand over it and shut her eyes......`
`"......See?`
` It's a simple game, isn't it?"`
`"You're right......`
` It's much more straightforward than the mind games these two played in the past.`
` This isn't even a game about witches and {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s anymore."`
`"That's right.`
` This is a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} game."`
`".........This is surprising.`
` To take on the fantasy that is Beato...you've created a genuine mystery."`
`"Please explain."`
`"It's extremely simple.`
` ......You'll watch the tale Bern has prepared for you.`
` There are several rules to it, but if you follow them as you read it through, it'll lead you to a Single Truth—in other words, an answer."`
`"So, ......it's an ordinary mystery novel?"`
`"I see...`
` In that case, there's no need for combat between red and blue truth."`
`In Beato's games, the argument was about whether it was a mystery or not.`
`However, {f:5:Bernkastel}'s game was a mystery.`
` There was no need to argue that from the start.`
`"I've even cut out the motive and the tricks.`
` ......There's only one question I'm asking you."`
`"Whodunit."`
`"......What a simple, yet fitting game to conclude our fight."`
`"Yeah.`
` ......No cheap tricks.`
` Just a stoically simple game."`
`"This is a genuine duel......"`
`"As the observer, I'll say this.`
` ......This game is "made to be solvable".`
` In other words, I guarantee that it's a suitable setting for your duel."`
`".........Bern, I know I keep on saying this,`
` .........but are you really sure?`
` ......Battler and Beato's relationship started because they both loved mystery.`
` ......I agree it's a pretty tricky scenario, ......but I'm not sure it'll be enough to stop these two......"`
`".........If my best tale can't stop them, then what comes will come."`
`"The important thing is that Lady {f:5:Bernkastel} put everything she had into this game."`
`"You're right.`
` Will that be enough to stump us?`
` That's all this simple game is about.`
` .........Thanks, Lambda.`
` Thanks to you, we know that this duel will be a fair fight."`
`"You're welcome.`
` I'm happy too.`
` ......It's very rare for Bern to bring a fight herself, and I'm honored to be here to see it."`
`"I am also honored to have you as an opponent."`
`"......Same here.`
` ......I underestimated you.`
` And I did it without even stepping into the battlefield.`
` Just thinking about it makes me want to vomit.`
` .........So let me fight."`
`"Mm.`
` Show us what you've got."`
`"If I win, I'll be able to look down on you for real this time.`
` ......And if I lose,`
` ......I'll surely be reminded of that emotion I know I've forgotten."`
`"Indeed."`
`"......{f:5:Bernkastel}.`
` Whether you win or lose, I'll promise you one thing."`
`"............What's that?"`
`"When this duel is over,`
` ......we'll be friends."`
`".........Hmph.`
` ..................Enough of that, please.`
` The sentimentality is killing me."`
`Lambda clapped her hands.`
` A pleasant sound rang out.`
`"Will you be the Reader, Bern?`
` Or shall I take on the role...?"`
`".........I don't need a Reader."`
`"Huh?"`
`"......A Reader miko can use her own voice to embellish or distort the tale.`
` ......Even if there was no cheap trickery in my game, by having a Reader, any amount of trickery could be added."`
`"Yes, that is true.`
` ......That's another of the Game Master's privileges."`
`"I want to have a straightforward duel with you.`
` .........So, I don't need a Reader.`
` You can read this tale with your own eyes and ears."`
`"Are you sure...?!`
` That means you've lost almost all of your advantages...!"`
`"............Got it.`
` You don't need a Reader.`
` We'll read the tale ourselves."`
`"If there is no Reader, .........doesn't that mean there will be absolutely no falsehoods in the narrated text?"`
`"We're ready, {f:5:Bernkastel}."`
`".............................."`
`"A showdown over a genuine mystery, without any cheap tricks.`
` .........If you're going to play fair and square, we'll challenge you head on too."`
`".........Thank you.`
` ......And I don't plan on losing either."`
`"Tsk, tsk, tsk.`
` That's no good, Lady Bern."`
`"......?"`
`"She's right.`
` If you're a witch challenging us with a mystery, it's no good having an attitude like that. Yeah, it's no goddamn good at all...!"`
`{f:5:Bernkastel}, realizing what Battler and Beato were asking for, snorted.`
` {f:5:Lambdadelta} nodded at her, telling her to enjoy this final duel to the fullest.`
`"Heheheheh....... Ahahahahahahahah......`
` A {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} and a witch discussing a mystery side by side?!`
` It's ridiculous! Ludicrous!`
` Let's see if your cheery take on mysteries can handle mine!`
` I challenge you to solve my mystery!!"`
`"That is more like it!`
` We'll take your challenge, Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}, Witch of Miracles!"`
`"Alright, time to start!!`
` I, Game Master Ushiromiya Battler,`
` and {f:5:Beatrice}, the Endless Witch, will be your opponents!`
` Don't start crying when we wipe the floor with you!!"`
`"Take this! Behold a mystery from {f:5:Bernkastel}!!!"`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} took the fragment holding the game and smashed it against the table, shattering it with a brilliant light as the game's scenario laid itself out.`
`The curtain rose.........on the mystery {f:5:Bernkastel} had created......`
`No sound but that of the falling rain filled the room.`
`It covered the tragic scene in the bloody dining hall......`
`".............................."`
`At some point, Ange had fainted and fallen to the floor.`
`Now, her consciousness was slowly returning, ......forcing her to remember what had happened in this room.`
`So, she reflexively averted her gaze even before the memory overtook her.`
`Six bodies lay in the blood‐stained dining hall.`
`Strangely enough, as her consciousness returned bit by bit, the terrifying scene before her seemed somehow less intense.`
`So, this time, Ange was able to look at the six corpses well enough to make out who they were.`
`First, ......there were her own parents.`
` ......They were a pitiful sight, colored bright red by a bloody makeup.`
`Next to them, that's Uncle Hideyoshi......and Auntie Eva.`
`Both Uncle Hideyoshi, the uncle who always said something funny and made me laugh......and Auntie Eva, the aunt who seemed to be so fond of me,`
` ......are lying there dead...`
`Genji‐san, the servant, is lying over there.`
`And, the one lying right here......is Auntie Rosa.`
`Six people.`
`A full six people......had their lives taken from them...and are lying in this room......`
`Maybe I had cried myself out before I fell unconscious.`
` ......The scene before me was still terribly painful, ......but I was somehow able to look at it without losing my head.`
`So, I'd already felt all the sadness I could at my parents' deaths.`
`The next emotion that rose up inside me......was a desire to check and see that everyone else was okay.`
`In that instant, ......Ange heard a scraping sound.`
`Thinking she must have imagined it, she was about to relax when she heard the sound once more.`
`It was probably coming from the door.`
`{n}Someone was clawing at the door from the outside.`
`Of course, she had no way of knowing who it was.`
`However, for some reason, she was sure that it was that black cat scratching at the door.`
`......The black cat was telling her to leave this room.`
`Ange understood and put her hand on the doorknob.`
`............?`
`I immediately noticed something odd.`
` The door was locked.`
`The same bad feeling I'd felt after being locked in the parlor crawled up my spine.`
`......However, unlike the time in the parlor, this door unlocked itself easily when I turned the knob.`
`I unlocked it...and slowly opened the door......`
`Beyond the door, .........I could see the dimly‐lit hallway, and a cat dashing down it away from me.`
`Then, it stopped, its emerald eyes glittering in the darkness, ......as though it was waiting for me to follow.`
`"...................................."`
`The hallway was dark......and dominated by an eerie silence.`
`When the black cat saw that I was coming, it walked forward as if guiding me.`
`I could hear nothing except the creaking of the floor, the jingling of the cat's bell,`
` ......and the howling of the storm outside.`
`......The party is being held in the hall.`
`I should be able to hear at least a little of the noise from this hallway......`
`".........Maybe it got really late......while I was passed out in the dining hall..."`
`It was a reasonable conclusion.`
` Then, we finally reached the main hall.`
`......The hall was frigid, and no trace of that party atmosphere remained.`
`Could all of that fun have been......just an illusion......?`
`The black cat's bell rang out.`
`When I looked up, I saw it had its feet on the stairway to the second floor, urging me to follow it.`
`".........Are we going up to the second floor...?"`
`The black cat seemed to nod, then silently ascended the stairs.`
`......Guests were allowed to go wherever they wanted on the first floor,`
` but the second floor was Uncle Krauss's family's house, and I remembered getting in trouble for trying to go up there.`
`However, at that moment, I couldn't think of any options...other than following that cat......`
`I walked along the dark hallway with the black cat.`
`{n}Eventually, we reached one of the doors.`
`The black cat scratched at the door, then turned to look at me.`
`{n}......It must have been telling me to open it.`
`"Okay......`
` ......I'll open it for you......"`
`I put my hand on the doorknob......and felt the resistance of a lock again.`
`This door is locked.`
` ......I turned around to tell the cat this, ......but...inexplicably...`
`a single key lay right in front of the cat.`
`Ange picked it up and stuck it in the keyhole.`
`......It was then that she finally noticed a strange sensation on her fingertips.`
`Blood.`
`Somehow, Ange's fingertips were stained red with blood.`
`She let out a short cry and dropped the key that she had just removed from the keyhole.`
`She finally realized.`
` In the darkness, she hadn't noticed before.`
`{n}The black cat's key......was covered with blood......`
`......The emotions that had gone numb in Ange sprang back.`
`A terrified scream rang out through the dark hallway......`
`Even so, Ange would eventually open that door.`
`That door......led to Natsuhi's room.`
`Natsuhi's room was a terrible mess.`
`Blankets and sheets were torn.`
`Cosmetics and books lay all over the place, as though a typhoon had just ripped through it.`
`And......there were the corpses.`
`Krauss and Natsuhi's corpses lay sprawled on the floor......`
`Very shortly, Ange will step into this room.`
`{n}She will then scream in terror once more......`
`And it isn't just the dining hall and Natsuhi's room.`
`In the stormy rose garden, .........Shannon's corpse lies exposed to the rain.`
`......Partway down the path to the rose garden...is Jessica's corpse.`
`When Ange finds that, she'll probably dash crying and screaming into the guesthouse.`
`And......death awaits her inside the guesthouse as well.`
`Just inside the front door...is Nanjo's corpse.`
`In the servant room nearby, even Gohda and Kumasawa lie dead.`
`......The total number of corpses...is thirteen.`
`A full thirteen corpses are waiting for Ange.`
`They wait in the mansion and the guesthouse on this desolate Rokkenjima...`
`...for Ange, exposed to the wind and rain and tormented by thunder, to find them......``The tragedy of the first twilight was discovered at 6:00 in the morning on the following day.`
`Gohda, who had woken up to get breakfast ready, went to check on the adult siblings, who had remained in the dining hall since the previous night because of the family conference.`
`"Talk about when you discovered the crime."`
`"{p:42:The dining hall was locked up}.`
` Of course, there is a lock on the doors to the dining hall, but they usually remained unlocked.`
` I knocked, but there was no answer..."`
`"{p:42:That's when I arrived}.`
` I recommended that he try unlocking the door, just in case."`
`"When {p:42:I unlocked the door with a master key}, a terrifying sight awaited me inside......"`
`"{p:42:Eva‐sama, Hideyoshi‐sama, Rudolf‐sama, Kyrie‐sama, Rosa‐sama, and Genji‐san,`
` six people in all, were lying there, covered in blood......}"`
`"A great tumult followed.`
` {p:42:Everyone gathered in the dining hall}."`
`"I don't want to remember it...`
` The sight of all the sobbing children crouched over the corpses of their own parents..."`
`"There was a chance they might've been alive still.`
` ......Everyone was shaking them desperately."`
`"But it was no use...`
` {p:42:The death of each parent was confirmed by their own child}..."`
`"{p:42:Doctor Nanjo and I confirmed that Genji‐sama was dead}."`
`"It was such a terrible way to be killed......`
` {p:42:Doctor or not, no one examining a body will reach the wrong conclusion}."`
`"Looks like {p:42:all of the victims died instantly}.`
` ......Kihi{0}hi{0}hihi."`
`"{p:42:After inspecting the interior of the dining hall, we determined that all of the doors and windows had been locked, making it a locked room}."`
`"And {p:42:nothing suspicious was found inside the dining hall}."`
`"Of course, {p:42:there was no one hiding in the dining hall either}."`
`"Naturally.`
` All of us are here right now.`
` {p:42:It's clear that no one is hiding}."`
`"But Dad, if that's true, it doesn't make sense...`
` Six people were killed, and the dining hall's a locked room!`
` How could someone have killed them and escaped?!"`
`"......I'd rather not think of it,`
` but perhaps the servants with their master keys are the most suspicious."`
`"They killed the six, then left and locked the door with their master keys.`
` ......It is a logical theory."`
`"E‐eeek!`
` Th‐that's absurd!"`
`Since there was no chance of the culprit hiding inside the dining hall,`
` it made sense to assume that the culprit had locked the door after committing the murder and exiting the room.`
`It was only natural that the servants, with their master keys, would fall under suspicion.`
`And, sadly enough, none of the servants had an alibi.`
`Then again, it wasn't only the servants. Everyone else lacked an alibi as well.`
`"Is there any way to lock up from the outside without a master key?"`
`"No, there isn't.`
` .........Hmm, that's not enough.`
` I'll say it with the red truth."`
`{p:1:All doors can only be locked or unlocked with a master key}.`
` {p:1:Of course, it is possible to lock or unlock the doors from inside the room even without a master key}.`
`"There you have it.`
` Any other questions?"`
`"Shouldn't there be keys to each individual room in addition to the master keys?"`
`"......Normally, those would exist.`
` However, they'd make the game more complicated, so I've eliminated them.`
` Red truth.`
` {p:1:In this game, we'll consider master keys to be the only keys that exist}."`
`"In other words,`
` all of the locks that appear in this game can only be locked or unlocked by master keys."`
`"That's how it is.`
` It really is a simple game."`
`"In that case, we should now check the number of master keys and who holds them."`
`"{p:1:There are five master keys total.`
` One is held by each of the five servants}.`
` The keys'll be managed by a particular method.`
` {p:1:The servants keep the master keys on their person at all times, so it is impossible for them to be stolen, handed over, or used by any human other than themselves}."`
`"What the heck.`
` Now they're sounding less like keys and more like a fingerprinting system."`
`"That's an interesting metaphor.`
` ......In other words, in the world of this game, it isn't the master keys, but the five servants themselves that can lock or unlock doors."`
`"We tried to retrieve Genji‐san's master key, but had no luck."`
`"To prevent trouble later on, {p:42:we destroyed Genji's master key}."`
`This was the crime of the first twilight.`
`{n}The scene was the fully locked room of the dining hall.`
`None of the servants holding master keys have alibis.`
`{n}Then again, no one else has an alibi either......`
`Everyone returned to the parlor to discuss what should be done next.`
`The phones were out, so they couldn't contact the police.`
`Was the mysterious culprit hiding away somewhere, planning to attack their next victim at this very moment?`
`Or was the culprit in here with them, mentally sticking out their tongue and tasting their next prey?`
`None of them had alibis, and it was possible for any one of them to be a culprit...`
`However, that tense feeling didn't last long.`
`By midday, everyone got tired of arguing, and they decided to take a break.`
`Krauss and Natsuhi announced that they wanted to talk with each other alone and went up to the second floor.`
`That paved the way for everyone else to start going their separate ways, some breaking away to head to the bathroom, others to gaze at the endless rain.`
`However, no matter how much time passed, Krauss and Natsuhi were the only ones who didn't return.`
`Calls were sent to both Krauss and Natsuhi's rooms using the extension phone line, but there was no answer.`
`Something might have happened.`
`Everyone headed to Krauss's and Natsuhi's rooms together, ......and in Natsuhi's room, they found Krauss and Natsuhi lying sprawled on the floor.`
`"{p:42:Madam's room was locked}!`
` It's just like the dining hall!"`
`"After getting everyone's permission, {p:42:I unlocked the door}..."`
`"{p:42:Krauss‐sama and Natsuhi‐sama lay sprawled on the floor inside the room}."`
`"{p:42:Doctor Nanjo checked their pulse.`
` Then, he announced that the two of them had died instantly}."`
`"Correct.`
` {p:42:I confirmed both of their deaths.`
` There can be no doubt that they died instantly}."`
`"I searched all over the room, looking for a clue...!`
` In the end, {p:42:I found that the windows and doors were all locked, making it a locked room}."`
`"Another locked room!`
` And yet again, we servants who have master keys will be suspected...!"`
`"B‐but have no fear...!`
` After Madam began to suspect us, we started keeping an eye on each other!"`
`"{p:42:All of us servants were together the whole time}."`
`"{p:42:All of us servants can prove an alibi for all of the other servants}."`
`"Now that's interesting.`
` So, you're saying that this locked room is even more perfect."`
`".........In the case of the first locked room, no one had an alibi.`
` So, for this locked room, all of them have alibis."`
`"In this world, the servants themselves are living master keys.`
` As long as those servants have perfect alibis, locking Natsuhi's room is impossible..."`
`"We decided to preserve the crime scene as it was."`
`"{p:42:We put duct tape all over the outside of the doors and windows, sealing them}!"`
`"I'm sure the culprit left some sort of clue in this room!`
` {p:42:We made sure that no one would be able to enter or leave until the police arrived}!"`
`"Then, we did the same to the dining hall.`
` {p:42:We also sealed the dining hall in the same way}."`
`"We reached the conclusion that the entire mansion itself should be preserved.`
` {p:42:We also sealed the mansion itself, and all of us took refuge in the guesthouse}."`
`"They sealed the whole mansion?`
` Duct tape on all the windows?`
` They even used a ladder for the windows on the third floor?"`
`"......The game would get complicated otherwise, so I've simplified it.`
` {p:1:All of the windows have steel bars on them, so it is impossible to enter or leave by them}.`
` Therefore,`
` {p:1:we'll say that they can seal the whole mansion by sealing the two doors, the front one and the back one}."`
`"Got it. That makes it easy."`
`"What do you think?"`
`"Actually killing the two people in Aunt Natsuhi's room would be easy.`
` Someone just had to knock and get them to open the door.`
` However, they couldn't lock it afterwards."`
`"Only the servants can lock doors,`
` but all of the servants have alibis."`
`"Unless the servants are all in it together.`
` More importantly, the first twilight has me suspicious."`
`"You think that one of the six who died in the dining hall was actually alive and committed the crime?"`
`"It's because of Erika.`
` I can't help but be suspicious when people are examining corpses."`
`"So, you think that one of the first six victims was alive?"`
`"Yeah.`
` And afterwards, they killed Krauss and Natsuhi.`
` Then, they locked the door from the inside, hid inside the room, and found a good chance to escape."`
`"Hmm, that theory does make logical sense."`
`"......I'll say it in red.`
` {p:1:The culprit of the first twilight has definitely killed six people}."`
`"Then I'll take a shot with the blue truth.`
` Here is the true nature of this locked room.`
` {p:2:The culprit locked the door from the inside, then hid in Natsuhi's room.`
` Then, after everyone left, they found an opportunity to escape}."`
`".........Sure, I'll deny that in red.`
` {p:1:The group sealed the room at the same time they left.`
` No culprit joined the group as they left.`
` Also, all of the seals on Natsuhi's room, the dining hall, and the mansion itself will never be broken}."`
`"Heheheheheh.`
` In other words, you can't use that trick where they hide under the bed and slip out later."`
`"......Interesting.`
` Nice going, {f:5:Bernkastel}."`
`"Thanks."`
`This was the crime of the second twilight.`
`{n}The scene was Natsuhi's fully locked room.`
`This time, all of the servants with master keys have alibis.`
`The whole group, realizing the dangers of being inside the mansion, took shelter in the guesthouse......`
`All those who took refuge in the guesthouse decided to hole up in there until the typhoon passed.`
`There, if everyone watched everyone else, they should be able to prevent further crimes both from inside and outside.`
`However, they couldn't do that without any breaks until the typhoon passed.`
`Once again, their actions left a weak point open, and they were faced with yet another tragedy.`
`"Shannon‐chan and Kanon‐kun, who went outside on an errand, still haven't come back...!"`
`"George nii‐san got upset, so {p:42:we all went outside to look for them}."`
`"We found Shannon‐san lying there in the rose garden.`
` Oh, poor, poor Shannon‐san......"`
`"I prayed she was still alive.`
` However, {p:42:I was forced to acknowledge that she was dead}..."`
`"Of course, {p:42:I also examined her and confirmed her death}."`
`"When the two of them left, we were busy checking the locks around the guesthouse.`
` So, {p:42:not one of us has an alibi}...!"`
`"Me, kill her?!`
` How could I have killed her?!!"`
`"Yeah.`
` George onii‐chan couldn't kill her, uu."`
`"Later on, we learned that George nii‐san alone had an alibi.`
` {p:42:At least regarding Shannon's death, it was impossible for George nii‐san to be the murderer}."`
`"To turn it around,`
` {p:42:......anyone could have killed her besides George‐aniki}."`
`"To prevent the culprit from using it for any mischief,`
` {p:42:we destroyed the master key Shannon‐san had held on the spot}."`
`"......At the time Shannon is killed, Kanon goes missing forever.`
` .........{p:1:From now on, Kanon is treated as having been killed.`
` Also, Kanon's master key is treated as having been destroyed}."`
`"Well, it'd be tasteless to go into it, so I won't, but...`
`...given that Shannon's dead, I wouldn't really expect anything else."`
`"In other words,`
` we can say that Shannon and Kanon were killed at the same time, even though we're missing a corpse?"`
`"That's right."`
`"......Hmm.`
` Looks like the crimes are moving along."`
`This was the crime of the fourth twilight.`
`The scene was the rose garden.`
`There are no locks or doors.`
` It isn't a locked room.`
`{n}So, the master keys no longer have anything to do with this.`
`Then, the pace of the crimes began to accelerate......`
`The group took shelter in the guesthouse.`
`They carefully sealed all doors and windows, sealing themselves in a locked room.`
`However, several locked‐room murders had already occurred.`
`Could locking themselves in a locked room do anything more than invite another tragedy?`
`After arguing fiercely in the cousins' room about finding the culprit, they decided to go to the servant room to double‐check the testimonies of Nanjo, Kumasawa, and Gohda.`
`And there, ......they learned that a tragedy had occurred once more.`
`"{p:42:Judging by these wounds, Gohda‐san and Kumasawa‐san died instantly}, I believe.`
` Such a gruesome way to die..."`
`"Like hell they could survive after this...!`
` {p:42:Gohda‐san and Kumasawa‐san are both dead}!"`
`"Well, we have been busy, keeping a lookout and locking up and all that.`
` Once again, {p:42:none of us has an alibi}."`
`"That's not true.`
` Look.`
` ......Considering the way they were killed, the culprit would definitely get blood spatter on themselves."`
`"But Doctor Nanjo and all of the cousins have no blood on them."`
`"All of us...in other words, {p:42:the four cousins and Doctor Nanjo couldn't have killed Gohda‐san and Kumasawa‐san}."`
`"In that case, it's clear that the culprit is someone other than us."`
`"I guessed that someone might have snuck in, so I checked around, {p:42:but the guesthouse was still completely locked up}."`
`"Perhaps the culprit has a master key after all..."`
`"That's impossible.`
` {p:42:No master keys exist anymore except the two keys on the two people who lie dead here}."`
`"Since the two master keys that exist are here inside the guesthouse,`
` ......that makes this guesthouse a perfect locked room...!"`
`"Well, since someone's dead, it obviously wasn't perfect.`
` Kihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi......"`
`This was the crime of the fifth and sixth twilights.`
`{n}The scene was the locked room known as the guesthouse.`
`Gohda's and Kumasawa's master keys were also destroyed, meaning that all master keys had now been lost.`
`Now, no one could break into this locked room guesthouse.`
`At least, that should have been true......`
`This time, Doctor Nanjo was the one who was killed.`
`He was killed in the entrance hall of the guesthouse.`
`It was far too foolish of him to come here alone to check that everything was locked.`
`"{p:42:H‐he's dead...`
` He's been killed......}!"`
`"Even I...can say for sure that {p:42:this was an instant death}..."`
`"{p:42:Everything is locked up perfectly}.`
` How did it happen, if this is a locked room?"`
`"Then that means the culprit is one of us...!"`
`"Impossible!`
` Judging by the circumstances, {p:42:Maria, Battler, George nii‐san and I all couldn't have killed Doctor Nanjo}!"`
`"In the first place, {p:42:no one could kill Doctor Nanjo inside the guesthouse}!"`
`"And look at this.`
` Simply put, {p:42:this is proof that Doctor Nanjo didn't leave the guesthouse}...!"`
`"Then that means no one could kill Doctor Nanjo, right?`
` So why was he killed?"`
`No one could answer that innocent question.`
`This was the seventh twilight.`
`Once again, the crime scene was the locked room known as the guesthouse.`
`Various bits of evidence made this crime seem even more impossible.`
`Then, the tragedy reached the eighth twilight, the final one.`
`By now, it was clear that holing up wouldn't keep them safe.`
`Jessica might have chosen anger as a way to numb her fear.`
`She flew out of the guesthouse in a rage, searching for the murderer that she was sure hid somewhere outside.`
`George, Battler, and Maria hurriedly chased after her.`
`Then, outside the building, they found Jessica lying on the ground.`
`It was, as anyone could tell by looking, a gruesome corpse......`
`"Poor......Jessica‐chan.`
` {p:42:She probably died instantly}."`
`"{p:42:There's no way she could live through this}.`
` Kihihihihi."`
`"The three of us were together the whole time!`
` {p:42:George‐aniki, Maria and I couldn't have killed Jessica}!"`
`"Yeah.`
` {p:42:The three of us couldn't have killed Jessica}."`
`"As if Maria‐chan could kill someone.`
` {p:42:Maria‐chan couldn't kill anyone}."`
`"Kihihi, thanks.`
` {p:42:George onii‐chan couldn't kill an adult.`
` He could kill a kid though}.`
` Kihihihihihi."`
`"Ah, I don't understand it at all...!!`
` What the hell is going on here...?!!"`
`This was the eighth twilight.`
` The crime scene was...outside.`
`However, the three who chased after Jessica have alibis.`
`{n}George, Battler, and Maria couldn't have killed Jessica.`
`So, is there really someone hiding on this island apart from the Ushiromiya family......?`
`The curtain is lowered on this tale, for now......`
`"......That's all for my tale."`
`"It's pretty well made.`
` If you had a full‐on Reader, it'd stand up well against Beato's games."`
`"I agree there.`
` You did a good job."`
`"Well, the real work comes from taking this, "reading" it, and making it worthy of proper theatergoing."`
`"Still, I'm stumped.`
` On the face of it, the culprit has to be some mysterious person outside the Ushiromiya family."`
`"And that would be the same as acknowledging the existence of a witch.`
` ......We can also suspect the existence of some accomplices aiding the culprit."`
`"In the first place, what was that purple text all about?`
` A new rule?"`
`"......I call them "purple statements".`
` It's a rule I made to make the story a bit easier to follow.`
` ......Just think of the purple statements as important spoken statements.`
` ......In other words, you might be able to ignore the spoken statements that aren't purple."`
`"Oho......`
` Well, that's nice of you."`
`"Then, are the purple statements as reliable as red truth?"`
`"Yes.`
` You can think of the purple statements as having the same power as red truth.`
` .........However, there's one exception.`
` The culprit can tell lies with purple statements."`
`"......I see.`
` To turn it around, anyone who isn't a culprit can't tell lies."`
`"Purple statements.`
` ......These seem to be the key to Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}'s game."`
`"Yeah, that's right.`
` ......I'll explain the rules for my game."`
`{e:100:`
`• The definition of "culprit" is "one who murders".`
`• It is possible for a culprit to lie.`
`• It is possible for a culprit to lie even before committing murder.`
`• Characters who are not culprits only speak the truth.`
`• Characters who are not culprits cannot cooperate with a culprit.`
`• A culprit must carry out all murders directly, by their own hands.`
`• A culprit must not die.`
`• A culprit must be among the characters appearing in the story.`
`• Purple statements are as absolute as red truths.`
` However, a culprit can lie with purple statements.}`
`"That's all."`
`"The definition of "culprit" is "one who murders"...`
` Makes sense."`
`"It is possible for a culprit to lie.`
` That seems reasonable enough too."`
`"It is possible for a culprit to lie even before committing murder.`
` Well, no surprises there."`
`"Characters who are not culprits only speak the truth.`
` That is one we should be grateful for!"`
`"Characters who are not culprits cannot cooperate with a culprit, right?"`
`"So, the culprit can't use any accomplices to create an alibi."`
`"Damn.`
` My guess was that someone had manufactured an alibi to cover for the culprit, but..."`
`"......Too bad for you."`
`"A culprit must carry out all murders directly, by their own hands.`
` ......In other words, there are no remote or indirect methods of murder, like traps."`
`"A culprit must not die.`
` In other words, no one can commit murder, set up a locked room, then commit suicide inside it."`
`"And doesn't it also mean that dead people can't be culprits?"`
`"......Hmm.`
` This is a fairly vital piece of information."`
`"A culprit must be among the characters appearing in the story.`
` ......So, no mysterious strangers sneaking onto the island."`
`"The appearing characters are the same old seventeen people after Kinzo is removed.`
` No one else appears in the story, so no one else matters."`
`"Purple statements are as absolute as red truths.`
` However, a culprit can lie with purple statements.`
` ......Now here's a troublesome one."`
`"This could be the heart of this game.`
` Is that all for the game's premises?"`
`".........Besides that, I guess there's only "the Reader will tell no lies".`
` In other words, {p:1:there are no lies in the non‐dialogue narrative text}.`
` ......I could've done that if I wanted, but it'd be a pain and make things complicated."`
`"So, you willingly abandon a witch's privileges.`
` You seem quite confident."`
`"She probably plans to win despite that."`
`"That's all from me.`
` ......I don't intend to give you any more hints or answer any more questions."`
`"As the observer, I'll proclaim this once again.`
` {p:1:I guarantee that it's possible to identify the culprit with this information}."`
`"Okay.`
` .........Got it."`
`"I can't wait to get started.`
` I can't believe the two of us are going to take on the same mystery together once more...!"`
`"Yeah.`
` Let's make the most of it...!"`
`......This is a real game between you and me.`
`{n}I recommend finding some paper and something to write with.`
`{n}That is, if you really intend to fight me.`
`If you do get completely stuck, maybe you should listen in on Battler and Beato's reasoning.`
`{n}We'll have those be "hints", for when you get absolutely stumped and can't move forward.`
`Still, I'd rather fight you one‐on‐one.`
`{n}If you plan to enjoy our little duel...`
`{n}Then try defeating me by your own power alone, without relying on hints.`
`So, ......let's enjoy ourselves, shall we?`
`{n}Enjoy this game that I've created...just for you......`
`"These purple statement things are quite a problem..."`
`"We know that they're statements important enough to be on par with red truth.`
` But they also contain the culprit's lies."`
`"Even the dumbest idiot wouldn't try swallowing a bread roll whole if there might be a needle inside."`
`"True.`
` If we accept the purple blindly, there's no chance the truth will come to light."`
`"A roll with a needle in it... I like that analogy.`
` This precious, vital information might all be wasted thanks to one, tiny lie."`
`"Just which ones of this vast collection of purple have lies in them?`
` ......Just thinking about it makes my head hurt."`
`"Then why don't we try turning the chessboard over?"`
`"Hoh?`
` What do you mean?"`
`"It's simple.`
` Forget which ones are lies.`
` Let's concentrate on finding out which ones must be true."`
`"Are there any purple statements that we know must be true?"`
`"That's what we're looking for.`
` We'll look for people who couldn't possibly be the culprit.`
` If we can do that, then all of their purple statements are the same as red truth."`
`"I see.`
` Instead of searching for the culprit, we'll start by searching for those who couldn't be the culprit!`
` Hmm, quite a fundamental strategy!"`
`"That's it.`
` There's got to be someone, so let's look through it carefully."`
`"Well, that's a start, I guess?"`
`".........Let's see what they can do from here."`
`"How can we know for sure that someone isn't the culprit?"`
`"One of the rules is that the culprit can't die.`
` In other words, though it might sound cruel, we can trust anyone who's dead."`
`"Hoh, that makes it easy!`
` Almost all of the characters were killed.`
` So, we can trust the purple of all those people!"`
`"But it isn't quite that simple.`
` There's the issue of people playing dead, which popped up so often even in our games."`
`"The bodies of all victims were examined, were they not?`
` Nanjo even said with the purple that no one would reach a wrong conclusion when examining a body."`
`"If Doctor Nanjo is the culprit, then we can't even rely on that.`
` At a glance, it may look as though all the victims were examined, but all confirmations of their deaths are in purple statements.`
` We can't be 100% sure."`
`"......Then whose death can we be sure about?"`
`"At any rate, let's check all the examinations over again.`
` Let's look for someone who we can be absolutely certain is dead, in some way more reliable than these purple statements."`
`"Yes, I've got it!`
` Battler, it's the narration!`
` We've been told that there are no lies in the narrative text outside the dialogue!"`
`"Ah, I just realized that too.`
` {f:5:Bernkastel} announced with the red truth that there are no lies in the narration."`
`"Oh, looks like they figured it out..."`
`"......They wouldn't get anywhere if they didn't."`
`"Are there any deaths confirmed by the narration?!`
` That would mean we can say for sure that the person in question is dead!"`
`"And that automatically means they aren't the culprit."`
`"And on top of that, it means we can trust their purple!"`
`"Let's look for deaths that are mentioned in the narration.`
` Ones that aren't vague about whether the person is alive or dead, like "X was lying on the ground"."`
`"Yes, let's read through it once more from the start!"`
`"Battler, look!`
` The narration clearly says that Nanjo was killed on the seventh twilight...!"`
`"I found one too!`
` On the eighth twilight, the narration clearly mentions Jessica's gruesome corpse."`
`"So, in other words......"`
`"Doctor Nanjo and Jessica.`
` Those two are definitely dead.`
` And that means—"`
`"We've proven that Nanjo and Jessica aren't culprits...!`
` And that means—"`
`"All of their purple statements are the same as red truth!"`
`"Yes!! That's right!"`
`The pair gave each other a high five.`
`Finally, they had found their first big clue.`
`{n}A safe slice on the roll with a needle in it.`
`{n}They had discovered some purple statements they could trust.`
`"Let's try writing out Nanjo's and Jessica's purple statements!`
` These are the same as red truth.`
` We're finally getting somewhere...!"`
`"If we're sure that Doctor Nanjo isn't the culprit, then his purple statement for the first twilight,`
` "doctor or not, no one examining a body will reach the wrong conclusion", becomes very important."`
`"In other words, no one will make any mistakes when confirming deaths...!"`
`"So, any time Doctor Nanjo or Jessica confirms a death, we can be absolutely sure that it's true."`
`"So, anyone whose death was confirmed by Nanjo or Jessica cannot be the culprit...!"`
`".........Uh‐oh.`
` Looks like they're moving along."`
`"......It's strange.`
` I find it annoying that they're moving along, ......but if they did get stuck, that would just be boring."`
`"Okay, let's check their examinations and find some more characters who can't be the culprit!"`
`"Yes!!"`
`"Battler, I've finished checking Nanjo's and Jessica's purple statements...!"`
`"People whose deaths were confirmed by those two are definitely dead.`
` And that means they can't be the culprit."`
`"Which in turn increases the number of purple statements we can trust!"`
`"Let's start with Doctor Nanjo.`
` He confirmed the deaths of the victims of the second twilight, Uncle Krauss and Aunt Natsuhi."`
`"Then, on the fourth twilight, he also confirmed Shannon's death."`
`"On the fifth and sixth twilights, he even confirmed Gohda‐san and Kumasawa‐san's deaths."`
`"The number of innocent people has skyrocketed!`
` In addition to Nanjo and Jessica, we now know that Krauss, Natsuhi, Shannon, Gohda, and Kumasawa cannot be the culprit...!"`
`"That's not all.`
` On the fourth twilight, {f:5:Bernkastel} announced Kanon‐kun's death with the red truth.`
` The culprit can't die, so Kanon‐kun isn't the culprit either!"`
`"Nanjo, Jessica, Krauss,`
` Natsuhi, Shannon, Kanon,`
` Gohda, and Kumasawa.`
` All eight of them are not the culprit!"`
`"Oooh......`
` All of a sudden, they now have eight suspects less."`
`"......It's only natural that they'd make it this far.`
` This is where it really begins."`
`"Now, the number of purple statements we can trust has grown tremendously.`
` We're really getting into the thick of it...!"`
`"Yeah!`
` Let's check through the purple statements of the characters we've just proven innocent...!"`
`"Krauss, Natsuhi, Shannon,`
` Kanon, Gohda, Kumasawa.`
` I've looked through the purple statements for all the people we just proved innocent!"`
`"Yeah.`
` And as a result, we've proven that Genji‐san isn't the culprit."`
`"For the first twilight, Kanon announces in a purple statement that he confirmed Genji's death.`
` That clears Genji of suspicion as well...!"`
`"So now, a total of nine people have been proven innocent.`
` Things are going pretty well."`
`"Ah, right. It looks like Shannon's and Kumasawa's purple statements confirm that the six people of the first twilight all died."`
`".........We shouldn't accept that so easily."`
`"Why not?`
` We can trust Shannon's and Kumasawa's statements, can we not?"`
`"Yeah, right?`
` If you're sure they aren't culprits, why can't you trust their purple statements?"`
`"Kumasawa‐san, for example, only said they were "lying there, covered in blood".`
` So, it's not clear whether they were alive or dead.`
` We can't call this a perfect examination of the six dining hall victims."`
`"Shannon speaks of those six in a different way.`
` She says "the death of each parent was confirmed by their own child"."`
`"That means George‐aniki, Maria, and I each examined our own parents in the dining hall.`
` However, we haven't proven yet that any of those three are innocent."`
`"Oh, I get it.`
` .........Shannon's words prove that the children confirmed each of the six deaths in the dining hall,`
` but they don't prove that the examinations those kids performed were legitimate."`
`"That's it.`
` Since we can't deny the possibility that the kids are lying, we still can't remove any of the six in the dining hall from suspicion."`
`"How troublesome......`
` All three of those are survivors who live until the end.`
` Since they are alive, that makes it impossible to prove that they aren't culprits..."`
`"Battler, George, Maria.`
` .....These survivors are not only likely to be culprits, they are also probably the hardest people to prove innocent."`
`"At any rate,`
` it looks like those nine are the only ones we can say are definitely dead and therefore definitely innocent."`
`"From here on out, it'll just be pure reasoning based off the purple statements of the nine we can trust."`
`"Nanjo, Jessica, Krauss,`
` Natsuhi, Shannon, Kanon,`
` Gohda, Kumasawa, Genji.`
` We can only read through their purple statements once more..."`
`"Things are going to get hard starting now.`
` Let's steel ourselves and take a shot at it...!"`
`"Mm.`
` It's finally starting to feel like a real mystery...!"`
`"Hey, Beato.`
` I've found out something interesting.`
` In this series of crimes, master keys can never be used."`
`"Come to think of it, the group of nine innocent people includes all five servants, doesn't it?"`
`"Only the servants can use master keys.`
` They can't hand them over to someone else.`
` And, since people who aren't culprits themselves can't assist culprits, the master keys cannot be used for crimes."`
`Since it's been guaranteed that all five servants are innocent,`
` we know that the master keys have nothing to do with the crimes.`
`"Yes, that's right...!`
` And that makes this even more troublesome, correct?`
` All of these locked room murders!`
` Every one of them must be constructed without any master keys...!"`
`"No.`
` Turn the chessboard over.`
` This just means that none of the tricks need master keys to construct."`
`"I see...!`
` First twilight, the locked room of the dining hall.`
` Second twilight, Natsuhi's locked room.`
` Starting with the fifth twilight, the locked room of the guesthouse.`
` It seems we must look closely through those again..."`
`"Let's read it through once more carefully.`
` ......All of the servants are innocent.`
` Master keys can't be used.`
` Let's think through it again with that in mind."`
`"I think I have a theory about the dining hall locked room of the first twilight."`
`"Let's hear it."`
`"The corpse examinations of the victims in the first twilight still aren't certain.`
` In other words, what if one of them was really the culprit?!`
` They killed the other five, locked the dining hall from the inside, then played dead...!"`
`"True, they could create a locked room without using master keys that way.`
` That leaves us with a problem though."`
`"What problem?"`
`"Remember?`
` When we were talking about the second twilight, {f:5:Bernkastel} said this with the red truth:`
` "The culprit of the first twilight has definitely killed six people.""`
`"Yes, now that you mention it...`
` .........Mgh......"`
`"Because of that red truth, it seems all six people in the dining hall were dead after all.`
` So, how did someone lock the dining hall from the outside?`
` Without using a key......"`
`"Hey, Battler.`
` Does that red truth really confirm the deaths of all six people in the dining hall?"`
`"......Hmm, ......well, ......it does, doesn't it...?"`
`"In that case, the six in the dining hall are all innocent, and excluding Genji, whose innocence has already been confirmed, that gives us five more people we can remove from the list of suspects, does it not?`
` In other words, 9+5=14 people have been proved innocent...!`
` There are only three left!`
` Either Battler, George, or Maria must be the culprit...!"`
`"Wait a second!`
` ......That doesn't seem right for some reason.`
` That red truth did say that the culprit killed six people.`
` However, she didn't say that red during the first twilight."`
`"I believe she said it back when we were talking about the second twilight, yes...?"`
`"I'd like to read through that bit again.`
` Let's search.`
` It feels like that was a strange time for her to say it..."`
`"............Not bad."`
`"Can't underestimate these two.`
` Even their instincts are sharp."`
`"I've been thinking about the second twilight's locked room, but no matter how many times I try, I keep ending up with the same theory..."`
`"You mean someone killing the pair of them, then locking the door from the inside and hiding?"`
`"Mm.`
` ......Since the master keys can't be used, the door must have been locked from the inside.`
` So, it only makes sense if the culprit was hiding somewhere in Natsuhi's room."`
`"Right.`
` That is weird.`
` It says this in the narration:`
` "no matter how much time passed, Krauss and Natsuhi were the only ones who didn't return."`
` And then it continues:`
` "everyone headed to Krauss's and Natsuhi's rooms together.""`
`"If Krauss and Natsuhi were the only ones who didn't return, .........that implies that everyone else did return to the parlor."`
`"That's right.`
` If the culprit locked themselves in Natsuhi's room after committing the crime, they shouldn't have been able to return.`
` And yet, everyone except the victims did return."`
`"That would make this crime impossible for all the survivors......`
` ......So, maybe we really should follow your theory of someone in the dining hall surviving and committing crimes later..."`
`"......Come to think of it,`
` ......when I mentioned that theory, I was hit with a red truth."`
`My theory was that someone in the dining hall was alive and killed Krauss and Natsuhi.`
`That theory was countered by this red truth: "The culprit of the first twilight has definitely killed six people"......`
`"Well, that's is hardly surprising.`
` After all, the culprit went on to kill Krauss and Natsuhi, so they've killed a total of not just six, but eight people."`
`"........................`
` ......Huh......?`
` Hold on......`
` ............They went on to kill Krauss and Natsuhi......`
` .........So......the culprit has definitely killed......six........."`
`"I've got it!!`
` We've been fooled.`
` I know what she meant by saying the culprit killed six people...!!"`
`"What do you mean "you know what she meant"?`
` Explain yourself...!"`
`"‘The culprit of the first twilight has definitely killed six people.’`
` If she had said that at the time of the first twilight, I might've accepted it as it seemed.`
` However, if we remember that she said it after the second twilight, a new possibility shows itself...!"`
`"You don't mean.........that the murders of the second twilight...`
`...are included in the "six people" who were definitely killed...?!"`
`"That's it!`
` The culprit really was hiding among the six in the dining hall!`
` Later on, they snuck out of the dining hall, killed the two people in Aunt Natsuhi's room, locked the door from the inside, and hid somewhere in the room...!"`
`The culprit could only have killed five people at most in the dining hall.`
`However, if we add on the victims of the second twilight, they would definitely have killed at least six times...!`
`"I see, now it all adds up...!`
` You can construct the locked rooms of both the first and second twilights without using master keys...!!"`
`"Well, ......you'd think so, but that reminds me of something else.`
` ......Aunt Natsuhi's room was sealed immediately afterwards..."`
`"Yes, come to think of it...`
` Lady {f:5:Bernkastel} used the red truth to say this: ‘The group sealed the room at the same time they left.`
` No culprit joined the group as they left.’"`
`"And she also said this:`
` ‘All of the seals will never be broken.’"`
`"In other words, ......the culprit is trapped in a locked room again."`
`"That theory might explain the first and second twilights.`
` ......However, the culprit would be sealed inside Aunt Natsuhi's room, unable to leave."`
`"And that means they wouldn't be able to carry out the fourth twilight and onwards!`
` ......Gyah, I thought it was such a nice theory, ......but I guess it's wrong......"`
`"I don't think we're wrong about this theory, but......`
` ......Maybe it just needs some more tweaking........."`
`"No, it does work.`
` There's no problem if the culprit gets sealed up.`
` ......Not as long as there's a second culprit!"`
`"A multiple culprit theory...!`
` Yes, that does seem to be the only way.`
` That way, even if one culprit is sealed up, the other can continue murdering..."`
`"If you think about it,`
` our theory has needed an accomplice from the very beginning.`
` Excluding Genji‐san, who we already know to be innocent, the other five of the first twilight's six victims—Auntie Eva, Uncle Hideyoshi, my old bastard, Kyrie‐san, and Auntie Rosa—`
`all had their deaths confirmed by people who {i:also} haven't been confirmed innocent.`
` Unless those people were accomplices—fellow culprits—no one would've been able to play dead."`
`"You're right...!`
` After all, the rules say that only culprits can cooperate with other culprits...!"`
`"Culprits are capable of lying even before they commit murder.`
` ......So, we have ourselves a theory."`
`"The culprit who carried out the first twilight murders also carried out the second twilight, then locked themselves up in Natsuhi's room."`
`"Then, the other culprit, who lied about the first culprit's death, carried on with the murders starting at the fourth twilight...!"`
`"Yes, it all matches up that way...!!`
` So, which of them was it?!"`
`"Unfortunately, so far, any one of them could be a culprit.`
` However, we can say for sure that the crime wasn't committed by a single person.`
` And, we know that the culprit locked up in Natsuhi's room was one of those five victims in the dining hall.`
` And we also know that the person who continued with the crimes was one of those who inspected the five suspicious corpses on the first twilight...!"`
`"One of those who inspected the five suspicious corpses in the dining hall...?`
` That would be......"`
`"Battler, George, and Maria.`
` We know that one of those three committed the murders later on!"`
`"Excellent......`
` Let's focus on those three and find the truth about those later crimes...!"`
`"The next crime is the fourth twilight.`
` Shannon‐chan was the one killed.`
` No one has an alibi, with one exception."`
`"George.`
` Jessica, who has been confirmed innocent, used the purple text to say that it was impossible for George to kill Shannon.`
` So, doesn't that mean either Battler or Maria must have killed her?"`
`"I'd like to think that, but it's too soon to be sure.`
` Battler, Maria, and every other person except George lacks an alibi.`
` I've managed to prove the crime wasn't committed by a single person, but I didn't prove that there were exactly two culprits.`
` At this point in time, it's still too soon to be sure."`
`"I see.`
` In addition to the culprit of the first and second twilights and the culprit who lied about the first culprit's death,`
` ......there might be yet another completely separate culprit as well.`
` ......Yes, it was a mistake to overlook that..."`
`"The murder of Shannon‐chan was possible for anyone, with only one single exception.`
` Also, that fact alone isn't enough to prove that George‐aniki is innocent overall."`
`"......I thought this would be an easy one since there's no locked room,`
` but on the contrary, we have no suspicious circumstances and no information to lead us to the culprit..."`
`"The pace of the crimes starts picking up here.`
` Instead of getting stuck on this one part, we should take a look at the fifth twilight too."`
`"It seems we have a problem with the fifth and sixth twilights...!`
` We can trust Jessica's purple statements, and she said this:`
` "The four cousins and Nanjo couldn't have killed Gohda and Kumasawa"...!"`
`"The four cousins and Doctor Nanjo.`
` In other words, all of the survivors at this point in time.`
` Thinking about it on normal lines, that would make this an impossible crime."`
`"However, that's where we can turn the chessboard over, correct?"`
`"You've got it.`
` This actually gives us a simple answer.`
` This crime proves that there's a culprit who isn't Doctor Nanjo or one of the cousins."`
`"Other than these survivors, everyone is supposed to be dead.`
` And yet, it was impossible for the survivors to commit the crime......"`
`"It's absolute proof that one of the culprits faked their death."`
`"And, since there exists a culprit who faked his or her death, that's absolute proof that there were multiple culprits.`
` Only a culprit can fake an examination and lie...!"`
`"The fifth and sixth twilights may seem to be a perfect impossible crime,`
` but this one incident alone tells us so much."`
`"Impossible crimes are a double‐edged sword—they have the power to break your opponents, but they also make it possible for theories to break deep into your lines of defense.`
` ......Long ago, you would surely have surrendered.`
` How far you've come."`
`"Heheh.`
` It's all because you've trained me so well."`
`The pair grinned at each other.`
`They had been to the brink of death and back in their many intellectual games before now.`
`{n}They wouldn't be discouraged by a riddle like this.`
`"Now let's move on to the crimes of the seventh and eighth twilights.`
` I think we're getting pretty close to the core of things."`
`"Yeah, let's keep our wits about us!"`
`"The situation's exactly the same on the seventh twilight.`
` Jessica's purple statement, which we can trust, shows that the four cousins, which means all of the survivors, couldn't have committed the crime."`
`"And yet, ......there's something I don't quite get.`
` The culprit of the first and second twilights was one of those five victims from the first twilight.`
` That person was sealed in Natsuhi's room, but we know their child was a culprit too, who lied when examining the death of their parent.`
` ......However, the only kids who can be a culprit are Battler, George, and Maria."`
`"That's right.`
` And we've proven that they couldn't have committed murder for the fifth, sixth, and seventh twilights."`
`"In other words,`
` .........this shows us that yet another culprit exists."`
`"Interesting.`
` It also happens to be a theory that makes sense.`
` Plus, it would mean that the third culprit was also one of those who played dead.`
` ......It might even be possible to have four or five culprits this way."`
`"*cackle*, I'm not sure about that.`
` At any rate, Gohda, Kumasawa, and Nanjo couldn't have been killed if there were only two culprits.`
` There can be no doubt of that...!"`
`"This is getting complicated.`
` Was it a group of three culprits?`
` Or was it a pair working together and someone else on their own?`
` ......Ah, right, we can't forget the possibility that there are more than three culprits."`
`"Of the seventeen people who appear in the story, nine have been confirmed innocent.`
` Eight are left, and let's put Battler, George, and Maria to the side since they survived.`
` That leaves five people who were supposedly dead, but have not been proved innocent:`
` Eva, Hideyoshi, Rudolf, Kyrie, and Rosa.`
` All were victims of the first twilight."`
`"Now, the question is which of those five victims in the dining hall was faking death.`
` ......We're getting close.`
` I'm starting to like this...!"`
`"As for the eighth twilight in the end,`
` the layout's exactly the same."`
`"Indeed.`
` The narration says that George, Battler, and Maria could not have killed Jessica.`
` The three survivors couldn't have done it."`
`"The purple statements here sound like they have a lot of hints for us."`
`"George's and Maria's purple statements are particularly interesting.`
` If only we could trust them, they would be quite a powerful clue......"`
`"If George‐aniki is innocent, then his purple statement about Maria being unable to kill anyone would be true, and Maria would be confirmed innocent.`
` In the same way, if Maria is innocent, then her statement about George being unable to kill an adult would be true, and that would consequently prove George‐aniki innocent as well."`
`"It would, but we cannot confirm that either of them is innocent..."`
`"If either George‐aniki or Maria could prove that the other was innocent, they would be innocent too.`
` It's like a chicken and egg dilemma.`
` It almost feels like a useful hint, but not quite.`
` Pretty annoying."`
`"Proving innocence for either of them probably won't be easy.`
` At least we've gotten the suspects down to a small number.`
` From here on out, there's probably nothing left to do except check each one to see if they could have been a culprit."`
`"You're right.`
` Feels like we're getting to the final stretch!"`
`"So, looks like they've almost made it, doesn't it......?"`
`"............I feel like a plucked fish."`
`"First, let's test the theory that Maria could have been a culprit.`
` If she's guilty, then Rosa could've been playing dead.`
` She could've carried out the crimes on the first and second twilights.`
` Then, she gets locked in Aunt Natsuhi's room, and Maria takes over for the following murders."`
`"It was impossible for Maria to commit any of the murders in the guesthouse.`
` So, the most Maria could do was kill Shannon."`
`"Which means a third culprit would be needed for the guesthouse murders."`
`"The third one would have to be Eva, Hideyoshi, Rudolf, or Kyrie.`
` And that would mean we'd need a fourth culprit too, right?"`
`"......You're right.`
` In order for one of those four adults to play dead, the child who checked them would have to be a culprit too.`
` In other words, if Maria is a culprit, we'll need to have at least four culprits total."`
`"If there are four culprits, then each one of them must kill at least one person."`
`The definition of "culprit" is a murderer.`
`"......In which case,`
` ......things don't quite seem to add up."`
`"The four culprits would then be two adults and two children.`
` One adult is in charge of the murders on the first and second twilights.`
` The other adult handles the murders from the guesthouse onwards.`
` Yes, this is where we get a contradiction."`
`"A culprit is defined as "one who murders".`
` ......That means anyone who's a culprit must commit murder at least once."`
`"Simply put, there are very few people that a child culprit could murder.`
` The children could not have killed on the first and second twilights.`
` They also can't commit murder after the first deaths in the guesthouse take place.`
` The only one they can possibly commit is Shannon's murder on the fourth twilight."`
`"......A child culprit can only kill Shannon.`
` A second child culprit couldn't kill anyone, so they couldn't be a culprit at all.`
` ......It means there can be only one child culprit."`
`"As soon as we pick Maria as a culprit, we need another adult culprit besides Rosa.`
` However, it's impossible for there to be a second child culprit to lie about their parent's death.`
` ......In other words, it's impossible for Maria to be a culprit...!"`
`"Next, let's try a theory with George as a culprit.`
` Only one child culprit can exist.`
` So, if George‐aniki is a culprit, that means Auntie Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi are the only adults who could've been playing dead."`
`"So, a three person group, with two adults and one kid?`
` I see, that sounds like it'd explain all the crimes so far, doesn't it?"`
`"But hold it!`
` That's actually impossible too."`
`"Indeed.`
` It's clearly shown that George cannot be a culprit."`
`"*giggle*.`
` ......Pretty sharp.`
` The only one the kids can kill is Shannon on the fourth twilight."`
`"A trustworthy purple statement has already proven that George couldn't have been the culprit in Shannon's murder...!"`
`"That's it.`
` Just one tiny alibi that only works for Shannon‐chan's murder.`
` That's what proves George‐aniki innocent for all of the crimes...!"`
`"So, we need not suspect George...!`
` Which means all of his purple statements can be relied upon...!"`
`"Once we're sure that George is innocent,`
` that automatically makes Maria innocent too."`
`"Yeah.`
` It confirms George‐aniki's purple statement saying "Maria couldn't kill anyone".`
` Since she couldn't kill anyone, she can't be a culprit.`
` So, Maria is also confirmed innocent."`
`"Since George and Maria are innocent,`
` that also proves that their examinations of their parents' deaths were also trustworthy."`
`"That's right.`
` No one will reach a wrong conclusion when examining a body,`
` and people who aren't culprits can't lie.`
` So, the deaths of their parents have been confirmed, and those parents are also innocent."`
`"We've gotten rid of almost everyone......`
` ......The answer is already clear, is it not...?"`
`"First off, there are multiple culprits.`
` That's confirmed.`
` These crimes would be impossible for a single person."`
`"To start, one of the adult culprits...`
`carried out the first twilight, then played dead."`
`"Since we know that all of the servants with master keys are innocent,`
` there's no way for the culprit to lock the door to the dining hall from the outside.`
` So, we know that the one who locked it did so from inside the room and must have been playing dead."`
`"And, in order for them to play dead,`
` they needed another culprit to lie when examining their death."`
`"Since Genji‐san is innocent, there are only five suspicious victims, each examined by their respective children.`
` So that gives us our second culprit: the child of the first culprit."`
`"And the child culprit can't carry out the crimes once they start occurring in the guesthouse.`
` Plus, the adult culprit is sealed up in Natsuhi's room.`
` So, a second adult culprit is needed."`
`"Two adults, one kid.`
` That's what our culprit group looks like."`
`"It should be obvious by now.`
` The name of the child culprit in this culprit group is clear."`
`"Pretty much.`
` All of the kids have been proven innocent, with one exception."`
`"And the only corpse inspections that a child culprit could lie about were the inspections of that child's own parents.`
` So, the culprit group was a family of two adults and one child."`
`"Murder with the family.`
` How sweet."`
`"So, who are the three culprits?`
` There's hardly any point in stretching this out further, is there?"`
`"Aw, come on.`
` What a messed up answer.`
` Looks like I was the child culprit."`
`"Hmph.`
` Even in my games, Battler culprit theories were some of the most popular, weren't they?"`
`"It seems so.`
` Sheesh, why does everyone think I did it...?!"`
`"If you're a culprit, that automatically makes your parents culprits too.`
` There's no need to think this over anymore.`
` We've already won."`
`"There's no need for any more discussions or hints.`
` Let's move ahead with the answer...!"`
`"Is it over?"`
`"......Well done.`
` ......It seems a mystery of this level wasn't enough to beat those two after all."``"Somebodyyyyyyyyy!!`
` Is anyone there?!`
` Onii‐chaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}an!!`
` Waaaaaahh!!"`
`Ange flew out of the guesthouse, sobbing.`
`Was there anyone still alive on this island?`
`When she checked the cousins' room earlier, it had been completely empty.`
`However, she remembered that she hadn't seen Battler's body, or George's, or Maria's.`
`What she didn't know was whether this meant they were safe...or whether she was about to be reunited with them as corpses.`
`"Where are you guys?!`
` Where aaaare youuuuu?!!`
` Answer meee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}eee!!"`
`She dashed around through the rain.`
`Where was she going?`
` Nowhere in particular.`
`The lost little sister dashed around in circles, searching for her brother.`
`Drenched with rain and all alone......`
`.........Eventually, I thought I heard my brother's voice from beyond a bush.`
`No, it wasn't just his voice.`
` I heard George onii‐chan's and Maria onee‐chan's voices too.`
`I called out at the top of my lungs, but they didn't answer.`
`But it's okay now.`
` They're right there.`
` Just on the other side of the fence.`
`I could even faintly see them through the fence.`
`When I ran around the fence, I found myself standing in front of a shed or something.`
`It must be a shed to store tools for the rose garden.`
`The three of them were standing in front of the shed.`
`"Onii‐chan...!!"`
`I cried out, but my voice didn't reach them.`
`{n}Even though I yelled so loudly?`
`Something felt very wrong about all this.`
`......When people hear a voice, even when they pretend not to have heard it, their bodies tend to show some sign that they've noticed.`
`However, there was no trace of that in the three of them.`
`Even though I was screaming so loud, .........it truly wasn't reaching their ears.`
`The instant I understood that, ......my dash towards them slowed and came to a halt.`
`Though we appeared to be in the same world, .........we were actually in different worlds entirely.`
`It was like a TV.`
` Or was it more like ghosts...?`
`I could see them clearly, ......but as far as they were concerned, I didn't exist.`
`......After all, look.`
`Even if I stand right in front of them, ......their eyes can't see me.`
`If I try and touch them, will I really be able to?`
` ......What if my hand just goes right through...`
`I was so scared at the thought......that I could do nothing but stand there in shock, even though I was so close to them...`
`"Dammit...!!`
` I don't have a clue anymore...!`
` Someone must have snuck in from outside the island after all!!`
` And that person massacred the Ushiromiya family!"`
`"......No matter how much we lock ourselves in, someone always gets killed.`
` ......Uu! It's the work of a witch after all!"`
`"Everyone, calm down...!`
` Let's calm down and think.`
` ......No one exists on this island except those with a direct relation to the Ushiromiya family."`
`"That doesn't make sense...!`
` After all, we've just seen several murders that'd be impossible for any one of us!"`
`"......Well, that's true......`
` But is it really?`
` Maybe we've just missed something."`
`"Missed something?"`
`"For example......`
` .........That's right, maybe someone was playing dead!`
` Since we're the only ones on this island, the culprit must be one of us.`
` That would mean that someone we thought was dead was actually faking...!"`
`"But Aniki, that's impossible!`
` Every one of the corpses was checked by someone!`
` There's no way any of them were faking!"`
`"I don't want to think about it,`
` ...but what if those corpse inspections......were also faked?"`
`".........Uu...?"`
`"What I'm getting at is this.`
` There were multiple culprits from the start.`
` One plays dead, and the other lies and confirms that the first culprit died.`
` Then, the culprit who played dead keeps on committing crimes,`
` creating the illusion that some stranger has snuck onto the island...!"`
`"Do you......still suspect someone in the Ushiromiya family of being the culprit?!"`
`".........Doctor Nanjo was killed.`
` ......Since he was killed, it's probably safe to say that he wasn't a culprit.`
` And, we can consider the examinations performed by a doctor like him to be the most reliable."`
`If so, then we can probably assume that the people whose death Nanjo checked were almost certainly dead.`
`Who did Nanjo check?`
`Genji's corpse.`
`{n}Krauss and Natsuhi's corpses.`
`{n}Shannon's corpse.`
`{n}Gohda and Kumasawa's corpses.`
`"Think back to the beginning and the bodies in the dining hall.`
` Of those six victims, Doctor Nanjo only inspected Genji‐san."`
`"......But didn't the rest of us check the others?"`
`"Yes, but Doctor Nanjo didn't actually inspect them himself."`
`"What are you talking about?!`
` How the hell could our parents have survived after being killed like that?!"`
`"Anyway, what do you think you're saying, George‐aniki?!`
` Wouldn't that mean one of our parents is the culprit?!`
` That's insane!!"`
`"They were killed right at the beginning, and so many of them...!`
` How can you go calling our parents culprits on top of that?!`
` I won't let anyone, not even you, suspect and slander our parents after they've been killed like that...!!"`
`".........S‐.........sorry......"`
`"......I know my Mama was really dead.`
` So, does that mean George onii‐chan's parents or Battler's parents were the culprits?"`
`"Let's stop with that, Maria‐chan......`
` I must have lost it a bit just now..."`
`"George onii‐chan wouldn't kill Shannon."`
`"That's enough...!`
` None of us would kill our family, right?!!"`
`"So, I don't think George onii‐chan would lie and say his parents were dead, not if they were really alive.`
` .........There's no way you would help out in a crime if Shannon was going to be killed."`
`Calmly, ......as though answering a quiz or a puzzle, Maria spoke to George.`
`Then, with a blank look on her face, she turned to Battler and spoke.`
`".........Battler, you saw your mom and dad's corpses, right?"`
`"Yeah, I saw them!!`
` We all saw them right?!`
` Those pitiful, blood‐stained......!!"`
`"I think you're lying."`
`"Huh?!`
` Where the hell did that come from?!!"`
`"Because that way, it all makes sense.`
` ......Back in the dining hall, your parents weren't dead.`
` One of them killed Aunt Natsuhi and Uncle Krauss, locked the door from the inside, and waited in that room.`
` ......The other one took over the murders after that."`
`"......To break open the locked room of the guesthouse, they needed to have an accomplice inside.`
` That was you.`
` ......That explains everything."`
`"E‐enooooooooooooough!!!"`
`"S‐stop it, Battler‐kun...!`
` You too, Maria‐chan...!"`
`"Finally, all the pieces fit together in the Wolves and Sheep puzzle in my head.`
` .........The culprits are Battler's family.`
` Uu.`
` ......Am I right?"`
`"Wh‐what are you talking abooooooooout?!!!"`
`{a:c:`
`"Correct."}`
`The voice came from behind Ange.`
` She spun around, surprised.`
`......There, covered in blood, ......yet wearing cheery expressions, ......were Rudolf and Kyrie.`
`"Uncle Rudolf, Auntie Kyrie, .........I, I'm so glad you're sa—"`
`After saying that much, George realized what the words meant, and his face twisted into an expression of shock and horror.`
`Maria wasn't surprised.`
` However, she showed no joy at having her answer proven correct.`
`And as for Battler...`
`......Ange...saw it.`
`A terrible expression...that she would never forget as long as she lived.`
`It was...a demon's smile.`
`A hideous demon that she'd never be able to look at again twisted its face in a foul grin, and the truly horrible thing was...`
`...that she saw it......on her brother's face......`
`Rudolf and Kyrie lifted up the guns they had been holding behind them.`
`The barrels were pointed at the foreheads of George, who was staggering backwards, and Maria, who was grinning as though she didn't care what happened.`
`There was a flash of lightning and a crack of thunder.`
` Nothing more could be heard.`
`Then, as George and Maria were snapped around by that roar, ......the strings holding them were snipped.`
`The two dolls fell into puddles with a splash...and stopped moving......`
`"......D‐......Dad... ......Mom........."`
`All of this occurred right before Ange's eyes...`
`"Heh...ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!"`
`"Eheheheheheh, haha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!"`
`"Ihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!"`
`Ange, who stood stunned beside them, wasn't visible to their eyes.`
`They guffawed, overcome with laughter.`
` Then, right in front of Ange, they started joking and complimenting each other on their kills so far.`
`The three hideous faces......the faces of her family......made Ange want to cry and vomit at the same time, and she felt as though she would suffocate.`
`Ange dashed away, covering her mouth.`
`She wanted to escape the disgusting laughter coming from her beloved family as soon as possible.`
`Then, she slipped and fell face‐down in a puddle of mud.`
`Ange didn't try to get up.`
`In fact, she instead chose to cover her ears to block out the disgusting laughter that she could still hear.`
`As she did, .........from the shadows of the fences and bushes in this inky‐black rose garden, ......several dark things slipped into sight.`
`"...............?!?!"`
`Ange looked around herself in surprise.........to see that eerie black shapes had appeared from all over the garden...and were slowly surrounding her.`
`It was.........a crowd of people with goat heads.`
`Their outfits were all different.`
`Some wore suits, while others were dressed casually.`
` However, all of them were covered with darkness, and all of them had goat heads.`
`Ange, bewildered, accidentally let her hands fall from her ears.`
`By now, she couldn't hear that disgusting laughter.`
`However, in its place, ......she could hear the words spoken by the goats.`
`‘............Kyrie and Rudolf are the culprits.’`
`‘Battler is the culprit...... Battler is the culprit......’`
`‘......Battler culprit theory.`
` Battler's family culprit theory......’`
`As the goats continued to mumble in eerie voices, ......they surrounded Ange and began to draw nearer.`
`They all pressed around her, each of them speaking of Ange's family as the culprits......`
`.........At first, everyone had joined in on the Eva culprit theory.`
`The sole survivor from Rokkenjima had gotten almost all of the wealth to herself, so the theory was only natural.`
`Why was Ushiromiya Eva the only one who escaped to Kuwadorian?`
` And why did she refuse so stubbornly to talk about what happened that day?`
`It was decided that the Eva culprit theory explained all of this.`
`However, when Eva died of illness, and people learned that all the vast wealth she had created by unscrupulous means would go to Ange,`
` public opinion—or rather, the Forgers—created a new culprit theory and spread it around.`
`This was.........the "Rudolf's family culprit theory".`
`If it was normal for everyone to come to the family conferences, why was Ange the only one who didn't come this time?`
`Did Rudolf's family have some reason for not bringing the young Ange with them?`
`They did take Battler, but he wasn't Kyrie's son.`
`Then, when it was revealed in some magazines that Kyrie's family had close ties to a massive gangster organization, all eyes suddenly gathered on Kyrie herself.`
`Then, the truth was also laid bare about how Rudolf had made a killing out of fraudulent business practices,`
` and almost immediately, the couple became thought of as the most suspicious people on the island.`
`Hideyoshi and Eva's company might have been rough, but at least it had operated within the law.`
`However, the more Rudolf's company was investigated, the more dirt was dug up.`
`Furthermore, trouble surrounding some party tickets from the time Rudolf and Kyrie were students was also testified to.`
` It was clear that they were far more suspicious than Eva's family.`
`And so, in a flash,`
` ......the "Rudolf's family culprit theory" expelled the other conspiracy theories, including the Eva culprit theory, and reigned as the greatest of them all.`
`......It wasn't really because it was more plausible than the Eva culprit theory.`
`They had just gotten bored of the old theory and wanted a new sensation......`
`The goats seemed to bend and undulate.`
`The sky rapidly turned white, ......becoming a ceiling lit by fluorescent lamps.`
`The goats had changed completely, .........becoming the shapes of girls......wearing goat masks.`
`All of the girls were wearing the same clothes.`
`It was a uniform.`
` ......The uniform of Saint Lucia Academy.`
`‘......Did you hear the real culprits were Rudolf and Kyrie?’`
`‘Oh, I heard that!`
` Yeah, I knew there was something suspicious about them leaving their kid behind!’`
`‘Didn't Ushiromiya Eva say herself that she was being poisoned to death?!`
` Isn't it obvious who was behind that?!’`
`‘Must be nice for her. She gets her whole family's riches all to herself, right?’`
`‘I always knew the "Rudolf's family culprit theory" was right!’`
`‘I always thought there was something strange about Ushiromiya‐san!’`
`‘We always thought she was weird, *snicker*snicker*.’`
`‘*giggle*giggle*giggle*giggle*.’`
`‘Rudolf and Kyrie did it.’`
`‘Wasn't Battler part of it too?’`
`‘Rudolf's family culprit theory!’`
`‘Rudolf and Kyrie were the culprits!’`
`‘They tried to get the family wealth all to themselves, but they failed at the hands of Eva—’`
`‘But in the end, Ushiromiya Ange gets everything anyway, doesn't she?’`
`‘Rudolf and Kyrie are the culprits, of course!’`
`‘Rudolf's family culprit theory!’`
`‘Rudolf and Kyrie and Battler did it!’`
`‘Rudolf and Kyrie and Battler did it!!’`
`‘They're saying your family did it, Ushiromiya‐san!’`
`‘What do you think of that?`
` Come on, tell us!’`
`‘But in the end, you get all the family wealth to yourself, don't you?!’`
`‘Even at the end, Ushiromiya Eva never told you anything, right?!’`
`‘I always knew there was something wrong with that girl!’`
`‘This also explains why Eva hated you so much!’`
`‘Hey, hey, say something, tell us what you think!’`
`‘She really is a creepy kid, isn't she?’`
`‘At least say something about what you think of the theory, you sicko!!’`
`A blade of air swept over me as I crouched down, holding my head.`
`In a flash, the illusion of the goat‐headed girl students who were surrounding me shattered.`
`......I was curled up in a puddle in the rainy rose garden, surrounded by goats.`
`But then, those goats were also sliced in half, and the upper halves slid to the side.`
`It was like seeing a master swordsman slicing through a stick of bamboo.`
`{a:c:`
`"This way......!"}`
`The voice came from......that black cat.`
`{n}The black cat with the bell that had guided me here.`
`Incredible that it can talk......`
`{n}But that doesn't matter now.`
` I dashed after it.`
`The goats shrank back.`
`A hole opened up in the encirclement.`
` The black cat dashed through it.`
`As I hurried through after it, the goats began to chase after me.`
`Countless heavy footsteps thundered behind us.`
`"Wh‐......where are we running to, {nobr:Mr. Cat}...?!"`
`The cat ignored my stupid question.`
`Where are we running to?`
`{n}It's obvious.`
` As far away as we can make it.`
`However, there were an unbelievable number of goats.`
`It wasn't just the group chasing us.`
` There were probably goats hiding throughout the rose garden, and everywhere we went, a group of them would appear and block our path.`
`Each time we bumped into them, we ran down a different path in this maze of a rose garden.`
`So, I didn't even know which direction we were running in anymore.`
`It couldn't be that we're......just running around in circles inside a massive crowd of goats, could it...?`
`When we ran into the arbor once more, I learned that my fears were justified.`
`The four paths that led from the arbor were all blocked by a crowd of goats.`
`{n}Of course, the path we had come down was also blocked by our pursuers.`
`There was nowhere to go to, nowhere to return to.`
` ......We were finally...trapped......`
`"M‐Mr. Cat, ......what should we do? W‐we're surrounded......!!"`
`"........................"`
`With a defensive posture, the black cat glared at the goats that surrounded us.`
`It's...all over for us......`
`At that moment, I found myself floating in the air.`
`A massive arm, large enough to crush my entire head, had grabbed my collar from behind.`
`Before I could even think to cry out, ......I saw, right in front of my face, a pair of strangely glowing red eyes, and a massive mouth with jagged teeth and a foul breath.`
`The mouth......opened wide...`
`...and, writhing as though it was a separate creature, ......a disturbing tongue stuck itself out.`
`Then, ......it spat words at me.`
`‘.........Rudolf, Kyrie, and Battler are the culprits......`
` ......Rudolf and Kyrie played dead, and Battler lied when he inspected them......`
` Then, one of the parents carried out the murders until the second twilight and hid under the bed in Natsuhi's room.`
` ......Battler killed Shannon, and then assisted in the murders in the guesthouse.`
` ......The other parent carried out the guesthouse murders......`
` This is......the truth............’`
`Then, ......that gaping, smelly mouth......slowly began to close over Ange's head......`
`"Counter.`
` ......{p:2:It's possible to form a logical theory other than the "Rudolf's family culprit theory".}"`
`A blue flash......sliced off the top of the mouth that was trying to eat Ange's head, sending it flying.`
`I fell into a puddle, along with the goat that was still grasping my collar, though there was nothing left of it above its jaw.`
`Without any hesitation, ......the goats stretched out their thick arms, as though this was their chance to snatch this prey for themselves...and they rushed towards me.`
` All of them spoke in unison.`
`‘{p:2:Everything except the Rudolf's family culprit theory is impossibllle...`
` ......Absolutely impossibllle}...!!’`
`"{p:1:It's possible to form a logical theory other than the Rudolf's family culprit theory}.`
` {p:2:For example, a theory with George's family as the culprits is possible}."`
`A red flash and a blue line became blades of wind that passed over my head,`
` flew at the goat that had tried to pick me up, and sliced both its arms off like a knife through butter.`
`I think the next goats dashed, not towards me, ......but towards the black cat that was protecting me from behind.`
`As I sat on my butt, staring up at the rainy night's sky,`
` ......the massive goats were in the air right above me, fighting the black cat...or someone.`
`‘{p:2:The "George's family culprit theory" is impossiiible!`
` George can't kill Shan{-}n{-}n{-}n{-}n{-}non!!`
` So he can't be a culprit, and he can't faaaake when checking corpses}!!!’`
`"{p:1:No, it is possible.`
` A "culprit" is defined as "one who murders".`
` It never says that they have to murder someone who appears in the story.`
` ......In other words,`
` if George committed murder outside the island sometime before this crime, he could be a "culprit" without killing anyone on the island, and it would be possible for him to lie}."`
`The deep‐red curves cut by the swings bit into the goat.`
`Its massive body was knocked into the air......became a bundle of roughly seven logs of flesh, and was thrown into the rose bushes.`
`This time, the terrible force of the attack shocked the goats.`
` They faltered, shook, stepped back.`
`......Finally, I understood.`
`That red slice.`
` ......It had come from a weapon that could draw red trails—no, it had also drawn blue trails just a second ago—`
`a massive scythe that could speak both types of truth, red and blue, at will.`
`I looked up at the sky, ......then let my head hang down backwards.`
`There was no black cat there.`
`It was a girl......holding a large scythe......`
`"How's that?`
` A deduction like this is trivial for Furudo Erika."`
`A stir passed through the crowd of goats as they acknowledged the presence of this girl who called herself Erika.`
`It was clear that her mere existence here was potent enough to unsettle them.`
`Clutching me in her arms, Erika leapt into the air and landed as light as a feather on top of the arbor.`
`Then, she let go of me and, still wielding her scythe, made an elegant curtsy to the crowd of goats surrounding us.`
`"This is probably the first time most of you have met me.`
` Allow me to introduce myself!`
` Hello and good day!`
` I'm Furudo Erika, the detective!"`
`"......Let's have the blockheads who can only think of the Rudolf's family culprit theory step down!`
` If anyone thinks they can counter my argument, please feel free!`
` Naturally, I welcome the challenge!!"`
`The goats all howled at once.`
` It seemed to be a cry of shock, of fear, or possibly of wonder.`
`The goats surrounded the arbor, chattering, but not moving any closer.`
`None of them had the courage to stand against this detective, this Witch of Truth called Furudo {f:5:Erika}...`
`"......Good grief.`
` All those thousands, and this is the best you can do?`
` None of you has the courage to fight Furudo Erika in a battle of words?"`
`"......Too bad.`
` Let's put an end to this.`
` Then again, I am the great Furudo Erika.`
` .........I don't have the time to waste on countering all you blockheads one by one.`
` I'll let her clean up the rest.`
` .........You're up!!"`
`When Erika cried out, red cracks opened in the dark night's sky.`
`They looked like the spiderweb‐shaped fissures that appear when a glass window has been struck hard.`
` ......No, it actually was a spiderweb, colored blood‐red.`
`"......*giggle*giggle*, ......kyaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha......!"`
`A laugh, ......a witch's laugh, rang out through the spiderweb‐covered world.`
` It sounded somehow familiar to Ange...`
`And there, ......standing above the spiderweb,`
` ......gazing down on the goats who must have looked like ensnared little bugs, was the witch.`
`"You forget me, .........and you call {i:him} the ruler of Rokkenjima......?`
` You forget me, and you think Rudolf is the culpriiiit...?`
` Kyahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!!"`
`It was the witch who lurked inside of Eva—a witch of the future, who would one day call herself an Endless Witch after the cat box closed over this world.`
`"Who dares speak of the murders of this island without involving {f:5:Eva Beatrice}?!`
` How impertinent!`
` On this island, who lives and who dies is totally up to me!!`
` All the wealth and gold is mine!!`
` Everything about October 4th and 5th in 1986 is mine to do with as I please!`
` It all belongs to me, {f:5:Eva Beatrice}!!"`
`{f:5:Eva} swung her one‐winged staff at the crowd of foolish goats beneath her and sentenced them to death.`
`The spiderweb ceiling covering the heavens plummeted, and more spiderwebs seeped out of the ground at the goats' feet.`
`Then, the webs from above and below met, and thousands upon thousands of goats were caught in their grasp.`
`Then, as {f:5:Eva} swung her staff, it swirled.`
` Around and around, like egg yolk being mixed in a bowl.`
`Eventually, it was all packed into a massive, blood‐red lump of goo.`
`The moans of goats drifted out from inside.`
`That entire crowd had been compressed into a meatball a few meters across.`
`"So, you morons doubt that I'm the culprit?!!"`
`"Reaching the Eva culprit theory and giving up there is good enough for the likes of you."`
`"Why don't you just get crushed and disappear fore{f:5:va}aa?!?!"`
`Squelch.`
`No other word could do that sound justice.`
`After sucking in all of those goats, the spider web ball vanished into thin air with a squelch.`
`After that, there wasn't even a trace left.`
`{n}Only the nighttime scenery of the rose garden remained, silent but for the sound of the falling rain......`
`{f:5:Eva} drifted down from the sky.`
`"Your aunt will always be on your side, Ange‐chan.`
` ......I'll never let anyone insult your family."`
`"A‐......Aunt Eva............"`
`I knew I should be grateful.`
`And yet, ......it really wasn't easy for me to believe that Aunt Eva was my ally.`
`{f:5:Eva} realized that too.`
`"Don't worry.`
` I'm not doing this because I want to be thanked.`
` But I'll always be on your side.`
` ......See you later."`
`She giggled, spun around, and vanished...`
`Now that she had already left, I started to regret not saying even a thank you...`
`So, ......I figured I should at least thank the other person who had saved me.`
`"......Thanks......for saving me...`
` Who......are you...?"`
`I already knew her name.`
`What I was really asking......was why she had saved me.`
`"I'm Furudo Erika, the detective.`
` .........And I'm also a witch."`
`"......A witch...?"`
`"A Witch of Truth.`
` ......A witch who searches for the Single Truth.`
` And......you're the same, aren't you?"`
`"..........................."`
`Those two days...October 4th and 5th, 1986.`
`I was so desperate to know what happened......that I took a step off the roof of that skyscraper,`
` ......drifted through several witch games and fragment worlds, and abandoned myself to this long journey with no rewards.`
`All I want......is to know what happened that day.`
`All I want......is the Single Truth of that day.`
`"Looking for something like that is what makes someone a Witch of Truth.`
` So, you're just the same as me.`
` ......That's why I came to save you."`
`"......I...want to know.`
` ......Just what happened on that day?`
` No one will tell me! No one knows...!`
` But I know something happened that day!"`
`"I'd give up anything to learn what that was...!`
` That's the one thing I need to know no matter what, even if it kills me...!`
` So tell me!`
` Do you know the answer?!`
` What happened on this island?!"`
`"......To a Witch of Truth,`
` is the truth something that is {i:given}?`
` If I told you that such‐and‐such was the truth, would you really just accept whatever I said...?"`
`"No, ......I wouldn't........."`
`"What did Battler‐san show you today?"`
`......Today, ............Onii‐chan showed me a bizarre Halloween party.`
`It may have been heart‐warming......and a lot of fun, but...`
`It definitely......wasn't the truth.`
`"Didn't Battler‐san show you that saying it was the truth?"`
`"It isn't.`
` ......That couldn't......be the truth!"`
`"Sometimes, other people will try to mislead us by claiming they know the truth.`
` ......But a real Witch of Truth must continue to pursue the Single Truth without being led astray.`
` That's why you can't accept the fake truth that Battler‐san's trying to force on you.`
` ......You care about finding the one real truth more than anything."`
`"..................Yeah..."`
`Onii‐chan......is trying to muddy the waters.`
`I've felt that this whole time.`
`Even though he knows everything about what happened that day, ......he won't tell me anything at all.`
`How is he any different from Aunt Eva,`
` who mocked me and refused to tell me anything, even until the very moment of her death?`
`......Why won't Onii‐chan tell me?`
`{n}..............................`
`"............Why...?"`
`"........................"`
`"Why......won't he tell me?!"`
`The dam inside my heart burst.`
`"Why won't Onii‐chan......tell me what really happened?!!`
` Why? Why...?!!`
` I'm the only one who doesn't know!!`
` No one's telling me the truth!!`
` Tell me!!`
` Tell me what happened that day, Onii‐chan!!`
` Onii‐chaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aan!!!"`
`I cried out at the rainy night sky.`
`Hot tears poured from my eyes, but they were covered by the cold rain that beat against me, so no one other than me would know that they were tears.`
`......No one would know my pain and sadness.`
`I'm.........always the only one left out......all alone......`
`"Someone, tell me!!!`
` Tell me what happened that day!!!"`
`"......No one can tell you.`
` .........After all, truth is something you can only grasp on your own."`
`"Where is the truth?!`
` How can I find it?!`
` Everyone's hiding it! They won't tell me!`
` I'll grasp it myself...!`
` So please, just tell me where the truth is hidden...!"`
`{a:c:`
`".........Very well.`
` I can tell you."}`
`As that voice rang out, the world bent and swirled.`
`{n}After blinking several times, ......I realized that the world had become a sea of stars.`
`No, that's not quite right.`
` There are stars up there in the sky, but those lights below me aren't stars.`
`They're lights from building windows, street lights, car lights.`
`......I was floating in the dark sky............over a city lined with skyscrapers.`
`".........I can't tell you what the truth is.`
` ......However, if it's a question of how the truth can be reached,`
` ......I can show you the way."`
`"You.................."`
`Various bad memories are jumping out at me from the back of my mind.`
`......That's right.`
` I was chained in place in that strange theater thing......and forced to watch a repulsive fragment where Mom and Dad committed murder......`
`"......I never said that what you saw was the truth."`
`"B‐but you used the red to......"`
`"You yelled out and interrupted, and stopped me from saying any more.`
` ......This is all truth "of a sort, but not necessarily true". That's what I was about to say."`
`".........Just how far are you willing to go to mock me......?"`
`"......I apologize.`
` But I did want to test you."`
`"Test me how?"`
`"I wanted to see if you were ready to accept the truth, no matter what it may be."`
`".............................."`
`"......The truth can betray you sometimes.`
` In fact, there are times when it shows itself as the thing you desire least."`
`"......That fragment I showed you...`
`was probably the worst one imaginable for you.`
` ......However, you aren't fit to reach the truth unless you have the strength and the courage to withstand it, even if it's something like that."`
`".................."`
`I have no comeback.`
`Finding the truth is my goal.`
` I just want to know what happened on that island on that day.`
`......I don't think of myself as wanting to hear only the facts that are pleasing to me.`
`......Have I really been prepared.........to face the bloody, unbearable truth that's probably waiting there for me...?`
`.........If I find the truth, ......it'll mean having to confront my family's tragic end directly......and accept it as it is.`
`And accepting that...`
`.........means abandoning any faint hope for that convenient miracle,`
` ......the idea that one of them might have survived somehow......and might return even though twelve years have passed.`
`Even though I know a miracle like that would be completely ridiculous,`
` ......if I'm honest with myself, I have to admit that the faint hope it brought me has given me comfort these past twelve years.`
`......I want to know the truth.`
` But I want one of them to come back.`
`Those two wishes contradict each other.`
`By learning the truth, ......I'll be forced to accept that no one's coming home......`
`"............The truth is always cruel.`
` At times, it can even cut down your hopes.`
` .........Most of the time, {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s don't realize the costs of learning the truth.`
` ......I simply wanted to see if you had the necessary resolve."`
`I must choose between my two contradicting wishes.`
`Will I find the truth...`
`...and abandon my optimistic hopes for my family's return?`
`Or will I give up on the truth...`
`...and keep waiting for the family that's never actually going to come back,`
` .........deceiving my numb self forever with the childish illusion my brother provided for me?`
`"...............Tell me, Ange.`
` ......Are you truly determined to learn the truth......?"`
`"..............................`
` .........I am."`
`"And your resolve will not falter?"`
`"It won't."`
`After hearing my immediate reply, {f:5:Bernkastel} stared at me.`
`Are those expressionless eyes of hers......measuring my resolve?`
`Now that my brother has even gone to the lengths of becoming a Game Master to cover up the truth...`
`...the only thing I can rely on in my search for the truth is the path that {f:5:Bernkastel} can show me...`
`".........Deep in your eyes...`
`...I see the glint of one who seeks the truth."`
`"Will you tell me?!`
` Will you show me the way that leads to the truth...?!"`
`"Yes.`
` .........I'll guide you.`
` Did you forget, Ange?`
` ..........I am your guardian, am I not...?"`
`When did I last hear {f:5:Bernkastel} use that word?`
`......That's right.`
` At the very beginning, I met her in this future world and became a witch, with her as my guardian.`
`............That's when I become the {f:5:Beatrice} of 1998, the one who could defeat the {f:5:Beatrice} of 1986...`
`"You are the {f:5:Beatrice} of 1998.`
` ......{f:5:Ange Beatrice}.`
` ......I became your guardian and recognized you as a witch.`
` However, you aren't an Endless Witch like Beato."`
`".........A Witch of Truth."`
`"That's right.`
` .........You're like Erika.`
` A Witch of Truth, who will seek the Single Truth, undeceived by any illusions."`
`"As a Witch of Truth, ......{f:5:Ange Beatrice}.........has the power to reach the Single Truth, right...?"`
`"Yes.`
` ......However, up until now, you have been unable to use this power.`
` Do you know why?"`
`"......I do now.`
` .........Even as I sought the truth, ......I unconsciously resisted finding it out."`
`"Exactly.`
` ......Finding the truth was your goal,`
` ......but at the same time, you were unconsciously afraid that learning the truth would mean losing that miracle of your family coming back.`
` ......So, you didn't have what it took to stretch your hand out to the Single Truth."`
`".................................`
` ......You're completely right......`
` I have to admit......that I was naive..."`
`I must admit it.`
`......My entire family is dead.`
`And with recognition of that fact,`
` ......I must expose why they died, and who was behind it.`
`"......Thanks.`
` .........The fragment you showed me in that dark theater......was there to open my eyes."`
`"Many, many games have gone by, waiting for you to become a true Witch of Truth.`
` ......But I think there was a purpose for all of it.`
` ......After all, now, in this final game, you have become a Witch of Truth."`
`".........Tell me.`
` ......What happened on that island that day?`
` ......I won't ask you to tell me that directly.`
` So guide me.`
` What can I do to reach the truth...?!"`
`"It's a bit too chilly here.`
` .........Let's move."`
`"To where?"`
`"To a place better for drinking tea."`
`Massive applause filled the hall.`
`It was applause in honor of a good fight.`
` Applause in honor of {f:5:Bernkastel}.`
`"Yes, Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}'s game was another splendid one!"`
`"We're going to reveal her game board to all of you, so have a go at it.`
` It's pretty awesome!"`
`"......But you solved it in the end all the same."`
`"A game that no one can solve isn't a game.`
` The main point is whether it was fun or not."`
`"It was fun!`
` I guarantee it."`
`"Same here.`
` At first, I thought there was no way anyone could solve it, but the way you can use one confirmed purple statement after another to narrow down the suspects made for a nice puzzle."`
`"Come, everyone! Gather around, gather around!"`
`"Just what sort of game is Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}'s mystery?!"`
`""That's for you to find out for yourselves!!""`
`Objects resembling chessboards were set out on several tables.`
`Crowds gathered around each, looking down with interest.`
`"Hohoh, it's like a logic puzzle."`
`"Quite an orthodox one, don't you think?"`
`"So this is what a witch's game is like."`
`"Hmm.`
` Looking at it like this, it's just a game.`
` ......But for the pieces, it's a massive series of crimes."`
`"Pu ku ku.`
` Indeed it is."`
`"It would not do to waste such a rare gift from Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}.`
` Let us take this opportunity to enjoy {f:5:ourselves}."`
`"Still, this is a tough one......`
` It almost makes you wonder if it was even made to be solvable, doesn't it...?"`
`"You can't get anywhere unless you start by believing it was made to be solvable.`
` ......A battle of wits can't begin until you trust the questioner that the problem can be solved."`
`"And we'll guarantee that it can.`
` Come on, have a go at it...!"`
`With Battler's encouragement, discussions over {f:5:Bernkastel}'s mystery game began at each table.`
`The mix of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s and fantasy creatures in heated discussion was truly a sight to behold.`
`Beato and {f:5:Bernkastel} sat in a chair far off from the discussions.`
`"Would you like some tea?"`
`"Any kind of calming black tea for me.`
` With milk, if you don't mind."`
`"As you wish.`
` ......Is there anything you need, Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}?"`
`"......Please add some dried plums to some black tea.`
` ......That's the trick to making terrible tea drinkable."`
`"*cackle*!`
` Come now, don't sulk.`
` We're honestly complimenting your game for being such a fun one."`
`Since she had emerged victorious in the game {f:5:Bernkastel} had put all her heart into, the look on Beato's face was positively gleeful.`
`"......I'm not sulking.`
` My face just looks this way."`
`"When I manage to spot Bern's own kind of warmth in that expression of hers,`
` I feel like I've climbed to the pitch‐black top of a snowy mountain and found the most beautiful star."`
`"......Well, sorry for having an eternally frosty face."`
`"How difficult it is to compliment Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}.`
` No matter what you say, she always takes it in a bad way."`
`"That's okay.`
` She's the kind who'll think about it for hours later on."`
`"Hohoh, the type who lies in bed thinking about it and hugging her pillow."`
`"Yep, that's Bern, that's totally Bern."`
`Beato and {f:5:Lambdadelta} giggled together.`
`{n}{f:5:Bernkastel} shrugged and looked away...`
`"Seriously though,`
` this really was a fun, puzzling game."`
`"Was it?`
` .........Thanks."`
`"Even though you could've made it unsolvable,`
` you really did make it to be solved.`
` ......That's not something you can do unless you plan on enjoying a fair game."`
`"......I like games where I win no matter what.`
` Games that I might lose are just a pain."`
`"Later, I'd like to switch sides and try another one.`
` I'll make a puzzle, and we'll see if you can solve it.`
` A game for you to win against me."`
`".............................."`
`"Of course, I'll use all the know‐how I've picked up in my fights with Beato to make it super‐hard.`
` I'm gonna be aiming to win two in a row...!"`
`"............Both you and Beato.`
` ......You have such an interesting way of thinking."`
`"How's that?"`
`"......A game is just a means to decide who wins and who loses, right?`
` When you create one, your own victory should be your highest priority.`
` ......So, why would you go to all the trouble of making a game you might lose...?"`
`"What fun is there in a game that you always win?`
` That's not even a game."`
`".............................."`
`"Victory and defeat.`
` It's fun because you're taking part in a fair competition, balanced between those two outcomes.`
` A game isn't a fight.`
` It's communication.`
` You enjoy the process.`
` And if you manage to win, well, that's just an added bonus."`
`".........Finally.`
` ......Finally, I clearly understand the difference between how all of you think and how I think."`
`"What difference?"`
`"For you, this is communication.`
` ......It isn't for me."`
`"The world you live in must be pretty savage."`
`"...............And what about you?`
` ......Wasn't it the same for you, until you understood Beato's game?`
` ......An eternal game is eternal torture.`
` ......Have you already completely forgotten about that pain you suffered...?"`
`".....................`
` ......There were days I did think that.`
` ......But the game is over now.`
` At the end of a game, I don't complain about stuff that's in the past.`
` What happens on the field stays on the field."`
`"That.........is the critical difference between you and me, I think.`
` ......Your eternal torture was something you could laugh off and forget.`
` ......Mine wasn't nearly so trivial.`
` ......That's all there is to it."`
`"......I don't know your history.`
` ......It sounds like you had it rough."`
`"Hmph.`
` ......To think I'm getting sympathy from a {i:promoted piece}. I must be losing my touch."`
`{f:5:Bernkastel}, sipping the black tea that Genji had brought her, gazed up at the ceiling with a faraway look.`
`Battler may not have known her history,`
` ......but even he was able to understand a bit of how she felt.`
`".........Are you...`
`being tortured by someone right now?"`
`"Are you kidding?`
` .........I'm as free as can be.`
` I'm not bound by anyone's shackles."`
`"Then that's a good thing, isn't it?`
` At least things are better for you now."`
`"............True.`
` It's much better now than it once was.`
` ......Though I am on this long, endless journey to escape from boredom."`
`"Then, at the very least, your encounters here should have been a good thing for you."`
`"Indeed.`
` ......Even the taste of defeat has driven boredom away from me for a time."`
`No, no.`
` Battler was shaking his head and laughing.`
`"......We're friends who've enjoyed fighting in a fair game."`
`"So.........?"`
`"If your days are filled with nothing except running away from boredom,`
` ......feel free to drop by our place every now and then.`
` We'd love to welcome a friend.`
` And we'll spare no effort in setting up all the entertainment needed to help a friend escape from boredom."`
`"You think you can prepare entertainment interesting enough to help {i:me}, the great {f:5:Bernkastel}, escape boredom for even a night...?"`
`"I do.`
` That's what it means to be a friend."`
`".............................."`
`"We won tonight's game.`
` So, the next time you come, we'll switch sides.`
` This time, we'll entertain you with one of our games."`
`"......Of course, we don't intend to let you win easily.`
` We'll challenge you to a devilishly twisted logic game!`
` It won't be something you can solve in a night.`
` It'll be good enough to make you stay for months, wracking your brains over it."`
`".........You would entertain the great {f:5:Bernkastel} as a friend......?"`
`"Yeah, we would."`
`"......Hmph......`
` .........After talking with you,`
` even this dried plum tea is starting to taste sickly sweet.`
` What a pain."`
`"I heard from Beato.`
` Sounds like this dried plum tea stuff is one of your favorites.`
` Next time, we'll toss some high‐class dried plums covered in gold leaf into your tea, so make sure you come again."`
`".........If you really plan to do that, I suggest you find some better tea to start with.`
` ......Tea like this doesn't inspire me to pay you a second visit."`
`"Ah, come on.`
` Guess you drink high‐grade black tea all the time.`
` Alright, then next time, why don't you invite us to somewhere we can drink some of this high‐quality tea?"`
`"..................Me......invite you?`
` ............*giggle*, ............aha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha."`
`"It's only fair, right?`
` We've treated you.`
` Now it's your turn."`
`"Yes, it would be only fair."`
`"So, let's have the game be fair too.`
` Let's switch sides and start a new game.`
` I'm looking forward to it.`
` We won this time, but who knows about the next...?!"`
`".........That's some confidence you have there.`
` And yet, I'm afraid you're mistaken on one point."`
`"What's that?"`
`"My game isn't over yet.`
` ......I wonder who will win in the end."`
`After taking one more sip of her black tea, {f:5:Bernkastel} set her cup on the table, wearing a thin smile.`
`"......The tea here's far too sweet to drink.`
` ......Thank you, Genji.`
` Take this away, please."`
`"As you wish......"`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} asked for her tea to be taken away after taking only two sips.`
`Battler smiled, realizing that this was just {f:5:Bernkastel}'s way of being shy.`
`....................................`
`Battler.`
` ......Why are you smiling with such a foolish, carefree face...?`
`If you really think this final game will be nothing but a happy epilogue...`
`...then I'll have to invite you all to a proper game for bringing this tale to a close.`
`Battler.`
` You forget things too easily.`
`Don't you remember in whose hands lie the key to this final game......?`
`The inside of my nose itched.`
`I'd never regained consciousness to a smell before.`
`Slowly, I opened my eyes.`
`......Wait, when did I lose consciousness in the first place?`
`I don't remember going to sleep or falling unconscious.`
`That's right.`
` ......{f:5:Bernkastel} invited me to come to a place better for drinking tea......`
`......That's when my memory gets hazy.`
` And, since the smell of black tea is what woke me up...`
`"...............Where am I......?"`
`"Auaurora's study.`
` ......I hate to admit it, but her taste in tea really is excellent."`
`I was sitting on what appeared to be a sofa in a dimly lit study.`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} sat across from me.`
` ......And right before my eyes was a beautiful cup filled with steaming hot tea.`
`".........Isn't............this place............"`
`I remembered.`
`{n}I've been here before.`
` ......Wasn't it.........`
`{a:c:`
`"How pleasant it is to see you again, child of man."}`
`......Yes, that voice.`
` Just hearing it brings back memories.`
`"Long time no see,`
` .........my master."`
`"I didn't think I would get the chance to welcome you into my study again.`
` ......To think that that game of yours is still continuing."`
`"......It won't be continuing much longer.`
` This is the end, the true final game."`
`This was the study of {f:5:Featherine Augustus Aurora}.`
`The majestic Witch of Theatergoing, Drama, and Spectating.`
`......Once in the past, I was summoned by her and ordered to be her Reader, or miko.`
`"Don't tell me you want me to Read again..."`
`"I wasn't the one who called you here.`
` ......My miko brought the two of us together."`
`"For what reason...?"`
`"Isn't it obvious?`
` ......To show you the path that leads to the truth."`
`"You'll show me the way, {f:5:Featherine}?"`
`".........I am the Witch of Theatergoing.`
` ......Though I dislike interfering with the actors on the stage."`
`"So, between Battler's boring play...`
`and my exciting one that manipulates the branches of fate, which would you rather watch?`
` ......I know you can't stand even a minute of boredom."`
`"Pft, ......heheheheheheheh."`
`As {f:5:Featherine} rocked her rocking chair, she looked up at the ceiling and chuckled.`
`She clearly holds some key to the truth I seek.`
`".........And yet, you are literally the one holding the key.`
` ......I can do nothing but tell you where to find the keyhole. Child of man."`
`I don't remember saying anything out loud, but {f:5:Featherine} answered my question as though I had.`
`......Come to think of it, that's right.`
`{f:5:Featherine} can read the thoughts of a mere child of man like me as easily as she can hear me speak.`
`Well, I guess that'll help us get to the point quicker...`
`"Onii‐chan gave me this key.`
` But he just said something about how I'd know how to use it when the time was right—he didn't tell me what it's actually for.`
` ......Do you two know?`
` What is this key for?`
` Onii‐chan said it was something very precious."`
`"Explain, my miko."`
`"No way.`
` You explain."`
`"......You demand that your master explain?"`
`"You've got to participate on the stage every now and then.`
` Otherwise you'll just go senile all the faster."`
`"My, my......`
` And yet, the memory of my long‐overdue appearance on the stage when Ange was Reader should have been enough to last me a few more centuries."`
`"Tell me.`
` ......What is this key?"`
`"A physical manifestation of the decision you are to make.`
` ......This tale, this game...`
`...will end by asking you to make a certain decision.`
` What you hold there is the act of your decision embodied in the form of a key."`
`"The physical manifestation......of my decision......"`
`"Exactly.`
` Ultimately, Battler is probably planning to put you in front of two doors, both of which can be opened by the key.`
` Then, he'll ask you to choose which door to open.`
` He must have told you that much, right?"`
`"..................He didn't tell me anything at all.`
` ......He just kept saying things like "you'll know when the time comes".`
` ......No one will tell me anything. ......Not Onii‐chan, not anyone..."`
`"Battler probably wants to respect a decision that you make by your own free will."`
`"But Ange.`
` ......You should've at least started to figure it out by now, right?"`
`"......Figure what out?"`
`"There's an answer Battler wants you to choose, isn't there......?"`
`Those words......made my heart jump in my chest.`
`......I've been thinking that.`
`Onii‐chan is clearly trying......to distance me from the truth,`
` to gloss over it with a vague tale that's almost like a daydream.`
`At the 1986 family conference...`
`...everyone had a wonderful time as they faded away.`
`Everyone is smiling down on you from heaven,`
` so you don't need to feel alone, even in 1998.`
` So give it your all and live on by yourself.`
`......I get the very strong sense that Onii‐chan is intending to end it just like that.`
`And every time I ask him about it,`
` he dodges the issue and says something about how the decision will be mine in the end.`
`"That's right.`
` It may appear that Battler is giving you a fair choice,`
` ......but he's actually scheming to get you to choose one of the two answers.`
` .........You've already seen the farce of a tale that he's using to do that, right?"`
`......That unbelievably bizarre Halloween party.`
`Everyone so strangely friendly that it was almost sickening.`
`I've already seen more than enough of that tale, so sickly sweet it makes me want to vomit,`
` where Ushiromiya Kinzo showered me with affection, where his children swore to support each other, ......where everyone was filled with happiness and hope.`
`"......He's trying to trick me with those chummy scenes......so he can keep me away from the truth.`
` .........He's such a...coward..."`
`"Certainly, he might be called a coward from your perspective.`
` But remember.`
` If you are a player in this game and Battler is the Game Master, ......what does that mean?"`
`"In the past, Battler was a player and Beato was the Game Master.`
` And they each fought for their own respective truths.`
` .........So, what is it this time?"`
`"......I'm a player......and Onii‐chan's the Game Master."`
`Could it be......that I've misunderstood everything from the very beginning?`
`Onii‐chan said he'd tell me what happened that day,`
` ......so I was under the impression that I'd learn everything if I followed him.`
`.........How would that be any different than, say,`
` Onii‐chan accepting everything Beato said about the crimes being the work of a witch?`
`What a......stupid mistake I've been making......`
`"......This game.........has always been a fight between me and Onii‐chan......?"`
`"I'm surprised you participated in the game without realizing that."`
`"......................................."`
`"Battler really is sly.`
` He just started up the final game without letting you realize that simple fact.`
` ......Well, it was the same back in Beato's games.`
` Battler was drawn into her game before he knew what was happening.`
` Before he even knew how to fight.`
` .........That's why I taught him how."`
`"It's exactly the same now.`
` ......You were forced to start this game before you understood anything about it, and I've come to tell you the truth.`
` To tell you who you're fighting against, and for what."`
`"......................................."`
`I was......too shocked to speak.`
`And finally, ......I realized what I needed to accomplish in this game.`
`I've always been passive.`
`I was sure that Onii‐chan would tell me everything,`
` ......so I naively thought I just had to believe whatever he said...`
`"No.`
` ......That was wrong."`
`This game is a battle...`
`......between me, the one who wants to reach the truth, ......and Onii‐chan, who wants to trick me and chase me out into a 1998 where I'm all alone...`
`All this time, ......I've kept on saying that Onii‐chan was foolish and naive,`
` .........and now I see that I was more naive than anyone else...`
`Despite this, {f:5:Bernkastel} didn't sneer at me.`
`On the contrary, ......she looked at me with that cold gaze, as if to say "so you've finally taken the first step".`
`".........Now do you understand?`
` Your own purpose......and the purpose of that key."`
`I gripped the key that Onii‐chan had hung around my neck...`
`and for a while, I shook with an emotion that even I couldn't understand.`
`Now that I know Onii‐chan tricked me, it would be easy to hate him.`
`{n}But hating him would be missing the point.`
`After all, ......this is a game between me and him.`
`Onii‐chan has done nothing but make the optimal moves to win against me.`
`......If games aren't just a playful way to communicate,`
` ......if they're the process that decides who wins and who loses...`
`...then there can be no fair games.`
`The best strategy is obviously to hit your opponent with a sneak attack and defeat them before they even know what's going on, never even telling them the rules......`
`......In that sense, .........Onii‐chan hasn't done anything wrong.`
`He's......using that sickly sweet illusion to trick me.........and force me out into a lonely future......`
`They'll be the only ones having a good time in the cat box, and I'll be the only one chased out.`
`"..................Thank you.`
` ......I'm grateful.`
` I think I've finally been able to truly open my eyes."`
`"Please, don't hate Battler.`
` After all, one‐sidedly tricking the opponent is what Game Masters do."`
`"......I know.`
` Onii‐chan took the best option from his position.`
` That's all there is to it.`
` ............So, I need to make the best possible moves from my position."`
`My goal is now clear.`
`October 4th and 5th, 1986.`
`{n}What happened on Rokkenjima that day.`
`I need to tear off the veil covering the truth.`
` Nothing more, nothing less. `
`"............Onii‐chan gave me this key......probably because he wants me to put it into the keyhole of his choosing.`
` ......That's why he keeps showing me this sentimental illusion.`
` But I won't be fooled anymore.`
` ......I'll open the door I want to open."`
`"Certainly, this is more my kind of tale than one with an Ange who does whatever Battler says."`
`"In that case, I really will hand things over to you now.`
` ......Tell Ange.`
` Tell her where the keyhole that leads to the truth is."`
`"Tell me.`
` Where is the keyhole?!"`
`".........Very well.`
` Have a seat first of all.`
` I will bring it over right now."`
`When {f:5:Featherine} rose from her rocking chair, ......my vision seemed to twist and bend.`
`......What? Some kind of interference?`
`Why now, when {f:5:Featherine}'s about to show me something important,`
` .........is my head......getting......suddenly......`
`I dug my fingernails into my knees, clenching my teeth to keep from losing consciousness.`
`However, ......the world just kept twisting more and more......`
`Except for the feel of the sofa beneath me, I couldn't sense anything at all......`
`"Missy?"`
`".........Huh?"`
`"It looks like she's here."`
`The door opened.........and Hachijo Tohya appeared.`
`......What's going on?`
`This isn't the world of witches......but the world of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s...?`
`I was sitting on a sofa...and Amakusa was behind me.`
`..............................`
`......There's no need to feel confused.`
`{f:5:Featherine} and Hachijo Tohya are the same being.`
`To her, the difference between the two worlds is a trivial thing.`
`To put it in the words of that lover of theatergoing, ......it's like having a slightly different background behind the stage.`
`So, there was no reason for me to feel hesitant.`
`"......Should I call you Hachijo this time?"`
`"How complicated names are.`
` ......Even though both of us are still here, just like before,`
` you have to wonder what to call me."`
`"......True.`
` Calling you {f:5:Featherine} would be a bit rude to you now.`
` ......To an actor, the names of the parts they play are only temporary."`
`"Precisely, child of man."`
`"{f:5:Featherine}??"`
`Amakusa's eyes went wide as he wondered what I was suddenly talking about.`
`{n}I ignored him and continued.`
`"......So, what are you going to show me?"`
`As I spoke, my eyes were caught by that heavy‐looking object she held under her arm.`
`At a glance, it looked like an encyclopedia with a fancy binding...`
`"Do you know what this is?"`
`As {f:5:Featherine} spoke, she set the heavy object on the table.`
`My first thought......was of a grimoire.`
`The heavy book had a mysterious, mystical feel to it, like something Maria onee‐chan might carry around.`
`And the most remarkable feature of it......was the large, sturdy lock that held it shut.`
`Why would someone go so far to keep people from reading a book......?`
`"Why don't you take it and observe the back?"`
`".........The back...?"`
`I flipped the heavy book over on my lap.`
`And, as soon as I saw it, I gave a small gasp.`
`"............EVA...`
`......USHIROM...... Ushiromiya...`
` ......Ushiromiya Eva!"`
`Without a doubt, those words were written there in English letters.`
`"What is this...?`
` Aunt Eva's......diary...?"`
`"Could this be......that rumored..."`
`"Do you know something about this...?!"`
`"Just a rumor.`
` ......They say that President Eva had a secret diary, and that she always kept it locked up.`
` ......They say she took it with her everywhere she went... At least, that's what I heard from some of the other bodyguards."`
`"......A secret......diary...`
` And why is that here......?"`
`"It was in the hospital room where Ushiromiya Eva passed away."`
`This diary was hidden behind her bed.`
`So, it remained in that room for some time after her death before it was found.`
`It was probably someone who worked for the hospital, or else a patient or their family, who happened to find it.`
`......Of course, by that time, there was a huge movement dedicated to the Rokkenjima mystery.`
`A locked diary found in the hospital room where Ushiromiya Eva spent her last moments...`
`...would be absolutely priceless.`
`The discoverer probably handed it over in secret to one of the "Witch Hunters", who would be able to accurately determine its worth.`
`Luckily, the Witch Hunters who got their hands on this book were all noble and upright people.`
`Not content to boorishly destroy the lock and reveal the truth,`
` ......they simply satisfied themselves with the fact that the truth of that day slumbered just on the other side of this mysterious lock.`
`Thanks to that, ......Eva's diary has remained undamaged to this very day...`
`"It is already known that Natsuhi, wife of Krauss, the eldest son of Kinzo,`
` sealed all of her complaints and repressed feelings by writing them down in a diary, which she treated like a sort of charm."`
`"......So, Aunt Eva did the same thing?"`
`"It's possible, at least.`
` ......Unlocking the hinges of this diary would be a pain even if you did have a key.`
` It's sealed up tight like a corset."`
`Amakusa was right.`
`This wasn't a diary made to be casually opened and reminisced over.`
`......It's probably safe to assume that this diary was used to forget things by writing them down and sealing them away, just like Ushiromiya Natsuhi's.`
`And on top of that, Eva brought it with her into her hospital room, then hid it behind the bed without telling anyone about it...`
`".........Don't tell me that diary contains...`
` ......Are you saying Aunt Eva wrote down what happened that day...?"`
`"By reading its contents, you will probably learn everything.`
` ......However, we don't know where the key that unlocks it is."`
`I jumped.`
`Then, I looked down at my chest.`
`{n}That's where my brother hung that key......`
`"Huh?`
` I‐......it's gone!`
` Th‐......the key's gone...!"`
`"......What's wrong, missy?`
` What key?"`
`"It's been hanging from my neck the whole time, hasn't it?!"`
`"......I never noticed it.`
` You had a key hanging from your neck...?"`
`I understood almost immediately.`
`In the world of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s, I haven't found the key.`
`The "me" with the key......is on the game board in the world of witches.`
`"Make me the "me" with the key!`
` I'm going to unlock this diary."`
`{f:5:Featherine} lifted a finger, spun it around, and the world twisted again.`
`When I returned to {f:5:Featherine}'s study, the key faded back into existence, hanging from my neck.`
`But at the same time, ......the diary on my lap faded out of existence.`
`"Where'd the diary go?!"`
`"It should exist somewhere on the game board.`
` Since it is one of the keyholes you are to be given, it must exist somewhere."`
`"Did Onii‐chan hide it somewhere...?"`
`"......Since Battler is trying to make this a game between you and him,`
` it probably isn't completely hidden."`
`"What do you mean...?"`
`"Even if Battler thinks of it as a king that mustn't be taken,`
` there would be no game unless it existed somewhere on this board."`
`"In other words, .........it's somewhere in the Ushiromiya mansion...?"`
`"Or, you may already have been given an opportunity to witness it.`
` ......Like how a swindler has already hidden a trap in microscopic letters on the first page of a contract you sign."`
`"......If Battler follows the rules of mystery as the Game Master,`
` .........‘clues must be shown’,`
` so the choice that leads to Battler's defeat must also have been shown."`
`".........Ange.`
` Try and remember.`
` ......You should have seen Eva's diary already in Battler's world."`
`In that instant, .........from the back of my mind...`
`......drifted the very first scene of this final game.`
`In the chapel...`
`......A book lying on the altar, a book with a lock on it......`
`As soon as I showed interest in that book, ......my brother suddenly got serious and told me not to touch it......`
`"That.........was Aunt Eva's diary........."`
`"That's right.`
` Ushiromiya Eva's diary.`
` The Book of the Single Truth, with the truth of that day written inside it."`
`"......The Book...of the Single Truth......`
` And is the truth really written inside it?`
` After all, there's a chance that it's just something Aunt Eva—"`
`"I'll give it to you in red truth.`
` ......{p:1:Ushiromiya Eva's diary, the Book of the Single Truth,`
` has written within it the truth of Rokkenjima during October 4th and 5th, 1986}."``The discussions over {f:5:Bernkastel}'s reasoning game were getting heated at each of the tables.`
`At some point, each table had started competing to see which could solve it first.`
`"{f:5:Bernkastel}.`
` Haven't Ange and Erika arrived yet?"`
`"......They should be here any moment.`
` Wanna make a bet on who arrives first?"`
`"I can understand Erika being late, but what about Ange?`
` ......Just what kind of pit did you toss her into this time?"`
`"How rude.`
` She was sitting on a sofa sipping tea."`
`"Hopefully the sort of tea you drink suits Ange's tastes."`
`"Hahaha, good point."`
`"How rude.`
` That tea would suit anyone's tastes.`
` ......Erika would even lick the last drop of my tea from the bottom of a miso soup pot."`
`"......How does miso soup come into this picture...?"`
`"Now that you mention her, ......Erika...!`
` This will be a long awaited reunion."`
`"Yeah, come to think of it.`
` Can't wait to see how long it'll take her to solve {f:5:Bernkastel}'s game."`
`"......This sort of game is what that kid's best at.`
` She'll probably read it from start to finish three times, then just say the answer right away."`
`"Probably.`
` I look forward to seeing her give the correct answer immediately with that smug look on her face."`
`"Come now, this is Erika we're talking about.`
` She'll probably pull out some twisted logic and say that it was possible for someone other than Battler's family."`
`"Good point.`
` In fact, I'd like to hear her proud, twisted logic even more than the right answer."`
`Apparently, Battler and Beato were looking forward to their reunion with Erika.`
`......They had already dueled with Erika in two separate games.`
`But now, there was no distinction between foes and allies.`
`They truly wanted to welcome her to this "after‐show party" as a friend...`
`"Still, it's a bit unexpected."`
`".........What is?"`
`"You know.`
` It's surprising that you'd let Ange go this easily."`
`Making sure that Battler and the others couldn't see her face, {f:5:Lambdadelta} sniggered.`
`"Is it really so surprising...?"`
`"Of course it is.`
` I thought that, being you, you'd torture Battler with one tough puzzle after another before releasing her,`
` .........or that you'd at least try to give Ange some weird ideas and have her turn the game around in the end."`
`"..........................."`
`"And I thought I knew you better than anyone else in the world.`
` So embarrassing that I was wrong."`
`"......I'm sure it is.`
` But don't worry.`
` ......You obviously do know me better than anyone else in the world."`
`"Y‐......yeah, of course!`
` After all, I love, adore, and understand you more than any other person in the universe{p:0:☆}"`
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} was flustered by {f:5:Bernkastel}'s apparently friendly words, which were very rare, coming from her.`
`"......Battler‐sama.`
` Pardon me for interrupting your conversation.`
` Ange‐sama has returned."`
`"Oh, she's back?!`
` Great.`
` So, is she okay...?"`
`"It seems that she was soaked by the rain, but Kumasawa is bringing her a towel now."`
`When Battler heard this, he breathed a sigh of relief.`
`Then, he turned to face {f:5:Bernkastel}, showing her a forced smile as though apologizing for still suspecting her just a little.`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} showed no reaction, and simply continued to wear a blank expression with a slight smile.`
`"Ange‐sama has returned."`
`".........I'm back."`
`"Battler!`
` Ange's back...!"`
`"Ange...!`
` Wonderful. I was worried."`
`"........................"`
`Ange stared at Battler as he dashed towards her with a relieved smile.`
`Her expression seemed somehow indifferent.`
`"......That Battler.`
` Looks like he thought I had you hanging by chains in a cave or something."`
`"N‐no, no.`
` I didn't think you'd go that far."`
`".........I was just having some tea at the house of one of {f:5:Bernkastel}'s friends.`
` It was delicious."`
`"Were there any dried plums or miso soup in it...?!"`
`"..............................`
` ......Why would there be?"`
`As Ange spoke bluntly, she walked right past her brother and exchanged a few whispered words with {f:5:Bernkastel}.`
`"What is it, Battler?"`
`"Huh? Oh, nothing......`
` Nothing at all."`
`If he said that his little sister being cold to him had left him feeling forlorn, Beato would either laugh at him or scratch him.`
`After all, Ange was a girl at a tender age.`
`She might be in a bad mood for reasons that a man like him couldn't understand.`
`......Taking note of this, and having satisfied himself that Ange was okay, he made to walk away.`
`"Battler.`
` ......Ange is calling for you."`
`"Huh?`
` Oh, sorry."`
`"I've been trying to get your attention for a while.`
` Don't ignore me."`
`"......I wasn't really ignoring you.`
` ......What's going on with you, anyway?`
` You've looked like you're in a bad mood for a while now."`
`"I imagine {f:5:Bernkastel} gave her something strange to drink and pretended it was just a rare sort of black tea.`
` Hyah{0}hyah{0}hya!"`
`"......I have no business with you.`
` Back off for a bit, would you?`
` I want to talk to Onii‐chan alone."`
`"Come, come, I may not look it, but I am the wife of the territory lord...!`
` When it comes to Battler, I am far more—"`
`"......Sorry, Beato.`
` Would you mind leaving for just a bit?"`
`By now, Battler had realized that Ange's issue was more than just a slight bad mood.`
`Beato puffed out her cheeks as though she wanted to say something back.`
` However, she just let out a sigh and walked away...`
`"................................."`
`"......Is this okay?"`
`"It is.`
` After all, this game is between me and you, right?`
` I'm the player.`
` You're the Game Master.`
` ......No matter how many pieces get between us, in the end, it's still a direct battle between you and me."`
`"......Well, it's true that I'm the Game Master, but it's not like I'm fighting against you or anything.`
` This final game was held so you could be invited to the Rokkenjima of 1986."`
`"Games are played to decide who wins and who loses.`
` It's not called a game unless you have foes and allies.`
` ......Don't try to trick me."`
`"What......are you talking about, all of a sudden...?"`
`"You had me totally fooled.`
` At first, I actually thought you'd take me to that day in 1986.`
` ......But that wasn't true!"`
`"This has all been a farce you created, hasn't it?!`
` You're using this sentimental tale to dodge the issue and leave me confused!`
` You're trying to chase me out into a lonely future with nothing but this lukewarm happiness as a parting gift!`
` There's just one thing I've been after since the beginning!`
` What happened on Rokkenjima that day?!"`
`"And the only answer you gave me was this game!`
` This sentimental party of illusions!!`
` Your answer to my question is beyond clear at this point!`
` I want the truth!!`
` And you have no intention of telling me!"`
`"Ange, ......listen, you've got it wrong—"`
`"Don't try and trick me!!`
` I know now that this game is the final fight between me and you!`
` Me, searching for the truth of that day!`
` And you, trying to hide that truth behind an illusion!!"`
`"It's exactly the same!`
` The setup is no different than those fights between you and Beato!`
` It wouldn't have been much longer before I was chased out of the gameboard with everything still vague and fuzzy because of you!"`
`"Well, sorry, but I've already figured out that this game is a battle.`
` Don't think you'll trick me so easily anymore!"`
`Ange's shouting tore apart the peaceful atmosphere.`
`The family members and the residents of fantasy gulped and watched the scene, wondering what was going on......`
`Beato tried to run up to Battler, but he motioned for her to stay back.`
`"......What is it you want?"`
`"There's only one thing I've ever wanted!`
` The truth of Rokkenjima in 1986.`
` That's all I'm looking for!!"`
`"The truth is sealed within the cat box.`
` ......It can't be reached by someone outside the cat box like you."`
`"Is that why you're trying to palm me off with this sentimental illusion?!"`
`"Yes, this is an illusion.`
` However, I wanted you to remember this fun atmosphere, ......the harmony within your family.`
` .........It's not about what happened on that island that day.`
` I wanted you to remember the warmth of these family conferences, a warmth you forgot about."`
`"That's just an illusion you're trying to impose on me!`
` I reject that and deny it completely!!"`
`"The truth of 1986 doesn't exist.`
` The cat box is empty inside.`
` ......You're looking for something that isn't there."`
`"......Hmph.`
` I won't be tricked anymore.`
` .........The truth of that day does exist.`
` ......It was written down by the sole survivor and preserved to this very day!"`
`Battler's expression faltered for just an instant, and Ange didn't miss it.`
`So he was hiding it after all.`
`Onii‐chan...has been hiding the Book of the Single Truth from me...!!`
`"Aunt Eva...!`
` For the first time since your death, I'd like to express my gratitude.`
` ......Because you wrote down what happened that day, you gave me one last chance at learning the truth...!"`
`"A‐......Ange‐chan, you have to listen to me...!`
` Everything I wrote in that diary is nonsense, so it doesn't......"`
`"There's no point trying to deceive me.`
` Your diary has the truth of that day written in it!`
` It's already been proven with the red truth!"`
`"......A‐absurd.`
` Who could possibly use the red truth besides Battler, the Game Master...?!"`
`"..............................`
` ......It's Auaurora, isn't it?"`
`"That's right.`
` ......The "Book of the Single Truth" exists in 1998, the world of the future.`
` Who else could perform the crucial role of confirming its contents with the red truth...?"`
`"I heard everything from {f:5:Bernkastel}!!`
` I've been fooled by you long enough!!`
` I don't want some sentimental illusion.`
` I want the real truth!!"`
`"And no matter how hard you try to cover it up in 1986, I can expose it in 1998!!`
` After all,`
` you are the {f:5:Beatrice} of 1986, Onii‐chan, ......and I am the {f:5:Beatrice} of 1998!!"`
`A cyclone rose up around Ange.`
`It was a golden swirl of gold butterflies.`
`{n}Just like the Golden Witch, {f:5:Beatrice}......`
`"I am {f:5:Ange Beatrice} of 1998, the final Golden Witch!!`
` No witch of the past can defeat a witch of the future!!"`
`The cyclone of gold broke apart, and as gold leaves scattered across the room, .........the final witch, who would inherit {f:5:Beatrice}'s name in the future, appeared.`
`"{f:5:Ange}......{f:5:Beatrice}............"`
`"You are the Golden and Endless Witch.`
` I'm not!`
` I'm the Witch of Gold and Truth!`
` No illusion can stand in my way!!"`
`"Your boring party is over, Onii‐chan!`
` Now it's time for my party to start!!`
` I've even readied a game to liven things up!`
` You're up, Aunt Eva."`
`"Huh...?!"`
`When Ange snapped her fingers, she vanished among a swirl of gold butterflies.`
`In her place in the middle of the cyclone, a girl wearing a dress appeared, bowing modestly......`
`"You......!"`
`"......That's pretty rude, you know?`
` ......Inviting everyone to the party except me."`
`"You're.........{f:5:Eva}.........!!"`
`"The sole survivor of Rokkenjima.`
` And a witch of the future, the Golden and Endless Witch from 1986 to 1998!!"`
`"In the world of the future, Battler‐kun, your sappy illusion is more fragile than a flake of snow on a lake!`
` Okay, let's have some fun!!`
` Come, try to remember, {i:all of you}... Remember your endless theory‐making!!"`
`When {f:5:Eva} held her hand to the heavens, light gathered there and took the form of a bottle.`
`Yes, a bottle.`
` A glass bottle with no label.`
`There was no alcohol inside.`
` ......Sealed within it was a fragment that let off a pale, sinister light.`
`"B‐Battler!! This is bad!!`
` She must not smash that bottle!!"`
`"It's showtime!!!"`
`The bottle was slammed against the floor and smashed to pieces.`
`As soon as the fragment within it touched the outside air, it flashed white and burst.`
`......At first, it seemed that nothing had happened. `
`However, {f:5:Eva} grinned at them before becoming a cloud of butterflies and vanishing.`
`Come to think of it, {f:5:Bernkastel} was gone as well.`
`"What did she do...?!"`
`"......It was probably a fragment she brought back with her from the world of the future.`
` ......Perhaps we could call it the contents of the cat box in the future."`
`"So, what does that mean?!`
` What now?!"`
`At that moment, they heard a tremendous hiss.`
`{n}It was as though large chunks of hail had started falling everywhere.`
`An earthquake accompanied that noise, and the whole mansion groaned.`
` Dust began to fall from the ceiling.`
`At the same time, it seemed as though the curtain‐covered window glowed with a pale light.`
`"Wh‐what on Earth is going on...?"`
`"Kyrie, look outside!`
` What the hell is that?!"`
`Everyone rushed to a window in response to her voice.`
` Of course, Battler and Beato went too.`
`Then, they drew the curtains, looked at the scene outside, ......and were stunned into silence.`
`".........How......beautiful......"`
`Kinzo's words spoke for the first impression felt by all who looked out the windows.`
`"......Not all beauty is benign."`
`"They always say that beauty has thorns nyeh."`
`Though everyone found the scene beautiful, ......it gave them all an ominous feeling.`
`Outside the window, ......countless small objects, crystal fragments glowing pale blue, lay strewn about everywhere like fallen hail.`
`The word "fantastical" perfectly summed up the scene that lay before them in the glowing rose garden......`
`"......Just now, I saw something move over there...!"`
`"H‐hey, is there someone over there?!`
` Wait, huh...?!"`
`"......A, a person...just grew out of that glowing fragment...!"`
`"Seven Sisters of Purgatory, battle formation!!"`
`With those words of Lucifer's, everyone finally realized that they were surrounded by "danger"...`
`One by one, the countless fragments shook and burst, ......and large, dark bodies rose up from inside each.`
`They were...giants with goat heads.`
`One after another, they appeared from the insides of broken fragments.`
`The realization that the countless fragments lying all over the rose garden were responsible for the blue glow covering the entire area......sent a wave of cold terror rushing over all present.`
`"45! Wide‐area surveillance!"`
`"......M‐my radar's filled with white!`
` We're either being jammed, or......or the vast number of readings is making a count of enemy numbers impossible!!"`
`Even as she said this, the glowing rose garden outside the window was filling with giant goats.`
`The fragments carrying the goats weren't just in the rose garden...... They were spread evenly across the entire island.`
`......Not just the rose garden, ......but the entire area around the mansion had to be half‐covered with goats by now...`
`".........For your attention."`
`"Know that we are completely surrounded."`
`"Yeah, we noticed......"`
`"Kihihihihihihihihi.`
` What'll you do now, Battler...?"`
`"Only one thing to do with uninvited guests, and that's show them the door.`
` ......Who are these people?`
` I'm guessing these aren't your minions, right, Beato?"`
`"......The goat forms they hold are probably just imitations of the pieces on this game board."`
`"They aren't Riiche's or Lia's minions.`
` ......This is something worse."`
`"......I {f:5:see}.`
` ......A manifestation of the messages within the {f:5:bottles}."`
`"Messages within the bottles?`
` Beato's message bottles?"`
`"No.`
` ......These fragments are delusions from the people of the future."`
`"......Endless possibilities are hidden within the cat box.`
` ......Because of that, those outside the box can imagine the insides to be any one of an infinite number of things.`
` ......It would seem those endless delusions are the true nature of these creatures."`
`"Wh‐what will those goats do to us, I wonder..."`
`"It doesn't look like they're coming to give us a handshake and a pat on the back."`
`"......Those people......`
` .........They're lowlifes, making up and passing around stories, imagining the tragedies that might have unfolded for us on this island...`
` ......They found it so interesting that I never talked about the truth......that they kept on creating tragedies one after another for their own enjoyment......"`
`"I see.`
` .........So, they're fragments of the future, containing delusions about the 1986 cat box......"`
`"In the future world, any and all interpretations can and do {f:5:exist}.`
` Unless we deny them, each will be able to call their own views the truth, and they will remain on this {f:5:island}."`
`"Ahhahahahahahaha!`
` What a fix we're in!"`
`"Looks like we're surrounded and fighting for our lives!"`
`"Hmm, what are they doing...?"`
`"Th‐they're eating... They're eating something...!"`
`"......They're eating......the roses...?!"`
`The squirming crowd of goats was busily doing something.`
`If you looked closely, you could see them sticking their heads into the rose bushes and munching away.`
`And it wasn't just the rose bushes.`
`Light poles, the bricks of the flower beds, ......and even the stone paving itself—they were biting all of it.`
` Almost as if they were trying to eat up the whole island.`
`"No.`
` ......They aren't just eating..."`
`"If they aren't eating, then what are they doing...?!"`
`".........What they are doing is not eating.`
` They are eroding, shaving away.`
` ......Shaving away the game board itself."`
`"They're......eating the game board...?!"`
`"In the future world, everyone believes that we were swallowed up by tragedy today!`
` ......That's why "they" won't accept a truth where we enjoy ourselves in peace...!"`
`"......Truths of the past are inferior to truths of the future.`
` ......The merciless future fangs and jaws of those goats......refuse to accept our truth and are eroding it, replacing it with "the truth they wish to see"."`
`"D‐......dammit...`
` ......This is our truth...!`
` It's not for those people in the future, who have nothing to do with us anyway, to rewrite as they please...!"`
`The garden outside the window was now filled with too many goats to count, all chewing away.`
`This repulsive scene stole the words from everyone's lips......`
`......They weren't just stunned into silence.`
`There was just no point in making a fuss and letting the goats know for no reason.`
`No point in letting them know......that there was plenty of prey waiting in this bright, warm room, ......prey that was softer and more satisfying to chew than roses or bricks......`
`"Th‐that goat there, he's looking at us...!"`
`"......Silence. Don't make a fuss."`
`"......I‐it's coming this way...`
` ......Isn't this bad......?"`
`They saw one of the newly born goats head slowly towards their window.`
`There was already a huge swarm of them in the garden, so it was no surprise that, when one of them looked around for new prey, it would see the light from this window.`
`Its immense, eerie body slowly approached.`
`As it grew closer, they could finally see its disturbing form clearly.`
`The eyes blazed, and yet were still cold, ruthless, and reptilian.`
`The cruel fangs and jaw could tear apart and crush anything.`
`Any fangs that could chew through brick would hardly have a problem chewing through {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s...`
`Its massive body had to be taller than the windows themselves......`
`And......it was lumbering towards this window......`
`"This window...isn't made out of special Ushiromiya bulletproof glass, by any chance, is it?"`
`"......I doubt even bulletproof glass would stop that thing."`
`"W‐waah...!!`
` It's coming, it's coming! It's running towards us!!!"`
`"......For your attention:`
` know that this window shall not be breached."`
`The power of Cornelia's seal formed a shield around the glass.`
`The goat was blown back, unable even to touch the glass because of this power.`
`Its weight made the earth tremble.`
` They could feel that clearly, even inside.`
`......But that tremor had also drawn the attention of the nearby goats.`
`A pack of goats started shuffling closer, ......and then, realizing that they were in competition for this new prey, the pack quickly broke into a thundering charge.`
`The window protected by Cornelia's seal would probably be safe.`
` However, there were many windows in the great hall.`
`For the first time, those windows became a source of terror instead of sunlight and a lovely view.`
`"Gertrude!"`
`"......For your attention: know that this window shall not be breached."`
`Getrude sealed another window.`
`{n}The goats trying to break in through that one were thrown back.`
`But at the same time, those inside the building heard the terrible crash of a third window being shattered.`
`Scattering fragments of glass everywhere, the massive goats broke through the window frame and entered the building.`
`"W‐waaaaaaaaahhh!!"`
`"G‐get back! Everyone get back!"`
`‘......On the first twilight......sacrifice the six...............’`
`Those words really were coming from the goat's mouth.`
`{n}Along with steaming, foul breath.`
`However, it didn't get a chance to say any more.`
`Forehead, neck, shoulder,`
` chest, side, gut, knee—the stakes of the Seven Sisters buried themselves in deep one after another.`
`"What rough, unappetizing flesh for piercing!"`
`"I just couldn't bear to gobble up any more of these...!"`
`Several other windows shattered one after another, and goats squeezed their way in through the window frames.`
`Their mouths were still stuffed with the bricks they had just been snacking on.`
`Each time they chewed, it made a ghastly sound like bones being crushed...`
`"......We will repel {f:5:them}."`
`"Chiester Troops, prepare for close‐range combat!"`
`"Hold up.`
` ......You start firing away and we'll have all the other goats coming to join the party."`
`"......Let's fall back to the second floor.`
` If we can seal the staircase, that'll buy us some time."`
`"Everyone, upstairs.`
` ......Hurry!"`
`After sniffing noisily as though scanning the smells around them,`
` the goats started chewing on whatever chairs, tables, or curtains were close by.`
`The goats would chew anything to bits, as long as it was near them.`
`If the others were careful not to attract the goats' attention, they would be able to escape from this place......`
`The {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s ran on ahead up to the second floor, while the fantasy creatures, who were used to fighting, guarded the rear.`
`The goats were completely absorbed by their all‐consuming feast in the hall.`
`......Even the portrait of {f:5:Beatrice}, which might have been called the symbol of the whole Ushiromiya family, had now been brutally chewed up...`
`"Battler, the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s have all taken refuge on the second floor...!"`
`"Good.`
` Dlanor, seal all the staircases."`
`"Gertrude and Cornelia will handle {f:5:it}.`
` However, they need more {f:5:time}."`
`Loud beating sounds—whether that could be called "knocking" was unclear—and sounds of shattering glass could be heard from all parts of the mansion.`
`"......Well now, ladies and gentlemen.`
` It's time for work."`
`"Seven Sisters of Purgatory, right here!`
` Let's go, you lowlifes!`
` Tonight, it's all‐you‐can‐eat!!"`
`"Chiester Troops, halt all external tasks.`
` Cancel automatic updates, accept no data, take no prisoners!"`
`"Eiserne Jungfrau of the Seventh {f:5:District}.`
` By the territory lord's order, carry out your {f:5:duty}."`
`"......I'll lend a hand.`
` Lion, you're in the way.`
` Go up to the second floor."`
`"But Will...!"`
`"Leave this to us and go.`
` ......You have your own job to do. Protect your family."`
`"I, ......I understand.`
` ......Everyone, stay safe......"`
`The mansion was filled with the sounds of bashing, crushing, smashing, and chewing.`
`The goats and their wave of destruction were drawing steadily closer......`
`"......Lord {f:5:Battler}.`
` Gertrude and Cornelia have finished sealing the other {f:5:staircases}.`
` The large staircase here is the only one that {f:5:remains}."`
`"The other staircases are tiny, so they went fast.`
` On the other hand, this staircase is huuuge.`
` Looks like you'll have your hands full buying time."`
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} spoke as though it was someone else's problem.`
`It only took a glance at her face to see that she had no intention of lending a hand.`
`Even so, Beato didn't scold her.`
`......This was a game between Battler and Ange.`
` {f:5:Lambdadelta} was only a theatergoer who had been invited.`
`"......Don't think badly of me.`
` ......Even I'd die if I was torn apart by nothingness.`
` Sorry, but I think I'll stick to being an observer."`
`"That's what you've always been.`
` .........Though it is a shame that we can't ask for your help."`
`"......Nah, she's being nice.`
` Doesn't want to steal our show."`
`"Heheh.`
` Sure, let's say that's the reason."`
`As a Voyager witch, {f:5:Lambdadelta} could retreat from this game board of Battler's if she wanted to.`
`In other words, she was the only one who wasn't in trouble now.`
`"See you later.`
` ......I think I'll watch this game between you and Bern 'til the end.`
` ......I'll be rooting for you."`
`"As you munch on popcorn?"`
`"Of course.`
` I think I'll have some soy‐sauce butter flavor today."`
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} vanished with a pop.`
`As soon as she did, a black hole opened up in midair, and Gaap fell out of it.`
`"Battler, Riiche.`
` Could you come here for a second?`
` You should probably see this."`
`"......Right now?"`
`"Yes."`
`"Let's go.`
` ......Everyone, we're counting on you to hold this position...!"`
`When Gaap snapped her fingers, a large hole opened up under Battler and Beato, swallowing them both.`
`When it spat them back out again, .........they were in an inky‐black sky.`
`Both of them were floating in the night sky.`
` They could see Rokkenjima far beneath them.`
`And, as soon as they realized this, ......they shuddered.`
`"......Th‐this is............!!"`
`"It's not a crowd.`
` ......It's a sea."`
`It was no longer a crowd of goats, but an entire sea of them.`
`Just as Rokkenjima poked out from the ocean,`
` the mansion was now poking out from a sea of goats.`
`"......People in the future really are amazing.`
` ......Just how many of them have imagined the tragedy on this island?"`
`"They're nothing more than worthless drivel from outside the cat box...!`
` Let's clean this place up...!!"`
`"Now look over there.`
` ......It's hard to tell, but look at the shoreline."`
`"......The shoreline...?"`
`"It's easiest to see near the harbor.`
` Look closely.`
` .........See it......?"`
`"D‐don't tell me...?!"`
`"......Yeah, ......you're probably right.`
` ......They're......eating it.`
` ......Eating the whole island......"`
`"Come, try to remember, fragments of the future!!`
` Why don't you just chew up all the ostentation, all the illusions, all the fantasy, forever?!"`
`As {f:5:Eva} yelled this to the heavens, hovering above the raging sea, ......hail fell down with a pale glow.`
`Each one was a bottle with no label and a fragment inside.`
`They poured onto the island, smashing into bits and scattering the fragments inside them everywhere.`
`Every now and then, one of those fragments would split in two, then split in two again,`
` and every single one of those fragments burst and gave birth to a massive goat.`
`To say it was like bamboo shoots springing up after the rain would be a vast understatement.`
`The goats writhed about like bubbling, boiling water in a pot.`
`They ate away at everything they saw.`
`They didn't just eat the harbor, but the trees and rocks, the entire coastline itself.`
` Hundreds, thousands, ...no, tens of thousands of goats continued to eat...`
`They were chewing away at every bit of Rokkenjima, ......of this final game that Battler had prepared......`
`"Ahhahahhahahahahaha!!`
` Too bad, Battler‐kun!`
` The future wants a tragedy on this island...!`
` Even Ange wants the truth!`
` We'll just chew up all the ostentation, illusions, and fantasy for them!!"`
`By now, Battler and the others had to admit it.`
`The future wanted a tragedy.`
`{n}Even if the truth of this island had been a gentle, peaceful thing.`
`{n}The future didn't want that.`
`The truth they wanted...was painting over the past.`
`"......The past is such a fragile thing.`
` Even the cat box is being chewed apart."`
`"Just who are these people......?`
` ......Are they really so determined to throw us into a tragedy...?"`
`"That's all I wanted to show you.`
` .........Hopefully, this'll be useful for making a strategic decision."`
`"Yeah, thanks.`
` Thanks to that, I feel just awful now."`
`"Then let's go to the study next, if you don't mind.`
` {f:5:Goldsmith} wants to talk to you."`
`Gaap snapped her fingers, and another black hole swallowed them up and spat them out in the study.`
`"Owowowowow...`
` Gaap, if you're gonna drop me, at least do it on a bed."`
`"......Grandfather, we're in trouble. There's absolutely nowhere left to go...!"`
`"I know.`
` And even waiting out the storm from here is not an option."`
`"Ronove and the others should be able to buy us some time, but that's all."`
`If they just holed up in the mansion and fought from there, it would only be a matter of time before the swarm of goats got them.`
`Trying to repel a few of the goats who barged into the mansion...`
`would be like using a cup to bail water from a boat with a hole in it.`
`"We could fight defensively for a while, but then it would only be a matter of time..."`
`"We need to think of something while we fight.`
` ......Can we escape?!`
` Where to?!`
` Is there any way for us to leave the game board?!"`
`"Outside the game board is outside of our territory.`
` Only a Voyager witch could leave it."`
`Only {f:5:Bernkastel} and {f:5:Lambdadelta} could do it.`
`However, there was no way {f:5:Bernkastel} would help.`
`Even {f:5:Lambdadelta} had already announced that she would be an observer instead of lending a hand.`
`"So, there's nowhere left to run."`
`"No, there is just one place."`
`"Where?!"`
`"The Golden Land."`
`"I see......`
` Is that our only option now...?!"`
`"Indeed.`
` The Golden Land is the most impenetrable place on this game board.`
` If we wish to escape, it's that or nothing."`
`"These things are eating the cat box itself.`
` For all we know, at any moment, they could start chewing away at the Golden Land as well."`
`"............Nn, ...what should we do, Battler...?!"`
`"Not hesitate. We're retreating.`
` ......If we take too long to make a decision, even that road will be closed to us.`
` Let's evacuate everyone.`
` How can we open the door to the Golden Land?!"`
`"I just have to open it.`
` ......However, an immense cloud of the anti‐magic toxin is emanating from that crowd of goats.`
` It will take some time to open the door."`
`"So, we've only got to protect this study with our lives until the door's open.`
` Just have to keep doing what we've been doing."`
`"There's one more problem.`
` ......The door to the Golden Land cannot be shut unless two people close it from the outside."`
`"Two from the outside...?`
` What do you mean...?"`
`As soon as he said this, Battler realized.`
`{n}This must be an agreement made between the three witches who are one...`
`"Normally, there's no need to go to the trouble of shutting the door...`
` We can't do that this time, though."`
`"......Only you and Beato can fulfill the role of shutting the door."`
`"Me, the territory lord, and Beato.`
` It does seem to be the safest choice."`
`"Indeed.`
` If it's just the two of us, we might even be able to protect ourselves."`
`"Okay, open the door...!"`
`Beato waved her pipe, leaving a golden trail behind as she sliced the air vertically.`
`Then, the gap of the door to the Golden Land appeared.`
` It looked like nothing more than a thin golden string hanging from the ceiling.`
`If you looked closely, you could see that the string was getting thicker, very slowly.`
`The door to the Golden Land certainly was opening, but so slowly that you couldn't even tell if you weren't careful.`
`At this rate, it would probably take quite some time before it grew big enough to let a person through......`
`"Grandfather, Gaap, we'll need you to be our inner line of defense!"`
`"Yes, there may be goats climbing up the outer walls...!"`
`"Very well.`
` My rifle is hungry for some prey!"`
`"Understood.`
` It'll be fun dropping those things into the Abyss."`
`A giant was sliced at an angle, split into two parts, ......then fell to the floor, showering it with filthy dark blood and guts.`
`"Splendidly {f:5:done}."`
`"......I'll let you have the next one."`
`Countless massive goats, which had forced their way in from rooms and windows all across the mansion, wandered about in search of something to chew.`
`Several of the goats noticed the group of people huddled around the staircase and lumbered closer, but they were pulverized by merciless attacks.`
`Ronove's shields easily halted the charging of the goats, and {f:5:Virgilia}'s magic spears pinned the giants against the walls.`
`Dlanor's and Will's blades also sliced the goats effortlessly in two.`
`The pinpoint strikes of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory could pierce the vitals of and finish off any opponent, no matter how large.`
`The Chiester Sisters were holding their own too.`
`One shot from their high‐caliber firearms blasted so many goats to bits that you couldn't count the kills with both hands.`
`They would have been more than a match for a limited number of opponents.`
`However, they weren't just up against a crowd, but an entire sea.`
`It was like a pebble trying to face the approaching waves of a stormy sea......`
`"Hurry on that gun barrel replacement! Requesting cover from the Purgatory troops!"`
`"You run out of bullets and you're nothing but rabbits.`
` Laaame!"`
`"I don't wanna hear that from a bunch of seven paperweights that can only kill one person at a time nyeh."`
`"Yeah, keep them coming!!`
` Don't let us get bored!!"`
`The hall was filled with the corpses of massive goats.`
`As if in fear of this sight, the goats that came in one after another formed a wall, keeping their distance.`
`"......Perhaps they think they're no match for us."`
`"I wish that were {f:5:true}.`
` ......But it seems to be little more than wishful {f:5:thinking}."`
`"What're those guys doing...?`
` They're looking at us......and whispering to each other."`
`"Apparently, they have enough intelligence to talk with each other and cooperate."`
`The goats were surrounding them at a distance and whispering to each other.`
`Then, they nodded at each other as though deciding something, and the whole group stirred.`
`......What are they doing?`
` It almost looks like they're lining up in a different order......`
`"The enemy is changing its formation...!`
` It appears that the individuals with greater destructive power are being gathered in the front lines!"`
`"And so what? Let's go!!"`
`""""""Yes, Onee‐sama!!""""""`
`"Wait! Something's wrong...!"`
`Lucifer took aim at one of them, going for its forehead.`
`The other six sisters followed her lead, trying to pierce the vital organs all over the creature's body.`
`However, there was no sound of pierced flesh.`
`The Seven Sisters of Purgatory were knocked back, unable to cause even the smallest wound.`
`"Wh‐what?!`
` What just happened?!"`
`"......Those guys are talking about something."`
`The goats kept whispering the same thing, over and over, as they slowly approached the Seven Sisters.`
`All of them whispered unanimously.`
`‘......All fantasy......is fictional......’`
`‘.........The Seven Sisters of Purgatory......are personifications of stakes for ceremonial sacrifices, mere creatures of fantasy......’`
`‘......They're actually paperweights...... ......They're actually paperweights......’`
`As they whispered curses that denied the Seven Sisters' existence, the goats lumbered closer.`
`"Get back, Purgatory troops!!`
` We'll cover you!"`
`"It's time you learned a lesson, goats!!"`
`The golden bows of the Chiester troops mowed down the wall of goats with a shower of bright golden bullets.`
`Some of the goats were torn to pieces, but some of them seemed completely unaffected.`
`Then, the goats who were uninjured all whispered as one.`
`‘.........The Chiester Sisters Imperial Guards...have Maria's rabbit dolls as their vessels......’`
`‘.........They're actually rabbit dolls...`
` Maria's imagination, fantasy, fictional beings.........’`
`‘......All of the crimes can be explained by mystery......`
` All fantasy is irrelevant......’`
`"Looks like—"`
`"We've got lots of people who won't accept the existence of magic!"`
`"And that means?!"`
`"No magical attacks will have any effect on them!"`
`"D‐does that mean all of our attacks will be completely useless?!"`
`"......{ruby:Endless Nine:99.9999999}...nyeh.`
` ......If they don't accept that we exist, our attacks can't hurt them nyeh."`
`"Is that possible...?!"`
`"We'll have to test it."`
`Ronove stepped forward, stamped on the floor twice, and a red barrier rose up in front of him.`
`The crowd of goats dashed into it with a terrifying force.`
`While some goats were blown away by it, several of them slipped right through the magical barrier.`
`‘......Ronove is a creature of magic, a creature of fiction......’`
`‘.........Genji is Ronove's vessel...`
` An imaginary version of Genji......’`
`"I see, ......so even my attacks will not affect some of them."`
`There was no longer any point in {f:5:Virgilia} trying out her own magic spear.`
`Some of the goats must also have decided that her existence was fictional as well, and she would no longer be able to hurt them.`
`......All of these great demons, great witches, ......high‐level furniture, and weapons,`
` ......were overcome with fear of the crowd that surrounded them, a crowd that would not be affected by any of their attacks...`
`"...Wh‐what are we going to do......?!"`
`"......W‐we'll keep fighting until the end.`
` You do not have permission to die in battle...!"`
`‘.........Fantasy is all fiction...... Fantasy is all fiction......`
` ......Fantasy is......all......fii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}ictioon!!!’`
`A shriek from one of the goats became a signal for the wall of them to break.`
`They pushed forward with gaping mouths and foul breath, each trying to reach their prey first, trying to return these fictional creatures to nothingness.`
`"Look out...!!"`
`{f:5:Virgilia} leapt in front of and held several of the Seven Sisters, who had fallen on their butts, overpowered by the ferocity of the approaching goats.`
`However, even {f:5:Virgilia} was a fictional creature to these goats.`
`They could chew through her like cotton candy.`
`"Madam, quickly...!!"`
`Ronove threw himself at the oncoming goats.`
`Even he would be chewed apart easily.`
` Knowing this, Ronove leapt forward.`
`"......Even if my magic no longer functions,`
` ......I am still the fiercely passionate and loyal man I always was.`
` ......And furthermore, did you expect that I would simply sit by and watch a lady die?"`
`‘.........Ronove is fantasy...... Ronove is fantasy......’`
`Ronove slammed his right fist into the side of a goat's face.`
`As soon as he pulled it back, he swung his left leg into the goat's gut, then spun around into a reverse roundhouse that caught the goat again.`
`".....................Hmph."`
`Ronove knew.`
` ......He could do less damage than a mosquito bite against those who didn't accept his existence.`
`This was what it meant to face an anti‐magic defense of {ruby:Endless Nine:99.9999999}...`
`‘.........Ronove is fantasy......a fiction......an illusion......!!’`
`The goat swung its log‐like fist with a sound like a storm.`
`Ronove dodged by a hair.`
`......If he had been an instant slower, the massive arm would have crushed his head like glass.`
`"Ronove...!!`
` Stop this, run...!!"`
`"I, Ronove,`
` cannot help but rise to the challenge when I see a lady in a pinch.`
` A bad habit of mine."`
`Ronove grinned and tried to act tough.`
`He had already abandoned everything.`
`There was nothing he could do here and now...except become a shield to buy time.`
`He had already chosen to abandon his life for this.`
`‘......Ronove is fantasy...... He cannot be real... He cannot be real......’`
`‘.........Those of fantasy do not exist...... Do not exist......’`
`‘......Fantasy is all...pukespittle...pukespittle......’`
`The goats kept coming, trying to feast on Ronove.`
`None had any pretensions of making this a one‐on‐one fight.`
`{n}Nothing mattered except chewing apart fantasy.`
` Even just a nibble.`
`As they gnashed those ruthless jaws and fangs, they gathered around Ronove......`
`"......Ggh.........!"`
`Ronove's foot hit something, and he stumbled.`
`In the same instant, several massive arms reached out and lifted him up.`
`"R‐Ronove‐samaaaaaaaaaa!!"`
`"What are you doing, Chiesters? Shoot them!!"`
`".........We would've done that already if it'd have any effect nyeh......"`
`"Everyone, please stand back.`
` ......I should be able to buy you some time as they savor my flesh.`
` However, I think they'll find that Ronove has quite a few little bones in him."`
`An elbow rammed itself into the massive, hideous jaws that were trying to chew Ronove's head.`
`Of course, the goat did moan, but that did nothing but deprive just one goat of his right to the first bite of Ronove's head.`
`Many jaws opened wide,`
` ......trying to crush him and throw him down into those heartless stomachs, which would permit no heartwarming fantasies to exist......`
`‘.........I won't accept fantasy... Won't accept......’`
`‘......Explaining everything with mystery is possible...... Possiblllle......’`
`‘Fantasy is pukespittlllllle, everything is mysteryyyyyyyy...!!’`
`All of the many arms lifting Ronove up were sliced off.`
`The Seven Sisters used this chance to fly forward and grab Ronove, dragging him back.`
`".........Which of you......mentioned {f:5:mystery}?"`
`"Is Dlanor's blade effective?!"`
`"I see, if the opponents are calling it a mystery...!"`
`Blood‐red longsword in hand, Dlanor slowly walked forward.`
`Behind her walked Will, tapping his back with his black blade.`
`"......Well, if you don't think it's a fantasy,`
` ......then let's hear what your theories are."`
`"I cannot wait to hear your {f:5:opinions}."`
`The crowd of goats stepped back.`
`Though they had been so vicious against the fantasy creatures, they stepped back when faced with this pair wielding swords of mystery.`
`"......There have been a great many locked room murders on this game {f:5:board}.`
` Choose whichever you please, and we will parry all of your {f:5:attacks}."`
`"No.`
` ......We don't have to defend anything."`
`"......{f:5:Indeed}.`
` .........A mystery is always the source of the {f:5:challenge}.`
` ......Why should we be forced to play {f:5:defense}?"`
`"Do you guys get it yet?"`
`{a:c:You are the ones in the hot seat now.}`
`Blue truth cut the goats apart.`
`That blue truth dwelt within each and every one of the riddles in Beato's games so far.`
`What about the locked room with the chain, first game, second twilight?`
`{n}What about the locked room of the chapel, second game, first twilight?`
`{n}What about the trick to killing Nanjo, third game, ninth twilight?`
`There was no end to the blades.`
`The countless riddles {f:5:Beatrice} left behind became blades, "challenges" that tore the goats apart.`
`If they wanted to deny fantasy, ......they would have to make a counterargument.`
`They would have to deal with every single trick as a mystery.`
`However, although the goats spoke words of anti‐fantasy, most of them had prepared no answer for the mystery.`
`Well, every now and then, there was a goat who did have an answer.`
`‘......S‐someone outside the Ushiromiya family was hiding on the island, and......’`
`"Knox's 1st! It is forbidden for the culprit to be anyone not mentioned in the early part of the {f:5:story}!!"`
`‘......There were multiple culprits all working separately, and it just happened to look like a single culprit......’`
`"Van Dine's Rule #12.`
` There must be but one true culprit."`
`‘......Y‐you mean...everything but that is......f‐...forbidden......?!’`
`"Boring, right? To have a genre like that.`
` Personally,`
` I think mysteries should be more flexible."`
`‘......The Ten Knox Commandments......and the Twenty Van Dine Rules......a‐...are behind the times......’`
`‘The definition of the mystery genre is......changing with the era......I think...’`
`"Tch.`
` They're getting rebellious."`
`"Perhaps we are behind the {f:5:times}."`
`"In that case, let's see if you have any theories that can satisfy us."`
`".........{f:5:Come}!!"`
`The whole crowd of goats charged them.`
`In their fangs, each of them carried theories to crush Beato's locked rooms.`
`The bodies of these goats were different than the ones who had become corpses so easily just now.`
`They had mystery‐style answers to several locked rooms.`
`So, it would take several blade hits to deal them a fatal wound.`
`However, Beato had left many blades behind.`
` All of them were exceedingly sharp.`
`So, the pair of Inquisitors didn't think of this as a desperate battle.`
`This was mystery.`
`The goal of a mystery is to use all your imagination and knowledge to challenge each of its riddles head on.`
`Doing this is the greatest enjoyment of the mystery genre.`
`So they laughed.`
` Both Will and Dlanor laughed.`
`With smiles of admiration at the theories the goats had put everything they had into, they countered with blades from all the locked rooms.`
`The crowd of goats was no longer an encirclement, but a great wave threatening to swallow the pair up.`
`And yet, the pair repelled the enemy without giving an inch.`
`They resisted firmly, cutting through the tsunami of wailing goats.`
`It was like an ice‐breaking ship knocking a path through a frozen sea.`
`‘......They entered the locked room through a hidden passage that no one else could use, and......’`
`"Knox's 3rd! It is forbidden for hidden passages to {f:5:exist}!!"`
`‘......After the hidden passage was used, it was welded shut and became unusable, so no hidden passages existed at the time of the inspection...’`
`"Knox's 8th! It is forbidden for the case to be resolved with clues that are not {f:5:presented}!!"`
`‘......These are all fake murders, and no one is actually dead......`
` So, all locked rooms were constructed by the so‐called victims......’`
`"?!"`
`Dlanor hesitated for just an instant.`
`After all, this clichéd and simple theory managed to get around both Beato's locked rooms and the Knox Decalogue.`
`Dlanor saw nothingness inside the goats' massive jaws......`
`‘.........Nngghkkk............kk.........!!’`
`"Van Dine's Rule #7.`
` It is forbidden to have a crime without a corpse."`
`Surely, the jaws of that goat had closed over Dlanor's head.`
`However, the upper and lower jaw were no longer connected, ......so the upper half slid off to the side.`
`"Look like even the great Knox never forbade fake murders."`
`"There are many splendid mysteries besides {f:5:murder}."`
`The goats didn't give the pair enough time to have a nice, long chat about mystery.`
`The next massive figure immediately enveloped them.`
`Will's blade drew a diagonal slash across its chest, but it only cut through its clothes, leaving no wound.`
`"............?!`
` The Twenty Wedges don't work on this one."`
`Dlanor also hit it with her longsword, but still, it just cut its clothes without leaving a mark on its body.`
`Could it be that this goat......`
`had a theory that didn't violate Knox or Van Dine......?!`
`‘......Knox and Van Dine are meaningless......`
` All locked rooms can be undone by a single solution......`
` .........Because......’`
`In an attempt to stop the goat from saying any more, Will and Dlanor hit it with blades from every locked room, as well as stakes from the Ten Commandments and the Twenty Rules, but none of it had any effect.`
`Slowly, the goat clenched its massive fists together, ......and raised them up high.`
`‘......Because, .........because......!!’`
`"Will...!!!"`
`With a roar, Will slammed into the goat giant with his body.`
`Though its massive bulk bent back slightly, Will was still leaping into a deathtrap.`
`However, if he hadn't done so, he wouldn't have been able to protect Dlanor.`
`The goat grabbed Will.`
`{n}It lifted him up and held him high in the air.`
`It was like a little kid showing off his favorite toy and waving it around...`
`"Let's hear your theory.`
` .........If I'm to hear a great theory before I die, it'll be a fitting end for me."`
`‘......Van Dine and Knox are useless for making theories......’`
`"Gyagg......gghh....gghhh......!"`
`The goat's massive hands closed on Will like a vise.`
`{n}All the bones in Will's body creaked.`
`"......Let's hear...your theory.`
` ......Guh, ......aah......"`
`‘There is no need...for a theory......’`
`".........What...?"`
`‘Because...making theories for any of {f:5:Beatrice}'s games...is a waste of time......’`
`"What do you mean......gggyahh......!"`
`‘......This isn't an orthodox mystery, so thinking about it is just a waste of time...`
` I won't accept {f:5:Beatrice}'s games......as a mystery...`
` ......There are no answers to the tricks.`
` ......It's all, all......just an illuuuuusion......’`
`"......................................."`
`‘.........?!?!’`
`"......Thinking.........is just a waste of time......?"`
`‘...Gg.........gwhh—’`
`Will's head was lowered, so his face couldn't be seen.`
` However, the arm of the goat holding him was shaking.`
`The embrace of those log‐sized arms with superhuman strength......was being slowly pushed away by Will's shaking arms......`
`".........Thinking is just a waste of time......?`
` You say that......and call yourself a mystery fan......?"`
`‘Gwah...ooh..................’`
`".........Mystery is like chivalry.`
` You fight with the noble rules that you've created, with pride in the stance you've taken.`
` ......Is it worth being a coward if it'll help you win? Does losing make the whole fight meaningless if you fought with everything you had?`
` ......It isn't about winning and losing, ...it's about applauding the will to fight even in the most dire circumstances..."`
`‘...Guh, ghh, ghh, .........gggg......!!!’`
`The goat's arms were now spread wide, and it looked as though Will was now the one pushing it back.`
`Will's face was covered in shadow and couldn't be seen.`
`".........People like you, ......who call themselves mystery fans even though they never even try to solve it like a mystery.......`
` You're the ones I really can't stand!!!"`
`Will slammed his forehead into the goat's now unprotected head.`
`"If you call yourself a mystery fan, be proud to join a battle of wits!!`
` If you call yourself a mystery fan, it's about time you realized!`
` Giving up is nothing to brag abo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}out!!!"`
`Will headbutted the goat over and over again.`
`His forehead was gushing blood, torn apart by the goat's fangs, but he kept on headbutting.`
`Van Dine and Knox may be behind the times.`
`{n}The mystery genre does progress with time, just like the world around it.`
`However, there's one thing that must never change.`
`That is...pride.`
`What is a knight proud of?`
`{n}Not victory.`
`{n}He's proud of the courage that lets him stand up to anyone without fear.`
`Will couldn't forgive the kind of coward who could turn tail from a fight and then brag about it.`
`People who call themselves mystery fans but who have no pride were the only ones Will just couldn't bear.`
`The goat, unable to put up with this anymore, threw Will down to the floor.`
`Then, he lifted his fists again, determined to crush Will to pieces this time.`
`"Bring it!`
` You probably will beat me to a pulp,`
` but that'll be no victory for you.`
` ......You'll destroy your own pride with your own hands!!"`
`‘......Pointless, pointless......`
` ......This is no mystery, so why make theories? ......Thinking is just a waste of time, useless, useless, useless, die, die, die......’`
`A fist like a cannonball swinging down towards him......was the very last thing Will saw before he shut his eyes.`
`{a:c:`
`"If you stop thinking—"}`
`"......!"`
`"In this game, that means you lose."`
`Battler smashed his fist into the goat's mouth......and smashed teeth bounced off the celling.`
`"{f:5:Battler}‐sama...!"`
`"If you stop thinking, it means you've given up on the story being a mystery.`
` Which means......as far as you're concerned, this game is a fantasy."`
`Battler lifted up his arm.`
` Realizing this was a signal, Lucifer and Chiester00 jumped.`
`"If you've stopped thinking, you don't deserve to be an actor on the stage.`
` Stop trying to sound smart, go sit in the audience, and stuff your mouth with popcorn."`
`The goat lifted his fist again, then swung it down at Battler like a hammer.`
`"......If you've surrendered to fantasy!!"`
`"That just makes you another target nyeh...!"`
`"It's the same as acknowledging that we exist......"`
`"Begin recognition of hostile elements...!!`
` Mark all targets vulnerable to magical attacks in our HMDs!!"`
`"Kids who surrender to fantasy get to deal with us!!"`
`"......And if you have a theory, we will hear it {f:5:out}."`
`"We'll welcome those people with open arms.`
` ......Out of respect for them, we won't hold anything back!"`
`"Oh, but it would seem that this is {f:5:Battler}‐sama's time to shine."`
`".........While I would like to listen to all your favorite theories, both mystery and fantasy,`
` ......this isn't your game right now.`
` ......No matter how much you future fragments try to deny us, this is no time for me to be defeated......"`
`A golden glint gathered in Battler's hand.`
`It was so bright that the whole hall was bathed in gold.`
`Golden butterflies flitted about, as though the whole hall was being swallowed up by the Golden Land.`
`Battler lifted......his golden longsword high.`
`".........Feel free to challenge Beato's game as a mystery or a fantasy.`
` I welcome it.`
` But know this. ......I'm not gonna let you deny this final game of mine.`
` ............Feel the shame of your indiscretion...of impugning the honor of those who have passed away."`
`A slice of the golden longsword flooded the hall with a sea of golden light.`
`Then, the whole group of goats filling the hall with noise turned into clouds of gold butterflies and scattered.`
`......Even so, only about a hundred of them had been wiped out.`
`Before long, the massive crowds of goats outside would probably come pouring in like seawater through a hole in the bottom of a ship.`
`"......Just a bit longer until the seal is finished.`
` Sorry, but I'll have to ask you to hold out here a bit longer."`
`"Of course, Lord {f:5:Battler}!"`
`"Otherwise, we wouldn't get to show off!"`
`"You know, you two could try fighting just a little."`
`"But—"`
`"We're—"`
`""Just the MCs!!""`
`Their excessively blunt refusal drew a few strained smiles.`
`{n}However, it had lessened the tension in the room just a bit.`
`"{f:5:Battler}‐sama, leave this to us!"`
`"We won't allow the corrosion to proceed any further!"`
`"And not one of us will be left behind."`
`"Of {f:5:course}.`
` We are all precious pieces on Lord {f:5:Battler}'s game {f:5:board}."`
`The Seven Sisters of Purgatory, the Chiester Sisters troops, and everyone else nodded forcefully.`
`"Yeah.`
` I'm counting on all of you...!!`
` We'll definitely protect this final game I made for Ange!!"`
`"They're managing to hold their ground down below!"`
`"The door to the Golden Land is still opening slowly.`
` It will still take some time though."`
`"There you have it.`
` We'd better start buying some time ourselves...!"`
`The sea of goats that covered the ground below them was jostling about more and more.`
`......By now, even the sea surrounding the island had disappeared.`
`The horizon was gone, ......and the chewed up island was now floating on an eerie emptiness like space.`
`The goats that flooded the edges of Rokkenjima seemed to be spilling off the sides.`
`"Looks like that's it for this game board......"`
`"As long as there's a Game Master and pieces,`
` the game board can always be laid out again.`
` As long as you have two people together, you can create any sort of game."`
`"......True. ........................ Where on Earth is Ange...?"`
`"Where did you hide it?"`
`"That's right, ......the chapel...!`
` What's happened to the chapel?!"`
`"It's still there...!"`
`The chapel looked like a white building floating in the pitch‐black sea of goats.`
`......Yes.`
` This was strange.`
`There was no way those goats, who consumed everything, would go out of their way to avoid just the chapel.`
`"That's where Ange is...!"`
`Outside the chapel was a sea of goats.`
`Very soon, the earth around the chapel would be eaten away, and it would probably end up floating on nothingness.`
`The rampage of the goats, as they devoured everything and chanted the tragedy they imagined with one voice, truly made a lot of noise.`
`However, none of that reached the inside of the chapel.`
`Ange finally broke the magic seal on the entrance and stepped inside......`
`The seal was supposed to be unbreakable by anyone.`
`However, in the face of {f:5:Ange Beatrice}, Witch of Truth, the one who sought the truth and could sweep aside all forces that prevented her from finding it,`
` no barrier was absolute...`
`"....................................`
` ......There it is."`
`A single book, tightly locked, rested on the altar.`
`{n}It was the hidden diary that Ushiromiya Eva had written in even in her later years.`
`The Book of the Single Truth.`
`......It was the one {f:5:Featherine} had shown her in the world of 1998.`
`This time, I have the key.`
`I gripped the gold key that sat in my pocket, ......the key Onii‐chan gave me.`
`As I approached the altar, I saw that the Book of the Single Truth was wrapped in a strange bending of the light.`
`".........So, this is that seal of the Game Master that {f:5:Bernkastel} talked about."`
`The Book of the Single Truth was sealed in something like a crystal.`
`{n}It was a seal made by the Game Master's authority.`
`This was on a different level than the breakable magic seal on the chapel door.`
`No matter how Ange used her power as a Witch of Truth, this couldn't be broken by anyone except the Game Master.`
`......However, this time, Battler wasn't the only Game Master.`
`"Hmph.`
` ......So sorry, Onii‐chan.`
` {f:5:Bernkastel} is also a Game Master.`
` ......I just need to take it with me and have her break the seal."`
`Ange slowly approached the altar......`
`"......Will Ange really do as you say?"`
`"This is my little sister we're talking about, ......so yeah, probably not."`
`"Then what will we do?"`
`"Looks like we've got nothing to go on but brute force...!"`
`At that moment, a fierce impact hit the pair of them.`
`Beato was flung away, and Battler was sealed inside a massive crystal that extended up to the heavens.`
`"Damn, what the hell is this?!!"`
`"Battler...!! Gghh, what is this?!"`
`It was a barrier, a massive cage of crystal.`
`Battler was shut inside a crystal cage like a tower, so large that you had to look up to see the top.`
`"Beato, I need you to take care of Ange...!"`
`"What will you do?!`
` Can you break this from the inside all by yourself?!`
` Is this.........a locked room barrier?!`
` Who could have—"`
`".........There's only one person who'd challenge me with a locked room.`
` ......Looks like our final guest has finally arrived."`
`"You don't mean........."`
`"Go, and take care of Ange...!"`
`Beato left Battler to handle this on his own and headed for the chapel.`
`{n}Battler took a deep breath, then smiled daringly......`
`"......I've been waiting.`
` ......Was it boring in that depths of oblivion place?"`
`The answer was a laugh.`
`......Yeah, that's right.`
` That laugh is enough.`
`"Looks like you're doing well."`
`".........It wasn't boring.`
` ......After all, I believed."`
`"I'll bet you did.`
` ......I believed too."`
`Battler flung off the cape of the territory lord.`
`It would only get in the way.`
`And, it would be a rude way to welcome his final guest.`
`"Those dark depths.`
` ......Just the perfect place to think up mysteries to challenge you with when we next met."`
`"So, this crystal cage is the ring for our duel.`
` A chain deathmatch with nowhere to run."`
`"......Now that you mention it,`
` we're always fighting over locked rooms with chains."`
`"Then let's use that.`
` Make it a real chain deathmatch."`
`"I'm prepared, but what about you?"`
`"......I am.`
` ......I told you, didn't I?`
` I believed too."`
`At the same time, they both brandished their mysteries, sealing the other in a chained locked room.`
`"Come, Furudo Erikaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aaa!!!"`
`"Entertain me, Bwattleer‐shwa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aann{-}n{-}n{-}nn!!!"`
`At the same time, they were both sealed inside a locked room locked with a chain.`
`Of course, it was easy to set and unset the chain from the inside.`
`However, stepping into their opponent's chained room would be difficult.`
`They were fighting to the death with two chain locked rooms at once.`
`There could be no better locked‐room duel for this pair, who had battled with theories concerning chained rooms so often.`
`"{p:2:Furudo Erika committed suicide, died in an accident, died of illness, died by some reason other than homicide}!!"`
`"{p:1:It wasn't a suicide, it wasn't an accidental death, it wasn't a death by illness! I really was killed by you, Battler‐san}!!!"`
`"{p:2:It was a murder committed by slipping poison gas through the crack of the door, by filling the room with water and drowning you, by sucking the oxygen out of the room and making you suffocate}!!"`
`"{p:1:There was no poison gas, there was no drowning, there was no death by suffocation}!!"`
`"Hahahaha, ahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!`
` A locked room murder with poison gas? Death by drowning? Suffocation?!`
` *giggle*giggle*, aha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!"`
`"Crazy, right? It's funny, isn't it?"`
`"<Good>!!`
` {p:2:Ushiromiya Battler committed suicide, he died in an accident, he died by illness}!!`
` Time for me to test your locked room!"`
`"Red truth!!`
` {p:1:Ushiromiya Battler was stabbed to death!!`
` Let's say the weapon was a knife, stuck right into his back}!!"`
`"<Good>!!`
` Nothing beats a classic locked room!!"`
`"Then why don't you try it too?!"`
`"I'll take that challenge with the red truth!!`
` {p:1:Furudo Erika was stabbed to death!`
` The weapon was a knife, stuck right in her back}!!"`
`"Interesting!!`
` I'll tear your locked room to bii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}its!!"`
`".........What's this supposed to be?"`
`"Battler is busy at the moment with other business.`
` For now, I shall be your opponent."`
`Beato had sealed the chapel with a locked room barrier.`
`Unless that riddle was smashed with blue truth, Ange wouldn't be able to leave the chapel.`
`After shrugging impatiently, Ange finally faced Beato.`
`"Is this the first time I've fought you directly......?"`
`"Oh, is it now...?`
` Very well, let's see what you've got.`
` However, Battler isn't here at the moment.`
` .........When he's not around, I sometimes forget to hold back."`
`"What a coincidence.`
` I feel the same."`
`"{p:1:I killed you inside a perfect locked room, with windows, doors, and all other methods of entry or exit blocked}!!"`
`"Okay, I'll play along with your game. Repetition requested!!!"``"And then, you see,`
` the public will be told that, among the works entered into the first Company X mystery novel contest, a work from the amazing Hachijo was once again submitted under a false name..."`
`"Of course, we'll have produced a movie version and a TV drama, all of it ready for a simultaneous and coordinated launch...!`
` I hope this makes clear how eager we are at Company X to receive your manuscript...!!"`
`"And will there be prize money?"`
`"But of course...!`
` The ten million yen prize for Company X's first mystery novel contest will all go to you!`
` And much more besides!!"`
`"Splendid.`
` You've caught my interest.`
` That's why I've decided not to write up a manuscript."`
`""Whaaaaaaaa?!?!`
` M‐Madam Hachijo, whyyyyyyyy...?!!!""`
`Everything had seemed to be going so smoothly up until then, so this sudden refusal made the people from the publishing company fall over in their sofa.`
`"This little scheme of yours is far more interesting than the manuscript I wrote.`
` Which is why this manuscript is unsuitable for your company.`
` ......It was always a worthless story.`
` Mere junk prose to entice my ignorant readers into somehow ignoring their own ignorance and feeling as though they have exhausted the limits of reasoning."`
`"I was hoping that they'd recognize the irony and laugh at their own foolishness,`
` but it looks like you've taken it seriously.`
` Yes, I can say I'm ashamed at my own failure as a writer."`
`"O‐o‐of course not!!`
` Please, forgive us!! Please, let us use your work!!"`
`".........I have no need for money, but some pet food would be nice."`
`"Pet food?`
` O‐oh, for your cat...!!"`
`"Th‐there was a rumor that you had a cat who liked dried plums!`
` Y‐yes, as you wish...!`
` Quickly, let's have a high‐quality assortment of dried plums in here!!"`
`"She only eats the ones that are packaged separately, at 200 yen apiece.`
` ......At this rate, she'll die of high blood pressure.`
` She snacks on kimchi and spicy miso soup all the time too...`
` Really, there must be something wrong with that cat's tongue."`
`Mii!`
` The cat meowed an objection from where it lay on top of the bookshelf.`
`"I cannot give you this manuscript, but why don't I write up a new one for your company's contest?`
` However, I won't write it under my name.`
` It's estimated that thousands of manuscripts will be sent in for your contest.`
` If you manage to pick out mine from the pack, and if you also find it deserving of the prize, then I would be happy to continue our discussion just now.`
` .........How does that sound?"`
`""Y‐yes, of course!!`
` Just the honor of receiving your manuscript is more than enough!!""`
`"You people truly are amusing, fawning and cringing all the time.`
` But I've grown weary of this for today.`
` Leave now.`
` Meeting with the children of man can be so tiring."`
`""Thank you!!`
` We are deeply grateful for your kindness in allowing us this meeting!!!""`
`A servant guided the people from the publishing company to the door.`
`In the study that was now finally quiet, Hachijo Tohya let out a sigh, slumped down in the sofa, and gazed at the ceiling.`
`"It is tiring, but the stimulation of talking with a child of man isn't such a bad thing, in small doses."`
`".........It's good for you to talk to people every now and then.`
` ......You'll go senile if you stay shut in all the time."`
`The black cat leapt from the bookshelf and landed softly on the carpet.`
`Then its form silently twisted and became that of {f:5:Bernkastel}.`
`"Indeed.`
` They certainly can be entertaining.`
` Inviting them over now and then may go a long way to alleviating my boredom.`
` .........At any rate, I think I will write that manuscript...when I feel like it.`
` It sounds like they'll even bring a gift for you."`
`"What's all this about pet food?`
` How rude."`
`"Well, that's what it is.`
` ......Here."`
`Hachijo picked up a jar from a shelf, then took a dried plum out and threw it into the air.`
`In an instant, {f:5:Bernkastel} turned back into a black cat, caught it in midair, and started munching away.`
`"......Miss Hachijo, your guests have departed."`
`A servant knocked on the door before making this announcement.`
`"Thank you.`
` ......Let me know if that one wakes up."`
`"As you wish.`
` ......Would you like some tea?"`
`"No.`
` I'm going to write for a bit.`
` Please do not disturb me."`
`"Yes, ma'am."`
`After waiting for the servant's footsteps to disappear into the distance, Hachijo moved to her desk.`
`The desk certainly looked as though it belonged to a great writer, with pages of manuscript scattered across it.`
`"......Even though the century's almost over, you still write with a pen?"`
`The black cat spoke as it tore the dried plum apart with its mouth.`
`"Tales are to be written with ink.`
` To me, that is an unbreakable rule."`
`"......So, you write it once with ink, then type the whole thing over again with a keyboard.`
` ......Pretty stupid, doing the same thing twice."`
`"In that case, why does a child of man draw up a tale in their mind, and then spit the whole thing out again on a keyboard?`
` ......How foolish of them to do the same thing twice."`
`"Look at it that way, and you're doing the same thing three times."`
`"......Pft, ......*cackle*cackle*.`
` That was a good one."`
`Even as Hachijo laughed, her fountain pen was already sliding across the page.`
`Beautiful letters appeared almost as fast and proficiently as a typewriter.`
`......Only {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s called her creations "manuscripts".`
`With her fountain pen and writing paper, she was creating a world......`
`{n}As she did, the hands of the clock would spin around like a top.`
`The light and shadows that came in through the window changed their angle so fast, they might have been the hands of a clock themselves...`
`......Slowly, she drew a large X across the tightly packed words on the paper.`
`".........Having trouble?"`
`"......I can't draw it out well.`
` ......Writing a manuscript to please others is truly a pain.`
` ......After all, I don't usually write for other people to read."`
`"Why don't you just try taking whatever it is you're trying to say and writing that down......?"`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} curled up on the sofa, a mocking smile on her face.`
`Normally, whenever Hachijo was writing, {f:5:Bernkastel} would never let herself be noticed, much less talk to her.`
`However, realizing that Hachijo was apparently getting bored with her manuscript, {f:5:Bernkastel} yawned and started talking.`
`"What is it you're writing, anyway?"`
`"............A tale to give to a child of man."`
`"Which child of man?"`
`"......It's a tale I promised to write for a miko who once Read for me."`
`"Ah......`
` You're still writing that?"`
`"What can I write that would give her satisfaction?`
` ......The answer is no longer clear to me."`
`"......Looks like Auau's giving up yet again.`
` ......You always promise to write a story, then get stuck before you're finished and give up."`
`"If I had given up, I wouldn't be worrying over it like this."`
`".........There's only one tale that Ange's wanted from the beginning."`
`"The tale of the Single Truth..."`
`"Ange wishes to know what happened that day.`
` No matter how many tales you write distorting the truth, she'll never be satisfied."`
`"And yet, I do think my tales are far more interesting than the Single Truth."`
`"Ange doesn't want to read an interesting tale."`
`"......I promised that child of man that I would write a tale for her sake.`
` So, I'm writing a tale to please her."`
`"No matter how interesting or uninteresting it is,`
` everything you write is an illusion.`
` Ange doesn't want any of that.`
` ......Haven't you figured that out yet?"`
`".........The Book of the Single Truth...was written by Ushiromiya Eva."`
`Hidden amongst the pile of writing paper......was Eva's diary.`
`"Furthermore, the one who wrote this passed away without revealing it to anyone.`
` ......Being the humble writer that I am, I would like to respect that."`
`"......Don't make me laugh.`
` Is this coming from the person who entertains herself by tearing out the guts of a tale while enjoying a glass of wine by the light of the moon?"`
`"The truth...is uninteresting."`
`"Is that your opinion after tearing apart the guts of so many tales?"`
`"..................`
` ...You might as well say that."`
`With a self‐mocking laugh, Hachijo set down her fountain pen.`
`"I certainly have aged.`
` .........The first thing age taught me was that "not knowing" is more precious than "knowing"."`
`"That definitely sounds like something an old person would say, but I'll play along.`
` What do you mean?"`
`""Knowing" and "not knowing".`
` These two things have a one‐way relationship."`
`"True.`
` ......It's possible to switch from "not knowing" to "knowing", but you can't do it the other way around."`
`"When I realized that,`
` ......I saw the noble purity resembling virginity...that exists in not knowing."`
`".............................."`
`"In my attempts to escape boredom, I've torn apart and eaten the guts of as many games and tales as there are stars in the sky.`
` ......But always, my relief from boredom is short‐lived. It's all so fleeting that I've lost sight of the value in each individual tale."`
`"......That's right.`
` If you eat a cat, then you only get to enjoy it for one night.`
` But if you let it live, it might start calling you names and getting sarcastic."`
`"Indeed.`
` ......Even the annoying way they break into your sweets cupboard or sneak into your bed can be part of their charm."`
`Hachijo looked around at the books covering every square inch of the room, then softly pet the cat's back.`
`"I might have been able to enjoy a single tale much longer and much more deeply.`
` ......As I've eaten my way through countless tales to escape boredom, I haven't really been eating them.`
` ......I've just been killing them.`
` ......And, in the end, they'll kill me too."`
`Hachijo laughed with self‐derision.`
`".........Even in Beato's game, you tried to tear the guts out."`
`"I just wanted to check my answers.`
` I did try to do it in a way that respected {f:5:Beatrice}, the weaver of this tale."`
`".........Yeah.`
` ......I think it was pretty well Read, all done so that people who didn't understand wouldn't find the answers."`
`"Will it make for a better tale if Ange learns the truth, or if she doesn't? ......To be honest, I don't know anymore.`
` So, fully aware that you'll scorn me for it,`
` ......I've decided to stop writing the rest of this tale."`
`"......What do you mean?"`
`"I won't write it.`
` I will merely record it.`
` ......The tale that Ushiromiya Ange weaves herself."`
`"So, ......you're going to do that sort of thing again?"`
`"After growing tired of a thousand years of life, I am of the opinion that deliberately choosing not to learn the truth is the more noble path.`
` ......However, I now see that it isn't fair to force my opinion on Ange, who hasn't lived even a hundred years."`
`"So, ......you're going to leave it in Ange's care?"`
`"Yes.`
` I will write it as it plays out."`
`"......If you're leaving it to Ange, ......then the future course of this tale is all but set in stone, right...?"`
`"It would seem so.`
` .........Let it be so.`
` ......After all, in the end, a tale that a child of man weaves for herself will be more fun than any story I could create."`
`"In that case, why don't you lend a hand in Ange's tale?`
` You've already given yourself a role in it, haven't you...?"`
`".........Hmm.`
` ......So, it is my role to bring this tale to its conclusion."`
`"Come on, that's no way for someone in Beato's game to talk.`
` ......It's your job to tear the guts out of the cat box."`
`Hachijo chuckled, pushed aside the pile of writing paper, and picked up the Book of the Single Truth.`
`Then, she opened a locked drawer.`
`"......That is what Ange desires.`
` ......Perhaps fate has decided that this book's seal is to be broken.`
` ......Ange will reach the Single Truth, the Single Truth will break the seal on the cat box, and everything will be exposed to the light of day."`
`"And so, all of those countless message bottles and fragments made up of delightful imaginings, which have been scattered across the ocean of the internet, will fade away like foam on the sea.`
` .........After all, even that one has surely tired of such fragments."`
`"It's about time for that kid's journey to end as well."`
`"......Yes, let us accept this task.`
` Let us bring this journey to its final destination."`
`At that moment, there were sounds of someone in the hallway.`
`The instant someone knocked on the door, {f:5:Bernkastel} turned back into a black cat.`
`"......Miss Hachijo, please forgive me for interrupting."`
`It was the voice of Hachijo's servant.`
`"What is it?`
` If it's a phone call, tell them I'm busy."`
`"It isn't that.`
` ......Tohya‐sama has woken up."`
`"Thank you.`
` Prepare a light meal.`
` Enough for the two of us."`
`"As you wish."`
`Hachijo stood up.`
` Then, she shut the open drawer and locked it again.`
`Inside that drawer.........lay a glittering golden key......`
`"Repetition requested!! `
`"The definition of a locked room prevents all varieties of entering and exiting"!"`
`"Decline repetition!!`
` By definition, it is impossible for a locked‐room murder to take place inside a perfect locked room!"`
`"{p:2:The chain might have been repaired after it was destroyed!`
` The door might have been repaired after it was destroyed!`
` The wall might have been repaired after it was destroyed}!!"`
`"{p:1:My locked room doesn't involve anything being repaired}!!"`
`"<Good>!`
` This really is getting fun, Battler‐san...!"`
`"Sorry, but I don't have time to play with you right now!"`
`"I'm sorry too, but as a fellow Witch of Truth, I can't let you get in Ange‐san's way."`
`"......Come to think of it, you're a Witch of Truth too, aren't you?`
` I see, that makes you a sort of mentor to Ange."`
`"The Single Truth!!`
` It is the supreme, the ultimate!!`
` Only a Witch of Truth can break down all barriers that stand between her and that truth!"`
`"Is this Single Truth of yours really so important...?!`
` There are lots of things in this world that aren't worth knowing.`
` How important is 1986 to Ange, really?!`
` It isn't important at all!"`
`"*giggle*giggle*!`
` You're probably right!`
` No matter what happened or didn't happen in 1986,`
` it won't change anything for the Ange living in 1998!`
` There's no point in learning that truth.`
` However, there is just one thing that will change."`
`"What's that?"`
`"How she lives!!"`
`Erika transformed her reasoning into a scythe's blade and lashed out at Battler over and over.`
`Battler also created a blade from his reasoning and attacked Erika over and over.`
`In the middle of all this, he questioned Erika, the girl who, like Ange, called herself a Witch of Truth.`
`Just what is the point of exposing the truth?`
`"You're right.`
` Knowing certain things often changes the way a person lives her life.`
` ......In that case, I have one hope as her blood relative.`
` I hope that, at the end of my game, Ange finds a better way to live her life."`
`"By learning things, people change the way they live, but not always in a good direction.`
` There are plenty of things in this world that you'll be more comfortable not knowing."`
`"The number of ticks living in the seats on a train.`
` Those urban legends about nasty stuff in the tap water.`
` The world's full of things you'd be better off not knowing...!!"`
`"The Book of the Single Truth probably can teach Ange what happened on this island.`
` But what's the point in her knowing that?!`
` It'll just increase the sadness she's felt for twelve years!`
` How many more years will it take for her to find happiness as an ordinary girl...?!`
` How many years will it take for her wounds to be healed...?!!"`
`Ange's desire to find the truth is hurting her, regardless of what the truth actually is.`
`Though her deep wounds were slow to heal, they did begin to do so during those twelve years.`
`However, Ange kept picking at the scabs.`
`In her search for the truth, she tore at those wounds herself, opening them up once more...`
`"It's time for Ange to be free of her sadness from 1986...!!`
` That's the thing all of us Ushiromiyas pray for!!"`
`"Who cares about that?!`
` The truth is everything! The truth is justice!!"`
`"That's a disease everyone catches at one time in middle school...!`
` The desire to find out all those things adults are hiding!"`
`"And don't you think it's fun to find that out?"`
`"Yeah, totally.`
` Reading dirty books wouldn't be nearly so fun if you didn't have to do it in secret."`
`"......Pft—"`
`""Waha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!""`
`"{p:1:I deny all of your blue wedges with the red truth.`
` None of the methods you suggest could defeat my locked room}!!"`
`"...................................."`
`Ange was breathing heavily.`
` The Book of the Single Truth was right before her eyes.`
`If she could just defeat Beato, she'd be able to take the book to {f:5:Bernkastel}, and then she could read what was inside.`
`......Even though the truth of the final family conference on October 4th and 5th, 1986, was right there, ......the Golden Witch stood in her way.`
`Her anger and hatred spun around inside her head, wiping out the composure that she needed to create theories.`
`Ange shook her head several times, clearing away everything that got in the way of thinking.`
`However, no matter how many times she thought it through, the locked room sealing her in the chapel was perfect.`
`Ange wasn't particularly familiar with the mystery genre.`
`However, she knew about all the fragments containing Beato's games so far.`
`Her knowledge was shallow, but it should still have been enough to give her a good foothold.`
`However, .........no matter how many blue truths she shot at Beato, none of them even made the witch flinch...`
`Beato just blew them apart with the red truth and an elegant wave of her pipe.`
`"It's about time you gave up.`
` I don't even view this as a game between the two of us."`
`".........Are you trying to say that I could never solve this puzzle?"`
`"I'm just buying time until Battler finishes entertaining Erika.`
` He's the only one who can bring you to your senses."`
`"Bring {i:me} to my senses?`
` .........You're the ones doing this to me by hiding the Single Truth!!`
` That's why I'm fighting you!!`
` This is my right!!`
` As the final member of the Ushiromiya family, I have a right to know the truth!"`
`"Indeed.`
` And that is the purpose of this final game."`
`"......That's right.`
` Without this final game, I wouldn't have been given a chance to reach the truth.`
` At least for that one thing, I'm grateful."`
`"But as for what happened in 1986...`
` As for who took your relatives and your family away from you...`
` As a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}, your desire to know the truth is quite natural.`
` ......However, even knowing this, Battler decided that it would be best if you didn't return to 1986."`
`"I know what Onii‐chan's trying to say...!`
` He's telling me to look to the future and live, instead of being stuck in the past, right?!"`
`"Correct.`
` Battler...`
`wanted to use this final game to show you that."`
`"In that case, I gave my answer at the beginning.`
` It's "thanks but no thanks", Golden Witch...!`
` Back in 1986, I was already dead.`
` I've wandered about like a ghost for twelve years since then...!`
` And when Aunt Eva died, I lost my only reason to stick around on this Earth as a ghost!`
` That's why I decided to do one last thing before ending my life!!"`
`"And that thing would be learning the truth of 1986?"`
`"Yeah! Something wrong with that?!?!"`
`"Indeed there is, foolish girl!!`
` So, when you do reach the truth, you plan to die...!`
` In that case, I can't let you have it...!!`
` I must trick you and blind you as much as I can...to keep you alive!`
` Battler wants you to live...!!"`
`"Life without truth is no better than being dead!!`
` I'm trying to find the truth so I can live!!"`
`"You just admitted you were searching for the truth so you could die."`
`"Yeah, that's true.`
` Then let me rephrase that...!`
` I'm trying to find the truth so I can die!!`
` I offered up my life when I made my contract with {f:5:Bernkastel}!!`
` All so that I could learn what happened that day!!`
` That Single Truth will be the souvenir I take with me to hell!!!"`
`"{p:1:It's useless.`
` You cannot break this locked room.`
` This locked room is perfect...!`
` And yet, I kill you in this locked room}!!"`
`She had tried every theory and idea she could think of, even those so absurd they qualified as nonsense.`
`However, none of it had any effect on Beato.`
`Powerless and frustrated, with the Book of the Single Truth right before her eyes, ......Ange bit her lower lip.`
`"At first, this was supposed to be a game in which you were given a key. A key that would let you decide your future."`
`"Liar.`
` You wanted to hide the truth in this chapel, them make me choose a door that leads to some optimistic future.`
` ......That's not a choice! You're trying to decide for me!!"`
`"Parents have the right to prevent their children from making unsuitable choices."`
`"I'm not a kid!!`
` I'm an eighteen‐year‐old woman, who can think and act for herself...!!"`
`"Fool!!`
` You're just a six‐year‐old girl, who can't think of anything except the past!!"`
`"And whose fault is that?!!`
` Because of you, ......I've been stuck as a six‐year‐old all this time!!`
` Now it's time for me to tear apart your illusion covering the truth!!"`
`"Yes, now that I think about it, it's not this chapel that you've locked me inside!`
` Since that day in 1986, for all these years, ......you've had me locked away in a locked room where I'm all alone, and where no one will tell me the truth!!"`
`"And now......I'll tear your locked room apart with my own hands!!`
` ......Yeah, it's no good, it's no good at all.`
` I know the trick to your perfect locked room!!`
` Repetition requested!!`
` "You murdered me immediately after shutting me into this locked room!""`
`"............!`
` I decline."`
`"Of course you do.`
` ......You spend the next eighteen years killing me.`
` Thanks, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` ......If you hadn't reminded me, I wouldn't have figured out the trick."`
`"............Ange.`
` You are young, and you have a long future ahead of you.`
` In fact, you are a Golden Witch living in the future, are you not?`
` Then live in the future.`
` Just how much is a truth of the past really worth?`
` Isn't the truth of the future, the truth that you will create yourself, far more important...?!!"`
`"My life is trash.`
` My whole family died, leaving just me behind.`
` That's why I'm going back to them once I've gotten my Single Truth."`
`"If you learn the truth, you'll just have to accept your family's deaths...!`
` Haven't you ever thought about living on, hoping that by some miracle, one of them might have survived? And that someday, you might get a chance to see them again...?!"`
`"Don't worry.`
` Even the Witch of Miracles couldn't find a fragment like that."`
`Almost none of the family's remains were recovered from the Great Rokkenjima Explosion.`
`Some days, ......I hoped that this might be a sign that they had escaped the explosion and survived......and that hope gave me the strength to live on.`
`However, that hope wasn't strong enough to support me for twelve long years.`
`"So, even though I wanted to know the truth, I was unconsciously averting my eyes.`
` ......I felt that learning of my family's deaths for certain would force me to deny any possibility of someone miraculously surviving."`
`".........But I'm tired of living on and on, with nothing but that impossible hope of a miracle to keep me going."`
`"That's why I decided to accept my family's deaths.`
` I decided to accept the truth, no matter what it is.`
` That's why I became a Witch of Truth...!!"`
`"......How foolish, to be blinded by the truth of the past and unable to see one's own future......!`
` Forgive me, Battler.`
` ......I was not strong enough to guide your sister to a proper future..."`
`A blazing blue wedge appeared in Ange's hand.`
`{n}It was long, thick, and shaped like a spear.`
`"This is the end, witch of 1986.`
` ......{p:2:This locked room is perfect!!`
` Therefore, I can't get out, and you can't lay a finger on me from the outside!`
` However, you {i:locked me into} this room!`
` And there's just one trick that makes that the same as you "killing" me...!!`
` You shut me in this perfect locked room and made me starve to death...!!`
` Since you intentionally did this, there's no problem saying that this was a locked room murder with you as the killer}!!"`
`"It looks like being overly vague with the cause of death backfired on you.`
` .........So long, witch of illusions.`
` <See you in hell>."`
`With the stained glass window behind her, Beato spread her arms and let the spear of the blue truth pierce her.`
`The blue spear seemed to crucify Beato against the window.`
`".........Nng.........gah............"`
`"Game set.`
` ...So, this is Aunt Eva's diary, ......the Book of the Single Truth."`
`Ange picked the book up from where it lay on the altar, sealed in crystal.`
`"......If you read that, then by your contract with {f:5:Bernkastel}, you will die...`
` .........Learning the truth just to die?`
` Ridiculous...!!"`
`"That's right.`
` I'm looking for the truth so I can die.`
` ......At least let me choose how I go.`
` .........I'm not an idiot.`
` ......I know the real me is still.........floating in that starry sky."`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} acknowledged me as the final {f:5:Beatrice} and invited me on a journey to learn the truth of 1986.`
`There would be no coming back from that journey.`
`When {f:5:Bernkastel} told me that and walked off the roof into the black sky, ......I followed her into the empty air.`
`That was the contract.`
` I wanted two things from {f:5:Bernkastel}.`
`One was for someone from my family to come back.`
`{n}The other......was revenge.`
`To destroy the witch illusions concealing the events of that day.`
` In other words, to reach the truth.`
`However, the first of my wishes couldn't come true.`
`After all, even the Witch of Miracles couldn't find a fragment where my family came home.`
`So, she wordlessly questioned me.`
`She told me that I couldn't reach the truth unless I had the courage to end this worthless life, living like a ghost and hoping someone might come back.`
`So, she walked out into the open air, and I followed her.`
`Yes, now I can understand.`
`When I offered to trade away my life that day, ......I made one wish and gave up on another.`
`I wished for revenge against the illusion that hid the truth.`
`And now, I have succeeded in that revenge, defeating the master of that illusion and obtaining the Book of the Single Truth.`
`What I gave up was my naivety, my continuing belief that someone from my family might come back.`
`And now, I can accept that my entire family is dead.`
`"......How can you say someone's alive just because you don't know?`
` This cat box of yours is just a naive illusion, the idea that hiding a corpse means you can pretend it might still be alive!`
` But even if you hide a corpse, it's still dead...!!"`
`"You really think you can heal my wounds by saying they'll always be watching over me from the clouds, like some kind of fairy tale?!`
` I'm {f:5:Ange Beatrice}, Witch of Truth!!`
` I'll free myself from that life as a ghost, waiting for a miracle that'll never happen! I'll end my life as a noble martyr who's reached the truth...!!"`
`"......Didn't you come to understand the power of magic through Maria's grimoire......?"`
`"Yeah,`
` I understood it.`
` And then I despaired when I realized how powerless it was.`
` ......And that's what Onii‐chan is trying to force me to use now, isn't it?`
` ......If I believe, if I use magic, ......then my family will always be by my side."`
`".........Don't take me for a fool!!!`
` You think that kind of magic, that illusion, that daydream......can heal those twelve years?!`
` And how am I supposed to go on for decades and decades into the future?!"`
`"Someone, come back to me, someone!!`
` But no one's coming back!!`
` So, at least tell me what happened that day!!`
` {f:5:Bernkastel} said she'd tell me...!!"`
`"Yes, my master, I have the Book of the Single Truth...!`
` I'll bring it back to you, so let me have the truth!!`
` For a long time now, I've been prepared to abandon my naive hope in the miracle that my family might be alive!!`
` So now, tell me the truth of that daa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aay!!!"`
`A blinding light poured out of the chapel.`
`It seeped from the windows and the cracks of the door, even reaching as far as Battler's and Erika's eyes.`
`".........What...?!"`
`"It would seem that comrade Ange has completed her task.`
` It looks like you've used some useless seal, but to my master, that'll be easier than thawing frozen saury fish."`
`"......D‐damn......!!"`
`"Master said I could play with you until Ange finished her task.`
` I've had enough fun from this reunion, so I think it's time for me to leave."`
`Erika gave an elegant curtsey.`
`"Why did you talk Ange into looking for the Single Truth?!`
` Your master must know...!`
` That truth doesn't mean anything for Ange!"`
`"Yes.`
` All truths in this world are meaningless.`
` In the end, "meaning" comes from the mind of each individual human.`
` ......Even when there is a Single Truth, it can mean different things to different people!`
` The truth has no meaning in itself!`
` There's just one reason why I insist upon the truth despite it all!"`
`"Because you're a detective!"`
`"<Good>!!`
` But Ange‐san isn't a detective.`
` To her, the truth itself is the finish line.`
` ......A way to mark the end of her unhappy life."`
`"Now, she's finally finished the last purification ceremony...!!`
` She's a one‐night Witch of Truth, focused on learning just one truth in order to die!`
` A temporary witch for the short time until she slams against the ground!!"`
`"I won't let Ange die!!`
` No matter how tough it gets, she has to live!!`
` That's the only thing all of us want...!!`
` If she lives, all sorts of magic and miracles would be possible...!!"`
`"If only you'd put your arm around her shoulder and told her that directly, you might not have lost.`
` ......Your thoughts?`
` All it takes is to hear you howl, and a deduction like this becomes trivial for Furudo Erika."`
`"Live! Angee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}eee!!!"`
`He yelled towards the chapel, but Ange probably wasn't even there anymore.`
`Battler's yell was swallowed by the empty pitch‐black sky and the sea of rampaging goats...`
`"Comrade {f:5:Eva}.`
` Our mission is complete. Let's withdraw."`
`"Oh, are we done already?`
` And I was just about to tear the island apart with my own Eva culprit theory...!"`
`{f:5:Eva} appeared in midair and cackled.`
`"Sorry, Battler‐kun.`
` I wasn't strong enough.`
` ......For twelve years, I protected that kid my own way."`
`".........I'm grateful."`
`"However, she's decided this for herself.`
` She's eighteen years old now.`
` Don't you think people should decide how they live their own lives?"`
`"......Sorry.`
` For being an overprotective big brother."`
`"Later.`
` I'm Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}'s piece at the moment.`
` It's time for me to leave."`
`"I'll see you later, comrade {f:5:Eva}."`
`{f:5:Eva} held her palm open...and a small, pointy, blue fragment appeared there.`
`The fragment burst, and with a blinding flash of light, {f:5:Eva} vanished.`
`It was the same light that had seeped out of the chapel earlier.`
`......Pieces cannot leave the game board.`
` However, the Voyager witches alone could come and go.`
`This was probably some sort of magic that {f:5:Bernkastel} had given them.`
`Erika opened her palm as well, and the same sort of fragment appeared there.`
`"Well then, I bid you farewell.`
` In fact, this might be the last time we see each other."`
`"......Wait.`
` We haven't settled our fight yet."`
`If he could steal the fragment in Erika's hand, ......he would be able to go to where {f:5:Bernkastel} was.`
`The seal surrounding the Book of the Single Truth would probably be broken easily with {f:5:Bernkastel}'s power.`
`However, even so, it would take her some time.`
`If he could steal that fragment, ......he would have a chance at bringing Ange back...`
`"What is there to settle?`
` Time's up.`
` ......However,`
` ......if you feel like taking one last hit, I'd be happy to oblige."`
`He had known that Erika couldn't resist the challenge.`
`{n}......After all, Battler already knew what Erika's trick was.`
`He'd figured it out just a second ago.`
` Even while he spoke with Erika, he had been thinking about it inside his mind.`
`He could finish her with this last strike...and take the fragment......`
`"Let's go, Erika.`
` ......This'll decide it...!!"`
`"This'll be the last one before I go,`
` so go ahead and give me the craziest of your hilarious theories."`
`"Your locked room definition claimed that the walls, windows, floor, ceiling, and chain were all unbeatable!!`
` However, there was one possibility that I didn't check because it was too ridiculous!"`
`"And that was whether or not the chain could be set from the outside!!"`
`".........!"`
`"Blue truth!!`
` This is the answer to your locked room!!`
` The length of the chain!!`
` {p:2:The chain for your locked room was extra long, so it was possible to set and unset it from outside the room}!!!"`
`What a ridiculous answer.`
`However, if you blindly assume that a lock made by an unbreakable chain makes a locked room unbeatable, then this truly would be a perfect locked room.`
`The blue wedge flung from Battler's hand plunged straight into Erika's chest.`
`As she winced in pain, her hand shook, ......and the fragment she held flew into the air.`
`".........Your locked room definition claimed that the walls, windows, floor, door, and chain were all unbeatable!!`
` However, wasn't there one really ridiculous thing missing?!`
` Blue truth!!`
` {p:2:Your locked room had no ceiling, so it was possible to enter by climbing over the wall}!!!"`
`Erika's blue scythe swung out from behind her back, catching Battler in the side as he stretched his hand out towards the fragment.`
`Battler's hand......didn't reach it.`
`{n}The fragment returned to Erika's hands once more.`
`"It looks like our tricks were equally ridiculous.`
` ......The mystery nuts would've been furious, don't you think?"`
`"But I disagree!`
` To me, the process of exposing that ridiculousness is ecstasy!!`
` That's why I'm Furudo Erika, the detective!!"`
`"......Dammit...... ......You figured out the answer a while back, didn't you......?"`
`"Not true.`
` I thought it up in the instant between the time you let loose your blue truth and the time you stretched your hand out to grab the fragment.`
` I've just been buying time since the beginning.`
` I only started reasoning a second ago!"`
`Erika broke the crystal barrier that surrounded them.`
`Then, she flew high up into the sky, looking down on Battler and laughing at him as she gave a final bow.`
`"Good day, Battler‐san...!!`
` Even if this has been my only time to shine!`
` Even if I've outlived my usefulness and am about to be thrown back into the depths of oblivion!`
` Even so, I have no regrets!!"`
`"W‐wait!!!"`
`No one would be foolish enough to wait on command.`
`With a blinding flash, Erika vanished.`
`Ange had gotten the Book of the Single Truth and returned to {f:5:Bernkastel}.`
`......Battler and the others had no way to leave the game board.`
`Everything...had come to an end......`
`A gold butterfly flitted by, and Beato appeared.`
`"......My apologies, Battler...`
` ......I let Ange get away......"`
`"I'm sorry too.`
` ......I've let them get away. It's all over......"`
`Battler had created this game for Ange.`
`Now that Ange was gone, the game board no longer had any purpose.`
`......And even if that weren't the case, even now, the game board was being chewed apart by the goats, like a single leaf floating on a sea of nothingness...`
`Thanks to Gertrude and Cornelia's seals, the mansion was protected from the second floor up.`
`The door to the Golden Land was now open wide enough for a child to slip through.`
`The smaller people, including Maria and Sakutarou, slipped through it.`
`"......My friend.`
` I believe the door is opening at a quicker pace."`
`"Indeed.`
` To my eyes as well, it seems to be so."`
`"........................"`
`"F‐Father...!`
` Is the door open yet...?!`
` It looks like they're about to break in through the windows...!!"`
`"Krauss‐sama, there is no need for you to fear.`
` An Eiserne Jungfrau barrier is not so easily broken."`
`"Very soon, it'll be big enough for adults to go through too.`
` Don't worry. We'll make it in time."`
`"B‐but...there's knocking and banging everywhere, and—"`
`"Stay calm and wait.`
` After all, there is nothing for us to do but wait."`
`Even the outer walls of the mansion were covered with goats.`
`And they were plunging their fangs and fists into the walls and windows, trying to break through them.`
`So, there were goats stuck to all the windows in the hallway,`
` smashing their thick arms against the windows in a way that would terrify anyone, even if they knew about the barrier.`
`However, anyone watching the group of goats gathered at the top of the big staircase from the safety of the other side of the barrier would probably feel a different emotion.`
`Instead of terror, ......it was a sad, empty sort of emotion.`
`The barrier was drawn across the landing at the top of the hall's great staircase.`
`Beyond that barrier, ......everything had already been eaten away.`
`Was it even possible for those who stood in the hallway of the upper floors to believe that this was the Rokkenjima mansion?`
`By now, ......no one looking at this scene would be able to imagine such a thing.`
`Forget the hall or even the whole first floor...... Even the ground itself was almost gone.`
`The sea of goats had eaten everything apart long before this.`
`They had eaten apart the hall, the pillars of the mansion, the floor, the ground, the sea, the very concept of the island......every part of the game board Battler had created.`
`And now, the only leftover was the upper part of the mansion, which floated along in empty space.`
`"......How {f:5:pitiful}."`
`"To what do you refer?"`
`"......The goats, in their eagerness to chew this island apart,`
` have eaten up even the ground they stood on, dropping themselves into {f:5:nothingness}."`
`This had once been a huge entrance hall.`
`Beyond it had been a vast rose garden.`
` ......There had been so many places to stand upon.`
`However, now, ......holes had been dug everywhere, and nearly everything outside the mansion was completely gone.`
`Some goats were clutching to the few remaining footholds and pillars, still eating away at them.`
`"......It should be known that to expose the truth is to kill."`
`"Why can't humans live without killing, I {f:5:wonder}.`
` ......Throughout their long history, so many have prayed for miracles,`
` ......but in the end, they eat up their own chances at receiving a miracle, eating up the very ground they stand on and falling into the {f:5:abyss}......"`
`They saw a goat chewing the same pillar that was holding it up,`
` ......which, unsurprisingly, fell into empty blackness along with the goat...`
`"Humans are.........sad creatures, fated to live in order to learn."`
`"..........................."`
`"......If learning means eating away at the same hopes and dreams that keep you alive,`
` .........that would mean humans are born just so they can die.`
` ......We're taught that we have to live.`
` However, almost everything that we accomplish in life ends up killing us..."`
`".........Don't think about it.`
` You'll just get a headache."`
`"As a single human, I want to ask.`
` ......Is learning a crime?!`
` Is living in ignorance the only way we can have hopes and dreams...?!"`
`"......Both living with knowledge and living in ignorance have their benefits, as well as their shortcomings.`
` You're even free to choose which path you take.`
` .........That's what makes {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s powerless."`
`"While people can learn, they cannot "unlearn"......"`
`"And so, the all‐knowing god has stepped in for the sake of the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s who cannot know all,`
` marking out things that should be learned and things that should not be learned."`
`"............Too much curiosity...can kill.........your hopes and dreams."`
`"Humans are pitiable beings, who are unable to simply avoid those things which should not be {f:5:learned}.`
` .........Lord {f:5:Battler} may have failed to teach this to Ange, but he can hardly be {f:5:blamed}."`
`"......And now Ange's gone.`
` ......This game...is over."`
`Struck dumb by Will's words, everyone fell silent.`
`Only the sound of the goats eating everything away rang out hollowly...`
`Even if they escaped to the Golden Land, these goats of emptiness would probably chew into that realm eventually as well.`
`Even if they got away for the time being, nothing would be resolved.`
`It was all set in stone now.`
`They had no way to resist the future's violent attempts to tear the cat box of the past open.`
`"In that case, .........we must stay alive."`
`".............................."`
`"If a human's foolishness makes them throw away their own hopes and dreams in the end,`
` ......then I want to believe in those things until the last second."`
`"............Your resolve is impressive."`
`"I'm the embodiment of the one hope held by the {f:5:Beatrice}s of a million worlds.`
` ......So, even at times like this, I have to be everyone's hope.`
` I'm not giving up on this game yet."`
`"......You're not giving {f:5:up}?"`
`"I'll keep waiting, believing in a miracle, until the last second."`
`"So, you'll keep struggling on and on until it's all over?"`
`"That's right.`
` After all, last time, when we were surrounded by that pack of terrifying cats, we were prepared for death, weren't we...?!`
` But {f:5:Lambdadelta}‐san saved us...!`
` If we had given up, if we hadn't had the strength to believe in a miracle, then I'm sure we'd have been erased before help could come."`
`"Well, it's not like I really saved you. More like Bern just failed to kill you properly.`
` Or, it might have been some whim of hers.`
` A miraculous whim from the Witch of Miracles.`
` *giggle*giggle*......"`
`How long had she been there?`
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} was leaning on the handrail of the staircase, eating popcorn.`
`She held the cup of popcorn out as if to say "Want some?", but Lion declined the offer.`
`".........Battler‐kun told us.`
` ......He said Ange‐chan made a contract to learn the truth in exchange for her own life."`
`"Going by your conversation just now, that was no contract.`
` ......After all, living and seeking the truth so they can die is what humans do anyway, right?"`
`"In other words, Ange has spent all of her life trying to learn the truth.`
` ......All Bern did was shorten that time to a single instant."`
`"......When Ange‐chan lost her hopes and dreams, she stopped valuing her own life.`
` .........How can she be given hopes and dreams again?`
` ......What can be done to help her find a reason for living?"`
`"......Are you asking me?`
` I'm stupid, remember?`
` I'm super‐air‐headed super‐paper with a brain of confetti.`
` I don't understand complicated stuff."`
`After tossing the last bits of popcorn into her mouth, {f:5:Lambdadelta} threw the empty cup into the abyss of nothingness...`
`"......Bern wasn't really pushing that kid to do something she didn't want.`
` She was giving Ange a chance.`
` Or should I call it a choice?"`
`"Then, Ange made the choice she wanted, appeared on the game board, ......and now, in her game against Battler, she's making her own choices again.`
` ......From start to finish, Ange's game has always belonged to Ange.`
` Right now, I'm just a casual observer."`
`".........It doesn't exactly look like you're glued to the action."`
`"Maybe not.`
` It's a play with an obvious ending.`
` ......I was thinking I might sneak out in a moment."`
`"......So, you'd stop watching a play just because you think you know how it will end?`
` Even though it might reach a climax you didn't expect?"`
`"...................................."`
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} licked her salty fingers.`
`{n}Then, she stared at Lion challengingly and grinned.`
`"I know......that Ange's game won't end this way.`
` ......I know Battler‐kun's feelings will reach her.`
` ......She'll understand that he wants her to live in a better future, ......and she'll choose that future of her own accord.`
` .........I'm certain that's how this tale will end."`
`"......Huh...?`
` Are you talking to me, the Witch of Certainty, and saying that the outcome is certain...?"`
`"That's right.`
` I guarantee it.`
` ......Ange‐chan's game won't end like this.`
` So please, don't leave your seat.`
` We won't leave either.`
` There must be something we can do."`
`"And that......will surely lead her to a better future.`
` ......This tale will definitely have a happy ending.`
` So keep watching until the end.`
` I beg you."`
`"..............................`
` ......Even though I, the Witch of Certainty, have already announced that this tale won't have a happy ending...?"`
`"Who gets to decide what makes a happy ending?"`
`For a while, there was a tense silence.`
`With a confident gaze that seemed to be saying "are you serious?",`
` {f:5:Lambdadelta} stared at Lion.`
`However, Lion's eyes didn't even twitch.`
`For some time, they both stared into the other's eyes without flinching...`
`".........Hahh...!"`
`Suddenly, {f:5:Lambdadelta} let out a large sigh and stretched.`
`"Well, I have nowhere better to be.`
` ......Sure, I'll stick around a bit longer.`
` If you get me some more popcorn, that is.`
` I'm feeling like caramel flavor this time."`
`"If you come to the Golden Land, we'll serve you as much as you like."`
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} waved at them with a thin smile.`
`No one was quite sure what this meant, but it apparently signified her surrender in her own way.`
`"Okay.`
` If you'll guarantee your own flavor of happy ending with certainty,`
` ......then I, the great {f:5:Lambdadelta}, will stick around for a while longer.`
` See how big my heart is!`
` As wide as Lake Biwa!"`
`"...That's not very wide."`
`"And as gentle as the Sea of Japan!"`
`"That is a very rough {f:5:sea}."`
`"......For your attention."`
`"It would seem that you have mixed up your metaphors."`
`There was some muffled laughter.`
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} is the witch who gives strength to those who possess unshakable willpower.`
`She might have given Lion a bit of magic for that absolute belief in a happy ending.`
`"You better not let me get bored, okay?`
` If you do, I'll leave right away."`
`"Of course.`
` I'm sure Battler‐kun will be glad to welcome you as well."`
`Lion understood.`
`In order to fight back against {f:5:Bernkastel}, who had taken Ange outside the board, they would need the power of another who was capable of leaving the board.`
`Their last hope was to make sure {f:5:Lambdadelta} didn't abandon this game.`
`However, judging by {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s expression as she hummed to herself cheerily,`
` actually asking her for help was probably going to be a problem......`
`"Look, Zepar!`
` Everything from the first floor down is gone!"`
`"What a spectacle!`
` Not a sight you see every day!"`
`".........How have matters progressed {f:5:upstairs}?"`
`"Ah, right, we came here to tell you that!"`
`"Hey, everyone, sorry to keep you waiting!"`
`""They say the door to the Golden Land has opened...!!""`
`"......Finally."`
`"Let us {f:5:go}.`
` This place will not be safe for {f:5:long}."`
`Everyone who had been sitting on the staircase got up.`
`"I guess this is goodbye, Rokkenjima the beautiful."`
`"......True.`
` ......It may be a shadow of its former self, but this is the last time we'll see it, isn't it?"`
`"Heheheh, what could you possibly do with an attitude like that?`
` Isn't there something you've got to show me?!`
` Let's see a happy ending!"``The Book of the Single Truth, sealed in crystal by Battler.`
`Until I undo this seal, I can't even stick the key in the keyhole.`
`"......You can remove it, right?`
` This seal."`
`"Of course."`
`They were in a vast, dimly‐lit space.`
`To sum it up in a phrase, ......it was like a trench in the ocean floor.`
`No, that's not quite right.`
` It was......a library.`
`However, the number of books and the height of the shelves vastly surpassed all of those that existed in the world of humans.`
`If height is the measure of greatness,`
` ...then the gods must surely have been giants taller than mountains.`
`This place appeared to be a library big enough and grand enough for such gods.`
`Each individual book was no larger than those from the human world.`
`However, the shelves holding them stood like the walls of a valley......or a deep‐sea ocean trench.`
`So, ......Ange and the others looked like little more than a few small butterflies who had wandered into this vast library.`
`......Like minuscule deep‐sea fish swimming about all alone in an ocean pit.`
`"This is more like ice than a seal.`
` ......If you just steal it away from Battler and put it under the rays of the sun, it will fade away by itself as time passes."`
`"Isn't there some way to just smash it open?"`
`"......Do you like to thaw your frozen fish by smashing it with a hammer?"`
`"Sorry, I was always terrible in cooking class."`
`"......Kitties,`
` thaw this seal."`
`When {f:5:Bernkastel} whispered, from the dark ocean pit deep below them,`
` ......several emerald‐green glints appeared and gathered like a school of fish.`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} threw the Book of the Single Truth down to them, and only after several seconds passed, the school of fish seemed to gather around it and carry it away.`
`Those few seconds made it clear just how deep this bookshelf trench went.`
`Ange was once again dumbfounded by this unimaginably vast and godly library...`
`"We can just let them handle the rest."`
`"......And you really will let me see what's inside?"`
`"If that is your wish, I'll grant it.`
` And, of course, I won't be able to read it myself without that key of yours."`
`Ange silently gripped the golden key in her pocket...`
`This journey has been so long, and so strange.`
`In search of the truth from twelve years ago, I left my home, ......met President Okonogi, met Amakusa...`
`......And, at some point, that adventure became part of a witch illusion.`
`However, here I am.`
`Ushiromiya Eva's diary is here.`
`The truth written inside it is sitting right before me.`
`"Rest for a while.`
` ......Even I don't have enough free time to spend it all with you."`
`".........Well, I'm not really tired though."`
`"Erika.`
` ......Serve Ange some tea or something."`
`"Yes, my master!"`
`Erika popped into existence out of nowhere and bowed to her master.`
`".........{f:5:Bernkastel}.`
` If, by any chance, you're planning to use me and steal both the key and the book, ......you won't get off easy."`
`"H‐how dare you say such a thing to my master?!"`
`"Sorry.`
` After my long experience with witches, I've decided not to trust normal words."`
`"......Very well.`
` I'll promise it with the red truth.`
` ......{p:1:When the seal on the Book of the Single Truth is dissolved, you, Ange, will be the first to read it}.`
` ......Is that good enough for you?"`
`For some time, Ange considered the witch's words, searching for some sort of trap hidden within them...`
`There was no greater guarantee than a red truth given by a witch.`
` Ange understood this well enough.`
`If one did start to doubt even this red truth, .........there would be nothing left to trust in this entire world.`
`If one began to suspect even this, ......then even the truth would no longer be truth.`
`"......Are you still unsatisfied about something?"`
`"Nn.........`
` ......No, I'm fine."`
`She would need {f:5:Bernkastel}'s help if she wanted to read the Book of the Single Truth.`
`Ange finally realized that she had nothing to gain by complaining more and annoying this witch further...`
`"......Once you've broken the seal, call me right away."`
`"Of course.`
` I also want to read it as soon as possible.`
` I'll call for you at once."`
`Bern spun away from them, then vanished into the dark bookshelf trench.`
`Ange saw a school of emerald‐green fish appear and follow behind {f:5:Bernkastel}.`
` ......Could those be her familiars?`
`As she stared at the emerald lights that resembled some sort of deep‐sea fish, Ange was poked from behind.`
`"Let's go,`
` comrade Ange."`
`"......You're creeping me out, so please just call me Ange."`
`"Then you can call me Erika‐sama."`
`"......Let's get going, comrade Erika."`
`The pair began to swim in the direction Erika indicated.`
`"Swim" seemed a better way to describe what they were doing than "fly" would have.`
`".........Just what is this place?`
` It's way too big to be called a library."`
`"It's not like you'll be able to remember its name, so why not just call it the library?"`
`"I'll decide what I can or can't remember. Tell me."`
`"It's "the Great Witch of Theatergoing, Drama, and Spectating's Noble City of Carefully Selected Books"."`
`"......Yeah, "the library" works fine."`
`"Knew you'd say that."`
`The City of Books.`
`Yeah, the name fits.`
`The bookshelves on either side of this canyon are skyscrapers.`
`If I think of those emerald‐green lights flowing beneath us as headlights on a highway, then this really does seem like a city of books.`
`"These things aren't just books, are they?"`
`"That's right.`
` Each volume is packed with an ensemble play.`
` ......They look like books from here, but if you open one up, you'll find a whole world inside."`
`".........So, even our long tale is only one of these."`
`"Great witches who live on a far, far higher plane than we do are hardly any different from a god or Creator.`
` ......From their perspective, our little tale is worth little more than a single book, if that."`
`From the theatergoer's perspective, our individual lives are hardly worth anything at all.`
`If they're writing down an entire world in a single volume, ......then my life probably isn't even worth a single line.`
`"But we're the main characters.`
` ......I am, and so are you."`
`"That's right.`
` Even if the tale of the gods doesn't mention us,`
` ......we are always the main character in the story we write for ourselves.`
` .........Becoming aware of that fact is the first thing that separates witches from {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s."`
`They were on a balcony, which was really a room‐sized section that had been dug out of the bookshelf, with no guardrail along the cliff.`
`It didn't go in very deep, making it look like a room that had been cut in half.`
`It was filled with the tools of everyday life, as though this was Erika's hidden house.`
`"My master has ordered me to serve you some tea,`
` so if you don't feel like drinking, I'll have to pour it into you with a funnel."`
`".........If you try, I'll have to serve you some matcha."`
`"Matcha?"`
`"......Nothing. Just talking to myself."`
`Ignoring Erika as she made tea, ......Ange looked down upon the bizarre, otherworldly scene below.`
`Until Erika finished getting the tea ready, the scene held Ange's gaze like it was sucking out her soul......`
`"This might sound strange, coming from me."`
`"......What?"`
`"You made a deal to throw away your life to learn the truth.`
` That's quite something."`
`".........I had nothing to gain from life.`
` It was easy for me to trade away the time I had left."`
`"My master really does take to idle whims.`
` To think she would make a contract for the meaningless life of a powerless girl."`
`"........................Heh."`
`Ange chuckled, not bothering to argue.`
`That was exactly right.`
`How incredible that {f:5:Bernkastel} would lend her power to a worthless life that was trying to throw itself away.`
`"Well, my master is the witch who controls miracles.`
` ......So, it makes sense that she'd appear even for a worthless girl like you."`
`"Good point.`
` .........Even if {f:5:Bernkastel} hadn't appeared, I would've still taken that step off the edge that day."`
`"............You really are a cheap woman, aren't you?"`
`"Well then, just how much are you worth?"`
`"Me?!`
` Hahaha, aha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha......"`
`The way Erika cackled was disturbing.`
`Still, Ange realized that this was her way of answering the question.`
`People don't become witches of their own choosing.`
`If they're capable of living, all people want to live their lives as {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s.`
`......When something comes along to trip up that life, ......that's when the road to living as a witch opens.`
`Even Furudo Erika, who calls herself the Witch of Truth, must be like this.`
`The two Witches of Truth, sitting here drinking tea without even looking at each other, ......are exactly the same.`
`"I...like exposing the truth."`
`"I know that."`
`"I like exposing secrets, then watching those people turn pale as they wonder how I figured it out.`
` ......That's when I know I've reached the truth, and it's a moment of ecstasy."`
`"There's something seriously wrong with you."`
`"Well then, what does the truth mean to you?"`
`"................................."`
`Ange was about to give an immediate answer, but she bit down her words.`
`And once she did, not knowing the right way to respond, no further words came.`
`After all, to Ange, the truth itself was the goal.`
`At first, it was out of hatred.`
`Could Ushiromiya Eva, the sole survivor of Rokkenjima, be the culprit behind everything?`
`She hated Eva, but she had no proof that her aunt was the culprit, and of course, Eva never talked about what happened on that island.`
`......So, at first, in Ange's eyes, "the truth" meant proof that Eva was the culprit.`
`However, that feeling withered away with Eva's death.`
`Now that Eva was dead, even if Ange did find some kind of proof, ......it wouldn't mean anything.`
`So, eventually, the truth Ange wanted to find......became nothing more than the simple desire to know what happened on that island that day.`
`However, one thing was obvious.`
`Even if she did find out the truth, ......that wouldn't bring any of her family back to her.`
`"......It might not mean anything at all."`
`"You're going to expose the truth your beloved Onii‐chan is hiding, even though it's meaningless?`
` You're the one that's not making sense."`
`Erika laughed mockingly.`
`{n}Ange laughed too, as though she agreed.`
`"And so,`
` truth to me became my goal.`
` ......Maybe you could even call it my reason for living."`
`"So, once you do reach the truth, there won't be any point or purpose to you living anymore, right?"`
`"That's right.`
` So, I'll die.`
` ......Hasn't it been long enough?`
` I've already lived twelve years too long.`
` Don't I at least deserve to have a witch appear and grant my wish in my final moments?"`
`"............To put it simply,`
` you're just tired with life—does that sum it up?"`
`"Yeah.`
` So, my reason for living, my very existence, and everything else is meaningless.`
` ......That's why this goal of finding the Book of the Single Truth has put a little sparkle back into my life, now that it's nearly over.`
` ......At least on that score, I'm grateful to {f:5:Bernkastel}."`
`"I see.`
` ......Battler wants you to live, so he hid the goal that would let you die.`
` ......I think I pity Battler‐san for the first time.`
` After all, you can't choose your little sister."`
`".........................................."`
`Sorry, Onii‐chan.`
`I'm...tired of life.`
`Twelve whole years.`
`I've been living off nothing but the illusion that someone might come home someday.`
`Just let me find peace already.`
`Finding the truth of that day...... I decided I'd use that to mark the end of my life.`
`For twelve years, I've believed in a miracle, but there was no miracle...`
`I won't......believe in miracles anymore.........`
`"......The Book of the Single Truth.`
` Of course, I'm also dying to find out what's in it,`
` but from what I hear, it doesn't sound like the truth inside is something spectacular enough to mark the end of your life with."`
`"Yeah.`
` .........At first, I hoped there would be something earth‐shattering written in it.`
` But now......I guess I've cooled on it."`
`"Any truth searched for by a worthless person is bound to be worthless.`
` It'll probably make for a fitting end to your worthless life."`
`".........Yeah.`
` I'm...sure it will."`
`Ange was already starting to realize something.`
`Regardless of why Eva decided not to talk about what happened...`
`......the real events of that day.........probably weren't anything earth‐shattering.`
`Some sort of malfunction made the bomb in that secret underground base explode.`
`Yes.`
` ......It was just...an accident.`
`But......the public believed, and hoped, that some sort of plot surrounded the events of that day.`
`Eva was a suspect herself, so she could claim that nothing strange had happened until she was blue in the face, and no one would believe her.`
`......Of course, this included Ange.`
`In that case, ......shutting up like a clam would just make things easier.`
`It was hardly surprising......that Eva chose to say nothing.`
`"......Right now, I don't feel any sense of accomplishment.`
` ......I just feel...sort of worn out and listless."`
`"Being able to bear the truth is what makes a witch a Witch of Truth.`
` .........Comrade Ange.`
` It looks like you don't possess that strength after all.`
` If you did, you wouldn't be thinking about dying."`
`"...........................`
` ......You're right.`
` ......For twelve years, I've clung on to the hope that someone might come back.`
` ......I've just used {f:5:Beatrice}'s cat box to shut away the truth, denying it for twelve years."`
`"......When you read the Book of the Single Truth,`
` I wonder what will happen to you."`
`"Who knows.`
` .........Won't {f:5:Bernkastel} carry out the contract by slicing my head off with a scythe or something?`
` Or will I be turned into chunks of meat again?`
` ......Maybe I'll get some salt and pepper this time."`
`"..............................`
` ......I see, so that's where the chunks of meat thing came from."`
`"Did you say something?"`
`"Nope, nothing at all.`
` Anyway, would you like some more tea?"`
`"No thank you."`
`Ange listlessly gazed down from the balcony with no handrail,`
` ......down into the darkness of the abyss at the bottom of the bookshelf ravine... no, the gap between the bookshelf skyscrapers.`
`......From the beginning until the end of my journey, .........I haven't taken a single step away from this spot.`
`This journey of mine, not even a single step long, ......will end soon.........`
`"......Um, what are those lines of lights flowing around at the bottom?"`
`"Oh, those?`
` Probably a group of guests coming to the great Lady {f:5:Aurora}'s party."`
`"Guests...?"`
`"Great Witches from the Senate, Voyager witches who are trying to escape boredom in their endless travels,`
` powerful witches who have woken from century‐long sleeps, as well as witches who control the future world and noble witch hunters.`
` It seems she's planning to hold a grand party tonight."`
`"......Is it a birthday party or something?"`
`"From what I've heard, while the great Lady {f:5:Beatrice}, the Endless Witch, may be an outsider among witches,`
` she's also the genius whose formidable magical system of magic resulted in the creation of "{f:5:Beatrice}'s cat box", the endless factory capable of producing endless tales.`
` ......From my point of view, she's just stupid and a weak finisher, but in the world of great witches, she's apparently pretty famous."`
`"So this is {f:5:Beatrice}'s birthday party?"`
`"My master says she'll be holding a dinner party with {f:5:Beatrice}'s guts.`
` ......After all, it's only natural, right?`
` The cat box was only able to generate infinite tales because there was no Single Truth."`
`".........However, tonight,`
` the Single Truth will be revealed, thanks to your key.`
` And that means the cat box will be opened.`
` Really, it's no different from slicing open her chest as she still lives and tearing out what's inside."`
`".........Everyone in that huge crowd which looks like a packed freeway is going to one dinner party?`
` .........I'm not sure what's stronger, my shock at how famous {f:5:Beatrice} is, or my revulsion at those sleaze‐bags."`
`"For you, the Book of the Single Truth is nothing more than an end.`
` .........However, for all of those enjoying the mystery of Rokkenjima, this is an event that can't be missed."`
`"I see.`
` .........So, that's a crowd of those goats who're chewing Onii‐chan's game board apart."`
`Ange's analogy was an accurate one.`
`The crowd far, far below them......was made up of nobles wearing beautiful outfits and goat masks.`
`They were all so intent on tearing the guts out of {f:5:Beatrice}'s cat box that they couldn't even hide the drool trickling from their mouths.`
`Those gluttonous goat nobles, who derived pleasure from violently exposing the truth, were in a line of cars heading towards the meeting place.`
`".........Looks like this is the end for {f:5:Beatrice} and the cat box."`
`"......Beato's group has holed up in the Golden Land, the last leftovers from the game board.`
` Acting as gatekeepers, Battler and Beato have destroyed the first wave, but they won't be able to stop the second.`
` ......My master has given me an armada capable of destroying the very concept of defensive measures.`
` The Golden Land's ramparts are as good as gone."`
`".........Those goats who appeared all over the island... They're the personification of random opinions in the future, and all of them want the island's tale to be a tragedy."`
`"That's right.`
` Those goats keep getting born from the sea of the internet.`
` That first wave was just the riffraff.`
` The second wave will be entirely different.`
` It's made up of the best of the best, elite goats selected from the crowd that are capable of denying all the cowering pieces one by one.`
` In total, they number in the hundreds of thousands.`
` ......A hundred thousand people to deny the existence of a few dozen hiding on an island."`
`"......Looks like......this is it for Onii‐chan too."`
`"You're ready, though, aren't you?`
` You understand that Ushiromiya Battler died in 1986, ......and that this man is an illusion created by the cat box."`
`"............Yeah.`
` ......I understand."`
`Regardless of whether he's my real brother or an illusion, ......regardless of whether he's who I'd like him to be or not,`
` ......the Battler who created this game board for my sake...will die.`
`No, it just means that I'll accept the fact of his death, so it's not like he's going to die now......`
`Ange thought to herself.`
`Shouldn't performing the last rites for her brother......be her responsibility?`
`This was her final trial, which she had assigned to herself.`
`All of those people down on the game board......were the personification of Ange's naivety.`
`By denying the existence of all of them, .........wouldn't she finally be able to accept the truth?`
`.................................`
`No, that's not right.`
` ......I'm not being honest, even with myself.`
`Even if it's all an illusion, .........it wouldn't make that bizarre Halloween party any less heartwarming.`
`......Onii‐chan said it himself.`
`That Halloween party may have been an illusion.`
`However...`
`{n}He was trying to use that party to tell me something.........`
`........................`
`"About that second wave......"`
`"My master has appointed me to be their commander.`
` ......Leave it to me, Ange‐san.`
` My master isn't so malicious that she'd make you dirty your own hands."`
`".............................."`
`Yes, that might be kind of her.`
`.........These are...my lingering attachments we're talking about.`
`I should be grateful to {f:5:Bernkastel}.`
`If she really were cruel,`
` she would probably have ordered me to take charge of the second wave and execute my own family.`
`"Comrade Ange.`
` You are a Witch of Truth, aren't you?"`
`".....................`
` ......That's right.`
` ......Probably."`
`"Then let's accept the truth, okay?`
` Finally, after twelve years, the Single Truth lies before you."`
`".....................`
` ......I'll just sit around here until {f:5:Bernkastel} finishes breaking the seal."`
`"You'll probably be summoned as a guest for the party.`
` ......We've got a mirror, so maybe you should wipe the sleep from your eyes."`
`"And maybe you should shave before heading out to battle."`
`It floated in the empty air.`
`{n}...The door to the Golden Land.`
`One or two square meters of tiled floor still remained in front of the door, scarcely enough to remind a person that this had once been Kinzo's study.`
`......By now, all of the game board except the Golden Land had been eaten away, leaving only this door floating in a sea of nothingness......`
`There were two figures in front of that door.`
`It was Battler......and Beato.`
`They may not have been literally covered with wounds, but they definitely seemed to be dead tired.`
`Battler, leaning against the door, seemed to have finally caught his breath.`
`Beato was also sitting against the door, letting her legs dangle gracelessly.`
`Could the battle against that force really be called a battle?`
`It was more like a mere pushing fight on the increasingly small bit of ground that remained.`
`......They had wanted to protect at least Kinzo's study no matter what.`
`And, the only fruit of their desperate struggle was the tiny bit of flooring that they were sitting on now.`
`Those goats fell into the abyss whenever they had nowhere to stand.`
`So now, with so much of the floor gone, there was no way for them to attack anymore.`
`If Battler thought this, his naive hopes were quickly crushed.`
`".........Looks like we're surrounded."`
`"So, their plan was to gather their forces and crush us in a single stroke..."`
`Stretching across the horizon surrounding the door at their backs...`
`......was an encirclement of countless large sailing ships.`
`As they could clearly see, the decks of those ships were packed with goats,`
` with some of the more foolish and overeager ones spilling over the edges into the emptiness below.`
`"Dang...`
` I've gone through a lot of crazy stuff in your games,`
` ......but being surrounded by pirate ships is definitely a first for me."`
`"......They probably do possess the strength to break through the Golden Land's perimeter.`
` Those cannons are no bluff.`
` Doubtless, they intend to use those to smash through this door and pour in."`
`Along the sides of each ship were several open gun ports, each with a cannon pointing at the door.`
`If all the ships surrounding them were joined by even more, and all of those ships fired all of their cannons at once...`
`......There was no point trying to imagine what would happen next.`
`Battler and Beato grimaced and hung their heads.`
`"......How long will the Golden Land perimeter hold out against those cannons?"`
`"I do not know.`
` ......However, since they are still awaiting reinforcements after amassing that many, ......I doubt the barrier will break that easily."`
`"True.`
` I can't think of any other reason to delay your attack without even sending terms for surrender..."`
`"I hope we can take advantage of this time they give us."`
`"......Time is always the ally of the weaker side.`
` After all, we can always hope for a miracle."`
`"Though it might also give us more time to wither in despair."`
`At that moment, something small and hard hit Battler in the forehead.`
`"......Ow!`
` The heck is this? Konpeitou candy...?!"`
`"It's me!`
` I know where Bern and the others are!"`
`The konpeitou candy was {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s transformed body.`
`She was the only one of their allies capable of crossing the sea of fragments.`
`"Spectacular!`
` That's the great Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} for you!"`
`"They'll be able to see us here.`
` Let's talk inside.`
` ......It's getting crazy out there."`
`"Got it.`
` ......Is anyone there?!"`
`"When Battler knocked on the door, it opened, and Shannon and Kanon came into view.`
`"You called for us?"`
`"My apologies, but we need you two to keep a lookout."`
`"Leave it to us."`
`"......When they begin their attack, don't worry about fighting them.`
` Escape to the Golden Land as soon as they start.`
` Don't worry about closing the door."`
`"But that means......"`
`"They're planning to ignore the door and smash the Golden Land directly.`
` Making a last stand here won't do anyone any good."`
`"......I understand."`
`"We'll take care of things here, so go inside and work on a counterattack."`
`"Indeed.`
` We're counting on you."`
`Battler and Beato traded places with Shannon and Kanon, returning to the Golden Land.`
`A gentle rain poured down over the Golden Land rose garden.`
`{n}......The Golden Land's weather reflected the hearts of those inside it.`
`The quietly falling raindrops spoke for the pain felt by those who could do nothing but hide here, waiting for the enemy's final assault......`
`When they returned to the arbor, the konpeitou flew out of Battler's pocket,`
` jumped onto the table, and returned to its original form.`
`"I haven't had a thrill like this for years!`
` Hard to believe I'd get put in a tight spot like this even after becoming a witch."`
`"Let's get down to business...!`
` Just where are Ange and {f:5:Bernkastel}...?!"`
`"The City of Books."`
`"......I have heard of it.`
` ......They say it's a place where all kinds of fragments, collected by great witches who travel the sea, are recorded and stored in the form of books."`
`"Indeed, the Great Witch of Theatergoing, Drama, and Spectating's Noble City of Carefully Selected Books."`
`"So, the great Lady {f:5:Aurora} is the ruler of the City of Books.`
` Truly a suitable place for her."`
`"Nice going, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}.`
` ......Hard to believe you could pick out that spot so quickly from all the other possible hiding places."`
`"Actually, it was pretty easy.`
` ......I didn't even have to search, since they're advertising it as loud as they can.`
` They're planning a huge party where they'll unveil the secret to the cat box of the Endless Witch, the great Lady {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`".........Hmph.`
` I see, so they haven't been delaying their attack because they await reinforcements, but because the party hasn't begun yet."`
`"So, in this party, they plan to use Ange's key and reveal the contents of the Book of the Single Truth?"`
`"You've got it.`
` {f:5:Aurora} hasn't held an event like this for ages, and she's gathering VIP guests from all over the place.`
` ......The Book of the Single Truth will probably be the party's final showpiece."`
`"......So that means we still have a shot at taking Ange and the key back."`
`"Time‐wise, that may be true.`
` However, there's a really simple and obvious problem."`
`"What?"`
`"The City of Books is a sacred realm under the supervision of the Senate.`
` It's protected by a holy barrier.`
` Only a witch of the Senate can enter it."`
`"......Aren't there any invitees who aren't members of the Senate?"`
`"Yeah, there are.`
` It looks like they're being given special "invitations", which allow them to enter the sacred realm for a limited time.`
`"......Invitations."`
`"My, my, ......now this might be interesting."`
`"That's what I thought too...!`
` But it turns out there's a strict policy on punctuality, and these invitations automatically become useless unless you present them before the party begins!`
` And, I'm afraid to say the party started a short while ago."`
`"In other words, it's too late to try stealing an invitation from a guest who's running late."`
`"That's right.`
` ......So, what do we do now?!`
` Could someone get me popcorn?`
` I'd like a nice candy flavor this time!"`
`"As an outsider, I hate to barge into the conversation, ......but we seem to have no options left."`
`".........We're already done for, aren't we..."`
`"Can't we do anything except sit here until they attack?!`
` There must be something we can do...!"`
`"That's right.`
` ......There is just one thing we can do."`
`".........What's that?"`
`"We can keep on strugglin' for each second of survival...and hope for a miracle."`
`"A miracle...?!"`
`"So, we're stuck defending the Alamo."`
`"We cannot surrender.`
` ......Our only option is to hold out as long as we can, waiting for a miracle."`
`"......Uryuu.`
` What kind of miracle?"`
`"Ange could change her mind...for some reason.`
` ......There is a chance, maybe one in several million, that she comes back."`
`"......Hmph.`
` With a probability such as that, it truly would be a miracle."`
`"We are here so that we can await Ange‐san's return."`
`"Yes.`
` ......Ange‐san has nowhere to call home except where we are right now.`
` So, we must defend this place to the last minute, waiting for her to come back."`
`"Awaiting the master's return is the duty of a servant...!`
` N‐n‐n‐now that it has come to this, I, Gohda, am prepared for what may come...!"`
`".........Battler‐sama.`
` All of us are prepared."`
`"We of the Chiester Sisters Imperial Guard will fulfill our oath and remain by the great Lady {f:5:Beatrice}'s side until the bitter end!"`
`"45 here, no problems!`
` I shall fight until the end."`
`"......Finally, a fitting place to die nyeh.`
` ......No problems from 410 nyeh."`
`"The Seven Sisters of Purgatory will stay with {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama and Battler‐sama until the finish!!"`
`The six younger sisters also showed their resolve with their eyes.`
`"Eiserne Jungfrau...`
`will serve until the {f:5:end}."`
`"The former SSVD's got your back too."`
`".........And please, lend us your power as well."`
`"Me?!`
` No way.`
` Didn't I just give you some excellent intel?`
` I think I've done more than my fair share, don't you?"`
`"How do you know that Ange‐chan is in the City of Books?"`
`"I saw her with my own eyes, of course.`
` I never trust anything unless I see it for myself."`
`"Which means you're qualified to enter this sacred realm called the City of Books, right?"`
`"............Indeed.`
` The great Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} is a witch of the Senate, after all."`
`"{f:5:Lambdadelta}......"`
`"......What's with you guys?`
` .........You aren't gonna tell me to do more work, are you...?"`
`"My, what an unexpected development...!"`
`"Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} is the only one who can enter the City of Books!"`
`"And could that possibly mean...?!"`
`""That this is Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s time to shine?!!""`
`"Enough kidding around! Are you people crazy?`
` ......You're telling me to go, all by myself,`
` and sneak into there one more time,`
` and then bring Ange back out here?!"`
`The several dozen people surrounding {f:5:Lambdadelta} all nodded in unison.`
`"How stupid can you be?!`
` If I were to save Ange, that'd mean crashing the great {f:5:Aurora}'s party, get it?!`
` I'd have the whole world as my enemy!"`
`"And what's in it for me?! Nothing, obviously!`
` There's nothing you all could possibly offer me...`
`that'd be worth getting on the bad side of {f:5:Aurora} and her monster friends...!"`
`"You'll get to see a happy ending, where {f:5:Aurora} and {f:5:Bernkastel}'s schemes are crushed,`
` Ange comes back, and everyone makes peace with one another."`
`"......What do you say, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}?`
` There could be no greater thrill.`
` ......If you pulled off such a marvelous feat, you would be able to forget your illness for a thousand years, would you not?"`
`"We're begging you, {f:5:Lambdadelta}...!!`
` Lend us your power!!"`
`Please, please, we're begging you!`
` Help us save Ange...!`
` Everyone clamored for {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s help.`
`They surrounded her and begged for her assistance.`
`"Please, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}...!!`
` Only you can do this...!!"`
`"Give us your strength!!`
` I'll show you the greatest of tales!!`
` You'll get to see it from the front row!!`
` So please, lend us your strength!!"`
`"Shut uuu{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}up!!`
` Shut the hell uu{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}u{-}up!!!"`
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} leapt to her feet and crushed the cup of popcorn in her hands.`
`Sweet, candy‐flavored popcorn flew everywhere and pieces stuck to everyone's face.`
`It may have been a hilarious sight.`
`......However, no one laughed.`
`{f:5:Lambdadelta}'s face was filled with a rage that none of them had seen before.`
`"Could you please stop getting the wrong idea?!`
` I'm a spectator! A spectator!!`
` I'm just a guest who was invited by Beato to come and watch this game!"`
`"So, why I am supposed to risk my life for you people?!`
` You think you'll get a happy ending if Ange comes back?!`
` Are you really that stupid?!`
` Bern and her forces will come sweeping through here, mad with rage, and wipe us all out!"`
`"There's only one reason I'm here,`
` and that's because Lion over there said I'd get to watch an interesting show!!"`
`"Yeah, and now I'm sure I'll get to see a sublimely interesting tale very soon...!`
` A sad, sad tragedy as you fight desperately against Bern's forces and get wiped out one by one!`
` Oh, I'm sure you'll each get one last time to shine as you're torn apart!"`
`"If I just wait a little, I'll get to see all that, won't I?`
` Pretty soon, all of you'll be dead!!`
` But not me!`
` I'm a spectator, a guest!!`
` There's absolutely no reason why I should agree to die with you!!!"`
`.........No one was able to say a word.`
`In the still silence, with no sound except that of the rain, ......even {f:5:Lambdadelta} finally hung her head in dismay.`
`".........Sorry.`
` I'm totally lame, aren't I?`
` ......Yeah, if I stood up right now and said "leave it to me", my popularity would surge and I'd probably make it into the top three in the next character popularity contest."`
`"............But still,`
` ......unlike the rest of you, ......I'm not "one of this story's characters".`
` ......I can't die.`
` ......It's like it's midnight, and you're telling me that we're almost at the best part.`
` But tomorrow's Monday, and I've got early cleaning duty at school...!`
` We live in completely different worlds...!!`
` That's why...... You can't, like......`
` ........................haaaah..............."`
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} staggered as though dizzy, ......then plopped down into a chair.`
`Then, she became expressionless like a doll, just staring at a single point in space, silently......`
`".........Sorry."`
`Battler softly apologized.`
`{n}However, {f:5:Lambdadelta} remained expressionless.`
`"......There's still more we can do on our own.`
` So it's not fair to put pressure on you alone to risk something."`
`"...................................."`
`"We'll fight here and defend this spot until the last moment.`
` .........We'll believe in the miracle of Ange choosing us over the Single Truth.`
` ......If we aren't prepared to do that, we're in no position to ask you to give up your life alongside us."`
`Battler rose from his seat and spun around.`
`"......Battler..."`
`"I'll switch places with the pair outside.`
` ......When they come, I want to be in the front lines.`
` That's the fastest and most direct way I can show {f:5:Lambdadelta} my determination."`
`"................................."`
`"I shall go as well.`
` Master, please find Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} some more popcorn."`
`"......Beato..."`
`"I know Ange will return.`
` If we don't believe, even a possible miracle will not bear fruit.`
` You can't win a lottery unless you buy a ticket."`
`Beato also stood up and followed Battler.`
`"......Everyone,`
` let's do what we can to prepare for the fight."`
`"I agree.`
` Nothing stupider than just sitting around here...!"`
`"Good point.`
` If we're reaching the end, let's put on a good show."`
`".........We've got to make sure there's a place Ange‐chan can call home."`
`"And we should hold a strategic {f:5:conference}."`
`"Yeah.`
` We have furniture, weapons, demons, and Inquisitors.`
` Must be some way for these mismatched forces to cooperate."`
`"Let's go, little sisters.`
` Break time is over."`
`"Chiester Troops, rise."`
`The {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s and the fantasy creatures all rose to their feet and left the arbor.`
`Afterwards, only {f:5:Lambdadelta} remained, still staring blankly at a point in empty space......`
`"That black tea smells nice.`
` Is it instant? Or from a tea bag?"`
`"......Oh, would you like some too, comrade {f:5:Eva}?`
` We have no more cups, so you'll have to use a funnel."`
`A gold butterfly drifted onto the balcony and turned into {f:5:Eva}.`
`"How's {f:5:Bernkastel} doing?`
` Will it be a while longer before she breaks the seal on the Book of the Single Truth...?"`
`"That's what I came to talk about.`
` She says the seal has been broken."`
`".............................."`
`"Congratulations. So, the time has finally come.`
` ......The period to mark the end of your life."`
`"Take the key and go to Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}.`
` ......One of her cat familiars will guide you."`
`Two emerald sparkles flew in.`
`{n}They were the green, glinting eyes of a black cat.`
`The cat flicked its tail elegantly, with the dignity of a high‐class attendant.`
`"......Got it.`
` Then, I'll be back in a bit."`
`Ange rose from her seat.`
`She did it casually, as though she really was just heading out for a short trip.`
`However, her lips would never touch her half‐finished cup of tea again...`
`"We weren't together long, but I enjoyed it.`
` It was a very enlightening experience, to learn what disgust for your own kind feels like."`
`"Same here.`
` ......Next time we meet, you'll have to teach me the trick to making tea this terrible."`
`"......Are you happy?`
` Now, you'll finally get to learn that secret I've been hiding from you these past twelve years."`
`"I am happy.`
` ......Yeah, now I can understand how Erika feels.`
` ......It feels like I've taken a shot back at you, exposing the secret that you kept until your death."`
`"And is that a good feeling?"`
`".........Well, it's better than nothing."`
`Ange nodded towards the black cat to let it know that she was ready.`
`The cat nodded back in a refined manner, indicated that it wanted Ange to follow, and leapt from the balcony.`
`Without turning back, Ange followed it, jumping out into the air as though swimming...`
`{f:5:Eva} watched her go.`
`An expression of ridicule and scorn...was not the one that crossed her face...`
`"Good luck, Ange.`
` .........This is the path you've chosen.`
` ......You aren't six years old anymore.`
` You're eighteen.`
` ......Choose how to live your own life."`
`"...............What an overprotective aunt you are."`
`"I'm going to watch the ceremony.`
` What about you?"`
`"It's almost time to begin the attack, so I'm heading for the ships.`
` ......I've got to go pick up Beato's corpse.`
` The guts will go to the party.`
` I get to keep her skin, so let's stuff and mount it."`
`"So, this is the end to the mysterious tale of Rokkenjima."`
`".........Which means that it's also the end for you. I mean, you are a piece from there, right?"`
`"A piece is all I am.`
` The role of a piece is to remain faithful to its role until the game ends.`
` ......It's not a piece's place to worry about what happens after the game is over."`
`"True.`
` ......And it's the same for me.`
` .........Let's both enjoy this time while we have it.`
` Well then, allow me to take my leave."`
`"Later. Good luck with your work."`
`After exchanging elegant bows, the two witches vanished at the same time.`
`Nothing remained except some half‐finished tea cups and the aroma of the tea itself......`
`One after another, luxury cars stopped in front of a high‐class hotel in the city, and guests began to step out of them.`
`"Hey, Professor Ootsuki...!"`
`"Oh, what a surprise!`
` I haven't seen you since the last convention!"`
`All of the guests gathered here were very rich and cultured.`
`A single hobby tied all of them together.`
`They were the Witch Hunters.`
`Like‐minded people who enjoyed exploring various interpretations of the Rokkenjima mystery.`
`"Still, I wonder if it's really true.`
` It's hard to believe that Ushiromiya Eva's diary actually exists...!"`
`"It really is. I had heard rumors of it myself.`
` A secret diary said to have been hidden away by Ushiromiya Eva just before her death...!`
` Rumor has it that she wrote the details of Rokkenjima's truth in there.`
` It reminds me of that fable of the king with the donkey's ears.`
` Humans truly are tragic creatures, incapable of keeping quiet about a secret even if no one else could possibly learn of it."`
`"Waha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha.`
` From what I've heard, a collector from Dubai offered to buy it for ten million dollars...!"`
`"Incredible...!`
` More evidence of the fascination that the Rokkenjima mystery is capable of stirring!"`
`Conversations like this were breaking out passionately all over the place.`
`Furthermore, the guests weren't the only ones pouring in.`
`{n}The press was also there in force.`
`The Rokkenjima mystery had created such a large movement that, at one time, it became a social phenomenon.`
`Though that had died down slightly in recent years, it was still a topic fiercely debated across the internet.`
`It was hardly any surprise that the discovery and imminent release of Ushiromiya Eva's diary, which contained the truth of that mystery, had caused an uproar.`
`And on top of all that, the mysterious Forger Itouikukuro was to appear publicly for the first time.`
` In fact, it seemed that Itouikukuro and Hachijo Tohya, the up‐and‐coming mystery novelist, were the same person.`
`Of course, this meant that Hachijo Tohya would also be appearing in public for the first time.`
`The fact that she was actually an enigmatic female author, despite having been thought to be male, would have been enough to cause a stir on its own.`
`Before the diary unveiling party, a press conference was held in one of the rooms of the hotel.`
`"......Indeed.`
` I am Hachijo Tohya."`
`"We now know that in your previous book signings, you went to the lengths of using a double to avoid appearing in public.`
` What has caused you to change your mind and appear before us this time...?!"`
`"The legend of the Rokkenjima witch has given birth to endless tales.`
` ......Considering the weight of such a legend's demise,`
` and being the mere writer that I am, I felt obligated to show myself as a sign of respect."`
`"As a Forger, you announced on the web that you had reached the truth!`
` Does that mean you have already read the contents of that diary?!"`
`".........And, very soon, those contents will be revealed to everyone."`
`"Pardon me for asking,`
` but is there solid proof that the contents of this diary are the truth?`
` It seems that some are claiming it to be no more than the personal account of a single deceased person."`
`"That is not the case.`
` I guarantee it.`
` {p:1:The truth is written in this diary}."`
`A stir passed through the crowd, and the room was suddenly filled with camera flashes.`
`"This ends Hachijo's interview...!`
` Allow us to express our deep gratitude to all members of the press for coming today!`
` And now we would like to move on and allow you to take photos of Madam Ushiromiya Eva's diary."`
`A hotel worker pushed forward a cart covered by a veil.`
`Then, after looking to Hachijo for approval, he removed the veil.`
`There lay.........Ushiromiya Eva's diary.`
`{n}The Book of the Single Truth sat there, waiting for its seal to be broken.`
`Hachijo held it to her chest and laughed enigmatically.`
`Camera flashes came from everywhere, making the Book of the Single Truth glint......`
`"And that is all for now!`
` If you would all please move to the assembly hall...!"`
`Still holding the diary, Hachijo left the press conference room, escorted by men from the hotel.`
`Until she went through a door that said "No Entry Unless Authorized",`
` the journalists continued to surround her and ask questions, hoping to gather just one more comment.`
`When the door slammed shut, .........the world twisted.`
`The hotel employees became black cats wearing capes.`
`Hachijo had turned into {f:5:Featherine}...`
`"Things are getting pretty crazy out there.`
` ......Did you enjoy it?"`
`"......It was tiring.`
` ......Though not a bad experience.`
` I must say, though, this diary truly is heavy."`
`{f:5:Featherine} tossed the diary, and {f:5:Bernkastel} caught it.`
`"I will rest in one of the waiting rooms."`
`"You're up again pretty soon.`
` There's no time to rest."`
`"......In that case, call it a short break so that I can properly enjoy this long‐awaited excitement."`
`"I need to borrow that book.`
` I promised Ange that I'd show her first."`
`"I see.`
` In that case, do as you please."`
`{f:5:Featherine} left, followed by her cat attendants.`
`After watching her until she was out of sight, {f:5:Bernkastel} disappeared as well.`
`Like Erika's room, {f:5:Bernkastel}'s was a balcony without a handrail, dug out of a bookshelf cliff.`
`Ange had been kept waiting for some time, but she had waited patiently, looking down at the world below her...`
`{a:c:`
`"......I'm late, aren't I?`
` Sorry about that."}`
`After {f:5:Bernkastel} appeared, the black cats gave a bow and vanished.`
`"Here you go.`
` I've brought it with me.`
` The Book of the Single Truth."`
`".....................`
` ......Can I touch it...?"`
`"Do as you like."`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} set it on the table and beckoned Ange forward.`
`Slowly, ......Ange approached it.`
`"So, ......this is Aunt Eva's diary......"`
`"That's right.`
` ......Inside it, you'll find the Single Truth that you wanted.`
` ......You do have the key, right?"`
`"Yes.`
` Right here."`
`Ange took the key out, looked at it there on her palm, then gripped it tightly.`
`Even that heavy lock that held the diary so securely...was fated to be swept aside easily as soon as Ange readied herself...`
`"I won't rush you.`
` You don't have to open it until you're ready."`
`"......In here, there's the truth of what happened on October 4th and 5th, 1986, right?"`
`"...............Yes.`
` Everything that you offered up your life in the hope of learning is there."`
`In that instant, inside of Ange, two Anges appeared, taking control of her body at the same time.`
`On the one hand, she knew that she had already paid a great price to learn the truth.`
`This part of her gripped the key, wanting to act quickly to prevent the moment of hesitation that might lead her to refuse to learn the truth now,`
` at the final moment, with the Book of the Single Truth right before her.`
`On the other hand,`
` ......a feeling that she was betraying the brother and family that watched over her warmly made her bite her lower lip.`
`However, though she shook, she could do nothing but watch as her right hand slowly brought the key towards the lock.`
`"................................."`
`"......................................."`
`What am I hesitating for...?`
`Inside this diary, there's the final destination of my sad, painful, twelve‐year‐long journey.`
`Was twelve years not enough of that? Do I want to keep living that way...?`
`That Onii‐chan, and all those others—those are all illusions created by my heart.`
` ......My naive hope that a miracle might still occur.`
`If I put my two options on a scale, then the path I should choose is clear.`
`Slowly, ......I pushed the key into the lock.........and twisted...`
`The lock opened with a click, ......and at the same time, it felt as though a crack ran through the key in my hands.`
`Maybe a part of its intricate design had broken off.`
`{n}I couldn't tell where it had broken just by glancing at it.`
`However, for some reason, its golden glint seemed dulled somehow.`
`"......It's because you've made your choice with that key.`
` A bit of magic has disappeared."`
`"What kind of magic?"`
`"Didn't Battler tell you?`
` He said you couldn't hand that over to anyone else.`
` ......That magic, which "left the decision to you", has just fulfilled its role and disappeared.`
` That key is just a key now.`
` It can't do anything but lock and unlock that diary."`
`".........I see.`
` Then, I guess I have no more use for Onii‐chan's key."`
`"Can I have it?`
` Once you've read the diary, I'll lock it up again.`
` Opening that lock will be a big part of tonight's ceremony, it seems."`
`"......I see.`
` Do whatever you want."`
`I don't give a damn what happens after I find the truth.`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} slid the key from where it lay on the table and put it into her pocket.`
`"Go ahead, then.`
` .........Before the courage that led you here fades."`
`"................................."`
`I lifted up Aunt Eva's now unlocked diary.`
`The lock was open.`
` Even the hinge had been released by now.`
`......There was no longer anything standing in the way of me opening to the pages within...`
`I thought of taking a deep breath.`
` However, I decided against it.`
`......I prepared myself for this long ago.`
`So stupid to fuel my reluctance further.`
`I opened it.`
` Violently, ruthlessly.`
`I knew...that this was the right way to open to the truth that awaited me inside.`
`As soon as the cover was opened, ......a brilliant light poured out, and my mind went hazy.`
`The truth was sent to my mind directly, without letters or words......`
`Tell me......what happened that day............on Rokkenjima......`
`My consciousness......returned gradually.`
`Nothing was written in the open book before me.`
`Of course.`
` This was......my own blank and empty notebook.`
`I was at school, just sitting idly with my notebook open.`
`The world had stopped.`
`The hands on the clock had stopped too.`
`In that case, the auditorium should have been filled with silence.`
`However, I could hear a small commotion.`
`In this world of suspended time, ......I could see dark shapes sneaking about behind the unmoving students.`
`They were.........students with goat heads.`
`They were sneaking glances at me from behind the frozen students, whispering something to each other.`
`I know.`
` I can hear them.`
`Everybody...everybody knows.`
`One after another, students with goat heads slipped out from every conceivable hiding place.`
`They slipped around all the students stopped in time...and gathered around me.`
`Then, they all jeered out things in an endless stream, and, possibly aware that I could hear, showered me with giggles and sneers and comments amongst themselves.`
`However, nothing that came from the goats' mouths reached my ears as words.`
`This was a world without letters or words, ......so no words reached me.`
`However, their emotions and meanings did reach me.`
`So, I knew what it was they were saying.`
`And then, when I was able to visualize it, .........this happened...`
`One after another, the goats opened their massive jaws, showing their fangs that dripped with saliva,`
` ......and came forward to bite me.`
`Time was stopped for me.`
`{n}I was aware, but I could not move.`
`......Literally, that wasn't true.`
`However, I was pretending that I couldn't hear, ......so I couldn't move.`
`The goats bit me all over my body, leaving their fang marks, licking me.`
`Maybe they didn't like the taste of my clothes.`
`Taking advantage of the fact that I couldn't move, ......they chewed through my clothes one by one.`
`Over and over again, ......the goats stuck their tongues, their jaws, their fangs into my naked body.`
`I was covered with drool and bitten all over.`
`Bright red teeth marks were left behind as sharp fangs pierced my skin, leaving trails of blood.`
`They licked up that blood like real goats, ......hurting and humiliating me.`
`As I hung my head, one of the goats pulled on my hair, forcing me to look up, and spoke.`
`This time, it wasn't conceptual, but words I could hear.`
`However, they weren't words of the human world.`
` They were a witch's words.`
`The red truth, which signifies absolute truth.`
`‘This is...{p:1:the truth of the Rokkenjima incident}!!’`
`"............I won't accept it."`
`‘It doesn't matter if you accept it or not!!`
` This is the truth!!`
` {p:1:After all, *********, ******************!!`
` *********************************}!!!’`
`"......I won't accept it, I won't! ......I'll never accept a truth like that, ......never......"`
`‘{p:1:Whether you accept it or not, that doesn't change the truth!!`
` After all, this is the Single Truth, proven in re{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}eddd}!!’`
`*giggle*giggle, ......heh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eh{0}eheh, hah{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha...!!`
`Who cares about the truth, so stupid, so pointless...!`
`{n}I'm the one who gets to decide if that's the truth or not, right?`
`Even if it's red truth, I won't acknowledge it, won't permit it, and I definitely won't accept it...!!`
`"The red truth is absolute?!`
` Who is it absolute for?!`
` It's absolute for you guys, right?`
` It's not absolute for me!!`
` I won't let you contaminate my truth with yours!!"`
`".........Ange, calm down.`
` You're the one who wanted to know, right?"`
`"Hahahaha, ah{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!`
` My truth is that Aunt Eva's the culprit!!`
` Aunt Eva killed everyone!!`
` Everything's her fault!!`
` Dad and Mom and Onii‐chan and all the others are just victims...!!`
` It's no one's fault, no one's fault...!!`
` How could it be? How could it be?!"`
`― Your aunt will always be on your side, Ange‐chan.`
`"Hahahaha, ah{0}hah{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!`
` Yeah, I get it now, I know what you meant!`

` That's right, Aunt Eva, you're the culprit, you're the culprit!!`
` It's the world that's messed up and broken for not realizing that...!!`
` I'm the right one, I'll deny the red truth, deny the whole world...!!!"`
`".........Oh?`
` ......In that case, try writing a red truth that only you can write.`
` ......But how is it possible for a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} to write with red truth?"`
`"It is possible!!`
` There's a red ink that only {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s can write with!!"`
`Ange‐san, please calm down.`
`"I'm the right one!! The world's wrong!!`
` I'll write it!!`
` I'll write the truth with the real red truth!!`
` Haha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hah, aha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!"`
`20, requesting urgent support on the roof!!`
`Ange‐san!!`
` Wait!!`
` Don't be hasty, look ooo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}ouuuut!!!`
`"<Goodbye, Ange. Have a nice day.>"`
`"I'll write it out! This is my blood‐red truth!!`
` I'll never accept the truth of your woo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}orld!!!"`
`Ange's body went past the edge of the balcony.`
`The air, which she had once been able to swim through, was now completely merciless for some reason.`
`Ange's body......plunged straight into the darkness below.`
`"................................."`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} just watched the scene play out in silence......`
`Behind her, men in black suits rushed up to the fence, clutching it and screaming...`
`"T‐......this is 20......!`
` ......A‐......Ange‐san......j‐jumped off...!"`
`"Damn, ......I can't see her from here..."`
`"Q‐quickly, investigate the ground area...!!`
` It's no use, there's no way...!!"`
`"M‐...maybe she was caught by that safety net...!`
` L‐let's make sure...!"`
`What fools.`
`If you jumped straight down from this height, ......do you really think such a flimsy safety net could possibly save you......?`
`"As the Witch of Miracles, I, {f:5:Bernkastel}, guarantee that such a miracle certainly won't occur.`
` .........*giggle*giggle*giggle*, ......hah{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haa{0}ha{0}haha!!"`
`Ange's body......fell from the skyscraper‐like bookshelf and slammed against the floor of the City of Books.`
`Looking down from {f:5:Bernkastel}'s balcony, which was as high as a skyscraper's roof,`
` ......could it have looked like a lovely, red pressed flower?`
`It couldn't have looked like anything.`
`In the same way that the death of a single lonely girl who rejected the world and died alone......wouldn't leave an impression on any of the world's people.`
`She probably died instantly.`
`It was only natural.`
` She had fallen straight down from such a height, after all.`
`......Is it even conceivable that she wouldn't die instantly after something like that?`
`The index finger on the right hand of her corpse was stuck out as though it had traced something.`
`Could it be that, by some impossible miracle, she really had escaped an instant death?`
`And in her final moments, ......using the ink of the red blood draining from her, could she possibly have written her own personal red truth?`
`However, no one would ever be able to tell what she had written.`
`After all, ......the red blood pouring from her corpse had run over it all.`
`"............Even this...was your decision,`
` .........Ange."`
`{f:5:Eva} was looking down at the beautiful flower of blood radiating from Ange's corpse.`
`"......I tried to give you a chance to live.`
` ......But you never truly made an effort to live in the future that began after the age of six.`
` .........And so, after twelve years, you've finally returned to where you started."`
`The eyes on Ange's corpse...were closed.`
`......However, there was no way of knowing if this was a peaceful thing.`
`Slowly, the corpse began to break down.`
`By the end, it had become a messy lump of flesh, with only a few parts recognizable as human.`
`......It was hardly surprising.`
`How else would she look after falling from that height......and slamming against the asphalt?`
`"You managed to die.`
` ......However,`
` this doesn't mean that everyone will be waiting for you in heaven.`
` ......After all, you reached this place by rejecting all of those in heaven.`
` .........<See you in hell>.`
` No, that's probably where we are right now.`
` .........So long, Ange."`
`"Ah, {f:5:Eva}.`
` Perfect timing."`
`"Did you call for me, my master?"`
`"Dispose of this scrap meat for me, if you wouldn't mind.`
` I'm going to put this back."`
`In {f:5:Bernkastel}'s hands was the key, which had lost its magic when Ange had made her decision, and the Book of the Single Truth, which had been locked up again.`
`"As you wish, my master."`
`After looking down one more time, {f:5:Bernkastel} vanished.`
`Once she had gone, {f:5:Eva} summoned some cat familiars and ordered them to clean up.`
`The black cats gathered Ange's flesh and scattered limbs and threw them into a tin bucket.`
`.........Even in this miserable form...`
`{n}Ange's soul......was still living.`
`Perhaps "living" is a poor description.`
`She...was unable to die.`
` From now on, forever.`
`She would drift along in the deepest depths of oblivion, covered by the dust of oblivion, until she finally......disappeared.`
`She continued to question herself.`
`What did the truth mean to her?`
`{n}What was right, and where was the place she could call home......?`
`As her flesh began to cool, even the energy to ask these questions...began to fade...`
`Eventually, ......she would forget her everyday memories, and even the reason why she was suffering.`
`However, there was one thing she would never be able to forget.`
`That was...the anguish.`
`From this point forth, ......she would suffer endlessly without even knowing why.`
`By the time the cats finished flinging her corpse into the bucket and dumping it into the sea of nothingness,`
` ............Ange had forgotten even her own name.........`
`.........What's this sound I keep hearing?`
`Yes, it must be............the sound of rain...`
`In that case, what are those two bright lights coming towards me?`
`......I don't know.`
`However, they came at me with a screeching sound...and stopped right in front of me.`
`A blaring noise came at me over and over.`
`Whatever's shining those bright lights...is threatening me.`
`{n}It's probably telling me to get out of the way.`
`However, I was incapable of moving even a finger......`
`There was a sound......of a car door opening.`
`Car.`
` ......Door.`
`Apparently, I was lying on asphalt under the pouring rain.``I saw a figure, apparently the driver, open an umbrella and come towards me...`
`".........Is this your garden?"`
`The figure questioned me.`
`{n}Of course, I couldn't answer it...`
`"......If it is, then I must apologize.`
` Yes, on a day with such fine weather, anyone would want to take a nap in such a lovely garden as this.`
` ......And yet, unless my memory fails me..."`
`The figure crouched down and looked into my face.`
` .........It was a woman.`
`"This is a public highway you're sleeping on.`
` Do you want to become roadkill?`
` ......Or maybe you already are roadkill.`
` Well now, which one is it?"`
`I......clenched my chest.`
`I felt I needed to answer somehow and establish communication.`
`So, after a lot of effort, ......I managed to let a short groan escape my lips.`
`"......I see.`
` So you aren't roadkill yet."`
`And that.........was how I met Ikuko.`
`"......The body is in a very frail condition.`
` Also, it is probable that there will be memory defects.`
` We won't know for sure until the CT scan, but brain damage is also a possibility."`
`"It's lucky that damage is all we have to deal with.`
` Spend much longer in a spot like that, and things would likely have been much worse."`
`"......True.`
` In any event, I recommend getting this checked at a large hospital."`
`"Thank you, Doctor.`
` .........Please keep this off the record.`
` It may not be much, but here's some money for your troubles."`
`"I see no reason to speak of this needlessly, but...`
` ......No, no, I couldn't possibly accept that much..."`
`In the end, the doctor took the money and swore to keep quiet about the matter.`
`Eventually, Hachijo returned.`
`"Oh, you've been awake.`
` How do you feel...?"`
`I nodded weakly, letting her know that it wasn't so bad for now.`
`......But...where is this place?`
`{n}A room I have absolutely no memory of, ......in a house I don't remember at all.`
`{n}And, first and foremost, here's a woman that I've never seen......`
`"To start off, let me introduce myself.`
` I'm Hachijo Ikuko.`
` I don't mind if you address me in a friendly manner as Ikuko, or if you prefer to call me Hachijo‐san and keep things more formal."`
`......Hachijo.........Ikuko.`
`"The Hachijo family owns a lot of land and is well known in these parts.`
` ......Unlike my accomplished brothers, I'm what you might call a little eccentric.`
` After I got into a bit too much mischief than was good for me, my parents finally ran out of patience and kicked me out.`
` I'm now confined to this house."`
`"......As a hobby, I like to read detective novels...and also to write them.`
` My age...is a single woman's secret.`
` My heart is that of a girl, but I'm approaching the point where calling myself one would be increasingly absurd.`
` Heheheheh."`
`With the haze my mind was in, it was extremely hard to make out what she was talking about.`
`However, ......I was able to pick up on the fact...that she was trying to talk to me cheerfully.`
`"......So, what's your name?"`
`..................My......name......`
`..............................`
`Logically, I know that, being a human, I must have a name.`
`And, I do have the feeling that I did indeed have a name.`
`......However, no matter how hard I tried to remember what it was, it just made my head hurt...`
`"Is there anything you can remember besides your name...?"`
`".........................................."`
`Who......am I......?`
`My head...`
`...no, even my heart was a mess of torn flesh,`
` ......and I couldn't remember a thing, ......not even who or what I was...`
`But I must remember.`
`I had some kind of purpose......or maybe a mission.`
`In order to remember that, .........I first have to remember who I am.`
`Who am I......?`
` What is my name......?`
` Where was I born......and what was my birthday......?`
`I need to remember something, anything............`
`.......................................`
`"...............Age......"`
`"Age?`
` *giggle*.`
` That's my little secret."`
`".........Eighteen..."`
`"I look like I'm eighteen...?!"`
`"......I'm............eighteen............"`
`"O‐oh, so that was your age...!`
` Well now, I thought you were being a bit too flattering.`
` Hahahaha."`
`When I asked myself how old I was, the number "eighteen" floated into my mind.`
`To be honest, I didn't really feel eighteen.`
`......My mind felt much younger than that, ......and my pathetic body felt much older.`
`"I see.`
` So you're eighteen.`
` And that's all you can remember."`
`I nodded weakly.`
`I never knew that knowing nothing about yourself could make you feel so powerless.`
`"In that case, until you remember your name,`
` let's give you the name "Tohya", written with the characters for "eighteen".`
` ......Hachijo Tohya.`
` What do you think?`
` Yeah, that sounds pretty cool.`
` Yes, I must say I've impressed myself very much with that one."`
`Hachijo......Ikuko gave a satisfied laugh.`
`From then on, I took the name Hachijo Tohya.`
`My inability to move my body was apparently due to a traffic accident.`
`On that day, I had been hit by a car, and Ikuko had picked me up from where I lay on the street.`
`If she hadn't hit the brakes...`
`She probably would've driven straight onwards, thinking she'd run over a dead dog or something.`
`......Later on, I—perhaps rudely—suspected that the one who hit me might have been Ikuko herself,`
` but when I saw her completely undamaged front bumper, I gave up on that theory.`
`Hachijo Ikuko lived in a small but lovely mansion on the top of a small hill, in a village with a view of the sea.`
`She also owned the hill behind her and was more than capable of enjoying the four seasons in privacy.`
`As time passed slowly, my rehabilitation continued, and my ability to move improved little by little.`
`However, ......it seemed I really had suffered some form of brain damage.`
`Finding out who I was.........looked like it would be a very difficult task.`
`In the beginning, when I couldn't bear not knowing my identity, my head often hurt so much it felt as though it would explode.`
`......However, as I slowly accepted the fact that I was a new person, with the new name of Hachijo Tohya,`
` ......the headaches became less frequent.`
`The whole time, ......no memories returned to me except the fact that I had been eighteen.`
`However, I was unable to remember any more, unable even to be sure that eighteen was my true age,`
` ......and eventually, I stopped trying to remember my former self.`
`"Good morning, Tohya.`
` That was quite the storm last night. Were you able to sleep well?"`
`".........I had some trouble falling asleep.`
` So, I decided to read your manuscript."`
`"My, my.`
` How far did you manage to get?"`
`"I finished it."`
`"......Now there's a surprise.`
` You managed to read through all that in a single night?"`
`"I was surprised too.`
` ......Once I got into it, I'd finished before I knew it.`
` ......It was like I was just skimming it, ......or maybe like I was reading each page in a glance......"`
`"It sounds like you have some talent at speed reading.`
` ......So, how was it?`
` What did you think of it?"`
`"I liked it a lot.`
` Still, if you don't explain that part about the ocean currents a bit more clearly, it might be a little unfair for the reader...`
` Oh, but I thought it was great that you had the foreshadowing with the ring right there at the beginning."`
`".........After I finished, I had to go back to the beginning and slap myself for being so easily tricked.`
` I think that feeling's the best part of a detective novel."`
`"...................................."`
`"......Um, ......did I say something to offend you?`
` ......If I did, I apologize."`
`"Of course not! Why are you apologizing...?!`
` I'm just shocked, that's all.`
` The pertinence of your remarks is commendable...`
` It seems you must also have some talent as a critic or a detective novel writer."`
`...............A detective novel...writer.`
` ......A critic.`
`{n}........................`
`From across the fog of oblivion...`
`...I seem to remember myself fighting and arguing about......mysteries, ......or something like that.`
`That way of fighting, which I must have learned in the past.........sent a surge of excitement through me.`
`......Mystery.`
` ......Fighting......`
` My head......hurt.........`
`I accepted a painkiller and swallowed it with fresh water brought up from the well.`
`Who am I......really.........?`
`......But no matter how much I thought, I couldn't remember.`
`I was told that the frequency of my headaches could be lessened by brain surgery, but also that there was no guarantee that it would do my memory any good.`
`Ikuko said that she would let me have surgery if I wanted it.`
`However, I refused.`
`Even if I can't remember it, ......the real me is still there, sleeping inside my head.`
`I was scared......that the surgery might harm that "me" somehow.`
`By now, I've gotten used to dealing with headaches.`
`......As long as I don't force myself to remember the past, the headaches don't torment me every day.`
`So, ......bit by bit, I became free of the headaches...and got used to my new life as Hachijo Tohya......`
`Gradually, my interest shifted from myself to Ikuko.`
`Hachijo Ikuko.`
`A very strange woman.`
`First off, she was apparently the daughter of a very well‐off family, just as she had said.`
`However, she was considerably eccentric,`
` and the "various mischievous incidents" she spoke of had apparently gotten her within an inch of being disowned.`
`As a result, she had been given this house, and had been ordered to live here quietly and alone.`
`She had never been a particularly social person, so she happily accepted this new state of affairs,`
` living however she pleased with servants to take care of her.`
`She had no friends.`
` No one ever came to visit.`
`Besides me, the only one she ever talked to was Bern, an old black cat she kept as a pet.`
`I didn't know her real age.`
`She didn't seem to be too old to marry yet, but she wasn't likely to meet anyone new leading an isolated life like this.`
`Despite her insistence that she just hadn't met anyone worth the trouble, I felt as though she'd already given up on marriage.`
`Her everyday life changed very little.`
`She would either read through the many detective novels that were brought to her, or else write detective novels herself.`
`At first, I thought she was some novelist at a private retreat, plugging away at a new book.`
`However, the manuscripts she finished just ended up clipped together in a pile.`
`With me as the sole exception, it didn't look like she gave them to anyone else to read.`
`A novelist is someone who writes novels for other people to read.`
`So, I figured you could hardly call her a novelist when she kept writing novels no one would ever read.`
`"......Ikuko‐san, why don't you ever show these to anyone?"`
`"I show them to you.`
` Only the better ones, of course."`
`"Haven't you ever thought of sending one to some publishing company?`
` ......It's a shame for things to be this way, when your works are so interesting."`
`"My works can't stand up against the pros.`
` I sent one in once, but it was absolutely no good.`
` I understand my position.`
` This is just an amateur's pastime."`
`"I don't think "amateur" is a fitting word for someone who's so well‐versed in detective novels from all times and places across the world."`
`"Being a big eater doesn't mean you'll make a good cook.`
` Reading every detective novel you can get your hands on provides no guarantee of being a good detective novelist.`
` That's how it is.`
` That's why this is nothing more than a pastime."`
`"......Is it really fun to write novels that you won't show to anyone?"`
`"It used to be.`
` ......Once."`
`"What about now?"`
`"I like getting to hear your opinions.`
` .........At any rate, I've finished writing the chapter.`
` I'll go make some tea, so would you mind reading it again and sharing your thoughts with me?"`
`Saying this with a smile, Ikuko thrust a pile of manuscript paper at me.`
`When it comes to detective novels, reading and writing are the same.`
`{n}It's boring if you just do it by yourself.`
`You only get something really precious when you share the world with someone else.`
`........................Headache.`
`"Tohya?`
` ......Are you okay?`
` I'll go get some headache medicine."`
`"I'm fine.`
` I'm more interested in this manuscript.`
` I can't wait for the new chapter."`
`The seasons passed.`
`Together with Ikuko, in this town whose name I didn't even know,`
` I spent my days debating detective novels and talking about ideas for new plots.`
`At a glance, they may have appeared to be stale and unproductive days.`
`However, ......I found satisfaction with my new life as Hachijo Tohya.`
`"......And so, the curtain closes on the strange tale of Kurokubi Island.`
` .........The End."`
`With a dramatic flourish of her fountain pen, Ikuko signified that her manuscript was now complete.`
`"What do you think...?!`
` I tried using your plot to make Tsujiko's tragic love scene at the end a bit more moving."`
`"I think it's very good......`
` I think the last farewell is sad enough to make it moving as a story, not just a reasoning puzzle."`
`"......That's thanks to your plot.`
` ......Compared to this work, everything I've written before now is worth little more than scrap paper.`
` ......Even as I was writing it, I was excited to be the first person in the world who got to read it.`
` ......I've never felt that before."`
`"I just mentioned some ideas.`
` You're the one who turned them into such a fascinating story, Ikuko‐san."`
`Before I knew it, she had roped me in as well, and I too had dipped my toe into the world of detective novel writing.`
`......Apparently, the old me had possessed some knowledge of mysteries and detective novels and the like.`
`And my talent seemed to be of a fairly unorthodox kind.`
`I turned famous mysteries from across the world on their head, always looking to twist those ideas into something new.`
`However, a few ideas aren't enough to make a book.`
`No meal is complete if all you can do is chop up vegetables.`
`It was thanks to Ikuko's writing, a skill she had built up over many years, that my ideas were transformed into a work of fiction.`
`This first work that we had authored together, "The Strange Tale of Kurokubi Island", had brought out the best of our individual quirks,`
` ......and, though I hate to brag, it had turned into a masterpiece that we could show to anyone without shame.`
`"Hello?`
` Please bring us some champagne.`
` ......Bring a glass for yourself as well.`
` This is the best work ever created within these walls.`
` Let's celebrate."`
`Ikuko called for some champagne over the internal phone line.`
`Joined by the servant who happened to be working that day and the cat Bern, we raised our glasses high and toasted our accomplishment.`
`".........Ikuko‐san.`
` I have an idea, if you don't mind."`
`"Let's hear it.`
` There is never a wrong time for your ideas, as long as I'm not in the shower or on the can...!"`
`"Why don't we try submitting our book?`
` ......I've never read something this interesting before.`
` I'm sure lots of other people will want to read it."`
`"......You think so?`
` I tried once in the past, thinking the same thing, but the result was......"`
`"I believe in your talent, Ikuko‐san.`
` ......What about you?"`
`"Of course, I believe in your talent."`
`"Then it's decided.`
` ......To Ikuko‐san's big debut."`
`"To Tohya's big debut!"`
`We clinked our glasses once more.`
`{n}The evening wore on.........`
`We must've had way too much to drink.`
`Before I knew it, I must have passed out on the sofa.`
`There was a blanket covering me.`
` ......Ikuko‐san must've put it there.`
`The lights were out in the study, but it wasn't dark.`
`{n}The computer's monitor was glowing.`
`Outside, it had started to rain.`
`{n}......It reminded me of the day Ikuko‐san found me and took me in.`
`Because of that, ......whenever it rains, I find myself wondering who I was, ......and I usually get headaches.`
`So, I wasn't sure whether the pain was because of the rain or because I drank too much.`
`"......Ikuko‐san.`
` Turn on the lights.`
` ......Using a computer in the dark is bad for your eyes."`
`"Oh, did I wake you up?"`
`"No, I slept well.`
` Thanks to that, I feel refreshed."`
`I turned on the light and looked out through a gap in the curtains.`
`{n}......As I'd thought, it was the sort of pouring rain that always reminded me of that day.`
`"It's raining pretty hard out there.`
` The wind looks pretty strong too.`
` I hope the rain gutters don't get clogged with leaves again."`
`"......I just had them cleaned the other day, so they should be fine for a while."`
`Her answer sounded a little abstracted.`
`{n}Apparently, her attention was absorbed by the computer.`
`"You've been pretty hooked by that computer lately, Ikuko‐san.`
` Did you find an interesting article or something?"`
`".........It may be a bit juvenile, but it's still pretty interesting.`
` ......You know, that Rokkenjima incident."`
`"......Rokkenjima.........?"`
`"I told you about the Rokkenjima mystery a few days ago, remember?`
` It's been really huge on the net lately.`
` The discussions, theories, and especially the Forgeries have been quite entertaining.`
` ......The "Forgeries" are stories with the premise that further message bottles signed by Ushiromiya Maria existed and washed up on one of the nearby islands......"`
`Only too happy to share her knowledge of the subject, Ikuko continued her explanation at length.`
`......However, ......a huge bell was clanging inside my head.`
`The noise was so great that I thought my head would split open.`
`Unable to tell what was the floor and what was the ceiling, ......I crumpled and clutched at my head...`
`"Tohya......are you okay...?!"`
`"......My head.........hurts....................."`
`The Rokkenjima Explosion Accident.`
`{n}The many disquieting rumors surrounding it.`
`The scheming of the relatives after Ushiromiya Kinzo's vast wealth and the hidden gold......`
`And the truth?`
`Ushiromiya Eva, the sole survivor, said nothing.`
`Eventually, the granddaughter, Ushiromiya Ange, who escaped harm because she was absent on that day, would inherit everything......`
`Ange, ......Ange... ............Ushiromiya...Ange............`
`......I am...Ushiromiya...............`
` Ggghh......`
`No good...my head is......splitting......`
`An incomprehensible scene pierced my eyelids from the inside like a blade of light.`
`Just what......am I looking at......?`
`Who......are these people......calling to me.........but not by the name Tohya...?`
`......Who............am I.........?`
` Who are these people......?`
` What is............this memory.........?`
`Help me, Ikuko.........`
` .........Someone else's memory............is hurting me.........`
`My...head's......splitting.....................`
`{a:c:......I can hear the sorrowful sound of wind......`
`{n}And......that must be rain.`
`{n}......Who......am I, again...?`
`{n}I am......Ushiromiya......}`
`{a:c:`
`"Ange! ......Ange...!!"}`
`{a:c:`
`"Please, please say something...!!"}`
`{a:c:Voices...`
` Voices calling to me}.`
`{a:c:Dad......and Mom......}`
`{a:c:......It can't be them......}`
`{a:c:In 1986, ......on Rokkenjima,{n}......Mom and Dad......}`
`"......Ange, hang in there...!`
` Can you hear Daddy's voice...?!"`
`"Please, say something!! Ange!!"`
`......Mom, Dad......`
`{n}I'll......say it out loud......`
`.........Mom......Dad.........`
`"Ange...!!`
` Ange, thank goodness......!!"`
`I could feel my body being lifted up firmly......and hugged roughly.`
`......Mom and Dad......were hugging me......`
`My eyelids had been open for a while now.`
`{n}I could feel the light slowly returning to my eyes.`
`Just like your eyes get used to the dark, ......my eyes got used to the light, ......and bit by bit, the scene around me came into view.`
`However, it was an unusual sight, which seemed to be very far away.`
`My body......was being hugged by Mom and Dad.`
`Dad was sniffling, his face covered with tears.`
`There were tears in Mom's eyes too as she hugged me tight.`
`It was......so strong that it hurt a bit.`
`I was......the bad kid, who wasn't obedient, who always had an excuse, ......and who always tried to do the opposite of what her parents said.`
` .........That was why......they were holding me tight, .........to make sure I didn't head down the wrong path......`
`As my eyes adjusted, I could see other people besides my parents.`
`Everyone was there.`
` George onii‐chan, Jessica onee‐chan, Maria onee‐chan.`
`My uncles and aunts.`
`......Even Sakutarou.`
` ......And then, there was the witch {f:5:Virgilia}, and Ronove, and...............`
`"...............Where............"`
`"You were fortunate.`
` ......By chance, we found you drifting in the waves of the sea of emptiness.`
` ......You were in a terrible state.`
` ......It took much time to make you remember your true form."`
`".........{f:5:Beatrice}...`
` ............So, this is......"`
`"The Golden Land.`
` ......Your whole family has been waiting here for you to return."`
`"......We knew you would come home."`
`Did I.........come home because I was supposed to...?`
`......Didn't I............return to the form I was meant to have, ......and then...............`
`"No, you did come home."`
`"That's right.`
` You made it back here because you wanted to come home to us."`
`".........Dad, ......Mom...`
` .........I..............."`
`"You don't need to say anything.`
` .........You've been on a great and terrible journey, haven't you?`
` ......You took that journey all by yourself..."`
`"You understand now, don't you?`
` You won't forget again?"`
`I understand, ......Dad...`
`"......This is...a place you can always call home..."`
`"............I know..."`
`When I gave that answer, Mom and Dad hugged me again.`
`Hot tears fell onto my face.`
`They were Mom and Dad's tears......`
`"............‘All right’......might not be the best way to put it.`
` ......But I'm so glad.`
` Glad you came home."`
`"......Aunt.........Eva......"`
`"Feel free to hate me as much as you want.`
` ......But give your Mom and Dad a million kisses.`
` ......Give a kiss to everyone who cared about you so much."`
`"Aunt...... ............Eva............."`
`".........And say "I'm home" to your other mother."`
`Mom gave me a push from behind, ............and I stumbled forwards.`
`Towards my...other mother.`
`".........Eva...... ...............Mom............"`
`"......Ange‐chan..............."`
`"If only............I'd called you that on that day,`
` .........I might never have messed up......`
` ......We might have been able......to create a new world together......"`
`"It's in the past now.`
` ......You've come home.`
` .........You don't need to say anything else..."`
`"Mom......`
` ............Mom.................."`
`"Welcome home, Ange‐chan...`
` ............You're my precious daughter......"`
`"Mom......`
` ............You were always, ......to the very end, .........the one looking out for me the most............"`
`The two of them hugged each other quietly, ......burying their faces in the other's shoulders and sobbing.`
`The truth...wasn't worth anything at all.`
`In the first place, ......the truth is always in the past.`
`The point of the future isn't to learn what happened in the past.`
`What really matters...is whether I truly live and prosper in the truth that is "the now".`
`How can there be any truth......in a life not truly lived?`
`Back when I only ever tried to see the truth of the past, I was nothing more than a ghost trapped in that past.`
`Since that time, I haven't lived a single day.`
`......Now, I truly understand.`
`This is what.........real truth is.........`
`"I will......live......`
` ......And I've remembered how much everyone loved me......"`
`Because I was young and selfish, I didn't even remember until now.`
`The kind grandpa who always spoiled me.`
`The entertaining aunts and uncles.`
`All of the kind and gentle servants.`
`......It was always...warm.`
`And yet, because I was young and cruel, I never even tried to retain any of those memories.`
`Everyone was distorted by my irresponsible imagination, ......and I completely forgot how things were......`
`Now, I can remember clearly, and I understand.`
`It's true that the Halloween quiz party itself was an illusion.`
`We never did anything like that.`
`......But there were all kinds of other fun things we {i:did} do when the relatives gathered,`
` .........things that were no more or less fun than that party.........`
`Then, ......for the first time since the start of the game...`
`...I went up to each and every one of them......to greet them, thank them, and apologize.`
`To thank Grandpa for always pampering me.`
`To thank my aunts and uncles.`
`To thank the cousins for always playing with me even though I was so selfish.`
`......And to thank the creatures of fantasy......and apologize to them.`
`I think I said something horrible to Sakutarou once, in the past.`
`And to Maria onee‐chan too.`
`"......Maria onee‐chan, you really were a witch, weren't you?"`
`"I've always been a witch.`
` ......You approached that level yourself once, didn't you?"`
`"No.`
` I never really understood.`
` ......I felt sorry for you and your magic.`
` ......I could {i:only} feel sorry for you...`
` .........So, ......I couldn't pick up a fragment of happiness, couldn't even find one.`
` .........You told me that yourself once, Onee‐chan......"`
`"......It can't be helped.`
` It takes two to create a universe.`
` ......I had Beato, but you were all alone."`
`"No.`
` ......If only I could have called Aunt Eva "Mom", there would have been two of us.`
` ......I'm sure I'd have been able to create a new world with the same magic you used, Maria onee‐chan."`
`".........All of it is my fault.`
` The message bottles I threw into the sea for fun caused a distortion in your future and wore you down.`
` ......I bear responsibility for that."`
`"......Yeah, seriously.`
` It's all because of your message bottles.`
` Because of those, people started copying you and making Forgeries, ......growing the story into something crazy."`
`However, the message bottles thrown into the sea by Beato did not name a specific person as the culprit.`
`......One of the Forgers wrote a plausible Forgery that had Ushiromiya Eva as the culprit, ......which spread like wildfire...`
`I should've known better than anyone that it couldn't possibly be true, ......but even I accepted it in the end.`
`"............It isn't your fault, Beato.`
` ......No matter how many people around me had their baseless suspicions,`
` ......there should've been only one truth inside me.`
` And yet, so easily, ......I abandoned my warm memories of all of you,`
` ......and surrendered my heart to them."`
`"No, no.`
` If I had not thrown the message bottles, future Rokkenjima would never have become a flourishing ground for such bizarre misconceptions.`
` I bear responsibility for it all."`
`"......True.`
` That's right, it really is your fault after all."`
`"Mgh.`
` ......It's a little irritating to hear you say it so boldly.`
` ......I changed my mind, you have your share of the blame as well!"`
`"........................`
` ......Yeah, you're right.`
` You were at fault, and so was I.`
` ......Still, it'd be stupid for us to attack each other.`
` ......After all, I'm a witch of the future.`
` You're a witch of the past.`
` ......I should be using that magic to build my future.`
` ......We both bear responsibility in some way,`
` but neither of us has the right to blame the other."`
`".........I knew you could do it, Ange.`
` I knew you'd be able to understand Mariage Sorcière's teachings."`
`"You're right.`
` ......As the final member of Mariage Sorcière, ......it's my responsibility to pass on your magic."`
`"My magic can make everyone happy."`
`"Indeed...!`
` You have both pure magic and wicked magic at your fingertips...!"`
`".........That's true.`
` Magic can change completely depending on your heart.`
` ......You can't use magic properly without the proper guidance.`
` ......And proper magic can guide people to happiness."`
`"It is a wonderful thing...`
` .........Bringing people happiness is the sole reason that witches wield magic.`
` ......I am very pleased that we were finally able to pass on this lesson to the last in the line of Endless Witches..."`
`"Sorry for failing to pass it down myself at all."`
`"Witch of the Future, {f:5:Ange Beatrice}.`
` ......I hereby retract your expulsion from Mariage Sorcière."`
`"Uryuu!`
` I knew Ange would come back...!"`
`"Congratulations, Ange‐sama!"`
`"......Back in the days when I traveled together with you all, I remember thinking I understood all this...but I didn't.`
` ......I'm sorry.`
` I'm really sorry......"`
`"Witches cannot create a universe unless there are two.`
` ......In the future, you will be alone. ......Will you really be okay...?"`
`"Yeah, I'll be okay.`
` ......I'm not alone anymore.`
` ......I'll...live.`
` ......With everyone.`
` And I'll live in the future.`
` I swear to keep living, so that I can pass on the magic of Mariage Sorcière."`
`"Maria onee‐chan's magic has saved me too.`
` .........There are a lot of people out there who need magic.`
` Teaching it the right way and saving as many people as I can...`
`...is my mission as the final witch of Mariage Sorcière."`
`"Will you truly be able to do so...?"`
`"Of course. I have the power to do it.`
` There's the golden magic that my predecessor, {f:5:Eva Beatrice}, spent so much time building.`
` I've inherited all of that. Right?"`
`"*giggle*.`
` ......If only my health had held out a little longer, I was planning to spend all of it on myself."`
`*giggle*, ......aha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha.`
`As Ange laughed, tears poured from her eyes again.`
`Everyone surrounded Ange with their kind, warm smiles......`
`Battler stood alone in the rose garden maze, letting the rain quietly fall on him......`
`After searching for some time, Ange found him.`
`"............Onii‐chan........."`
`".............................."`
`Ange, who was feeling guilty, sensed anger in her brother's expression.`
`So, ......she thought he was going to hit her.`
`She shut her eyes tight.`
`However, her brother touched her softly.`
`He patted her head gently.`
`".........See?"`
`".................."`
`"The truth......wasn't anything important, was it?"`
`".........No, it wasn't.`
` ......Even though you were here, ......waiting for me to come home in such a......warm world......`
` .........I had my back turned......the whole time......"`
`"You learned the truth."`
`"...............Yeah..."`
`"So, any hopes you had of someone miraculously surviving and coming back......have been crushed.`
` ......However, you now have a new mission and a new hope to help you live in the future."`
`"......You kept those precious hopes safe for me.`
` ......And I opened the box with my own hands and let them all escape.`
` ......It turned out worse than Pandora's box.`
` ......A truth I didn't need to know flew out of the box, along with all my hopes, ......leaving nothing inside but empty space..."`
`"That's okay.`
` ......It's open now, and that's that.`
` An empty box isn't so bad—it's a clean slate, a fresh start.`
` And anyway, if you're harboring false hopes, sometimes it's better just to pull out the thorn."`
`Battler laughed heartily.`
`{n}Then, with that same smile on his face, he told her.`
`"We're already dead."`
`"...............Yeah."`
`"You've lived twelve years on the hope that we might still be alive.`
` Not anymore.`
` That's over and done with."`
`"Yeah.`
` ......I know.`
` Starting now, ......I'll step forward into a new life."`
`"Beato put Rokkenjima in the cat box.`
` The next witch, Auntie Eva, guarded the lid of that cat box her whole life.`
` ......The witch after that was you, and you opened that lid, ......but so what?`
` Why does the truth of the past matter?"`
`".........Yeah.`
` ......From now on, I'll truly live.`
` And I'll make my own personal truth prosper."`
`"Good luck,`
` final witch of Mariage Sorcière.`
` ......I've read Maria's grimoire.`
` It's a great book, with some really good stuff written in it."`
`"Even the Bible needs a translator.`
` So, Maria's grimoire probably needs one too.`
` ......You will be that translator.`
` ......You've got to teach it to kids who are in the position you once were.`
` That's your mission as the new Witch of the Future."`
`"......Yeah."`
`"I'm...gone.`
` But I'll always be behind you, watching over you."`
`"I know.`
` ......And not just you.`
` Everyone else too..."`
`".........We all love you......and we'll love you forever and ever.`
` Don't forget that......"`
`"......I won't...`
` .........Never......never ever..............."`
`Ange leapt into Battler's chest......and sobbed.`
`{y:0:Human}{n:0:Human}s are sad creatures, who can "learn" but not "unlearn".`
`She had already learned.`
`It was a cruel, terrifying, merciless thing, ......capable of destroying even the miracle called hope.`
`......However, there was still one tiny fragment left gripped in her hand.`
`Her family's...love.`
`If Ange could just remember that love and hold on to it tightly.........then she could surely live on...`
`She could stop herself from taking that single step into nothingness......`
`"Besides... The Rokkenjima cat box hasn't yet been opened completely.`
` ......You've just taken a peek at what's inside.`
` So now...you must be the lid yourself."`
`"And, this time, you'll be the one to protect everyone inside the cat box.`
` Me and Dad and Kyrie‐san, the cousins and the uncles and the aunts.`
` Grandfather and the servants.`
` ......And all of the fantasy people."`
`"...............Yeah.`
` ......This time......I have to......protect everyone........."`
`{a:c:`
`"Then shouldn't you hurry up a bit?"}`
`From the other side of a rose bush came the sound of popcorn being eaten.`
`......It was {f:5:Lambdadelta}.`
`"I'm pretty sure you know this,`
` ......but Bern is just about to hold a big party for the Book of the Single Truth.`
` She's gathered beings from heaven and from hell, from the spirit world and from parallel worlds.`
` If she announces what's in that book in a place like that, it'll all be too late, won't it?"`
`".........I'm...going.`
` ......I gave {f:5:Bernkastel} that key.`
` It's my responsibility.`
` I'll go and bring it back."`
`"The City of Books, is it?`
` But there's no way for us to get in.`
` There's a barrier around that place."`
`"......She gave me this.`
` With it, I can come and go as I please.`
` .........What an idiot.`
` She forgot to collect it when she threw me away."`
`Ange fished through her pocket, and there was a jingling sound.`
`It was a bell with a blue ribbon tied to it.`
`".........That's it.`
` One of those temporary entry passes that you get when you turn in your invitation.`
` As long as you have that, at least one of you will be able to get into the City of Books.`
` Well, as long as someone takes you across the sea of fragments first."`
`"{f:5:Lambdadelta}.`
` Take me to the City of Books."`
`"......Ange."`
`"This is my way of taking responsibility.`
` .........I'll see that the Book of the Single Truth isn't made public."`
`".........Are you serious?`
` That place is a den of monsters among monsters.`
` Now that you've lost Bern's protection, you'll be weaker than a fly.`
` You'll be smushed and that'll be the end of you."`
`"Ah—"`
`The bell was stolen from Ange's hands.`
`"{f:5:Lambdadelta}.`
` I'll go there.`
` ......I just need you to take me and send me on my way.`
` I'm an empty creature anyway, unable to exist outside the cat box.`
` Ange, on the other hand, has to live on into the future.`
` And you're also a person with a future.`
` ......So I'll go.`
` I have nothing to lose."`
`"No! This is my responsibility, my way of making up for what I did!`
` If I don't do it myself, the future won't change at all, and I won't be able to save the cat box of the future...!"`
`Ange tried to snatch the bell from Battler's hand, but Battler had no intention of giving it up.`
`The two of them were grimly serious, but from the sidelines, it just looked like an ordinary squabble between two close siblings.`
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} watched this conversation and shrugged.`
`......If she just had to take either one of them to the City of Books, she wouldn't have to make any enemies, and there was no risk to her.`
`All she cared about was which one would make the story more interesting.`
` Nothing else.`
`But then, she finally noticed.`
`"Hold on.`
` ......Hold on a sec, you two. Hold on!"`
`"What's your problem?! Save it for later!!"`
`"We're having an important sibling discussion here!"`
`"Okay, first off,`
` let go of each other.`
` ......Battler's holding the bell now, right?`
` Jump, Battler."`
`"......Jump?`
` Like this?"`
`Jingle jingle.`
`"You next, Ange.`
` Try jumping."`
`"......Why me as well...?"`
`Jingle jingle.`
`"Huh......?`
` ......Why......?"`
`If Battler was holding the bell, where did that sound come from......?`
`Ange hurriedly searched through her pockets.`
`When she did, ......another blue‐ribboned bell came out of a different pocket than the first one.`
`"These are......the same, aren't they...?"`
`"......No way......`
` Why are there two?`
` I was only given one of them!"`
`"I don't know why.`
` But the point is, you've got two bells that'll get you into the City of Books.`
` Therefore, I don't have to sit here and watch the two of you play with each other anymore."`
`The pair of them gripped their bells and looked at each other.`
`"From the very beginning,`
` this game has belonged to the two of you.`
` ......There's just been a slight change in who the opponent is."`
`"......This game isn't a competition between you two.`
` It's a fight over the cat box, with you two who want to close the lid on one team, ......and Bern who wants it opened on the other.`
` Ange has moved from Bern's team to Battler's team.`
` That's all there is to it."`
`"{f:5:Lambdadelta}.`
` Take us to the City of Books."`
`".........I hope you know I'm just taking you there!`
` After that, I'm done being anything but a spectator!`
` I'm just gonna be sitting nearby and watching, to see exactly how you fight, what you do, and how Bern is going to make mincemeat out of you both...!"`
`"{f:5:Lambdadelta}...... Thank you!"``Shannon and Kanon stood guard in front of the door to the Golden Land.`
`They glared quietly and fearlessly at the eerie fleet of ships across the horizon.`
`Shannon slowly lifted her hands.`
`Kanon also raised his right hand, and a blade that trailed red appeared there.`
`"Stop right there.`
` I forbid you to come any closer."`
`"......If you do, ......I'll kill you."`
`They could see a single dinghy leave the fleet and approach them.`
`{n}They couldn't tell if it was a messenger or the first wave.`
`Shannon and Kanon watched it cautiously...`
`At the head of that dinghy rowed by goats......stood Erika.`
`...Where had she gotten that headgear from?`
` Maybe she was trying to act the part of the fleet's leader.`
` ......The object on top of Erika's head, as she glared at them with an audacious smile, appeared to be a pirate hat.`
`"I've come to deliver our terms.`
` There will be room for negotiation.`
` Please open the gate."`
`Shannon and Kanon looked at each other.`
`Erika was the one offering this deal.`
` It wasn't likely to be anything agreeable.`
`However, if they turned her away, the attack would probably begin at once.`
`Since they were in a firmly inferior position, they wanted to buy time by any means they could.`
`At Shannon's nod, Kanon erased his sword......`
`The Golden Land was filled with a hard downpour accompanied by occasional thunder.`
`Realizing that this weather spoke for their emotions, Erika smiled even more boldly.`
`At the center of the Golden Land...was the arbor surrounded by the golden rose garden.`
`A large number of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s and fantasy creatures were there, arguing about something.`
`Even without asking, it was easy to guess the nature of the debate by their anguished expressions.`
`After all, in this life‐or‐death situation, they didn't have many options they could take......`
`In the direction Erika was being led—with her goat guards alongside her—Beato stood waiting, accompanied by the Chiester Sisters troops.`
`Noticing Beato, Erika gave a bow that at least {i:appeared} graceful.`
`Beato followed suit and gave the sort of graceful bow that was rarely seen from her.`
`"......I am {f:5:Beatrice}, the Golden and Endless Witch, and master of the Golden Land.`
` ......Announce yourself."`
`As though hinting that she was more than ready to go through with this farce, Beato introduced herself boldly and requested that Erika do the same.`
`"We have been dispatched from the Great Witch of Theatergoing, Drama, and Spectating's Noble City of Carefully Selected Books.`
` I am the Witch of Truth, the commander of the Library Fleet, which is committed to bestowing honor and protection to books.`
` My name is Furudo Erika.`
` It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance."`
`"Shall we get down to business?"`
`"You ought to celebrate.`
` We of the Library Fleet, dedicated to offering honor and protection to books, have come to bring good news to you all.`
` First,`
` I would like to announce that, after careful selection, the City of Books has acknowledged and accepted the game board created by the Endless Witch {f:5:Beatrice} as a great and honorable book."`
`"Hoh.`
` That is indeed a great honor."`
`"This game board is a profoundly entertaining and original masterpiece, worthy of close study.`
` It deserves to be released for all of our subjects to read.`
` And so, the City of Books has ordered us to grant eternal honor and protection to this game board."`
`"This is all quite long and boring.`
` Get to the point."`
`"We demand that you hand the entirety of this game board over to the honorable City of Books.`
` Doing so will give this board and its pieces the greatest honor and protection imaginable."`
`"And if we refuse?"`
`"You will be prosecuted for the crime of monopolizing a great cultural artifact that ought to be shared among all of our subjects.`
` We are here to notify you of the impending assault, one which will be waged by us to protect the benefits that are the rightful property of all subjects, not yours alone."`
`"Are you not concerned that the shared property of all subjects might be destroyed in this assault of yours?"`
`"According to the Great Library Protective Regulations, should a criminal guilty of monopolization of a cultural artifact attempt to hold the aforementioned hostage in a refusal to surrender,`
` the executive fleet may prioritize arrest over its protective duties, provided that they obtain permission from the Great Court.`
` ......Of course, we have already obtained the Great Court's written authorization."`
`"I imagine the word "arrest" is closely followed by "dead or alive", am I right?"`
`"My, my.`
` I'm impressed that you can read those tiny letters.`
` Now, enough fooling around.`
` ......Let's hear your answer."`
`"What do we have to gain by accepting your conditions?"`
`"Both of us will be saved a troublesome task.`
` Furthermore, your brave and noble acts will be written down as a glorious final chapter in the City of Books."`
`"......You do understand, right?`
` You have no chance of winning.`
` This won't even be a fight.`
` It will just be you sitting there at the bottom of a well, looking up at the rocks being dropped on you."`
`".........So, you claim that my only option is to decide how the library witches write of my final moments.`
` *cackle*cackle*......"`
`"The rest is up to you.`
` If you treasure this game board, you ought to surrender.`
` The pieces will be treasured by our many subjects for all time, and will be able to continue their roles on into eternity."`
`"Hmph.`
` ......In other words, the tragedies I created at will shall continue forevermore."`
`"How is that any different from what you've been doing so far?"`
`"...............It isn't.`
` ......Is there anything else?`
` If not, allow me to give you my answer."`
`"Go ahead."`
`Erika tensed slightly.`
`{n}After all, this was the great Lady {f:5:Beatrice} she was dealing with.`
`She might shout "here is my answer" dramatically and do something crazy.`
`They say a cornered rat is the most dangerous.`
`Furthermore, Erika had intel telling her that the great Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}, witch of the Senate, had been spending her time inside the Golden Land, though only as a theatergoer.`
`Erika needed to carry out this noble task that her master had assigned her, and she had to carry it out perfectly.`
`If she was honest, .........she wanted to make Beato raise a white flag, even by trickery if necessary.`
`So, even though this was a farce, she held back from giving any unneeded provocation.`
`She gulped and tried to size Beato up.`
`And then, ...............with a pathetic expression on her face, ......Beato let out a sigh.`
`"I'll be honest.`
` The truth is...I am tired."`
`".........What do you mean by that?"`
`"My game had already achieved its purpose when my fight with Battler ended.`
` And yet, for various reasons, the game has repeated several times since then.`
` ......To be perfectly honest, I am tired of it."`
`"......To be honest, I certainly didn't expect that answer.`
` ......So, you want to surrender?`
` Really......?"`
`"Simply put, I don't care either way.`
` ......It doesn't matter whether I surrender or whether we're vanquished by you.`
` I simply wish to have the curtain closed on this game board and tale, regardless of who does the deed."`
`Of course, .........that was a lie.`
`{n}She knew she couldn't win even if she fought.`
`For now, their best option......was to play for time.`
`They would fix Erika's attention to this spot, ......and during that time, Battler and the others would steal the key from {f:5:Bernkastel} while she was completely off her guard.`
`......Once they had the key, they would return to the Golden Land, use that key to let Ange open the door to the future, and see her off.`
`That was their goal.`
`{n}Everything after that...would be inside the cat box.`
`Ange would live on into the future, with hope.`
` No one would know whether Beato and the others were alive or dead.`
` ......That was enough.`
`The only strategy Beato and the others could use to achieve this...was to buy time.`
`"......If you do surrender, it may be a bit of an anti‐climax, but it will save me a lot of trouble."`
`"But, well, ......it is not so simple.`
` You see, and this is just between you and me,`
` ......as you may know, the great Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} is staying here.`
` She is, you see, pushing us to show her a dramatic climax."`
`"......That's a pretty cruel whim to force on someone.`
` How are a few wimpy people like you, the dregs of an already‐solved puzzle, supposed to fight against our fleet,`
` with its hundreds of thousands of troops?"`
`"Very true, very true...`
` The gap in strength is overwhelming.`
` We told her that it wouldn't even be a fight, but......`
` Well, ......Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} didn't listen, and just said she would bring some of her friends to support us, so we should fight with everything we had."`
`"......Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s.........friends......?"`
`Unlike {f:5:Bernkastel}, who kept to herself, {f:5:Lambdadelta} had many friends.`
`Her friends and patrons were all formidable, including monsters that had become legends in their own lifetimes and territory lords commanding vast influence over their respective domains.`
`In all seriousness, her "fan club", as she so called it, had enough size and influence that no one would have been overly surprised if it had suddenly declared itself an independent nation right in the middle of the sea of fragments.`
`"......To our dismay, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} is very much ready for action.`
` Without any regard for us, she keeps calling up friends and acquaintances on the phone from all over the place, telling them to come over..."`
`.........Of course, this was all a lie.`
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} had turned into a small candy comet and was now shooting towards the City of Books with Battler and Ange in tow.`
`So, to make sure that {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s and Battler's absences were not noticed,`
` everyone was crowded around the arbor, pretending to argue furiously with each other...`
`"Battler‐sama, give us your decision!!`
` We, the Seven Sisters of Purgatory, are prepared for death at any time!!"`
`"I firmly oppose taking a last stand that would lead to our deaths!`
` What could possibly be gained by dying?"`
`"How can you be such a coward?!`
` It is inconceivable that we should live on in shame as prisoners!"`
`"There are times when the mere fact of being alive gives one opportunities."`
`"......Yes, indeed.`
` A short temper makes a bad leader..."`
`"Battler, if you call yourself a man, now's the time to act like one!`
` The great {f:5:Lambdadelta}‐sama is even willing to help out, right?!"`
`"I agree!`
` These are the times when a man has to make a tough decision...!"`
`"......In many cases, the timing of a decision is more valuable than the decision itself."`
`"I‐if we surrender, they might not be violent......"`
`"You can't be serious!!`
` Weren't you supposed to be a lion, and a male one too?!`
` Where are your fangs now?!!"`
`"If death awaits us regardless, I would rather die as a wolf than as a pig."`
`"Are you stupid?!`
` Are you saying you want to die like a dog?!"`
`".........It all depends on the strength of the support {f:5:Lambdadelta}‐san can provide..."`
`"{f:5:Lambdadelta}‐san.`
` Are your friends really strong enough to win against them...?"`
`".........It's a gamble.`
` Do we surrender and die, or do we take the gamble and die by losing?"`
`"Interesting.`
` In that case, our chances for survival must be higher if we gamble on it."`
`"......An honorable surrender will surely cause the Great Court to show {f:5:mercy}."`
`"They're backed by the Senate, aren't they?`
` Sure, they'll hem and haw, but we'll all see the guillotine in the end."`
`"A‐anyway, let's all calm down...!`
` Cool your heads...!`
` I'm opposed to letting our emotions control us!"`
`"Why don't you calm down first?`
` .........We have another possible strategy: mutually assured destruction.`
` We might not be able to win, but if we can convince them that we plan on taking enough of them with us, that might force our opponents to show restraint."`
`"Basically,`
` if they're gonna pick a fight, we'll let them know we aren't going down without doing some damage first!!"`
`"Kihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi!!`
` All of {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s friends are incredible...!!`
` She knows lots and lots of witches, beasts, demons, and gods, all of which have really, really huge legends and histories!`
` Even if those ships outnumbered the stars in the sky, {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s friends would wipe them out in a single blast!`
` Kihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi!!"`
`".........W‐will this really work?`
` ......She hasn't seen through our act yet, has she......?"`
`"It is working.`
` You must speak more forcefully as well.`
` Do not worry about politeness."`
`"Enough, you gutless swine!!`
` Do you lack the backbone to finish with a bang?!!"`
`"H‐h‐h‐hold on...!`
` Don't forget that some of us are opposed to fighting!`
` I think we should surrender!!"`
`"Whaaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}at?!`
` Goo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}ohda, you defeatist foo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}ool!!"`
`"Ah, ow, ouch, my lord, it's j‐just an act, gyaa{0}a{0}r{0}r{0}r{0}r{0}gghhh!!"`
`"Well, it looks like the debate has gotten quite heated!!"`
`"Will we surrender?!`
` Or will we fight back?! Which will it be?!"`
`""Nobody knows!!""`
`"Personally speaking, I would like to surrender.`
` ......If my purpose is to come to an end in any event, I would prefer that my game board be preserved the way I made it.`
` ......I could not bear to have Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} continue to use it however she pleases."`
`"............We don't want that either.`
` I came here to fight you, but I'm no match for Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s friends."`
`Secretly, Erika was getting worried at these complicated developments.`
`And, she was relieved that she hadn't pushed too hard earlier on.`
`She wanted to curry favor with Beato and end this with a bloodless takeover.`
`Even the great Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} probably wouldn't seriously think of picking a fight with the Senate.`
`Her motive was probably something much more trivial, a simple desire to watch the game board's final fireworks from a front row seat.`
`However, ......if she really did have some fireworks of her own prepared,`
` ......it was at least possible that this could turn into a ruckus that Erika would have no chance of quelling.`
`............Beato saw all of this going on in Erika's mind.`
`So, she continued to act with an even more pathetic expression on her face.`
`Even among witches, her acting ability was top‐notch.`
`".........Might you be willing to lend us some of your strength?`
` So that my game board's beauty will be preserved?`
` ......Yes, it was a great error to invite that busybody as a guest.`
` ......Haha..."`
`".........I understand.`
` I'd like to end this quietly too, if I can.`
` So, how can we work together?"`
`"For some time now, we have been arguing over whether we should surrender or resist.`
` I intend to return to the debate myself to propose that we surrender and ask Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} not to do anything that might destroy the game board."`
`"That would please me very much.`
` So, what should I do?"`
`"I would like you to guarantee that we have the necessary time to debate the matter.`
` ......After all, your ships are surrounding and pressuring us at the moment.`
` Everyone is so tense at the thought that we may be attacked at any time that they're falling apart."`
`"So, if you guarantee that we will have enough time to discuss this amongst ourselves, everyone will surely be able to keep their composure during that time.`
` ......Furthermore, I will have enough time to convince Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}."`
`".............................................`
`......Very well.`
` About how long do you need?"`
`"Would you be gracious and avoid giving a specific time limit?`
` ......If a time limit is imposed, everyone will just fall apart again as the limit nears, possibly leading to an agitated decision..."`
`"......You have a point there.`
` The most important thing about a fuse is whether it's lit or not.`
` The length of the fuse is a trivial matter."`
`"In that case, ......will you give us the time we need?"`
`"Understood.`
` I guarantee that you will have time to discuss it.`
` However, that time will not be unlimited.`
` I will wait here and listen in on your discussion."`
`"Well, as far as that goes, ......it is true that your mere presence here has everyone on edge......"`
`"I have already made my concessions.`
` Isn't it your turn now?"`
`"...................................."`
`They were some distance away from the arbor, but still just about close enough that one could get a general idea of what was going on.`
`It might just barely be possible to hide the fact that Battler and {f:5:Lambdadelta} were missing,`
` to convincingly pretend to be engaged in a white‐hot argument in gridlock.`
` ......But absolutely nothing was safe at this distance.`
`If it were possible, they would rather have kept Erika waiting much further away.`
`They had planned to set up a seat of honor for their guest at one of the far corners of the garden maze......`
`".........Is there some sort of problem?"`
`"Okay, okay.`
` Don't make such a scary face...`
` In that case, please wait here.`
` ......This is a, um, confidential conference!`
` So, you must, uh,`
` come no closer than this line...!"`
`Beato drew a line in the ground with her foot.`
`"Help them see me in a good light.`
` If it's clear that I have obtained a generous agreement from you, that will be a powerful weapon in my hands in the debate."`
`".........Could I get a chair?"`
`"Y‐yes, yes, of course!`
` Chiester Troops, bring Miss Erika a chair and umbrella at once...!`
` And a hand towel too!`
` I'll wipe it nice and clean for you...!"`
`"......................................."`
`"Milady, have there been any developments in our negotiations...?"`
`"Wahahahahaha...`
` If anything's certain, it's that I'll be winning this year's prize for best actress...!"`
`"That's our {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama!"`
`"All we can do is argue fiercely, squabble amongst ourselves,`
` and make it look like things will turn for the worse if negotiations break down."`
`"Indeed.`
` What we begin now is a fight, as important as any other, to support Battler's group.`
` Get yourselves ready, everyone.`
` Let us argue and insult with all we have.`
` Got it...?!"`
`"Mmm, mmyes, my lord!"`
`The sight of Gohda, his cheek red and swollen from being pinched, made everyone snort, but they quickly covered their mouths and put fingers to their lips......`
`Then, everyone nodded at each other, and the fake argument resumed.`
`Erika was sitting in the chair that the Chiester Sisters had brought her, filling a goat in on the details of the negotiation.`
`The goat would probably return and tell the rest of the fleet.`
`The fleet would tell {f:5:Bernkastel},`
` and {f:5:Bernkastel} might think of some plan to deal with this situation or give new orders.`
`The conversation with the goat ended, and it spun around.`
`{n}......It would return to the dinghy and report on this to the fleet.`
`It left the rose bushes behind and passed through the garden maze, heading towards the door that led outside......`
`.........Would it really be okay to let that goat reach the boats......?`
`If it made it back, Erika's report would reach {f:5:Bernkastel}'s ears......`
`The Chiester Sisters spoke through a secret channel that only they could use.`
`"............Two seconds nyeh.`
` Won't even be a sound nyeh..."`
`"......It's just about to leave Erika's sphere of awareness.`
` ......Can assassinate until it's in range of the goat boatman. ETA ten seconds."`
`"Lady {f:5:Beatrice},`
` permission to assassinate.`
` .........We can do it. Erika will sense nothing."`
`"You do not have permission.`
` ......Do you think an envoy would leave their boat without setting a time limit?`
` The fleet probably has orders to attack if it isn't contacted within a certain period of time.`
` Let that goat go."`
`"00, understood."`
`The goat passed through the door.`
`Then, after receiving a silent bow from Shannon and Kanon, it got on the dinghy and returned to the fleet.`
`The fleet would probably follow Erika's orders and stand by until an attack order was given.`
`......That gave the residents of the Golden Land a chance to assassinate Erika, .........but of course, that wasn't going to be possible, practically speaking.`
`She was {f:5:Bernkastel}'s greatest underling, and a witch who controlled truth.`
`Tricking her was all they could hope for.`
` Anything else would be wishful thinking...`
`"Why don't you all have a seat too?"`
`"......You need have no worries about us, ma'am."`
`Without any hint that she had just been talking about assassinations,`
` 00 stood upright with her hands clasped behind her back......`
`Surrender, or resist until the end.`
`The false argument resumed.`
`Just how well and how long would they be able to trick Erika?`
`Yes. ......The final fight for the Golden Land...had already begun.`
`"............Battler.`
` You can count on us to handle things here.`
` ......It's time for you and Ange to take this final game back...!"`
`".........This is one freakishly huge library......"`
`"I've heard that each one of these books has a tale like ours inside it."`
`"After all, ......this is a world of gods."`
`"You can tell at a glance that it's not a place for the likes of you guys, right?"`
`After passing through the barrier, the three of them had finally made it inside the City of Books.`
`For some time, they were overcome by the countless otherworldly sights before them, but they quickly remembered their original objective.`
`"Okay, listen up.`
` First off, don't get the wrong idea.`
` ......You two came here to fight Bern,`
` but that doesn't mean walking up to her and attacking her directly, okay?"`
`"............We know."`
`"In the first place,`
` you were only able to fight the great {f:5:Beatrice} on an even footing because the game board protected you with rules that made it that way.`
` If you leave the game board,`
` ......you're more like something that'll leave a small stain on her palm when she swats you.`
` Don't forget that, got it?"`
`"......Makes sense.`
` ......This isn't the game board we're familiar with."`
`"We didn't come here to fight.`
` ......We came here to take something back with us."`
`"Exactly.`
` ......You're here to prevent the Book of the Single Truth from being exposed to the public.`
` That is your only goal, your only fight.`
` You'd better not be confused about that."`
`Battler and Ange nodded to show their understanding.`
`"The Book of the Single Truth itself is being displayed openly in the middle of the party, so stealing that'll be impossible.`
` ......However, bringing in the key is a big part of the ceremony."`
`"Which means the key must be stored in a different place."`
`"......But there's no guarantee that it'll be undefended."`
`"After that, it's all up to your luck.`
` I hope it's good, for your sakes.`
` ..................! Hide!!"`
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} pulled her head back from around the corner of a bookshelf.`
`{n}The others hurriedly followed suit.`
`......In the distance, they saw emerald‐green lights floating about and leaving trails.`
`"Those are Bern's cat familiars.`
` ......She's got them patrolling all over the place today."`
`"......Did she guess that we would come?"`
`"No.`
` Don't forget how huge this place is.`
` Those are staff cats, out looking for nitwit guests who've gotten lost, so they can be taken to the lost children area."`
`"And that's not where we want to go at the moment."`
`".........If it looks like one's about to find us, .........should we take them out...?"`
`"I'd advise against it.`
` ......Maybe if this were some other territory or game board,`
`......but this is Bern's home base.`
` That single cat should make you as scared as being surrounded by a crowd of vicious beasts."`
`"......Plus, they're cats.`
` They've got good senses, and they'll call for their friends.`
`......If they spot you, you'd better prepare yourself for what comes next.`
` I'm not going to save you.`
` ......Just taking you here has been troublesome enough."`
`"......As for me, if I surrender,`
` ......I might get off the hook with being stripped naked and put through a hundred years of all the worst kinds of pukespittle fragments.`
` ......How wonderful. I think I can sympathize with Bern's feelings a bit now."`
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} wasn't laughing.`
` Most likely, even this punishment she spoke of was pretty optimistic.`
`Despite saying that she won't offer any more help...`
`{n}She's already...`
`risking everything.`
`And for what?`
`"......Isn't that obvious?"`
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} brushed her hair back and grinned.`
`"It's because you're gonna show me the perfect happy ending!"`
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} hugged their heads at the same time, making their foreheads bonk together.`
`"You'd better show me, for certain...!"`
`"......Yeah.`
` ......We'll show you. A certain...happy ending!"`
`"We'll......certainly take this cat box back...!"`
`"Let's go.`
` ......This way, and swim quietly."`
`The three of them swam out into the darkness of the deep ocean trench that was the City of Books.`
`In that massive, vast trench of bookshelves, they vanished into the darkness almost immediately.`
`The library defied the common sense of the human world.`
`......The City of Books.`
`The word "city" was no exaggeration.`
`And, it was filled with the green, glowing eyes of {f:5:Bernkastel}'s countless cat familiars.`
`Trying to count them would be almost as crazy as counting all the fish in the ocean.`
`They formed schools that swam all over the place,`
` ......on the lookout for any fools who might miraculously have managed to slip in and disturb their master's party.`
`If Battler's group was found, the cats would report it instantly.`
`{n}They would probably form a pack, open their large mouths and swallow them in a single gulp.`
`......There would be no fight.`
`In this place, Battler's party would be swallowed like tiny fishes if they were discovered.`
`The warships surrounding the Golden Land were well more than a hundred strong.`
`Each of them had dozens of cannons pointing at the door to the Golden Land.`
`The goats that packed the decks of the ships numbered in the tens of thousands.`
`Each one of them carried anti‐magic toxin in their fangs, potent enough to completely deny each of the game board pieces one by one.`
`This time, they would chew apart and eat away everything.`
` ......The crowd of goats unleashed their rotten breath and dangling drool.`
`At that time, Erika, who wanted to avoid trouble and hoped Beato would be able to convince {f:5:Lambdadelta} to surrender peacefully,`
` was sitting alone, calmly enjoying the tea Ronove had poured for her.`
`Of course, even Erika wasn't planning to give them unlimited time.`
` In her mind, she had already decided to allow them three yawns before stepping in.`
`".........This actually isn't so bad.`
` ......Getting to watch Beato try and convince everyone as they call her a coward and a loser."`
`"Indeed, it is impressive that our short‐tempered mistress has managed to become such an adult.`
` ......Pu ku ku ku."`
`"......What's so funny?"`
`"Oh, pardon me.`
` ......Are you ready for another cup?`
` Please feel free to enjoy our collection of great teas from across the globe at your leisure."`
`"Lambda's leading Beato's side into an all‐out resistance...?`
` And she's gathering her friends?`
` .........Is this a joke?"`
`The messenger cat shook its head, then continued to dispassionately meow its report.`
`"......Even Lambda isn't that stupid.`
` She should know what it means to have Auau as her enemy..."`
`Even as she said this, {f:5:Bernkastel} was chewing away at her thumbnail...`
`"Despite how she looks, that kid has a lot of strange friends...`
` Absolute monsters who just love to meddle......`
` .........But even so, to take up arms against the Senate........."`
`...............It was possible...`
`She could think of many monsters among {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s friends who would love to see a losing side get support and make a comeback victory......`
`Before she realized it, the finger {f:5:Bernkastel} was biting was covered with sweat.`
`"......She might do it.`
` ......She really is a moron sometimes, after all!`
` Get me a phone, quickly!!"`
`The cat leapt away, then flew back with a phone and receiver.`
`"I'm going to call up her friends...!`
` ......I have to warn them not to get involved in this stupid game...!`
` Umm, ......phone numbers, phone numbers.......`
` .........Why don't I have any phone numbers saved in here...?`
` Oh, right, I have no friends...`
` Umm, ......how were you supposed to greet people over the phone? Does "hello" work?!"`
`"Meow!"`
`The golden key was being kept in a room inside the City of Books.`
`However, perhaps "room" wasn't a fitting word to use.`
`It was large enough that you could probably fit two domed baseball stadiums in it one atop the other.`
`Even so, in this city, these were called "rooms".`
`Floating in the center of this vast room...were several sacred magic circles.`
`Wrapped around by these magic circles......was Ange's gold key.`
`Surrounding this were countless emerald‐green stars, which looked like a slowly revolving planetarium.`
`Those eyes as numerous as the stars......were all glaring in the same direction.`
`"............Come on, don't look at me like that.`
` I'm on your side. Did you forget?"`
`One of the cats kitty‐paddled towards {f:5:Eva},`
` meowing that no one was allowed to enter this room.`
`"Lady {f:5:Bernkastel} has ordered me to guard that key.`
` So, why don't you leave this to me and get lost?"`
`After looking at each other with suspicious eyes, the cats glared at {f:5:Eva} again, as though saying that they hadn't heard any such order.`
`"By the way,`
` ......cats have pretty soft bodies, don't they?"`
`".........??"`
`"Much easier to chew that way."`
`{f:5:Eva} lifted up her golden staff...and a circular pattern of red lines covered the floor and ceiling of the vast room.`
`The reaction from the cats was lightning fast.`
` They realized instantly that this was hostile behavior.`
`The entire emerald‐green constellation writhed and became a single, massive, deep‐sea fish, which charged at {f:5:Eva} with its massive mouth open wide.`
`However, at the same time, the red lines—the massive spiderwebs—on the floor and ceiling came crashing together and crushed the fish,`
` twisted it, spun it around and around, .........and compressed it to the size of a small ball.`
`Then, that ball‐shaped thing burst open, leaving nothing left.`
`It all happened in an instant.`
`"Why don't you just give up and die for{f:5:eva}aa??`
` Ahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!!"`
`The Witch Hunters were holding a convention in the event hall.`
`After all, once Ushiromiya Eva's diary was opened, ......the endless cat box would be lost, along with the countless imagined stories that had entertained them for so long.`
`So, this final convention was a time for them to air their best theories one last time.`
`The cat box was soon to be opened, and while that did give them a slightly lonely feeling,`
` they couldn't contain their excitement as intellectual rapists, not when they knew that the Rokkenjima mystery was finally going to be solved once and for all.`
`......There was a girl out there......who was going to be hurt by the opening of that box.`
`However, their jaws and fangs couldn't care less.`
`The witch‐hunting goat nobles kept licking their lips, ......wanting to chew apart the guts of {f:5:Beatrice}'s cat box as soon as they could...`
`Seated upon a grand throne the size of a pillar,`
` {f:5:Featherine} listened in on the nonsense being spewed from the mouths of the goat nobles.`
`A black cat wearing a cape silently appeared and whispered something into {f:5:Featherine}'s ear.`
`"........................`
` No, it is fine.`
` ......Everything is going according to my script.`
` ......You need not inform my miko."`
`The cat bowed humbly and vanished.`
`{f:5:Featherine} raised her wine glass high, ......and laughed as she looked through it to the light of the chandelier, which was as beautiful and majestic as the moon.`
`"This should be enough to thank you for your excellent reading, child of man.`
` ......Well now.`
` ......Just who is weaving this tale?`
` ......Am I for you?`
` Or are you for me?`
` .........Heh, ......heheheheheheh."`
`".........What do you think?"`
`"A trap?"`
`......As Battler's group moved forward, darting from bookshelf to bookshelf while avoiding the eyes of the cats, they found something strange.`
`Written with a faintly glowing, red substance......was a letter and an arrow.`
`{a:c:`
`{p:1:{e:200:K←}}`
`That's what it looked like to them.`
`"......Do you think "K" means key?"`
`"Those marks only appeared when we got close.`
` ......This is a message aimed at us."`
`"Does this mean there's someone here besides us who's willing to help...?"`
`"......Is there really anyone who'd take our side?"`
`Ange traced the red arrow with her finger.`
` ......It was written with very faint, thin strings that had been twisted together.`
`Sticky red strings that, when touched, melted like cotton candy and clung to the fingers......`
`"There is.`
` ......Someone......who's always been on my side."`
`"......How can you be so sure?"`
`"...........................`
` ......Yeah, I get it too now.`
` ......Lambda.`
` We can trust the person who wrote this.`
` She'll probably be able to guide us to the key safely."`
`"Are you sure?`
` Then let's go...!`
` We don't have time to be standing around!"`
`".........Thank you, .........Mom...!"`
`In the arbor, the argument over whether they should surrender or fight continued without signs of stopping.`
`Every now and then, a small fight would break out, which fortunately ended up delaying Erika's third yawn.`
`However, they didn't know how long they would have to continue this fake fight.`
`Keeping this high level of tension going was physically stressful.`
`The instant they tired out and the tension faded, Erika would probably demand a verdict.`
`They had to constantly appear to be trapped and agitated.`
`......It was a battle of weariness and tension.`
`This was their fight.`
`Erika waited patiently.`
`Now that she had tired of tea, she was watching Ronove perform some magic tricks, and seemed to be quite enjoying herself.`
`......Even Ronove, who was usually aloof from the world, was fighting.`
`If Erika got bored and lost her patience with them, an all‐out attack would probably begin at once.`
`Even he was putting everything he had into the fight to buy time for Battler's group......`
`As the fiercest leader in the argument, Beato wore out the quickest.`
`She breathed heavily, and her face was so pale, it seemed she might faint at any moment.`
`"......Beato, hang in there.`
` Your body won't hold out much longer at this rate."`
`"Pretend to suddenly burst into tears and rest for a while.`
` We'll pick up the slack."`
`"I am still......fine......`
` ......Come on...! From the top, one more fierce debate.`
` Let's go...!!`
` So, who's up first? Who wants to kick this off?!"`
`"In that case, I, Gohda, am prepared...!!`
` W‐we must fight!!`
` It would be outrageous to accept defeat without fighting!!`
` As I've said from the beginning, fighting with all we have is the only option!!"`
`".........Hold on a second."`
`Erika suddenly rose from her chair.`
`Ronove tried to coax her back into her seat, but Erika's attention was completely focused on those arguing under the arbor.`
`"............I am...the detective.`
` My memory of what I hear is as good as a recording."`
`"We are aware of that, of course......`
` You are quite an excellent detective, after all......"`
`"I'm not interested in you.`
` ......Gohda‐san.`
` I have one question for you."`
`"Y‐.........yes, ma'am!`
` ......Have I done something to cause offense......?"`
`"‘Hold on.`
` Don't forget that some of us are opposed to fighting.`
` I think we should surrender.’`
` .........Those were the first words I heard from you when I arrived here."`
`"However, you just said this:`
` "We must fight.`
` It would be outrageous to accept defeat without fighting.`
` As I've said from the beginning, fighting with all we have is the only option."`
` ......That's what you said."`
`"W‐well, uh...... Did I say that...?"`
`"............It is hardly strange for an opinion to change in the course of a discussion."`
`"I‐i‐indeed...!`
` All of us have been feeling doubts about our position lately, so an occasional change of opinion wouldn't be...!"`
`"No.`
` ......From beginning to end, no one has changed their opinion in this argument.`
` Just now, Gohda‐san alone flipped his position 180 degrees.`
` ......Furthermore, if I recall the things that were said to Gohda‐san by the rest of you, I can't imagine any of them sufficient to make him entirely switch position."`
`An uncomfortable, damp wind blew by.`
`Everyone was silent, frozen as though time had stopped.`
`In that silence, Erika continued with a blank expression.`
`".........This can lead us to two conclusions.`
` First, ......it may be that Gohda‐san has no opinion...and is just a loser who will say anything that goes with the flow.`
` Second, .........it may be that none of you has an opinion, and that this entire argument exists only for its own sake."`
`"Aren't you.........over‐thinking this a bit...?`
` Here we are, in a desperate debate that will decide our fate.`
` I hardly think it strange that some people would act abnormally under such pressure..."`
`"If you have some reason for prolonging a meaningless argument, that can only be to buy time.`
` .........Do you have anything to gain by buying time?`
` ......Is it because Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s reinforcements will come?`
` .........That can't be true either."`
`"After all, for some time now,`
` I have heard all of you speak to Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} and Battler occasionally, but not once have I heard them reply.`
` ............Taking all of this into account, we are left with only one conclusion."`
`That Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} and Battler are not here now.`
`And that these people have won Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s assistance, ......with Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} and Battler probably planning to sneak into the City of Books.`
`In which case, their goal is probably to steal back the golden key...and Ange.`
`And your plan was to act as bait and buy time until their mission was complete.`
`".........All it takes is a single poorly‐chosen line from Gohda‐san,`
` ......and a deduction like this becomes trivial for Furudo Erika.`
` ............Your thoughts?`
` Ladies and gentlemen......?"`
`With a blank......yet ruthless expression, Erika spoke these words and returned to her seat.`
`Everyone else was frozen, unable to move.`
` No one spoke.`
`......However, time was moving.`
`As evidence, ......a bead of sweat dripped down someone's cheek, fell, ......and hit the table with a tiny yet audible splat.`
`Then, frozen time shattered, and in the same instant, the white chair Erika had been sitting in broke apart.`
`The stakes of the Seven Sisters of Purgatory and the high‐velocity rounds from the Chiester Sisters had obliterated the chair at exactly the same time.`
`And a few moments after that, the Erika sitting in that chair faded and vanished.`
`"......Afterimage!!"`
`"She's fast!! Kill her!!!"`
`In an instant, Erika had moved to a spot behind the chair.`
`{n}Her expression remained as blank as it had been.`
`However, there was now something in her hand that wasn't there before.`
`As the seven lightning strikes of the Seven Sisters raced at her once more, she batted all of them away with her scythe.`
`"That was one hell of a farce.`
` But I will say that the tea was good.`
` ......Well now, it seems that you've all been in agreement since the start.`
` ......Allow me to ask for your answer once again."`
`Erika lifted her left hand, the one that wasn't holding the scythe.`
`"Very well, then answer I shall...!!`
` This Golden Land belongs to me, to all of us!!`
` Those who would enter unbidden will receive the welcome they deserve!!`
` In other words, to put it elegantly..."`
`"............All cannons, prepare to fire.`
` Target: the Golden Land."`
`"GO WASH YOUR FACE IN MISO SOO{-}O{-}O{-}O{-}O{-}O{-}O{-}O{-}O{-}O{-}O{-}O{-}O{-}O{-}OOUP!!!"`
`"SHOOT 'EM DEEE{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}E{-}EAD!!!"`
`"......Yes, thank you.`
` .........See you around.`
` ......Meow."`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} set down the receiver and crossed out yet another name on a list of {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s notable friends.`
`Something was wrong.`
` No one she called had heard anything from {f:5:Lambdadelta}.`
`They weren't just playing dumb.`
` They really knew nothing about the strange ruckus {f:5:Lambdadelta} was trying to stir up.`
`Even {f:5:Bernkastel} was starting to suspect that something was fishy...`
`Then, a black cat leapt in and meowed a frantic report.`
`"Lambda and Battler aren't in the Golden Land...?!`
` .......................................`
` ......Hah, .........hahhhha{0}ha{0}haa{0}ha{0}ha{0}hah{0}ha{0}ha{0}hhhaah!!!"`
`She tore the phone receiver from its stand.`
`The number she dialed was short.`
` It was probably an internal line.`
`However, after listening to it ring several times, she slammed the receiver down again, finally managing to break the phone.`
`"......Gather all the cats who aren't busy. This is an emergency!!!`
` The cats I had guarding the key aren't responding!!!`
` .........Lambdaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}awg!!"`
`Overwhelmed with emotion, {f:5:Bernkastel} kicked the table over.`
`Then, ......the room finally grew bright.`
`It was like green sunlight.`
`A bright green light waved about, giving the illusion that a green sun was rising and lighting the room up.`
`It was a sign that {f:5:Bernkastel}'s army had been given an emergency summons......`
`"Come, my kitties!!!`
` It's time for a witch hunt!!`
` That kid always smells like candy, so you'll find her pretty fast!!`
` The first cat who finds her gets a human form and a witch's title!!!"`
`What was now an emerald‐green nebula let out a roar of delight that shook the bookshelf cliff......`
`"......Something's chasing us..."`
`"What...is that......?`
` ......A green.........sun......?"`
`"............Hide!!`
` They know!!"`
`The three of them frantically hid behind a bookshelf.`
`The room with the key in it was straight ahead.`
`They could see something glowing faintly in the darkness of that room.`
`It was a glow different from anything else they had seen so far in this city.`
`The color it glowed...was gold.`
`They had almost reached the golden key.`
`However, if they went towards it, {f:5:Bernkastel} would be right behind them, along with her vast swarm of familiars.`
`In other words, they were trapped in a dead end.`
`They already knew that the emerald‐green color came from the eyes of the familiars.`
`However, ......it was almost beyond comprehension that this undulating green sun could be the same thing, ......and they could do nothing except stare in wide‐eyed shock...`
`As the countless cats approached, they passed through the ravine of bookshelves from the very top to the very bottom, painstakingly checking the gaps between each book.`
`However, even this mind‐numbingly huge task was accomplished swiftly, thanks to the sheer number of familiars.`
`With the speed of a gust of wind, ......they carefully checked every nook and cranny.`
`There was no way to hide from this green sun.`
`That would have been as foolish as trying to hide from water on a sinking ship.`
`"......Will we be able to hide until they pass us...?!"`
`"No...`
` We'll be found no matter where we hide...!"`
`Battler was just about to leap out from the shadows, but {f:5:Lambdadelta} grabbed him by the collar an instant before.`
`"Are you thinking of fighting?!"`
`"No, but we'll be found if we just stand here...!`
` So we have to move forward!`
` We need to reach the key as soon as possible...!"`
`"You really think there aren't cats guarding the key?!`
` We're already trapped between them!!"`
`"I believe in Aunt Eva...!`
` She's the one who's guided us this far...!`
` I'm sure she took care of the guard cats too!"`
`"I agree.`
` If we're just going to be found anyway, then let's try and get there as fast as possible and grab the key.`
` If we can just get that, no one will be able to open that book!!"`
`".........So, you'll rush in there and grab the key.`
` And then what?!`
` That place is a dead end!`
` There'll be nowhere to run, don't you realize that?!"`
`"We know that, but......!!"`
`"The key will be our trump card.`
` ......It's vitally important for {f:5:Bernkastel} too.`
` ......If worst comes to worst, we might be able to use the key as a bargaining chip..."`
`"Bargain with Bern?!`
` ......You're insane!!"`
`"But if we hide here, we'll definitely be found.`
` ......In that case, I'll take a bet on that billion to one chance.`
` We'll get the key and have that be our trump card."`
`"So, you're praying for a miracle to win against the Witch of Miracles...?"`
`"Picking a winner out of astronomically bad odds.`
` That's the Ushiromiya family magic...!!"`
`"............I've got good eyesight, so let me enlighten you.`
` Can you see those magic circles around the golden key?`
` ......That's a simple barrier, but a pretty strong one.`
` ......On the plus side, it'll break at a touch..."`
`"But it's a really mean‐spirited seal that'll take exactly one hour to fade, whether a Great Witch or a lowly {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} does it.`
` According to the ceremony schedule, we still have that hour.`
` ......But it means that we won't even be able to touch the key unless we can buy all that time for ourselves!!"`
`"When Aunt Eva took out the guard cats, she must've broken the magic circle too!`
` It probably won't take an hour...!"`
`"As far as I can see, the magic circle is still just fine.`
` Sorry to say it, but even if Eva did do that, it was less than an hour ago."`
`"Well, what's an hour?`
` At least we know that we can get it if we can manage to stick around that long!"`
`"Yeah.`
` ......Sure, let's play tag for an hour.`
` I'm used to getting chased around by thugs."`
`"You two really are out of your minds...!!`
` You really think you'll get the luxury of a game of tag out of Bern and all her cats?!"`
`"If there's even a 1% chance!"`
`"You can be certain that we'll grab it...!!"`
`There was an immense difference in enthusiasm between {f:5:Lambdadelta} and the siblings, who had nothing left to lose.`
`However, this was by no means cowardice on {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s part.`
`She was a Great Witch of the Senate.`
` ......If she surrendered, she wouldn't be able to escape severe punishment, but she would be forgiven after a few hundred years.`
`She had been thrown into a stormy sea while clutching a buoy that could save only her—how could she possibly decide to throw that buoy away?`
`There was no way a person with a life to lose could be as determined as those who were already gambling everything.`
` No one could blame her.`
`"...............Ahh, geez, you two really are stupid, you know that?`
` ......Alright, fine.`
` I'll tell you a plan that's got a bit more than a 1% chance of working.`
` Any guesses?"`
`The two siblings looked at each other.`
`However, they both thought that any plan would be worth listening to, even if it would only raise their chances by 0.00001%.`
`"A sacrifice.`
` ......Bern is a cat, so although she'll give chase to fleeing prey, she'll also kill prey that doesn't flee.`
` {i:After} toying with it first!"`
`"Cats are terrible creatures..."`
`"......Still, if that's true, ......it'll be worth the bet."`
`"Let's have one sacrifice.`
` We'll decide with rock‐paper‐scissors.`
` ......Whoever loses has to go spend as much time as possible taunting Bern, getting laughed at, and getting killed.`
` ......Does that work for you?"`
`"No need for rock‐paper‐scissors.`
` I'll do it.`
` You two go on to the key room."`
`"No way, Onii‐chan...!!`
` I'll do it.`
` This is all my responsibility.`
` ......I was the one who listened to {f:5:Bernkastel} and trusted her.`
` ......So, I've got a thing or two to say to her!"`
`Both Battler and Ange decided to be the sacrifice and wouldn't listen to the other.`
`"See?`
` You need rock‐paper‐scissors to decide, right?`
` If you don't act quickly, we won't even have a chance to use this plan.`
` ......They'll be here any moment."`
`".........Okay.`
` ......Either Ange or I will be the sacrifice.`
` ......{f:5:Lambdadelta}, you'll take whoever's left, steal the key, and take them back to the Golden Land."`
`"I won't let you do it.`
` Onii‐chan."`
`"Quit joking around.`
` You've got to let me act like a big brother at least once in a while."`
`"There's no time.`
` Rock‐paper‐scissors, single round!`
` I'm super‐paper with a head full of confetti, so in reference to that, we'll all start with paper.`
` Got it, you two?"`
`"Fine."`
`"Ange... No regrets, okay?"`
`"3, 2, 1, paper!!"`
`It really was a stupid, childish game of rock‐paper‐scissors.`
`Despite promising to start with paper, ......they threw different signs to catch each other off guard.`
`Both Battler and Ange chose rock.`
`......And yet, it wasn't a tie.`
`Because in addition to those two rocks......was one person who chose scissors.`
`After staring stupidly at their fists and those scissors, ......they looked at her.`
`"............Ah, dang...`
` ......We were supposed to start with paper, so I figured I'd use scissors and beat you both.`
` ......I guess confetti‐head should've stuck with paper."`
`There had been no reason for {f:5:Lambdadelta} to join in on the game.`
`{n}This wasn't the time for a joke like that.`
`Battler and Ange, each trying to lose, ......chose rock.`
`{n}{f:5:Lambdadelta} alone......chose scissors.`
`"Don't tell me......you intentionally......"`
`"If you die, we can't even get back to the Golden Land...!`
` This doesn't count!"`
`"Well then, you can just use this, can't you?"`
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} made a clenched fist, a fragment glowing pale blue appeared there, and she gave it to the pair of them.`
`Battler had seen one of these before.`
` ......It was a magic fragment, like the one Erika had used before disappearing, which would allow one to cross the sea of fragments.`
`"With that, you'll both be able to return to the Golden Land.`
` And anyway, I'm the best person for the job.`
` You two probably wouldn't last a handful of seconds against Bern.`
` If it's me, not only will an hour be no problem, but who knows? I might even win."`
`"And I owe her one.`
` I've got to make this my victory and even the score.`
` ......Still, away games are such a pain."`
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} pretended to complain as she stood up straight.`
`"Anyway, see you in a bit.`
` ......I guess a show‐off like me couldn't stick to being a spectator after all.`
` Sorry for stealing your time to shine.`
` ......It's sad that I won't be able to watch your game until the end,`
` ......but I've already taken a look at the script, so I'm not missing anything."`
`".........Lambda......"`
`Then, with her broadest smile and a wink...`
`"This is your happy ending!`
` I've already figured out what happens next, so there's no need to watch.`
` I'll see the two of you again.`
` In the credit roll of your happy ending, that is!"`
`"W‐......wait...!!"`
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} snapped her fingers, and the two of them turned into konpeitou candies.`
`She picked them up, .........took aim at the glint of the golden key, ......and flicked them away.`
`That way, they should be able to reach the key without {f:5:Bernkastel} noticing......`
`Dang, what terrible luck.`
`What were the odds of them both playing a rock against my scissors?`
`.........Yeah, I know.`
`{n}It wasn't nice of me to test you like that.`
` Sorry, you two.`
`And then, ......{f:5:Lambdadelta}'s body was lit up by an emerald‐green light...`
`When she turned around, the cat's eyes and {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s......met.`
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} grinned and waved......`
`There was a thunderous boom and several bright flashes.`
`"What in the...?`
` .........?!?!"`
`A chain of explosions flashed by one after another, enveloping {f:5:Bernkastel} and her pack of familiars in an instant.`
`They were multicolored fireworks.`
` ......Or rather, multicolored candy that burst with a flash and scattered everywhere.`
`Countless stick candies, sugar sculptures, cookies, and tarts flew in every direction,`
` and each one of those split and exploded into hundreds of candies,`
` each of which exploded again into a cloud of konpeitou.`
`However, these sweets weren't sweet.`
`The konpeitou was heavier than lead, harder than steel, and sharper than any blade.`
`As the colorful cloud exploded outward, it blasted the entire pack of cats into little bits.`
`The emerald‐green glints that were scattered everywhere sparkled like the night sky,`
` and among them danced the cloud of pretty candies that looked like they'd go well on a Christmas tree.`
`It was flashy, and beautiful, and cute, and perfectly fitting for the grand entrance of the Great Witch...Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}.`
`"......Oh, if it isn't Lambda.`
` .........I was hoping to meet you in the party hall."`
`"I love you, Bern.`
` Isn't whispering of our love all the better if we're alone?"`
`"......I'll be happy to hear it, after I've plucked off all your limbs."`
`With a jerk of her chin, Bern ordered her familiars to attack.`
`"This is my dearly beloved and only friend in the world.`
` Her arms from the elbow down. Her legs from the knees down.`
` You can chew those up however you please.`
` But not a scratch anywhere else on her."`
`The crowd of cats undulated again, reformed into a single mass,`
` and became the emerald‐green leviathan that would swallow up any poor victims who snuck into the City of Books.`
`It was shaped like an impossibly vast whale.`
`However, would it look like a whale from Lambda's perspective?`
`She probably couldn't see anything except an immense mouth about to swallow up everything.`
`"Ah, simply wonderful.`
` You're going to swallow me up with your love, aren't you?!"`
`"......I do love you, Lambda.`
` Once your limbs are gone, I'll skewer you through your butt and hang you by my bed.`
` Every morning, I'll give you a good morning kiss, and every evening, I'll kiss you goodnight."`
`"Sounds great!`
` Then I'd better wrap you up in my love too!!!"`
`However, {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s war cry was swallowed up by the glowing, writhing leviathan in a single bite.`
`".........*giggle*.`
` Yes, you are wonderful, Lambda.`
` I love your gentle cluelessness, the way you just recklessly do things without looking ahead.`
` .....................?`
` ......Wind...?"`
`The same instant that {f:5:Lambdadelta} was swallowed and {f:5:Bernkastel} was sure of her victory, the latter felt a slight breeze playing with her hair.`
`The countless sweets that {f:5:Lambdadelta} had sent flying like fireworks, and which drifted about like the decorations at a Christmas party, ......were flowing.`
` No, ......they were converging on a single point.`
`It was like watching a firework run backwards.`
`Countless sweets rapidly contracting to somewhere within the vast, closed mouth of the leviathan.`
`A gigantic reverse explosion gathering at a single inner point.`
`Or perhaps it was more like countless candies showering the leviathan from all directions like bullets.`
`......Inside that mass of green......was a black swirl.`
`That swirl was on a palm.`
`On the palm of {f:5:Lambdadelta}, who wore a defiant smile.`
`It was...a mass of super‐concentrated gravity.`
`All of the sweets, the cats, the whale, and everything else was being sucked into that one point and crunched.`
`"I'll hold you tight. ......Get over here, Bern!!!"`
`"......You're trying......to suck me in......?!"`
`All of the candies {f:5:Lambdadelta} had scattered were getting sucked back into the black hole on her palm at unbelievable speeds.`
`The pressure of the reverse candy explosion whittled away at the leviathan, crushing it inwards.`
`".........La......mb...daa......aaaa......aaaaa...!!!"`
`"Come on. ......Let me give you a hug."`
`With all her strength, {f:5:Bernkastel} held her ground in midair, trying to resist this supergravity.`
`For the first time, all trace of condescension had left her face.`
`Even {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s cocky expression was marred by the sweat trailing from her forehead.`
`......Because their power was so overwhelming, any victory would have to be instantaneous.`
`If either relaxed in the slightest, they would match each other's strengths and get dragged into another dizzyingly long fight that could last for centuries.`
`Neither of them had any desire to go through that again.`
` .........So, neither of them showed the slightest mercy for their most beloved friend.`
`By now, the leviathan had been completely crushed and compressed inside the black hole.`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} was the only one still holding her ground.`
`However, a windstorm of candy asteroids like an asteroid belt repeatedly slammed into {f:5:Bernkastel}, wearing away her girl form bit by bit.`
`".........I've got to get away...... .........I'll......really............`
` .........?!?!"`
`The next thing to fly into {f:5:Bernkastel}'s range of vision......`
`...was a comet hurtling straight for her, with a massive present box at its core and a cloud of candy surrounding it.`
`"Lambdaaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aaa!!!`
` Waaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhh!!!`
` Gyaaaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahh, my...body......gaaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhhh!!"`
`The candy comet wiped out {f:5:Bernkastel} along with her scream.`
`It burst into little bits, then within a blink of an eye, it was sucked back into a hole of supergravity.`
`Once it was all gathered into one place like a gem, it began to spin rapidly.`
`It was flattened by the centrifugal force, turning into something whose shape resembled a galaxy.`
`After swallowing all of the cats and their master,`
` it now looked like a winding, flickering, emerald‐green galaxy that floated just above {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s palm.`
`The pocket of supergravity kept compressing it further and further,`
` .........until, at the end, it had become a single, green, shining konpeitou.`
`Then, it fell...`
`down onto her outstretched palm.`
`"Sorry, Bern.`
` ......I wanted to play with you always, so I've always taken it easy and pretended to be in a pinch."`
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} held the konpeitou above her head and peered at it.`
`"But the truth is, I'm just impossibly strong.`
` .........Sorry."`
`Then, ......she pressed the konpeitou to her pink lips,`
` ......gave it a light kiss, ......and bit down.`
`"............This...doesn't taste like Bern."`
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} licked her fingertips, ......then turned to face the empty air behind her.`
`".........I already knew,`
` my beloved Lambda."`
`"Ahh, I love you too, Bern......"`
`"Liar.`
` .........You're never.........serious with me.........and I always knew it."`
`"In that case,`
` ......let's show our love for real.`
` .........With both of us......serious."`
`"Ahh, I do love you, {f:5:Lambdadelta}.`
` ......I'm happy......so happy......"`
`"Ahh, I do love you, {f:5:Bernkastel}.`
` .........I'll turn you into candy and cuddle you with my tongue forever."`
`"So no matter who wins, we can keep on loving each other.`
` *giggle*giggle*, ahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!`
` That's wonderful, just wonderful...!!"`
`"Okay!!`
` Let's show our love right now!!!"`
`With a crash, crack lines appeared across the sky of the Golden Land.`
`Then, finally, the barrier of the Golden Land was breached by the fleet's assault.`
`It was a bizarre scene.`
` More ridiculous than anything anyone had imagined.`
`The sky of the Golden Land shattered like glass, and a fleet of sailboats flew in one after another.`
`They were crowded with goats pushing each other and spilling off the sides.`
`"Come, let us begin!!`
` The final banquet in the Golden Land...!!"`
`Banquet.`
` ......That wasn't some fancy metaphor, but a simple statement of fact.`
`The overwhelming surge of goat troops came in like a tsunami.`
`The residents of the Golden Land who stood defiantly were like a forgotten sandcastle on a beach.`
`A fight between a wave and a sandcastle is not a fight.`
`For the voracious, merciless goats now storming the food at a standing buffet, this......was a feast.`
`"So be it!!`
` Kill them aa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}all!!!"`
`"<Good>!!`
` Come, goats!! Bring destruction to all that has form, stillness to all that moves!`
` Despair to all who li{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}ive!!!"`
`All those who could use magic fired it off at once.`
`With a shout like a thunderclap, the goat tsunami rushed forward.`
`Everything collided at once, and there was a brilliant and terrible explosion.`
`Sparks and smoke, flying splinters and screams.`
`For just an instant, the fierce magical cannonballs fired by Beato, {f:5:Virgilia}, and the Chiester Sisters seemed to halt the goat tsunami in its tracks.`
`However, their numbers were so great that they didn't even flinch.`
`The goat wave pressed forward, over the corpses of those who had been blasted away or fallen to their knees in weariness.`
`The mound of corpses piled up, and still more goats were shot down as they tried to cross it,`
` ......so that before long, it really was tall enough to be a tsunami.`
`"Pitiful!!`
` This Golden Land you've built is nothing more than a sandcastle some kid left on a beach!!`
` Now be swallowed by the wa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}ves!!"`
`"Perhaps you would do better to think of ripples beating meaninglessly against a cliff.`
` ......A sandcastle getting swallowed by a wave?`
` Just you try swallowing my castleeee!!!"`
`Beato lifted her hands, telling the pair of battle towers that had been hidden deep in the ground that the day of glory had come again.`
`The goat tsunami looked up at it in shock.`
`After all, this time the tsunami that towered over everything......wasn't them.`
`"OPEN FIII{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}I{-}IIIRE!!!"`
`A thunderstorm of rapid‐fire ballista rounds rained down from the battle tower gun ports.`
`{n}The goats let out a confused scream at the furious tempest that was bearing down on them.`
`However, they saw something else too. `
`......In the sky high above the tower......was a reaper astride a divine horse and backdropped by the moon,`
` ......with a massive spear the size of a tower in its hand.`
`The next words came not from the reaper, but from the Great Witch seated behind it.`
`"Return home.`
` This world does not belong to you."`
`"Do it, Mastee{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}eer!!"`
`The heavenly spear pierced the ground.`
`For an instant, it looked like some divine tower was sticking out of the ground.`
`However, that was the very last thing those eyes ever saw.`
`The sacred spear was the embodiment of heaven's wrath, and the strength to bury an unhallowed city in a single stroke was unleashed upon the pack of goats.`
`With a massive explosion that resembled a volcanic eruption, goats were sent flying all over the place.`
`".........Not bad. I guess they really are witches."`
`"But is it enough?!"`
`"The enemies keep on coming!`
` It looks like we'll be the ones swallowed up after all!"`
`"At least you two seem to be enjoying yourselves."`
`"Wahaahahahahahaha!!`
` Festivals are made to be enjoyed!!`
` It seems our time to shine shall not be stolen from us after all!!"`
`"Looks like it!!`
` I'm all fired up!!!"`
`Yes,`
` the crowd of goats truly was like a wave pressing in from the sea.`
`You might be able to split a ripple on the beach with your feet, but you cannot split the sea.`
`However, witches are those who do so nonetheless.`
` Of course, that meant the other side also had one who could split apart the sea.`
`Suddenly, smoke poured from one of the two battle towers, and it began to crumble, shaking the ground as it collapsed.`
`"......Wh‐what the hell happened?!"`
`"Over there!`
` On top of the other tower!!"`
`"Erikaaaaaaaaaaaaa......`
` But of course, I should have expected your turn would come......"`
`On top of the other battle tower, ......Erika stood gracefully, wielding her scythe.`
`"I think that's enough to show the witches of the Golden Land proper respect.`
` .........All magic is fake.`
` A fantasy sandcastle that will always vanish when mystery swallows it up."`
`"......Playing witches was pretty fun.`
` I think I remember playing something like this with some older girls from the neighborhood, when I was younger.`
` So, let's bring this to an end.`
` ............Now it's time to hear your screams."`
`Erika threw that pretentious pirate hat she had been wearing this whole time into the sky.`
`With the moon behind it, Erika's form—her afterimage—vanished from the tower's peak.`
`"Where is she?!!"`
`"We have her on radar!`
` On the side of the tower!"`
`Shaking with a wild, joyous laughter, Erika dashed straight down the side of the tower.`
`She twirled her scythe like a gymnast's baton, dicing up the wall, gun ports, pillars, and everything else as she ran, leaving a trail of smoke behind her.`
`So, from the sidelines, it looked as though a line of smoke had suddenly split the tower from top to bottom.`
`The golden arrows of the Chiester Sisters chased after Erika like golden threads in a sewing machine.`
`"You monster...!!`
` Get yourself sewed and embroidered nyeh!!"`
`"Hahahaha, ahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!`
` <Good>!!`
` <Good, good, goo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}ood>, ah{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aah!!"`
`Even the golden arrows couldn't catch up with Erika.`
`Finally, Erika reached the bottom of the battle tower, and the golden bows ejected empty cartridges.`
`"Explode, useless tower!`
` ......Did I get that right?!"`
`Erika, who had now landed on the ground, slowly stood up and tapped the tower behind her with the handle of the scythe.`
`That tiny tap cut the final string that held the tower together, and the whole thing fell in on itself with an earth‐shattering crash......`
`Once again, the dark tsunami rumbled forward through the rubble and smoke.`
`"I am Furudo {f:5:Erika}, Witch of Truth!!`
` This moment marks the dismantling of the Golden Land by the truth!!`
` Dust to dust, illusions to illusions!!`
` I'll end your daydream for you!`
` Come, try to remember, you specters of the past! Remember how you died so long agooo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}oo!!"`
`The goat tsunami swallowed everything up.`
`When she saw them sink under the black sea of goats, ......Erika guffawed from atop the debris of the tower.`
`"Come on now, kill them! Massacre them all!!!`
` Cut off all their heads and stick 'em on spears!!`
` Ghosts of 1986, the time has come for the raging whirlpool of truth to swallow you whole and erase you!! So long!!!"``{f:5:Eva} had indeed broken the magic circle around the key beforehand.`
`By the time Battler and Ange reached it, it was crumbling like the sand in an hourglass.`
`They tried punching and kicking it to make it break faster, but nothing they did hastened the process.`
`"......It looks like she broke it a while ago,`
` ...but it'll still probably take some time before it's gone..."`
`"Just a bit longer, I think.`
` ......If we can just buy time for five more minutes......"`
`Judging by the speed the magic circles were crumbling and the general appearance of the whole scene, it looked like it would be over soon.`
`However, as things stood, even if it was just five more minutes, would that be soon {i:enough}?`
`They turned around.`
`......Beyond the bookshelf ravine.........was a universe.`
`Even for Battler, who had seen Beato's fights many times over,`
` the battle between {f:5:Lambdadelta} and {f:5:Bernkastel} was so mind‐defying that he couldn't think of a single word to describe it.`
`When he finally managed to find a word, it was "a universe".`
`With each development in the battle between {f:5:Lambdadelta} and {f:5:Bernkastel}, a universe was created between the pair of them.`
`A Big Bang took place, a universe was created, galaxies beyond number were born and erased, born and erased.`
`Then, just when it seemed that a Big Crunch had occurred and the universe had met its demise, there was another Big Bang, and another universe was created.`
`It was like watching gods playing.`
`The two witches created and destroyed worlds over and over again,`
` almost as though two Creators were fighting to prove that their universe was the right one.`
`If you let your guard down in the slightest, ......then just watching this would steal your soul. That's how it felt.`
`"......We'll be able to get the key back any second now.`
` ......Then, we'll be able to go back to the Golden Land with the fragment {f:5:Lambdadelta} gave us, right...?"`
`"Go back as soon as you get the key.`
` I can't leave {f:5:Lambdadelta} on her own."`
`"You're going to jump into that fight?!"`
`"I can't leave her on her own."`
`"..........................."`
`"Their fight may defy common sense.`
` ......However, they're perfectly and evenly matched.`
` So...`
`......if anyone jumps in, even a single weak {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} like me, .........something might break."`
`A perfect balance maintained by two great powers can easily break by adding even a little strength to one side.`
`However, actually rushing in there to add that little bit of strength would be literally suicidal.`
`Like a moth flying into a furnace.`
`{n}It might burn up before it even reaches it.`
`"Once you get the key, go straight back to the Golden Land.`
` .........We don't know how long they can hold out, remember?"`
`"......I can't go back alone, ......not when everyone is fighting."`
`"That's right, this is your fight.`
` So fight.`
` ......Though you regret not dying with everyone else, you must overcome that feeling and live in the future.`
` That's what you decided to do, right?"`
`".................................!"`
`Ange had no words to respond with.`
`......Her brother and everyone else would probably die.`
` So, she wanted to die in the same place and the same time as everyone else.`
`However, that would not be permitted, and she knew she mustn't wish for it.`
`She had already made up her mind.`
`She had sworn......to live in the future, without turning back to look at everyone's deaths.`
`"When you get back to the Golden Land, show the key to Beato.`
` Beato will show you two doors.`
` ......Then, she'll give you an easy puzzle, and tell you to open one of them.`
` ......That's...the last game on my game board."`
`"......Two...doors......"`
`"Of the two, one will lead you to the future.`
` ......Don't worry.`
` I'm sure you won't choose the wrong one now.`
` Also, once you go through it, don't turn back until the door closes."`
`"Why can't I turn back?"`
`"Once the door closes, you won't be able to see our fate anymore.`
` ......In other words, we'll be shut inside the cat box."`
`"A fate inside a cat box......has endless truths."`
`"That's right.`
` We might've lost pathetically, or we might've made a miraculous comeback and survived.`
` In other words, if you, the Witch of the Future, are sent into the future without witnessing the end of our conflict, we'll still have a chance at victory."`
`"However, if you keep on looking at us, you'll see when we get annihilated.`
` That'll put the odds of our defeat at 100%.`
` So, to give us a miraculous victory, you must not turn back once you go through that door!`
` Got it?!!"`
`"Y‐......yeah........."`
`"So, I'll go and help {f:5:Lambdadelta}.`
` If you go back to the Golden Land after seeing me walk off like a hero, that's how my story will end for you."`
`"......The result of your battle will be sealed in the cat box.`
` ......So, you can never "lose"."`
`"Exactly.`
` So don't look back.`
` You'll have the key soon.`
` Go back to the Golden Land like your life depends on it.`
` ......So, real quick, I have one message for the you of the future.`
` Don't forget it, and engrave it into your heart!"`
`"Okay, ......okay......!!"`
`"......No matter what happens, never abandon the hopes that keep you alive.`
` All of us are always behind you.`
` ......If you just believe, we can even speak to you!`
` You hear me? Believe!`
` If one thing is certain, it's that miracles happen when you believe!"`
`At that moment, a massive explosion engulfed {f:5:Lambdadelta} and {f:5:Bernkastel}.`
`Surely, one of them had landed a powerful blow.`
`There were no further explosions, ......so surely, that strike had decided the match...`
`When the smoke cleared, ......who would be left standing...?`
`The magic circle sealing the key still needed several minutes to dissolve...`
`"..................Are you...still there...?`
` My beloved......{f:5:Lambdadelta}......?"`
`All that came into sight.........was {f:5:Bernkastel}.`
`There was no answering voice from {f:5:Lambdadelta}.`
`If this was a sign of {f:5:Bernkastel}'s victory, it didn't cause her expression to grow any brighter.`
`"............Too bad, Lambda.`
` ......And I thought we'd be able to build a universe together.`
` ...It's too bad, really too bad."`
`......{f:5:Bernkastel} was still focusing all her nerves on the battle.`
`So, she took no notice of Battler and Ange by the key.`
`......However, she would probably notice soon.`
`{n}And then, there would be nowhere to run.`
`The last circle of the magic circle was starting to fade away.`
`However, almost cruelly, the final circle went slower than the rest...`
`Seeing that, any hopes that it would dissolve in a minute, or maybe a few dozen seconds,`
` ......were crushed absolutely.`
`Battler readied himself.`
`"......Well, this fight probably won't work out as well as the last one,`
` ......but it looks like I'm up now."`
`"Onii‐chan......"`
`"You're great, Ange.`
` I'm proud that you didn't try to stop me."`
`With tears still pouring down her face, ......Ange lovingly rubbed her cheek against the hand that had been patting her head.`
`"............I've got to gather the kitties again.`
` ......I thought Battler would be with her, but I don't see him for some reason.`
` ......After all, one guy like him would be about as annoying as a pebble in my shoe."`
`The smoke cleared completely, ......and they saw a huge cloud of candy bits floating around, ......like it was {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s corpse.`
`A star‐shaped cookie bounced off of {f:5:Bernkastel}'s head.`
`It was missing one of its points, giving it a lonely feeling.`
`".........{f:5:Lambdadelta}.`
` ......Live with me.`
` ......We'll become a single universe, with you inside me."`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} chewed the cookie...and swallowed it.`
`"This way, we'll always be together........`
` I love you, Lambda."`
`{a:c:`
`"Me too, Bern."}`
`{f:5:Bernkastel}'s stomach suddenly swelled like a balloon.`
`The bulge rose from her stomach to her throat, then exploded like a firework from her mouth.`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} coughed up fireworks, sparks, and fragments of candy.`
`"You still haven't gotten out of your old cat habits?`
` .........You know you shouldn't eat snacks you find lying on the ground."`
`"La...mgu...ghkahh{0}khhh{0}khhk...dah...aaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}aahhhh!!"`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} kept coughing and spitting up exploding fireworks.`
`The birth of a small universe from that sweet had hit her directly from the inside of her stomach.`
` Even {f:5:Bernkastel} couldn't withstand that.`
`As she repeatedly vomited fireworks so violently that it seemed her guts would spill out, her body flickered in and out of existence, and she glared at {f:5:Lambdadelta} with a terrifying expression.`
`Her body was flickering because she had taken so much damage that even maintaining her form was now difficult.`
`"How unbecoming, Bern.`
` Your form is in disarray."`
`"*cough*, *cough*hack*, uuuggghhh, ......Lambdaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}ahhhkk, *cough*!!"`
`"I sort of felt like losing for a bit.`
` .........But I changed my mind.`
` If I became a single universe with you,`
` you wouldn't whisper to me of your love anymore."`
`".........True.`
` ......I'm not the type to give food to a fish I've already caught."`
`"I know.`
` That's why you shine so beautifully.`
` ......You'll lead others on, but never fawn on anyone, just like a proud queen of cats."`
`"I'll turn you into a cardboard box and make all your sides my scratching post!!"`
`"And I'll make you a shamisen, get bored after plucking one string, then put you in a cupboard and let the dust pile up on you!!!"`
`The goat tsunami had swallowed up everything, but sea spray was still flying about.`
`The reefs resisted the ocean trying to cover them, smashing waves left and right.`
`The Seven Sisters of Purgatory and the Inquisitors specialized at close‐range combat, and were rapidly building a mountain of corpses.`
`The witches fought hard too, but they would have preferred to fight at a distance if they could.`
`Just relying on fantasy creatures wouldn't be enough.`
`In these battle conditions, all of the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s were thrust right into the center of the fight.`
`Everyone in the Ushiromiya family displayed a fighting spirit equal to the witches and guarded their backs.`
`Even {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s are not powerless.`
` They have guns.`
`If the goats supported fantasy, they could use these as the ultimate anti‐magic weapons.`
`If the goats supported mystery, they could use these in a much more obvious way.`
`Those .45 Long Colt bullets delivered fatal wounds to each and every goat they struck.`
`"You stubborn vermin!!`
` How long are you going to resist?! Will you just...! Lie down and...! Sink into your watery grave!! Ushiromiyaa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aaa!!"`
`"If you tell an Ushiromiya to sink, you'll just make him fight all the harder!!`
` Little girl, you have no idea what the Ushiromiya family is!!"`
`"{i:You} were dead even {i:before} 1986!!`
` It's about time you stopped moving, gramps!!"`
`Erika's razor‐sharp scythe buried itself in Kinzo's chest.`
`It dug straight into his heart, but the daring smile on Kinzo's face didn't even falter.`
`"Hoh, ......and was my death ever witnessed by anyone outside the cat box?`
` I am indestructible...... INDESTRUCTIBLE!!"`
`A punch containing all of Kinzo's last spark of life sent Erika flying.`
`"Father, Father, are you okay?!!"`
`"March over my dead body and onward!!`
` An Ushiromiya never turns back!!"`
`As Erika tried to deliver the finishing blow, Krauss stepped in between them, blocking the way.`
`"......I will be your opponent in Father's place."`
`"Oh?`
` If it isn't the incompetent investing expert.`
` It's pretty impressive how you managed to find all the worst bets and lose your money so quickly."`
`"And yet, at least I remember to tie my shoes."`
`"Huh?"`
`Erika tried to look down at her own feet, ......but what she saw was Krauss's left fist.`
`"?!?!"`
`Krauss's left uppercut made Erika float in the air.`
` Not by magic, but by the simple laws of physics.`
`For an instant, Erika saw the moon......`
`"I may have been incompetent as an investor!!`
` However, any of my college friends will attest to my talent as a boxer!!`
` I will not allow you to discredit every part of the Ushiromiya family, little girl!!"`
`"You...damn......small fryyyyyyy!!!"`
`‘......Kanon is an illusion......`
` An illusion created by a lonely Jessica......’`
`"At the school festival,`
` I introduced Kanon‐kun to everyone!!`
` Saku, and Hina, and everyone else!!`
` All of my friends can testify to that!!`
` Don't make assumptions about our relationship based on your own imagination!!"`
`Jessica's body blow made the goat's massive body cave in.`
`"Splendidly done, Milady!`
` To think that you can wield such power in a tight spot like this...!"`
`"Well, sure I can!`
` That's 'cause, even if I died right now, I think I'd be cool with it.`
` ......This is the first time we've worked together, with you at my back.`
` Too bad it's not cutting the cake...!"`
`Jessica gave a embarrassed grin.`
` ......She looked even more relaxed than she had on the stage at the school festival.`
`"If we can't cut a cake, then let's cut something else."`
`"You always try to sound cool with every thing you say...!"`
`"But I like it that way!!"`
`The massive bodies that rushed at them, trying to deny their relationship and their very existence, had two choices: to be sliced or struck.`
`Each time one of those bodies hit the ground, it became proof that the two of them existed.`
`‘......Shannon is an illuuuuuuusion!`
` George is an anti‐social shut‐in!`
` Their love itself is an illusion and doesn't exiiiiiiist!!’`
`"George‐sama, look out!!!"`
`The goat's log‐sized fist buried itself in George's face.`
`They were in the middle of a tightly packed melee.`
` There was no way to dodge an unexpected attack like that.`
`‘............?!?!’`
`"......An anti‐social shut‐in, is it?`
` .........Very well.`
` Say what you wish about me."`
`George had indeed been hit with a fist right to the center of his face.`
`However, ......he didn't bend over backwards. Not even an inch.`
`The goat started to worry. What exactly had he hit?`
`Hadn't he punched a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} made of flesh......?`
`It was as though......he had slammed his fist into a steel wall......and it was his fist that was hurting...`
`However, ......the goat was too scared to move his fist from George's face.`
`After all, if he did, ......the expression on that face would probably be terrifying.`
`George's hand......knocked that fist away.`
`"You could probably get testimony from my old classmates from school.`
` ......Yes, I was an anti‐social person.`
` ......However, there's one more thing that they'll tell you, something far more important."`
`George was only grabbing the goat's massive fist in his tiny hand.`
`However, that fist was being crushed as though it had a vise around it......`
`Even though the other hand was so tiny, ......the goat couldn't even move its fist.`
`"......Ushiromiya George never fought for himself, no matter what happened to him.`
` ......He was a coward who ran away from all threats.`
` ......Everyone will tell you that.`
` .........However, they won't tell you that he never got into a fight."`
`I accepted the fact that someone as pathetic as me would be bullied.`
`"However!!`
` There were people who took my side in spite of all my flaws!!`
` And when THOSE people were bullied or harassed,`
` NEVER,`
` EVEN ONCE,`
` did I tolerate it!!!!"`
`The goat's broken teeth flew through the air.`
`{n}George's leg split the heavens.`
`‘......Sh‐......Shannon approached George for his money, and......’`
`A goat's filthy finger touched Shannon's back.`
`That finger......exploded and boiled away.`
`"My love for George‐san is true and pure.`
` ......George‐san must have kept all the letters I wrote him.`
` Read those, and you'll have your proof."`
`‘......Y‐......you can write anything in a letter...`
` ......The contents of a letter are no proof of true lo—’`
`A blazing red light charred the goat's entire body.`
`......Shannon slowly turned around, her face full of rage and contempt.`
`"Pitiful spectator, ignorant of love.`
` You have not even the capacity to read the hearts of others, much less a mystery.`
` ......Disappear......!!"`
`An absolute barrier rose up around Shannon, incinerating the goats around her with its intense heat.`
`"Kihihihi!`
` Yeah, maybe we are dead.`
` But that doesn't give anyone the right to criticize us!`
` No one can deny the love Mama and I shared...!!"`
`Maria grinned, showing her teeth, and performed her job without even looking at her hands.`
`Then, she gave the fully loaded rifle a rough toss up into the air.`
`".........Come and get some."`
`Rosa, who stood back‐to‐back with Maria, caught it without turning around.`
`No, that wasn't quite it.`
` Maria's throw had landed the gun directly into Rosa's already outstretched hand in a precise blind exchange.`
`Rosa's head was pointed at the ground......as she stroked the frigid trigger with her index finger.`
`"If any of you doubt my love for my daughter, ......step forward."`
`The crowd of goats, cowed by Rosa's ferocity, ......dared not approach.`
`"Then I will deny it.`
` ......Being the serial cheater you are, you were always off playing around with a man and leaving Maria all alone!!"`
`"Nothing like that is written anywhere in Maria's diary.`
` Kihi{0}hi{0}hihi."`
`"Y‐you should know better than anyone else...!!`
` Rosa didn't love you!`
` She was a total shithead of a mother who regretted even giving birth to you!!!!"`
`Erika peered at the unfeeling moon, ......the taste of metal in her mouth.`
`For a moment, she couldn't make sense of her new situation.`
`Was that cold feeling on her back......the ground?`
`Huh?`
` ......Why am I......lying down......?`
`And wasn't the moon full?`
` Why isn't it now...?`
`Come to think of it, ......my teeth...hurt.`
` ......There's something cold...and hard.`
`Then, she figured it out.`
`She was lying sprawled on the ground, with a gun barrel shoved into her mouth.`
`And the thing splitting the full moon.........was the angry king of wolves protecting its child.`
`"...............gahahk........."`
`The gun barrel exploded inside her mouth, shattering her medulla oblongata.`
`......But it was only her afterimage.`
`"What a terrifying woman you are. Are you really {y:0:Huma}{n:0:huma}—"`
`Having escaped death at the last moment by leaving an afterimage,`
` ......Erika was confronted at her new location by the glint of metal, which had been there even before she reappeared.`
`The fountain pen went right through Erika's eye, crushing it.`
`Of course, that was another afterimage.`
`However, when Erika escaped and reappeared somewhere else, a heel was already there waiting for her......`
`From the goats' perspective,`
` ......several afterimages of Erika seemed to have appeared at once......and all been taken out simultaneously by Rosa......`
`".........If you say that again, I'll have to get serious."`
`"Mama's really strong, kihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi!!"`
`"............Wh‐......what the hell......"`
`And so, Erika couldn't reappear anymore.`
`{n}At the very least, not within Rosa's range of attack.`
`Erika put a lot of distance between her and Rosa, reappearing in midair.`
`"......What.........are these people?!`
` What......the hell?!!`
` ............?!?!"`
`Erika's animal instincts made her turn her head slightly to the side just in time.`
`Where her head used to be, there was an odd shower of sparks.`
`It wasn't magic.`
` It was a real physical phenomenon cased by lead smashing against lead.`
`To think that two bullets shot from different angles......could have flown with impossible precision at where her head once was...`
`...so that both of them hit and bounced off each other like billiard balls.`
`"......Aw, so close."`
`"Sorry about that.`
` We're big fans of the whole "take out the boss first" strategy, you see."`
`"You know, we're pretty good at clay pigeons.`
` Flying along in a straight line probably isn't a good idea."`
`The two of them spun their rifles in exactly the same way at exactly the same time, reloading them in a way that put old westerns to shame,`
` then pointed them back up at where Erika was in the sky.`
`"Y‐`
`.........you monsteeeeers!!"`
`Once again, their accurate shots plunged through the forehead of Erika's afterimage, bouncing off each other like billiard balls with a shower of sparks.`
`This time, Erika appeared far behind them.`
`She had to admit it.`
` She had been forced to escape to a place outside the range of those guns fired by {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s.`
`Then, the light from the moon was blocked.`
`The place that she had fled to so rapidly exploded, sending chunks of rubble flying.`
`A massive longsword had been plunged into the ground.`
` ......It was Dlanor's sword.`
`"......Oh......`
` If it isn't my old friend......!"`
`"...................................."`
`Erika had dodged it by a hair, ......but this bulky, brutal longsword was more of a cannonball shaped like a sword than something for cutting with.`
`Despite the successful dodge, the blast of air pressure made her eardrums throb.`
`Dlanor was serious.`
` She had seriously intended to smash Erika to bits.`
`"What's with the scary face?!!`
` Can't you try and act a bit, I don't know, cuter?!"`
`".........Do you find this {f:5:enjoyable}?`
` Destroying people's dreams and {f:5:illusions}?"`
`"Of course it's enjoyable!`
` What do you expect an intellectual rapist to do?!"`
`"You are an {f:5:evildoer}.`
` ......And yet, I used to believe you were the sort of evil that could be sympathized {f:5:with}."`
`"I never asked for your sympathy."`
`"......Not cutting you down immediately upon our {f:5:meeting}...`
` That sin of mine is what helped bring this day to {f:5:pass}!!"`
`Dlanor's hair bristled with rage.`
`Seeing this expression on the one she had once called a friend......pinned Erika to the spot.`
`"My {f:5:friend}.`
` ......Allow me to free you before you can {f:5:suffer}.`
` I will not allow you to bear any further {f:5:sins}!!!"`
`"Whoa, ......wai— ...............!!!"`
`The force of anger that welled from Dlanor's whole body struck Erika.`
`Or rather, the swirl of blasting wind from Dlanor's massive longsword sent her flying.`
`As Erika took leap after leap backwards to escape the bladed cannonball, it smashed apart the ground in the spots where she had just been.`
`So, it almost looked as though Erika herself was smashing the earth beneath her with each backwards jump.`
`"Dlanor............"`
`"......Friend of mine,`
` rest in {f:5:peace}!!!"`
`Once more, the great longsword split the air and pulverized the ground.`
`However, this time, Erika was nowhere to be seen.`
` ......Where had she escaped to?`
`This time, Erika had broken the barrier of the Golden Land and landed on a ship whose bow was barely in sight.`
`......Practically speaking, she had run away.`
`Fully aware of this, Erika howled, her face contorted with humiliation.`
`Her shoulders heaved with her breathing, ......and she had even forgotten to fix her hair......`
`The scythe fell from her hand and landed with a clank to the floor.`
`{n}That sound brought her back to her senses.`
`"You good‐for‐nothing goats!!`
` What are you standing around staring for?!!`
` Open the gun ports!!`
` Load concept negation explosive rounds!!`
` Don't worry about aiming, just fii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}ire!!!"`
`The warships that had flown into the Golden Land opened their gun ports one after another, then they all fired at once in a scattered mess of cannonballs.`
`The hundreds of explosive rounds they fired would negate the concept of any thing or person they touched, smash them into little bits, and set them ablaze with flames.`
`The battlefield full of writhing goats became a fiery hell.`
`A cannonball smashed the arbor.`
` The once‐beautiful garden maze was burned down piece by piece and the fleeing gold butterflies were drowned in flames, burning into nothingness like little scraps of paper.`
`This was no longer a battlefield where two sides fought for victory.`
`{n}It was just a confused, hellish pot.`
`The Golden Land...was being torn apart.`
`The once‐beautiful rose garden was filled with explosion craters, and its rose petals were scattered about without pity.`
`Flying bits of flesh, blood, fangs, jaws.`
` Shrieks and half‐crazed screams.`
`And even amidst this hellish swirl, the goats and the dead continued to fight.`
`As seen from atop the boats, ......this was, without a doubt, hell.`
`"All ships!!`
` Drop anchoooooooors!!"`
`When Erika yelled, the goats on the boats ran around frantically, and one by one, massive anchors hanging by chains were thrown from the ships' bows down into the earth below.`
`Those anchors smashed through not only the ground, but the bottom of the Golden Land itself, digging in with their wedge‐shaped tips.`
`"Erikaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!"`
`"Oh, {f:5:Beatrice}‐san!!`
` What a huge battle this is!`
` I was worried that I wouldn't be able to find you!"`
`{f:5:Beatrice} landed on the front tip of the warship, facing off against Erika, who stood on the bow.`
`"You will not be forgiven! I'll finish you myself right here!!!"`
`Beato jabbed with her pipe.`
`It transformed into a beautifully intricate, long, and golden sword.`
`"Very well, bring it on.`
` Let's settle this."`
`Erika threw her scythe up into the air.`
`When it returned to her hand, it had become a sword similar to Beato's.`
`The nearby goats crowded around Erika, trying to support her.`
`"Stay out of this.`
` Anyway, you all need to start lifting the anchors!`
` Tear up the Golden Land by its roots!!"`
`{i:Aye aye, sir!}`
` The goats saluted and rushed to their posts.`
`Several dozen ships had lowered their anchors, digging into the base of the Golden Land.`
`Soon, they were going to pull them up, ......and try to tear the Golden Land to pieces.`
`"Come, Erikaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!`
` I'll give you the honor of my final duel!!"`
`Beato raised her sword, bowed in the ancient fashion, and waited for her duel opponent.`
`Erika kicked off her shoes violently and slowly walked up to the tip of the boat barefoot.`
`Then, in accordance with Beato's rules, she bowed back.`
`A duel on the prow of a ship that pierced the sky.`
`Below, the crowd of goats was being blasted away by the indiscriminate cannonballs, burned up and crushed in the panorama of this world's end.`
`Even thinking about who among the Ushiromiya family was still all right......was now ridiculous.`
`Yes, it truly was the end of this world.`
` The end of the Golden Land.`
`Ground to dust, filled with flames.`
`The golden rose garden was burning spectacularly, the air filled with a shower of burning sparks and gold dust.`
`The ground, the base of the Golden Land, creaked as fissures ran through it.`
`All of the ships started pulling up their anchors at once.`
` Crowds of strong goats used all of their monstrous strength to lift them.`
`The anchors that dug into the Golden Land's base......spread cracks throughout the entire Golden Land.`
`Not just the ground, but the air itself was filled with cracks, and shards of gold fell down everywhere.`
`The Golden Land's end was adorned with the flames of hell and streaking gold fragments, with fiery red and ephemeral gold.`
`Atop the boat's prow, Beato and Erika looked down on this, their swords crossed and sparks flying between them.`
`"Now there's one hell of a sight to see!!`
` Don't you think it's fitting?!`
` The perfect final chapter for your tale...!!"`
`"The Golden Land may meet its end.`
` I may perish as well.`
` However, no one can erase the fact that we were here!!`
` Ange reached the answer!`
` The Witch of the Future has a mission and hope, and will soon go off on a new journey!!`
` We have already succeeded...!!"`
`"Too bad, Furudo Erikaaaa!!`
` This battle ends with our victory!!!"`
`A duel between the master of the illusion called the Golden Land and the witch who controlled truth.`
`The earth split behind them.`
` The Golden Land was torn up.`
`The cat box known as the Golden Land was ripped apart, and the nothingness below peeked out through the cracks.`
`The scrambling crowd of goats fell through the gaps and were swallowed by the sea of nothingness.`
`......Beato's friends were also among them.`
`They helped each other, stretched out hands to each other, intending to hold on to everyone to the very end.`
`......But that is such a fragile fantasy, and what romantic optimism it is to embrace it......at the end of the world.`
`The ground shattered and sank.`
` It fell apart into the ocean of nothingness.`
`None could survive.`
` None could be saved.`
`{n}This was...destruction.`
`As the friends fell into the sea of nothingness, they looked up one last time...and prayed.`
`They prayed that the master of the Golden Land would leave proof that the Golden Land had indeed existed.`
`However, Beato didn't look down at them.`
` They wouldn't have wanted her to.`
`"This is our Golden Land!!`
` I am the Endless and Golden Witch {f:5:Beatrice}, and I am here!!`
` Though we may fall, we will not suffer defeat!!`
` You will become living evidence!`
` I'll carve the proof of our existence into your chest!!"`
`"So long, {f:5:Beatrice}!!`
` This marks the end of your execrable endless game!!`
` Fall into the depths of hell, you illusion!!!!"`
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} and {f:5:Bernkastel}'s fight to the death had passed through its phase as a dynamic clash of fireworks, and was now a clash that was quiet and motionless.`
`......These two witches, who possessed power on an entirely different level, may have been truly equal in strength.`
`The battle could only be resolved by mutual consent, if one of them lost interest or found some reason for wanting to lose.`
`Since both were putting their all into the fight without yielding a bit, they were absolutely and completely equal......`
`"......{f:5:Lambdadelta}......`
` ......I'm glad...to have you as a friend..."`
`"Dammit, just a bit longer...!`
` Just fall apart already, stupid magic circle...!"`
`Battler got irritated and punched the magic circle, but there was nothing he could do except continue to watch over it.`
`After all, the only way to dissolve it was by waiting.`
`However, the pair of them still felt relief, if only a little.`
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} really was strong.`
`{n}Even in a battle this spectacular, she fought on an even footing.`
`No, ......if you also took confidence into account, she seemed to have a slight advantage to Battler's eyes.`
`She would probably manage to buy them enough time.`
`{n}Ange would take the key and be able to return to the Golden Land.`
`They just had to endure a bit longer...`
`.........However, they had no way of knowing what {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s fate would be after this.`
`She had disobeyed the Senate, the highest‐level witches in existence.`
` ......A brutal fate probably awaited her.`
`However, even knowing this, Ange had to step forward into the future, without looking back.`
`......That was the single duty given to her, the Witch of the Future.`
`".........Onii‐chan, ......what's that...?`
` Something's coming towards us from a long way away."`
`"......?!`
` Crap, ......are they enemy reinforcements...?!"`
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} and {f:5:Bernkastel} were glaring at each other, so they didn't notice.`
`Heading towards them from the distance......were several emerald‐green glints.`
`That light showed that they were enemies.`
`"But there's only a few of them.`
` ......They won't be a match for {f:5:Lambdadelta}."`
`".............................."`
`All of the cats so far seemed like fish in a school,`
` giving the impression that they'd be terrifying as a group, but not much of a problem by themselves.`
`However, there was something different about the lights approaching them now.`
`.........They were approaching in a beautiful, ordered formation, like a constellation.`
`Battler quickly realized that this was something formidable......`
`".........My miko.`
` Isn't it about time to prepare the key...?"`
`Just by her tone, Battler was able to tell just how great a witch this was.`
`The black cats that surrounded her in a graceful and systematic constellation...`
`were all wearing large capes with elegant designs.`
`......It looked as though great overlords from many worlds had been transformed into cats, leaving only their capes untouched.`
`What Battler imagined was quite true.`
` That was exactly what had happened.`
`These were the overlords from many worlds that formed {f:5:Featherine}'s personal guard.`
`Their bodies took the form of cats merely as a sign of respect to their master, who took the form of a human.`
`These were entirely different from the pack of wild cats that served {f:5:Bernkastel}.`
`"......Auaurora...`
` ......Oh, is it that time already...?"`
`"Keeping the guests waiting in anticipation is an important factor when holding a party.`
` ......It is, however, not something I am particularly fond of."`
`As she said this, her eyes flicked to {f:5:Lambdadelta}.`
`The latter bowed hurriedly.`
`Though {f:5:Lambdadelta} grinned, she was also sweating with a brow furrowed with tension.`
`"............How long it has been, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}."`
`"A pleasure to see you...`
` Great Lady {f:5:Aurora}......"`
`"......This is no place to entertain one such as yourself.`
` ......Did you get lost on the way to the party...?`
` If so, allow me to guide you there myself."`
`"Th‐......that would be an honor, Great Lady {f:5:Aurora}......"`
`{f:5:Featherine Augustus Aurora}.`
` ......The legendary Great Witch.`
`It is said that she transgressed the limits of a witch, becoming a Creator,`
` .........and that, upon reaching this forbidden plane, she was cursed with a deadly ailment.`
`However, in life, she once turned her pet cat into a witch.`
`They say that this second witch wanders the sea of fragments endlessly, searching for any fragment capable of reviving her master from the pit of death called boredom, if even for a moment.`
`......And the cat did revive her master.`
`{n}Revived the sacred witch who had reached heights none should reach......`
`Just as witches look down from a higher world and sneer at {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s, calling them pieces on a game board...`
`...so {i:she} looks down from a world higher still and sneers at the territories of witches, calling {i:them} pieces on a game board.`
`......If a witch's strength is measured by the height of the world they are capable of reaching...`
`...then she was like a witch come back from the realm of the gods, the one who had touched the highest, forbidden heights and survived.`
`Was there any chance of winning against her?`
`No.`
`Not only could {f:5:Lambdadelta} not choose to win, she couldn't choose to lose either.`
`"My miko.`
` Would you mind playing with your friend some other time, and getting back to work now?`
` .........Prepare the key."`
`".........Okay..."`
`"*cackle*cackle*.`
` The simple, naive way cats forget their errand partway through doing it is their true charm.`
` ......Don't you think so, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}......?"`
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} didn't say anything, but hung her head low.`
`......From this position, it seemed that the key's seal would dissolve at any second.`
`However, {f:5:Bernkastel} would probably find Battler and Ange before that.`
`Once those two got their hands on the key, they could leave this place immediately.`
` ......But that was only if {f:5:Bernkastel} and {f:5:Featherine} didn't find them first.`
`.........{f:5:Bernkastel}......couldn't be allowed to move from this spot.`
`"......Looks like that's game, Lambda."`
`".............................."`
`"I am the miko of the Great Witch {f:5:Aurora}, remember...?`
` You haven't forgotten that the Witch of Theatergoing bestows her protection upon her Reader mikos, have you......?"`
`Still keeping her head lowered, {f:5:Lambdadelta} gave no answer.`
`The Witch of Theatergoing gave protection to her Reader mikos.`
`If {f:5:Lambdadelta} attacked {f:5:Bernkastel}, who was a miko,`
` .........then the great {f:5:Aurora}, in accordance with her contract, would take that as an attack against herself, and "respond accordingly".`
`"......Let's make a deal."`
`"......For what...?"`
`"Where is Battler hiding?`
` If you come clean, we'll let all of this slide."`
`"Is the Witch of Miracles afraid of a tiny, little piece like Battler?"`
`"......It's because I {i:am} the Witch of Miracles.`
` ......I won't forget that even a little pebble like him is capable of creating one."`
`"It was a little pebble that got a big break as the Witch of Miracles, after all."`
`"I'll ask one more time. Where is Battler?"`
`"......................................."`
`"......Too bad, Lambda.`
` It looks like that's your answer."`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} turned her back on {f:5:Lambdadelta}.`
`Then, she told her master that she was leaving to prepare the key, ......and she started swimming towards the key room.`
`............If I let her go...any further, ............she'll find Battler and Ange......`
`Battler readied himself.`
` This time, it was his turn to become a sacrifice.........`
`Even though he was nothing more than a single pebble, ......he could still put out an eye.`
`A candy firework exploded right in front of {f:5:Bernkastel}.`
`".........Lambda.`
` ......You really are a moron."`
`"L‐......{f:5:Lambdadelta}........."`
`"..................I've done it now......`
` ......Battler, Ange.`
` ......The rest is up to you...!"`
`The cat overlords changed their formation, becoming a ferocious constellation that surrounded {f:5:Featherine}.`
`Then, each drew the most terrifying of magic circles from their respective worlds...and began to chant.`
`".................................`
` ......I am slightly confused.`
` ......My miko, and you too, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}.`
` ......What sort of sideshow is this...?"`
`".........It looks like Lambda wants to stop me from going to get the key."`
`"Hoh.`
` ......And what would the point of that be, I wonder?"`
`"If you're having trouble understanding {i:that},`
` ......then you must be getting a bit tipsy, {f:5:Featherine}.`
` Looks like you need a pick‐me‐up."`
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} acted as tough as she could.`
` Her fingertips were shaking slightly.`
`"............An attack against a miko is considered to be an attack against her master.`
` ......You should know this as well as anyone, correct...?"`
`"I know it.`
` ......That's the rule that says I'm gonna have to pick a fight with you guys."`
`"Hoh.`
` .........Have I or my miko caused insult to a miko of yours?`
` If so, then please accept my apologies."`
`"But will you not tell me?`
` I don't believe you have a miko at the moment.`
` ......How long have you had one?"`
`"As for that......`
` I've got a ton of them...!!`
` Thirty or forty, I think.`
` Maybe even more!"`
`"I, {f:5:Lambdadelta}, will handle any fight picked against one of my mikos, no matter who the opponent is...!!`
` All of them are certain that a happy ending will come!!`
` As the Witch of Certainty, I can't abandon people who put their faith in certainty and work hard to achieve their goals!!!"`
`".........Your tale would not be a disagreeable one.`
` It would be worthy of my viewing.`
` ......However, I am not a spectator at the moment, but a performer.`
` ......I know that you are my miko's close friend, so I will give you one warning.`
` .........Remove yourself from this stage.`
` I will prepare a special seat for you in my audience seating."`
`"............I've been thinking about which is more interesting—your tale, or the tale I've been watching."`
`"......And your conclusion?"`
`"Battler's tale is a hundred times better...!!`
` Sorry, but I'll be getting Best Supporting Actress this year!!`
` ......Hey, you guys!`
` You'd better vote for me in the last character popularity contest, okay?!`
` At least in the top 5! Got it?!"`
`"............Who are you talking to?"`
`As {f:5:Lambdadelta} pretended to joke around, ......she calmly glared at the one weak point.`
`If she had a chance for a single attack, .........then a one‐in‐a‐billion shot at victory existed.`
`That horseshoe‐shaped memory device floating around {f:5:Featherine}'s head.`
`{n}Without that, she couldn't preserve her own being.`
`Destroying it would be impossible,`
` ......but if {f:5:Lambdadelta} could just jar it a little, ......she might be able to make it bug out.`
`At least once in the past, {f:5:Featherine}'s memory device had been damaged, and her personality and appearance had changed.`
`......However, she was aware of that herself, ......and probably wouldn't let that happen again no matter what.`
`"......Very well, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}.`
` When you've finished your script, feel free to send it in whenever you wish."`
`"The script is simple.`
` ......Just one line.`
` "The fantastic, cute {f:5:Lambdadelta}‐sama...`
`took out the evil mastermind Auaurora in a single shot!""`
`"Foolish Lambda.`
` ......I never realized how stupid you were."`
`"......The cats need not interfere.`
` ......I will personally reward Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} for the courageous tale she has submitted.`
` ......You will be granted a fitting tale and a fitting ending for your bravery."`
`"{f:5:Featherine Augustus}......Auaurora{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aa!!!"`
`{f:5:Lambdadelta} summoned magical power from her whole body and raised it in a mass above her head.`
`"Forgive me, but—"`
`And then, the world's time stopped.`
`"Your script will not be used.`
` ......After all..."`
`Rather than time stopping, ......it was more like someone had stopped flipping the pages of a book.`
`In this motionless world, ......closely packed letters appeared.`
`"The one writing the rest of the script...will be me."`
`They were the tale that had been written up to this very moment.`
`{e:85:{f:0:"FEATHERINE AUGUSTUS......Auauroraa{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}a{-}aaa!!!"}}`
`{e:85:{f:0:LAMBDADELTA summoned magical power from her whole body and raised it in a mass above her head.}}`
`That was where the paragraph ended.`
`In this frozen world, {f:5:Featherine} sat with her arms crossed.`
`"......How troublesome.`
` ......It's been so long since I've written a fight scene.`
` ......After such a development, how vexing it is to be suddenly handed the pen......"`
`When I get stuck writing, I try to write in reverse.`
`In other words, instead of starting at the beginning, I start at the end and go backwards from there.`
`That way, it's easier to set up foreshadowing, and I can write the story with my vision for the end in mind.`
`......The only downside is that it is surprisingly difficult to write the climax without having set up the story first.`
`".........For lack of a better idea,`
` I'll start at the end of the fight and go back from there.`
` ......Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta},`
` having suffered defeat at my hands, you draw your last breath."`
`As {f:5:Featherine} said this, words were added to the massive group of letters that filled the frozen world.`
`However, she was starting from the end, so there was a large gap between the new words and the old ones.`
`"......So, what will your defeat look like?`
` ......You should probably have a heroic end to suit your bravery."`
`"......How about this?`
` You get blasted away by......something or other, slammed against a bookshelf,`
` your limbs snap off, and then, having perished, you fall into the darkness and disappear.`
` ......Yes.`
` Quite a flashy way to go.`
` ..........Good. For now, that's how your final moments will be."`
`The blanks were being filled up with the outline {f:5:Featherine} spoke of.`
`At the same time, {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s figure was wiped out.`
`After crossing her arms and thinking again, {f:5:Featherine} pointed in a suitable direction.`
`Spreadeagled against the bookshelf {f:5:Featherine} had pointed at, reappeared {f:5:Lambdadelta}, who had slammed into it after "something or other" blasted her there.`
`".........Well now, I must write up the fierce battle that leads to this end,`
` ......but as you correctly surmise, I'm a little tipsy at the moment.`
` ......I'll fill that part in later, when I have some time to go over it nice and slowly."`
`"......For now, let this be enough.`
` I promise to add in a heroic fight to your liking later on......"`
`{f:5:Featherine} snapped her fingers.`
`......{f:5:Lambdadelta}......had no idea what was going on.`
`Before she could even blink, ......she was suddenly here, slammed against a bookshelf.`
`"......W...h......a...t.........i...s......t...h...i...s............"`
`She couldn't comprehend {i:what} it was that {f:5:Featherine} had killed her with.`
`However, that was only natural.`
`After all, even {f:5:Featherine} herself hadn't decided.`
`However, {f:5:Lambdadelta} did understand one thing.`
`She was already dead.`
`Streams of blood dripped from the corners of her mouth.`
`Then, lines of blood appeared on her wrists and ankles, her elbows and knees.`
`She looked like a marionette doll of herself.`
`".........W...h......a...t.........{0}k...{0}i...{0}l......{0}l...{0}e...{0}d.........{nobr:m......e}......"`
`"Precisely, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}.`
` Let me know if you have any good ideas."`
`"......Y...o......u.........{0}m...{0}o...{0}n...{0}s...{0}t...{0}e......{0}r........."`
`Still pinned against the bookshelf, ......{f:5:Lambdadelta} let her head slump.`
`Her wrists, ankles, legs, arms, ......and neck.`
`Each of those broke off as separate parts, ......and the marionette shaped like her lost its strings, falling in pieces into the depths below.`
`Nothing remained.`
`It was all swallowed up by the darkness beneath them......`
`"A monster, she says.`
` ......Quite a compliment, for one such as I.`
` ......*cackle*cackle*cackle*, ahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha."`
`"......L‐......{f:5:Lambdadelta}......"`
`"Ange, ......don't look. You can't look......!!"`
`Ange closed her eyes tight, shedding bitter tears.`
`She must not look.`
`The Witch of the Future......must not accept {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s defeat...`
`"She hasn't kicked it!`
` She was brave, and that's all there is to it...!!"`
`"I know...!!`
` That {f:5:Lambdadelta}......would never lose...!!"`
`Pop.`
`At that moment, there was a slight sound, ......and the golden key that hung in the air...shook.`
`......The seal on the key had finally broken.`
`Battler grabbed it immediately.`
`However, at exactly the same moment, a magical impulse shook the entire vast space of the key room.`
`"Wh‐what?!"`
`That impulse...seemed to have shaken something inside my pocket.`
`I stuck my hand in......and found that the fragment {f:5:Lambdadelta} had given us to return to the Golden Land......had shattered.`
`"......D‐dammit, ......Lambda's fragment...!"`
`"......You were so close too.`
` Now, there's nowhere to run."`
`"{f:5:Bernkastel}......"`
`"If Lambda had been a little cleverer, she probably could've bought you five more seconds.`
` ......Then, you would've taken that key and escaped to the Golden Land.`
` ......Looks like the miko suffers too when the master's a fool.`
` Ahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha."`
`"............Hoh."`
`{f:5:Featherine} quietly showed her surprise.`
`......To truly surprise her was no easy task.`
`The Witch of Miracles, who boasted that no one could even step on her shadow unless she wished it, ......fell.`
`After taking Battler's right fist to her face, she fell.`
`{f:5:Bernkastel}'s body immediately split into dust and reconstructed itself in front of Battler.`
` As though nothing had happened.`
`However, she was holding her cheek.`
`{n}She couldn't undo the fact that she had been hit.`
`For the first time in a hundred years, she had let someone tread on her shadow without wishing it.`
`Her expression gradually filled with shock.`
`And Battler's?`
`.........It couldn't be seen.`
`His outstretched right arm was blocking it, so his expression couldn't be seen......`
`"................................."`
`".........Wh‐.........what?"`
`"...............Take it back."`
`"T‐.........take what back.........?"`
`She didn't let the next strike hit her.`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} vanished like mist, then reformed a short distance away.`
`However, Battler had only missed by a hair's breadth.`
`Not because she had intentionally made it so, ......but for real.`
`".........Ow... .........Ouch, ouch........."`
`Finally, she truly began to feel the pain of being punched in the face.`
`Too many years had caused her to forget the very concept of pain.`
`Very slowly, ......it was coming back to her.`
`"Ow! ......Owowow! ......Owwwww!!"`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} writhed in anguish, holding her cheek.`
`{n}The feeling forgotten for centuries seemed to be hitting home hard.`
`Battler looked at her.`
` Their eyes met.`
` ......Once again, {f:5:Bernkastel} remembered an emotion she had forgotten for hundreds of years.`
`".........Does it hurt?"`
`"...............!!!"`
`"The pain of your words ridiculing my friend.........is greater than that."`
`And then, a shudder.`
`What Battler saw before his eyes......was {f:5:Bernkastel} trembling with fear for the first time in centuries.`
`To {f:5:Bernkastel}, it didn't even look like Battler was rushing at her to deliver another punch.`
`It was as though......she was being sucked towards where he stood with his furious fist raised.`
`As her eyes opened wide in terror, ......Battler's massive fist filled her vision.`
`Of course, he wasn't capable of hitting her.`
` {f:5:Bernkastel} was just like a shadow.`
`It was true that trying to grasp her form was meaningless, akin to growing envious of the moon reflected on the water and trying to hit it with a stone.`
`You cannot smash the moon on the water's surface simply by throwing stones at it.`
`However, Battler threw. And threw.`
` Over and over.`
` Determined never to allow the moon to appear there again.`
`Fiercely thrown pebbles tore the water's surface.`
` They smashed the moon's reflection, splitting apart the water's surface itself, ......leaving even the bottom of the pond bare, ......breaking through everything.`
`And that certain and absolute willpower...broke through to a miracle.`
`A backwards kick that Battler shot out without even looking behind him...drove into empty space.`
`In that space......{f:5:Bernkastel} reappeared with a foot in her gut.`
`"Geh.........hagh....................."`
`"......Take back your ridicule of our brave friend."`
`"Uuh, ............ghh......ggggghh..........."`
`The Witch of Miracles fell.`
` For the second time, she fell.`
`Once would have been a miracle.`
` Things that happen more than once......aren't miracles anymore.`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} understood.`
` Battler...had her fully grasped......`
`Then, she fell, ......slammed against the floor, .........struggled up onto her hands and knees, and vomited.`
`She threw up violently over and over.`
`{n}Her face was covered with pain and vomit and tears and snot.`
`Then, she looked up at Battler with a furious expression.........and howled.`
` And she wasn't howling at Battler.`
`"A‐Auaurora...!!`
` Y‐your miko is getting beaten up!`
` What are you standing around watching for?! Take him out!!!"`
`"Forgive me, but I am busy writing Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s final moments right now.`
` ......I cannot come to your aid.`
` ............Why don't you all give her a hand?"`
`{f:5:Featherine}'s guard, the cat overlords, now formed a different constellation.`
`Then, each drew a magic circle and began chanting.`
`"Ahah, ahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!`
` You know what these are?! Each one of these cats is the final form of a main character, each from a game like yours!!`
` Every one acted the main part in their heroic tale, and the story of their bravery was given honor, allowing them to become {f:5:Aurora}'s guards!!`
` Each one fought for the very existence of their country, their planet, their universe!!"`
`"What about you?!`
` Ahhahaha, at best, you've just been playing around with your little sister and some imaginary witch!!`
` These main characters are on a totally different level from you!!`
` Eat this and die, take it to the gut, you pukespittle scum!!!"`
`"O‐..................Onii‐chan.........!!!"`
`The many spectacular magical spells displayed the beginning of a universe, the creation of planets, then their destruction and the universe's end, all in an instant.`
`After that, not a speck of dust should remain......`
`However,`
` when the smoke cleared, there was a person standing there.`
`It stood there...............its hands in its pockets......and its head hanging quietly.`
`Its face was in shadows and couldn't be seen.`
`"......Onii‐chan..............."`
`"What......the hell......?"`
`Battler...seemed to be completely uninjured.`
`Not only were his clothes not burnt, ......his hair hadn't even been disturbed.`
`"Wh‐......what the hell?!?!`
` Stupid cats, that didn't work at all!!"`
`The cat overlords silently shook their heads, sending a short report to their master.`
`"{ruby:Endless Nine:99.9999999}..."`
`"What......the...............?"`
`"It seems that no one can interfere with their tale.`
` Forgive me, my miko.`
` It seems the cats have reached their limit."`
`"......A‐and you call yourselves overlords of many worlds?!!`
` Didn't you all use to be main characters in some game board?!`
` And this is the best you can do?!`
` You're pathetic!!"`
`The cats knew.`
`They had known from the very beginning.`
`{n}If this man before them was the main character of this board, ......they wouldn't be able to interfere.`
`"......My miko.`
` Creating a tale on the game board is a privilege extended only to the Game Master.`
` ......Since that right has been asserted, I, being the mere writer that I am, must respect it.`
` I shall return to my position as a spectator."`
`"Y‐you useless master...!!!"`
`"...............Battler.`
` I apologize for the ridicule your friend suffered at the hands of my miko.`
` And I see that the right to weave your game belongs to you, the Game Master.`
` You will weave your own game.`
` That is as it should be."`
`"......................................."`
`"However, my miko is also a Game Master in your game at the moment.`
` ......It seems the two of you opened the game board at the same time.`
` It is rare to have two Masters for a single game, but this miracle pleases me.`
` ......After all, I can rest assured that this will make for a proper final game for you both."`
`".........Stand up,`
` {f:5:Bernkastel}."`
`"............I see...`
` ......So, you're saying that if two Game Masters are going to fight, ......they should do it by the rules of the game...`
` .........*giggle*, ......*giggle*giggle*.`
` ......Why didn't you just say that in the first place......?"`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} slowly got to her feet and made her body melt away like mist.`
`Then, she appeared in the air once again, facing Battler.`
`"Very well.`
` ......I'll fight by the rules of your game board.`
` However, I'm not as patient as you all are, so I'll start with a short‐tempered, overwhelming puzzle and end this in an instant.`
` Who will be my opponent?`
` I don't mind if you both take me on at once."`
`"Onii‐chan, I'll fight too."`
`"............Stay back."`
`"Why...?!"`
`"Watch from there.`
` And this time, ......understand what I wanted to teach you."`
`".........Onii‐chan......"`
`"How's that?! {f:5:Aurora}!"`
`"......I will be your witness.`
` If you defeat my miko, I promise to return you all to the Golden Land."`
`"*giggle*giggle*.`
` Assuming the Golden Land still exists, that is."`
`"I.........believe in everyone."`
`"That's right...`
` Beato...and everyone else......won't lose...!"`
`"*giggle*, *giggle*giggle*giggle*...!!!`
` In that case, it's better that we start with the bad news.`
` .........Erika, you can make your report now.`
` Come!"`
`When {f:5:Bernkastel} snapped her fingers, Erika appeared with a bow.`
`"Pardon me for the interruption, my master."`
`"......Sorry, Erika.`
` I shouldn't have kept you waiting when you came bearing good news."`
`"No problem!`
` Rejoice, my master.`
` I have come to report the complete destruction of the Golden Land!"`
`"......Liar!!"`
`"The Golden Land has been totally destroyed.`
` I'm here to report that it has collapsed and fallen into the sea of nothingness.`
` Not just the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s, but the fantasy creatures as well have been completely annihilated."`
`"Liar!!`
` I won't believe it!"`
`"......Then allow me to convince you.`
` Take this, my master."`
`Erika humbly presented an object wrapped in cloth.`
`It shone with a golden light.`
`"......What's this?`
` A golden apple?"`
`"This is the heart of {f:5:Beatrice}, master of the Golden Land...!"`
`"B‐......Beato.........!!"`
`".............................."`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} grabbed hold of it, held it aloft, and gazed at it.`
`"......Even like this, it's still beating.`
` ......You're so cute, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` ......The game board that you are might be opened again by someone.`
` ......You still believe that, don't you......?"`
`"I‐it's okay, Onii‐chan...`
` We didn't see Beato get defeated...!`
` This is some sort of tactic they're using on us.`
` A tactic to make us lose our morale...!`
` Or maybe it's a tactic of Beato's!`
` She changed herself to pretend that she's been defeated.`
` There's no way that {f:5:Beatrice}...that everyone...that the Golden Land......could be destroyed......!!"`
`"*giggle*.`
` .........*giggle*giggle*giggle*, ahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hah{0}hha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha!!`
` True, if the Witch of the Future believes that, she might be able to make it so...`
` .........So, let me show you.`
` Watch closely, Witch of the Future from 1998."`
`{f:5:Bernkastel}......threw the golden heart into the air like an apple.`
`Then, with the blood‐red blade of a scythe that appeared in her hand, ......she split it......`
`"{p:1:{f:5:Beatrice} died in October of 1986.`
` Therefore, the Golden Land she created was completely destroyed.`
` Your relatives, kept alive in the Golden Land, were destroyed along with it.`
` Your father, mother, and of course Battler...will never return to you again, and will never speak your name again}."`
`".....................Ah......"`
`"A Witch of the Future has the power to interpret things how she pleases and rewrite what happened.`
` ......However, there is just one fact that she can't overwrite, no matter how much she struggles."`
`"......And that is...death.`
` You cannot overturn any notion of death, be it physical or mental.`
` ......It is the single blade of truth with which witches of the past can strike down witches of the future......"`
`".........Ah, ...............ah, ......ah............"`
`"Hang in there, Ange."`
`"............But, ............but..............."`
`"You decided to accept it, didn't you?`
` ......You decided to live on, even if no one came back alive, ......didn't you......?"`
`"......I know...... ......I know, but... ............I know, but...!!!"`
`Even so, ......a tiny sliver of hope......had remained inside Ange's heart.`
`A hope that despite everything, just maybe,`
` ......if I was blessed with a miracle,`
` .........someone......would come home after all.`
`It wouldn't matter when.`
` It could be ten years later or fifty years later.`
`{n}It wouldn't even matter if they didn't recognize my face......`
`I believed that someone might come back someday......`
` ......And I had decided to live with that tiny hope in my chest.`
`......Even though I had accepted everyone's death for a time, ......even though I had seen it in the Book of the Single Truth,`
` even so, ......I thought.........what's the harm.........in believing in a miracle.........just a little.........?`
`A miracle that you believe in when you know it won't happen.........is hope.`
`And so, the witch who presided over the fact that miracles don't happen.........had ruthlessly torn that hope away.`
`"Don't cry."`
`"I know...!!`
` But, ......but!!"`
`"Even the big brother you're crying to right now......is already dead."`
`"Onii‐chan isn't dead, he's here!!`
` Right here!!!"`
`"Don't cry, Ange."`
`"But, ......but!!!"`
`"Don't cry!!!"`
`At Battler's shout, Ange bit back her tears.`
`"If it's like that, ......then so what?`
` .........What do we of the past mean to you living in the future?`
` .........Ange.`
` What witch were you, again?"`
`".........Huh?"`
`"Whether we're alive or dead means nothing to you."`
`"Th‐that's not true...`
` I want you to be alive...!"`
`"That's not what I mean!!`
` You can cross over life and death, remember?!!"`
`Ange didn't understand what he was telling her.`
`So, stunned into silence, she frantically considered what her brother was trying to tell her.`
`Battler slowly lifted his face......and stared at {f:5:Bernkastel}.`
`"............And you...aren't a witch.`
` .........You're a reaper."`
`"That's right.`
` I have the sickle that reaps all hope and miracles.`
` So I must be what you say."`
`"......You're a reaper...who stole away the hope that kept Ange alive...`
`......and lured her towards death."`
`The one who teased Ange with truths of the past, stealing the future from her eyes and making her look only at what was already behind her.`
` And the one...who thrust the hope‐crushing Single Truth in front of her, gently pushing her from behind as she, of her own accord, took that step from the skyscraper's roof off into a world of nothingness.`
`"Now, I'll free Ange from the curse that you are!!`
` No more will her old curses hold her prisoner!!`
` Ange will step forward into the future!!`
` But not into the emptiness of the abyss that you're trying to lure her into.`
` ......She'll step into the future beyond 1998, a place where she will live strongly!!"`
`"{y:0:Human}{n:0:Human}s are wretched creatures, who walk into the future while staring back at the past!!`
` That's why they fail to notice even the most obvious pitfalls, and plummet headfirst into them like comical fools!!"`
`"Come, {f:5:Bernkastel}!!!`
` A witch of the past like you can't block the radiance of the future!!"`
`"Aha, ahha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha!!!`
` Then I'll get started, by the rules of your game!!`
` I'll give you some locked‐room riddles.`
` But since I'm short‐tempered, overpowering, and easily bored, I'll give you all of them at once!!!"`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} spread her hands, and it seemed as though a halo or angel wings were spreading out behind her.`
`Each of the countless rays that spread out from her......was the blue‐trailing blade of a locked‐room mystery.`
`They were the countless, endless number of locked‐room mysteries that {f:5:Bernkastel} had amassed, the souvenirs she had brought back from the many places she had visited during her long travels through the sea of fragments.`
`All of those rays twisted at once...and aimed towards Battler.`
`It was as though infinite giant snakes had turned their heads to stare at him.`
`".........If you fail to shoot down even a single puzzle,`
` then this is goodbye.`
` I'm not as patient as Beato, who gave you until October 5th at midnight to give your answer.`
` If you don't answer immediately, you die."`
`In that case, this wasn't "mystery" anymore.`
`{n}This wasn't an intellectual game, but a merciless assault.`
`"Die."`
`"............!!!"`
`All at once, hundreds of guided lasers known as mysteries shot at Battler.`
`The complex geometric figure drawn by those blue lasers was nothing but divinely beautiful.`
`Each one was a mystery.`
` Trying to solve each one in this oppressive hailstorm would be like threading a storm of approaching needles.`
`Battler flew freely through this vast space, dodging the beautiful blue streaks of mystery as he shot them down one after another.`
`The entirety of the mystery knowledge he had built up to this day told him the answer to each puzzle.`
`Each time his eyes glowed with the answer, one of the mysteries shattered.`
`However, that mystery was only one out of hundreds.`
` This hardly rose to the level of "opposition" or "resistance".`
`".........Onii‐chan, it's impossible...!!`
` Run!!"`
`"There is no unsolvable mystery, ......just like there is no inescapable fate."`
`"Onii‐chan...!!"`
`"Watch, Ange.`
` Don't miss what I'm trying to show you..."`
`By now, the bundle of mysteries looked like one giant snake with blue streaming behind it.`
`Battler skillfully dodged it, precisely splitting its many fangs off one by one.`
`Even though he knew it was a useless resistance, like trying to pick up all the grains of sand on a beach one by one.`
`"Not bad.`
` .........Are classic mysteries your specialty?`
` Then what about twists on the genre?`
` Let's see if you can handle more and more mysteries from all times and places."`
`Even though Battler was still fighting the giant snake, wings appeared behind Bern once more.`
`And......they gave birth to seven more huge snakes.`
`It now looked like a great dragon with seven heads.`
`"Ushiromiya Battler.`
` It's true that you're a very avid reader and an expert on the mystery genre.`
` But you're still young.`
` ......There's a limit to how many books and mysteries you could've read.`
` ......Learn that this world is filled with countless riddles and tricks that you've never heard of."`
`"......Onii‐chan!!`
` This isn't possible anymore!!!`
` Please, just run away!!`
` You can't beat {f:5:Bernkastel}!!"`
`Battler's expression remained calm.`
` However, his whole body was covered with sweat, and he was breathing hard.`
`It was clear that he couldn't overcome this onslaught, though he himself refused to admit it.`
`Battler wiped away his sweat......and fixed his gaze on the eight snake heads that surrounded him in three dimensions...`
`"......Ange.`
` .........You believed in the miracle that someone from your family might still be alive,`
` and after living that way for twelve years, ......you lost heart.`
` You gave in and succumbed to the miracle that refused to happen."`
`"..................That's......"`
`"In that case,`
` ......if I'm going to be seeing you off as you try and step forward into the future,`
` ......I can't afford to give in to another miracle."`
`"That's right.`
` But I'll still harvest your miracles and hopes.`
` All of them, without mercy."`
`What was now an eight‐headed dragon......opened its eight jaws.`
`It looked for weak points from all angles, hoping to swallow Battler in a single gulp.`
`He wouldn't be able to dodge any longer.`
`"Ange‐san.`
` ......If you're expecting a miracle, then I have some bad news for you."`
`".........?!"`
`"Beato has now been completely destroyed, and that has even been announced in red.`
` Do you know what that means?"`
`"..........................."`
`"Since Beato has been destroyed, the Golden Land has been destroyed also.`
` ......That means that every last one of them has vanished.`
` In other words, you no longer have any friends who can conveniently show up and save you from this pinch."`
`Beato had been destroyed, and that had been confirmed in red.`
` ......Therefore, no one else would come to rescue them.`
`......Even {f:5:Eva} was a resident of the Golden Land.`
`After helpfully breaking the key's seal ahead of their arrival, she had probably hidden away somewhere.`
`However, now that Beato had been destroyed, ......all of the residents of the Golden Land had met the same fate as ice under the sun...`
`Any faint hopes that {f:5:Eva} was hiding in the shadows, ready to save them from this final pinch...`
`had been completely crushed from the moment that {f:5:Bernkastel} had smashed the golden heart......`
`No longer was there anyone who could save them.`
`There was no hope at all of her brother being saved by any factor not already present.`
`What about herself?`
`...I'm just standing here watching.`
`If I help, will I be able to bring about some kind of miracle...?`
`But I don't know that much about the mystery genre.`
`I only have the most superficial knowledge of how to fight, gleaned from watching Beato's game fragments.`
`I'll have my work cut out just trying not to slow him down, ......so there's no way I'll be able to protect him.`
`But......I can't just watch...`
`"O‐...Onii‐chan...!!`
` Let me fight too...!!"`
`"Stay back!`
` .........Just......keep watching.`
` ......And think."`
`"Think about what......?!!"`
`"Go back to how you felt at the very beginning......back when you were six years old.........when it all started."`
`"......How I felt......when I was six........."`
`"You've lived the last twelve years looking for the truth.`
` .........But that wasn't your real, greatest wish, was it?"`
`"......My......greatest wish........."`
`"We prepared this final game......because we wanted to protect that wish and that hope.`
` But, unfortunately, you wasted it."`
`"......So you'll have to abandon that hope as you step forward into the future.`
` .........But even so,`
` even so, ......if you have strength in your heart, ......you can have it."`
`"......Have what.........?"`
`"Remember.`
` Your very first wish.`
` ............Even after learning the Single Truth, remember."`
`The Single Truth.`
`Even after learning the heartless truth, that everyone is dead and that no one will come home, ......remember.`
`Remember......your very first wish.`
`"Onii‐chan!!!"`
`There was a cataclysmic flash, as brilliant as the birth of a sun.`
`The snakes, glowing pale blue, ......ran through Battler all at once.`
`Battler was stained red, surrounded with a cloud of blood.`
`Then, he stumbled, ............and looked at Ange one final time.`
`Ange...couldn't say anything in response.`
`The light in Battler's eyes faded, .........and, slowly, ......his body began to fall......`
`It reached the ground......and landed gently, like something settling on the ocean floor.`
`Ange rushed toward him......and looked at the final face of her dead brother.`
`His eyes were opened wide, ......filled with an unwavering determination to the very last second...`
`".........Remind me, was Ange‐san particularly good at mysteries?"`
`"She's nothing compared to Battler."`
`The waving snakes raised their heads......and surrounded Ange.`
`Ange...had no blades to fight with.`
`She could only cling to her brother's dead face, saying his name over and over.`
`"This is a surprisingly boring ending.`
` ............I guess this is checkmate."`
`"................................."`
`The eight snake heads.........all attacked at once.`
`Ange held her brother's face, ......thinking about his final words......`
`My very first wish......... That could only be one thing...`
`That everyone.........would come back......`
`That fueled my life for twelve years, until I was so exhausted that I abandoned my own hope.`
`Then, in exchange for the hope I'd abandoned, I searched for the truth.`
`And at the end of the truth, ......I was confronted with something brutal and ruthless that I had no need to know,`
` ......and as a result, I was faced with the true despair of knowing that no one would come home.`
`The final hope, ......which I had abandoned but hadn't been able to let go of completely, was crushed.`
`The Single Truth.`
`If only I hadn't learned it, ......I might still have been able to keep hold of that faint hope.`
`But, ............now............`
`{a:c:You can still have it.}`
`{a:c:If you have strength in your heart,`
` you can still have it.}`
`{a:c:Remember...your very first wish.}`
`"..................Gahah, ......gahhk!"`
`Battler was coughing.`
`Impossible.`
`His whole body had been pierced, and he had been completely dead.`
`{n}For him to cough would be too much of a miracle to be possible.`
`"What?!!`
` Why?!`
` Battler died!!`
` So why, ......why was he revived?!"`
`Battler rose to his feet slowly.`
`Though blood still dribbled from his mouth, his expression was fearless.`
`However, Ange didn't stand up.`
`She kept sitting, her head lowered.`
`".........Well, that was a nice warm‐up.`
` ......Shall we get started, {f:5:Bernkastel}?!`
` Round two...!!"`
`"Wh‐what in the...... Why, my master?!`
` The dead can't revive!!"`
`"Impossible!!`
` ......{p:1:Battler is dead}!!!`
` How can he revive?!"`
`".........Onii‐chan.........is alive........."`
`"{p:1:I've used the red truth!!`
` I've said that Battler is dead}, right?!`
` So how, {i:how} can he come back to life?!?!"`
`"Even if the whole world says he's dead,`
` .........I'll be the one person in the world who believes.`
` ......Onii‐chan is alive.`
` And, someday, ......he'll come back to me."`
`"That's right.`
` ......As long as you don't lose that hope, ......there's no miracle that can be crushed!"`
`"H‐......how dare you stand before the Witch of Miracles, ......and speak of miracles yourse{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}elf!!`
` Uuu{0}u{0}ur{0}r{0}r{0}r{0}rg{0}g{0}g{0}g{0}g{0}g{0}g{0}gh{0}ghh, swallow them, grind them up,`

` You can't erase us.}`
`"Even if the whole world refuses to acknowledge it, the miracle will happen as long as we believe!!"{n}{t}"Even if the whole world refuses to acknowledge it, the miracle will happen as long as we believe!!"`
`The eight wriggling snake heads transformed into a massive whale jaw......and swallowed everything.`
`"There will be no miracle!!`
` {p:1:There exists no one whom you can trust}!!`
` So dii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}ie!!!"`
`{a:c:`
`"There is someone.`
` ......Everyone...will protect me."}`
`The cruel whale of mystery that tried to swallow everything......was gouged deeply by a massive wedge.`
`That deeply pounded wedge could only have been used by someone who had both talent and a deep love for mysteries.`
`"You call that cliché a triiiick...?!!`
` I've read and gotten bored of that one long ago!"`
`The woman who stood back to back with Battler, launching stakes, ......was very, very clearly......`
`"Beato?!?!`
` How?!`
` {p:1:I announced your death with the red truth}!!"`
`".........So what if you did......?"`
`"{p:1:The red truth is absolute!!`
` A perfect truth, which no one can overturn no matter how hard they try}!!"`
`"Even if the whole world gets together......`
`...and denies that my family is still alive,`
` .........even if that's forced in front of my eyes as the Single Truth,`
` ......I won't acknowledge it.`
` After all..."`
`Ange slowly rose to her feet.`
`Around her, ......the shapes of people slowly appeared, and they also rose to their feet.`
`One after another, a whole crowd of them.`
`They were......Ange's family, her relatives.`
` Everyone from Rokkenjima.`
`That wasn't all.`
` Everyone from the Golden Land, all of the fantasy creatures appeared, and following Ange's lead, they rose to their feet.`
`Then, all of them glared at {f:5:Bernkastel}.`
`"Even if the whole world denies my hope, I won't abandon it.`
` I won't abandon my unshakable hope that everyone's alive.`
` ......And now, I've finally gotten there.`
` .........This is it. My attitude as a witch."`
`".........Y‐you...... Weren't you just a Witch of the Future...?`
` Just a powerless witch who could only shed tears of regret for the past...?!"`
`"I am the Golden Witch, {f:5:Ange Beatrice}.`
` ......My titles are the Golden, the Endless,`
` .........and the Witch of Resurrection."`
`".........You've reached it, haven't you, Ange?"`
`"Yeah.`
` Thanks, Onee‐chan.`
` ......After all those long years, I'm there at last."`
`"I always knew you could get there."`
`"Thanks, Onii‐chan.`
` ......I understand it now.`
` What your last game was trying to teach me."`
`"Disappear, putrid delusions!!!`
` I can't...`
` I can't accept something like thi{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}is!!!"`
`"Everyone will be with me for eternity.`
` No matter how many times people try to kill them with the red truth,`
` ......I'll reject it.`
` Everyone will come back to me, again and again.`
` .........I am {f:5:Ange}, Witch of Resurrection!!`
` In my world, your red truth can't touch me!!!"`
`"Uuurrrggggaa{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}a{0}ag{0}g{0}ghhh!!!"`
`From Ange.........no, from Ange and her family and her friends, several golden streaks shot out at once.`
`They were the same as the marks left by {f:5:Bernkastel}'s great snakes.`
`However, the glow inside these...was gold.`
`Then, they wriggled, combined into one single mass, and transformed into an eagle with two wings.`
`It wasn't one‐winged anymore.`
`Thanks to Ange's absolute willpower, the golden eagle had gained the wing it needed to fly into the future.`
`Those spread wings............made {f:5:Bernkastel} and the whale shrink back.`
`"The Ushiromiya eagle never looks back."`
`"And it never gives up...!!"`
`The golden eagle easily swallowed the blue whale with its wings, grinding it to bits.`
`And it didn't let the whale's master escape either.`
`It was now {f:5:Bernkastel}'s turn to run.`
`{f:5:Bernkastel} didn't fight the golden eagle.`
` She couldn't.`
`In this world of Ange's, where even the red truth couldn't hurt anyone, just what sort of attack could have any effect?`
`She frantically ran this way and that, throwing one wedge of red truth after another at the Ushiromiya family.`
`{a:c:`
`{p:1:Ushiromiya Kinzo is dead}.`
`{p:1:Ushiromiya Krauss is dead}.`
`{p:1:Ushiromiya Natsuhi is dead}.}`
`She repeated this over and over again, ......but no one fell down.`
`Ange wouldn't accept it, so they couldn't pierce anyone.`
`"Th‐......this is......`
` Can Endless Nine really do this...?!`
` E‐even the red truth......doesn't work?!!`
` Just what is this golden truth?!!`
` What kind of truth can defeat red truth......?!!!"`
`"A believing heart.`
` ......This is {i:our} consensus.`
` ......Compared to the truth that we all acknowledge and share, your red truth can't hurt anything."`
`".........So long, {f:5:Bernkastel}!`
` ......This time, it's really checkmate."`
`"I, ......I............won't accept this,`
` I woo{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}o{-}on't!!!"`
`The massive golden eagle......finally swallowed {f:5:Bernkastel} whole.`
`It then slammed into the vast ceiling......and there was an incredible explosion accompanied by an earthquake.`
`From the cracked ceiling, along with many falling chips, ......a single black cat plummeted...and slammed against the floor.`
`Erika ran up to it, repeatedly calling out to her master, hugging it.`
`Then, she realized that it was still breathing, and simultaneous expressions of relief and shock rose to her face.`
`"......Don't worry.`
` I won't let you lay a finger on my truth, and in the same way, I won't lay a finger on your truth either."`
`"...She looks like a wet mop."`
`"Call it a free scolding for her own good."`
`"Beato.`
` Don't act too cozy with my big brother.`
` I still haven't accepted your relationship, got it?"`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` It was your own foolishness to revive me!`
` It's too late. My charming subordinates and I will be tormenting you until the day you die!!`
` And I'll make you watch Battler flirt with me every day!!`
` Wah?!"`
`"Wow, this is pretty convenient.`
` Looks like this resurrection magic has an off switch."`
`"Wha— ......Wai— .........An— ............!!"`
`Beato kept appearing and disappearing like a lightbulb turning on and off.`
` Ange seemed to be enjoying herself.`
`"Waaaaaaah, Battleeeeeeeer, Ange's being mean!"`
`"Go easy on her, Ange."`
`"Sure.`
` If you say so, Onii‐chan."`
`"Ange, you're incredible!! Uryuu!!"`
`"Ange‐sama!!`
` Congratulations on becoming a Witch of Resurrection!!`
` This way, we'll all...be with you forever!"`
`"Yeah, that's right.`
` Everyone.`
` ......The anti‐magic toxin doesn't matter one bit.`
` You'll be with me for all eternity."`
`"Nice, Ange.`
` Well said!!"`
`Everyone surged forward, squishing Ange.`
`They tried tossing her into the air, but dropped her onto her butt, and everyone laughed.`
`Ange looked a bit resentful, but when her brother lent her a hand, she got up and joined the circle of smiles......`
`A quiet applause greeted them.`
`{f:5:Featherine}, their witness, had acknowledged their victory and was clapping for them.`
`"......Splendidly done,`
` Lady {f:5:Ange Beatrice}.`
` ......In celebration of this miracle, I bestow upon you the title of Lady.`
` The tale you weaved was quite entertaining."`
`"................................."`
`"There is no need to be so hostile.`
` I am congratulating you."`
`{f:5:Featherine} smiled serenely.`
`Then, the cat overlords broke their positions in their constellation and lined up behind her.`
`It was clear that this was not only a peaceful action, but part of a solemn ceremony.`
`"You have defeated my miko.`
` And I thank you for sparing her life.`
` .........As you can see, she is my cute pet cat, which I keep to stave off boredom.`
` If she died, boredom would overcome me as well."`
`The true strength of this being, who referred to {f:5:Bernkastel} as a pet cat, had already been made clear during her fight with {f:5:Lambdadelta}.`
`Even so, Ange spoke.`
`"......I......won't forgive you for killing {f:5:Lambdadelta}."`
`"My, that doesn't sound like the words of a Witch of Resurrection.`
` Can you not revive her whenever you wish?"`
`"Huh?`
` I can revive her...?!"`
`"It's okay!`
` I'm sure that Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} has been revived somewhere, thanks to your power. There is no need to worry."`
`"Indeed.`
` She has already been moved to the audience seating I prepared for her.`
` Do not fear.`
` She is receiving the red‐carpet treatment."`
`"Really?!`
` That's......wonderful......"`
`Ange finally relaxed and let the tension leave her whole body.`
`"Well now.`
` ......Battler.`
` You are now the sole Game Master of your final game."`
`".........True.`
` That cat of yours will probably retire after that."`
`"Perhaps you should carry on with the final ceremony of your game...`
` ......My miko is as forgetful as a cat, but she can sometimes be as persistent as one.`
` I suggest getting it over with quickly."`
`".........Yeah.`
` ......I'll take that suggestion."`
`"I shall be your witness and write a detailed account."`
`"The final...ceremony......`
` .........So, even this game...is about to end."`
`Battler nodded silently.`
`Then, he stepped out of the crowd and motioned for Ange to follow him.`
`As Ange passed by each member of the Ushiromiya family, they cheered her on, giving words of encouragement.`
`Battler took out the golden key and handed it to Ange.`
`It now had the same glint it had possessed when he had first given it to her.`
`Then, two doors appeared out of thin air on either side of them.`
`They had a stately design, ......making it clear that this was a very important decision.`
`"......Am I supposed to pick one without any hints?"`
`"Of course not.`
` I'll give you a hint.`
` By now, it should be an easy puzzle.`
` A simple puzzle with two answers.`
` And you'll choose your answer by opening one of the doors."`
`"I see......`
` Okay.`
` So this is a continuation of that Halloween party.`
` I fell asleep during that party, didn't I?`
` I'm glad to finally wrap that up properly."`
`"Beato.`
` Come forward."`
`"*cackle*cackle*.`
` This is your fault for falling asleep before my puzzle.`
` I'm glad I've gotten a chance to tell it."`
`"Sorry about that.`
` It sounds like it'll be pretty tough."`
`"Uryuu!`
` You'll be fine, Ange!"`
`"Kihihihihihi, I wonder about that."`
`"*cackle*cackle*!`
` Prepare yourself. It's a tough one!"`
`"......Calm down, Ange.`
` It's an easy puzzle.`
` ............Do you remember what your brother told you at the very beginning, ...about how to choose the best possible option...?"`
`"................................."`
`"Battler, you're giving too many hints.`
` This is the triumphant return of Lady {f:5:Ange}, Witch of the Future.`
` All you have to do is watch over her."`
`"......True.`
` Then I'll hand it over to Beato.`
` ......I'm counting on you."`
`"Indeed.`
` .........Then let us begin."`
`"O‐......okay."`
`Ange gulped, then stared up at the witch's face.`
`The witch held out her {p:42:left hand}, bringing it close to Ange's face.`
`{n}Then, she slowly spread her fingers.`
`"Look carefully at my palm.`
` I'm not hiding anything, correct?"`
`"......Yeah.`
` There's nothing there."`
`"Watch closely.`
` I'll make a fist,`
` ......and then stretch out my index finger."`
`She stretched out her index finger and held it right in front of Ange's eyes.`
`"Watch the tip of my finger closely.`
` Ready? It'll be fast."`
`The witch rapidly lifted her index finger high into the air, pointing at the heavens.`
`Just as Ange looked up to see the finger raised high, it swung down as though trying to dodge her gaze.`
`In that manner, the finger swung...`
`up,`
` down,`
` left,`
` right,`
` then left again, as though Ange was playing a game of Acchi Muite Hoi.`
`Feeling as though she'd lose if she couldn't keep up with the fingertip, Ange swung her face this way and that, looking serious.`
`The witch's hand moved faster and faster.`
` Ange didn't lose track of it.`
`Then, the witch's high pointing finger took a sudden swing downwards,`
` ......and when it stopped, her index finger was curled up, and her hand was held in a simple fist.`
`"..........................."`
`"Ready?`
` I'm going to open my hand..."`
`The witch slowly opened her {p:42:right fist}......`
`And there.........was a cutely wrapped candy.`
`"Ready for the question?"`
`"Yeah."`
`"Was this a trick or magic?`
` That is my puzzle for you."`
`"Go ahead, Ange.`
` ......Give your answer.`
` Is this a trick or magic......?"`
`I...know.`
`I know what the answer is.`
`"If your answer is "magic", open this door.`
` If it's "a trick", then open that door."`
`I had already decided my answer.`
`"This is my answer."`
`I walked over to the door that represented the answer I had chosen.`
`Then, I put the golden key into the keyhole, ......and turned to face everyone.`
`"The Ushiromiya Eagle never looks back."`
`"......That's right.`
` Sorry."`
`I gripped the key tightly and twisted.`
`Then, the key and the door flashed brilliantly......and slowly faded away.`
`Beyond the door...was a strangely colored space.`
`{n}If I step into this, .........I'll reach the future I chose.`
`Before taking that single step, ......I spoke without turning back.`
`"The Ushiromiya eagle never turns back.`
` ......So I won't turn around, but I'll say this!`
` Thank you, everyone.`
` But this isn't goodbye!`
` I'll always be with you all!!"`
`"Yeah.`
` You won't turn back.`
` But we'll always be standing behind you."`
`"......That's not it!!`
` Despite it all, I still believe.`
` I'm positive......that everyone will come back!!"`
`".........Ange......"`
`"That is good.`
` ......Ange.`
` I look forward to the day when we all meet again."`
`"Ange, my adorable granddaughter.`
` We may be away for some time.`
` ......Here, don't forget this.`
` It's your prize from that quiz party."`
`A gold butterfly flew over my shoulder, landed on my palm, and turned into a scrubbing brush.`

`"......This was lying next to me when I woke up on the sofa, wasn't it?`
` ......This was...my prize."`
`"Take it back to the future with you, and treasure it."`
`"Thanks, ......everyone."`
`"......Maybe I should've taken this a bit more seriously."`
`I...took a step forward.`
`Forward...into the future.`
`{a:c:I won't say goodbye.`
`{n}So, see you later.`
`{n}We'll always be together.}`
`The wind brushed against my cheek.`
`{n}I slowly opened my shut eyes.`
`......I might have had my eyes closed for a very long time.`
`{n}Even the sparkles below me...seemed blindingly bright.`
`.........It was a strange world, with a sea of light beneath me.`
`The wind was cold.`
` ......However, it told me that I had returned to reality.`
`I was standing with one foot outstretched.........over the sea of light below me.`
`How long have I been here?`
`......Since the moment I was lured by {f:5:Bernkastel}, just about to take a step off the edge,`
` ......time has probably been stopped for me.`
`"...................................."`
`I slowly.........pulled my foot back in.`
`{n}Then, I leaned against the fence and sat down.`
`The sky...was far away.`
` But so was the ground.`
`This whole time, I've been in this sad place, so far from both of those worlds.`
`I can't...go to the sky.`
`In that case, I have to return to my world.`
`"And the elevator is probably the way to go.`
` ......I've had enough skydiving.`
` I really doubt it'll happen again.`
` There won't be any more miraculous survivals if I jump down from here."`
`After all, some Witch of Miracles has already guaranteed that a miracle like that definitely isn't happening.`
`Then, I finally noticed them.`
`The guards that President Okonogi had assigned to me.`
`They were approaching the fence with forced smiles and sweat dripping down their faces, trying not to startle me.`
`That's right.`
` I got away from these guys before jumping off, didn't I?`
`".........Did you think I was going to jump?"`
`"W‐well, you did look......uh........."`
`"......Sorry.`
` If I jumped, I guess you'd really catch it from Okonogi‐san."`
`"Ange‐san, ......it's dangerous there.`
` For now, please come back to this side..."`
`"Let me stay here just a little longer.`
` .........It's okay.`
` I won't get any sudden ideas.`
` Does one of you have a cell phone?"`
`"Y‐yes......"`
`"I want to talk to Okonogi‐san about something.`
` Would you mind calling him?"`
`The guards looked at each other, then rushed to take out their cell phones.`
`They looked like they didn't want to put me in a bad mood in case I jumped off and left them to take the blame.`
`"Th‐......the president has picked up...`
` .........Here......"`
`"Thanks.`
` ......Hello, Okonogi‐san?`
` ............Yeah.`
` Sorry for calling all of a sudden.`
` No, it's excellent news.`
` A bit of an early Christmas present.`
` ......I'm giving all of the Ushiromiya Group to you.`
` .........That's right.`
` In exchange, I have a few things I want."`
`As she gazed down at the sea of stars spread out on the ground below her, Ange spoke.`
`She spoke of how she would live from now on.`
`.........Ushiromiya Ange's...`
`strange and mysterious adventure......ends here.`
`But {i:my} life will continue.`
`After all, I now have a job to do.`
`I am {f:5:Ange Beatrice}, witch of Mariage Sorcière.`
`"Ushiromiya Ange just fell from here and died.`
` ......I am {f:5:Ange}, the witch.`
` ......I'll live.`
` As a witch."`
`"And so, your game ends."`
`As Ange opened the door and vanished from sight, ......the residents of the Golden Land disappeared as well.`
`Afterwards, only Battler could still be seen.`
`He had now finished doing everything he could for Ange......`
`"......Close the door.`
` ......I believe there was some rule about closing this door?"`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` ......The rule said that you needed two people to close it."`
`"Hey, Auntie {f:5:Eva}."`
`"Don't call me that, it makes me feel old!"`
`The two of them stood to the left and right of the door that Ange had vanished through.`
`"Ange.`
` ......Let there be happiness in your future."`
`"After all, we'll always be with you."`
`Then, the two of them held their hands out in front of them.`
`As they did, a door popped into existence and closed.`
`{n}Then, the door itself faded away......`
`"......And now, we have completed our role."`
`"Yeah.`
` ......This marks the end of the pieces' purpose."`
`"You have worked hard, both of you.`
` ......And with this, we shall clean up your game board."`
`Slowly......the world began to crumble.`
`At a glance, it looked as though the City of Books was starting to fall apart.`
`But that wasn't it.`
`Battler and {f:5:Eva}'s world...was being cut off from the City of Books.`
`The world broke apart bit by bit, and the ceiling would probably fall in soon.`
`"This is goodbye,`
` Battler‐kun."`
`"Yeah.`
` ......See you later. And count on it.`
` Take care of Ange, Auntie Eva."`
`"At least at the end, try calling me {f:5:Eva} onee‐san, will you?"`
`"................................."`
`"See you later, Erika.`
` Somewhere, someday."`
`"............Both Ange and I were Witches of Truth.`
` ......So...just what was the difference between the two of us?"`
`"..................I wonder."`
`"I was...a witch who suffered through the truth.`
` ...However, I turned my back from that truth.`
` ......She, on the other hand, was a witch who—even after learning the truth—continued to believe in her own truth.`
` .........If she was the real Witch of Truth,`
` .........then what kind of witch was I?"`
`"If you ask me,`
` ............you...aren't a witch."`
`"..........................."`
`"After all, you're the detective."`
`"........................`
` .........<Good>.`
` ...I'd forgotten."`
`"We'll meet again, someday.`
` ......Wherever there's a crime, the detective's sure to be there, right?"`
`"Yes.`
` When another crime occurs in the Ushiromiya family,`
` I promise to appear."`
`"So long, great detective."`
`"So long, my rival.`
` I look forward to the day when the two of us can cross blades again."`
`Those...were the final words the two spoke to each other.`
`A mighty roar and a cloud of dust blew by, covering everything.`
`......And then, everything vanished.`
`{n}Nothing remained.`
`{n}Battler and {f:5:Eva} were both gone.`
`The City of Books was shrouded in silence.`
`".........It's all...over."`
`"Yes,`
` Great Lady {f:5:Aurora}."`
`"......You will take care of my pet cat.`
` .........Now, I shall go too.`
` There are some things that must be cleaned up in this world as well."`
`When Hachijo made her announcement,`
` everyone fell silent, thinking they had misheard her.`
`Before too long though, the crowd exploded with a shower of questions about what she meant by this.`
`"Th‐that's...too cruel...!!"`
`"You can't do this after dragging us along this far!!"`
`"Madam Hachijo, we have come from far and wide to see it!`
` How can you......do this now?!!"`
`".........I will say it again.`
` I've changed my mind.`
` Ushiromiya Eva's diary will not be made public."`
`"A, a scam, this is all a scam...!!"`
`"Is that really Ushiromiya Eva's diary you're holding?`
` I say you cooked the whole thing up!"`
`"You think you can get away with something like this?!!`
` Show us the book!!!"`
`"Children of man can be so hideous.`
` ......Neither you nor I have the right to read what lies in there.`
` ......However, now that I think of it, this has been quite an entertaining show.`
` I was fortunate enough to witness an amusing side of children of man tonight, as they disturbed the sleep of the dead and promulgated rumors with abandon.`
` .........Let us go, Bern.`
` I have had my share of entertainment for the night..."`
`A black cat jumped onto Hachijo's shoulder,`
` and she disappeared off to the side of the stage, the Book of the Single Truth in her arms.`
`Only the angry yells of the massive crowd remained......`
`And so, .........the people gradually lost interest in Ushiromiya Eva's diary,`
` ......some even doubting whether it had ever existed at all.`
`Though the weekly magazines were in an uproar over Hachijo Tohya's apparently fraudulent claims,`
` there were some who began to voice an opinion that the Rokkenjima mystery itself was an indiscreet desecration of the dead.`
`It wasn't likely that Rokkenjima could rest in peace just because of something like this.`
`However, people became slightly more hesitant to show open interest in the Rokkenjima mystery in public.`
`An unopened cat box is eternal.`
`And so, Rokkenjima will probably never find peace.`
`However, .........even so, compared to how it was before, .........life will surely be easier.`
`.........Because, as the years pass, ......the dust will slowly pile up on it where it lies in the depths of oblivion.`
`At the bottom of the deep sea known as the depths of oblivion, ......the witches' cat box will probably get slowly buried as the years pass.`
`{f:5:Featherine}...threw a single golden rose into that sea.`
`{n}An offering to let the cat box rest in peace.`
`Let us mark the end of this long story......with the tale of that golden rose.`
`In the darkness, there was a massive roar and an earthquake.`
`When it passed, ........dawn began to rise over the endless night......`
`"Where am I............?"`
`"We're in the wreckage of an old submarine base.`
` Do you remember...?"`
`"It's where it all started."`
`"*cackle*cackle*.`
` The place where we first met, two generations ago."`
`"Hahaha.`
` Sounds pretty romantic if you put it that way."`
`Battler and Beato......could be seen in the ruins of Rokkenjima's underground submarine base.`
`The cave's mouth opened to the sea, and the gentle sound of the waves drifted in along with the cries of the seagulls.`
`It seemed that the typhoon, which had closed off the island for two days, ...had finally gotten bored and gone away.`
`Beato went down to the shore and lifted up a large sheet.`
`{n}Beneath it...was a motorboat.`
`Of course, it wasn't from the time of the war.`
` It was modern.`
`"Pile this up on the boat.`
` It's heavy."`
`"Whoa.`
` This is a gold ingot.`
` I thought they all got buried."`
`"I thought something like this might happen,`
` so I snuck this one out beforehand."`
`The single heavy gold ingot was dropped into the boat.`
`{n}I'm not sure how much this is worth by itself, but it must be quite a lot.`
`"Have you ever driven a motorboat before?"`
`"You're joking, right?"`
`"It's easy.`
` I'll teach you."`
`She wasn't used to this, but after several mistakes, Beato finally got the engine started.`
`"If you go out that way and hop from island to island, you'll see Niijima before too long.`
` Then, you can just land on a sandy beach."`
`"......Aren't you coming?"`
`"I cannot.`
` ......I am the master of the Golden Land.`
` I cannot leave this place."`
`"What's to be gained from staying?"`
`"What's to be gained from going?"`
`"Let's live."`
`".........I cannot.`
` I have already committed countless sins in countless worlds.`
` The number of lives I have taken, sins I have committed......is too great."`
`"But you haven't committed any sins in our world."`
`"No, .........that is not true."`
`"................................."`
`"Go.`
` Go while I'm still in a good mood.`
` Otherwise, I may seal the island in a storm again."`
`Battler suddenly spun around.`
`When Beato turned around to see what was going on, her body was suddenly lifted into the air.`
`"Then,`
` I'll take you back as a souvenir of the Golden Land."`
`"L‐let go...!`
` Th‐this isn't safe...!!"`
`"Enough screaming.`
` Listen carefully, {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`"Wh‐what...?"`
`"I'm going to steal you away."`
`"........................Ba......"`
`As Battler quietly gazed at her with serious eyes, Beato was lost for words.`
`"If you have sinned,`
` then it's my sin as well for making you do it.`
` ......So, let's carry your cross together."`
`".........Battler............"`
`"As long as I live,`
` ......I'll carry your cross.`
` .........Let's leave the Golden Land.`
` You and me, together."`
`Beato was now too shocked to say anything at all.`
`Then, tears poured from her eyes, and she covered her face with both hands.`
`Battler gently set her down on the boat.`
`He undid the mooring ropes.`
`......Now there was no longer anything tying this boat to the island.`
`"Let's go."`
`Controlling the boat as Beato had taught him, Battler slowly guided it out......`
`When they passed out of the dimly lit cavern, they were immediately struck by the bright rays of the sun and surrounded by a crowd of white seagulls.`
`As the seagulls flew this way and that, ......the feathers they dropped in the water seemed to celebrate the boat's departure.`
`The brilliant sunlight told them that they were now free of the island's curse.`
`......The sky, now freed from the seal of the typhoon, seemed too bright to be real.`
`Feeling hot, Battler took off his jacket.`
` .....It was swept away by the wind and danced through the sky.`
`However, instead of panicking, Battler just smiled as he watched it go.`
`Beato also watched it go.`
` ......No, she watched the island go.`
`Rokkenjima, ......and the Golden Land she had spent a thousand years in.`
`"Will I.........be able to live......?"`
`"You will.`
` ......You won't have a magical butler, but there's lots of conveniences out there in the world.`
` ......There are all kinds of things you can't find on Rokkenjima.`
` I'll...show you this world of ours."`
`".........Will I......be able to live......?"`
`Beato repeated the same words again.`
`{n}Battler knew what she meant.`
`However, no matter what answer he gave, he wouldn't be able to resolve her problem now.`
`......However, there was a way to resolve it.`
`Time...and heart.`
`{n}Little by little, bit by bit.`
`Like a chain being cut by falling drops of water, ......he would have to sever the curse of the island gradually, ......over a long period of time.`
`It might take a long, long time.`
`{n}However, someday, ......she will be free.`
`That's what I believe.`
`"I am the sinful witch, who toyed with hundreds of deaths on that island.`
` ......Your world...is too brilliant for me."`
`"No, you have to live."`
`I answered immediately and forcefully.`
`"If you think you need to atone for hundreds of sins, then keep on living and living.`
` Live as hard as you can, ......with everything you've got.`
` That's the only way you can atone."`
`"............Is that...truly the only way to atone for my sins?"`
`"That's right.`
` And you'll definitely be able to do it someday.`
` Trust me."`
`"........................Battler........."`
`"Come on, don't look at me with teary eyes.`
` It's embarrassing..."`
`"*cackle*cackle*......`
` Forgive me.`
` Then, at the very least,`
` ......would you close your eyes?"`
`"Wh‐......why should I... Hey, your face is pretty close......"`
`"Foolish man......`
` You ought to be cursed for taking the witch away from the Golden Land.`
` .........That's why you must close your eyes.`
` ......I‐...it's.........embarrassing for me too."`
`As soon as Battler shut his eyes......`
`{n}...soft lips......covered his.`
`Then, they slowly drew back.`
`He tried to open his eyes, but received a quick slap on the cheek.`
`"Don't look, I told you not to look at my face!!"`
`"C‐come on, what's there to lose...?!"`
`"You have no delicacy!`
` Don't open them, not yet!!`
` Why?`
` B‐because I want to kiss you again...!!"`
`The next kiss......was on his earlobe.`
`"H‐hey, quit it...!`
` Now this is getting really embarrassing...!"`
`He knew he'd get hit again if he opened his eyes, so he resisted with his eyes still shut.`
`Beato tickled his ear by softly blowing on it,`
` and then she spoke in her usual cheerful, bullying voice.`
`"Sorry, Battler.`
` I'm a terrible, atrocious witch."`
`"Yeah, I know.`
` You're an evil, cruel witch."`
`"And so, I cannot atone for my sins.`
` I'm the sort of witch who can cackle over hundreds of deaths...!"`
`"Ah, come on...`
` But it's just like you to say that."`
`He accidentally opened his eyes.`
`......And when he did......the witch was nowhere to be seen.`
`The Golden Witch had vanished......like a dream or an illusion.`
`......And...so had the single ingot they had carried with them.`
`A black luxury car was parked at the rear entrance of the skyscraper.`
`Men wearing suits were packing a heavy‐looking attaché case into its trunk.`
`"Let me handle all the rest.`
` We'll take care all of the troublesome work."`
`"I'm counting on you.`
` I'm sure Aunt Eva would be glad to entrust it to you,`
` the person she trusted most."`
`Out of the building...came Ange and President Okonogi.`
`Ange's expression......was peaceful.`
`It was hard to imagine that this was the same person who had always looked so dark to Okonogi.`
`"......In her later years, the company president was very ill.`
` She might have said some fairly harsh things to you,`
` ......but I don't believe that was how she truly felt."`
`"I know.`
` On my bad days, even I say things I shouldn't."`
`"...............You've changed."`
`"You think so?"`
`"......I thought you would never forgive the president as long as you lived."`
`"You're the one who taught me, Okonogi‐san."`
`"I did?`
` Did I say something?"`
`"Without love, the truth cannot be {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen}."`
`"Did I say something that pretentious?`
` Heh{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha."`
`"It's been a long journey.`
` ......It really has been a long journey, all just to understand what you told me that day."`
`Of course, Okonogi understood.`
`He understood that she had taken a long and arduous journey through her own heart.`
`"Once you've decided on your new address and bank account, get in touch.`
` I won't let you want for anything."`
`"Any problems with the Sumadera family?"`
`"Leave that to me.`
` We have your power of attorney as our rallying point.`
` Thanks to that, the Ushiromiya Group has a united front.`
` ......Because of what you did, Ange‐chan, the business built by the former president has been protected.`
` I truly believe she would be joyful at your decision."`
`"I'm just making you deal with all the hard stuff."`
`The Ushiromiya Group was shaken by the passing of their great president, Ushiromiya Eva.`
`Since there was no clear successor, the group had been in danger of splitting.`
`Amidst this, Ange, who had inherited a large portion of the group's stock, was closely watched to see how she would act.`
`......However, since Ange had shown no interest in any of this, and had gone around talking about things like selling all their assets and donating everything to some charity,`
` the group had grown very shaky indeed.`
`There was even a chance that an outsider, such as the Sumadera family, would step in and destroy the Ushiromiya Group.`
`As disturbing as it may seem,`
` it's a fact that some even wished for the center of all this trouble, Ange, to disappear...`
`......However, because Ange had a change of heart and decided to help do what was best for the Ushiromiya Group that Eva had brought together,`
` the worst‐case scenario had been avoided.`
`Okonogi had been named as Ange's successor.`
`Now that he had Ange's trust, there was no more reliable ally to be had.`
`Okonogi himself had certain plans he could carry out based on the knowledge that Ange trusted him.`
`Okonogi, who had carried great responsibility in the Ushiromiya Group thanks to his position as Eva's closest confidant, was the most natural choice to be Eva's successor,`
` and thanks in part to his ability, everything had now been wrapped up smoothly.`
`This way, the Ushiromiya Group was secure.`
`By now, the Ushiromiya Group was the only thing other than Ange herself to hold the Ushiromiya name,`
` so she might have thought of it as her last tie to her family.`
`"You know, you're free to come back any time you want.`
` We'll have a chair set aside just for you."`
`"Thanks.`
` Just knowing I have a place to go back to, I can set off on my journey in peace."`
`"What are you going to do from now on?"`
`"I'm going to become an author."`
`"An author?`
` To write novels?"`
`"It doesn't matter what.`
` It could be novels or picture books.`
` If I have any skill at drawing, maybe I'll do a manga.`
` ......What I do doesn't matter.`
` As long as I can share my heart with someone."`
`"......Sounds like you've set a noble task for yourself.`
` I'll be praying for your success."`
`"Thanks.`
` If I manage to publish a book, I'll send you a copy."`
`"I look forward to it."`
`The car's trunk was closed with a clunk.`
`{n}Apparently, all of her luggage had been loaded.`
`"Ah, yes, allow me to introduce you to the driver.`
` He's a protégé of mine.`
` He is trustworthy, and you can rely on him for anything.`
` Oh, and he worked as a guard for the old president for many years, so you might recognize him."`
`"......As long as it isn't Amakusa."`
`Achoo!`
` The man walking out of the driver's seat sneezed.`
`"Now that hurts, missy."`
`"Hey, Amakusa, just what have you done to her?"`
`"......Well, he was always the most flippant of Aunt Eva's guards.`
` I was hoping for pretty much anyone else."`
`"But he was also the one closest to you, wasn't he?"`
`"......At least listening to him talk can be pretty entertaining."`
`"The boss assigned me to be his contact with you.`
` If you ever get into any sort of trouble, just let me know."`
`"Can I send you to go buy toilet paper?"`
`"I'll even buy you some feminine hygiene products to go with it."`
`"......See?`
` The guy's a creep."`
`Okonogi guffawed.`
` I got into the back seat.`
`"Stay well,`
` Ange‐chan."`
`"I guess this is the last time anyone will call me by that name."`
`"Let me know when you've decided on a new one."`
`Okonogi patted the roof of the car.`
`At that signal, Amakusa honked the horn and removed the hand brake...`
`"So, until you've decided on a new name, I guess I'll be calling you missy."`
`"That's fine for now."`
`"......Okay.`
` Where are we going?`
` North? South?"`
`"............Any recommendations?"`
`"How about leaving the main island entirely?`
` I'd suggest north to Hokkaido.`
` ......Huge meadows, giant clouds!`
` A novelist writing stories in a log cabin... Sounds awesome."`
`"South it is.`
` ......I'd already decided to do the opposite of whatever you said."`
`"Heheh, that's pretty harsh."`
`"I'd like to go someplace warm.`
` A town with a view of the sea."`
`Ange slowly closed her eyes.`
`{n}Things had been pretty crazy lately, and she was tired......`
`"Roger that.`
` Next time you open your eyes, you'll be in an unfamiliar land.`
` ......But it'll be a warm town with a view of the sea."`
`"Can't wait to see...`
`what you choose."`
`The car got onto the freeway.`
`{n}It was surrounded by the great river of cars heading east and west.`
`By now, no one could tell which of those points was the car she rode in.`
`Starting today, Ushiromiya Ange would change her name and live in a new climate.`
`Changing her name didn't mean that she had given up on being Ange.`
`This was Ange's...`
`{n}...no, {f:5:Ange Beatrice}'s mission.`
`{a:c:`
` I am {f:5:Ange Beatrice}.}`
`{a:c:`
` The Golden and Endless Witch of Resurrection.`
` A witch of Mariage Sorcière.}`
`{a:c:`
` The final witch, who is still alive in the future called 1998.........}`
`A strong wind blew through my hair.`
`My nose was filled with the smell of the sea.`
`......I must have been standing still for a very long time.`
`This is.........a point cutting through the sea.`
`I was standing on the bow of a boat.`
` I was still holding that thing.`
`"......Missy.`
` If you stand around there too long, you'll freeze."`
`"Amakusa.........`
` ......So, this is......"`
`Captain Kawabata's face peered out at her.`
`"You can see it now.`
` That's the old Ushiromiya family dock."`
`"Whoo.`
` Not even a trace of it left."`
`".........I see.`
` ......I've come back here.`
` It's been a really long daydream.........no, a long and windy side trip."`
`No matter what sort of tales are woven and written about the past,`
` ......they have nothing to do with my tale of the future.`
`I swore to live life looking only to the future, without turning back.`
`If that vow I made to myself has any meaning, then this hasn't all been just a daydream.`
`And besides, I've brought many things back with me from that long side trip.`
`Among those, there are even some things that are immediately useful.`
`"...........................`
` ......But yeah, this isn't going to be useful for anything."`
`I threw the scrubbing brush into the ocean.`
`I threw the can of mackerel into the ocean.`
`I threw the memory foam pillow with the One‐winged Crest into the ocean.`
`I threw the old‐type white school swimsuit into the ocean.`
`I threw the fully ripe mango into the ocean.`
`I threw the decorative pine branch into the ocean.`
`I threw the uniform from Angel Mort into the ocean.`
`I threw the signed celebrity photograph of Kinzo into the ocean.`
`I threw the bag that laughs with Kinzo's voice into the ocean.`
`I threw the One‐winged Eagle carp streamer into the ocean.`
`I threw the bouquet of golden roses into the ocean.`
`I threw the music box that had been passed down through the generations into the ocean.`
`I threw the mass‐produced Sakutarou doll into the ocean.`
`I threw the tea set bearing the family crest into the ocean.`
`I threw the pocket watch bearing the family crest into the ocean.`
`I threw the {f:5:Beatrice} corsage into the ocean.`
`I threw the Battler doll into the ocean.`
`I threw the {f:5:Beatrice} doll into the ocean.`
`"......What was that?"`
`"My attachment to the past.`
` .........I was...shedding my old shell."`
`"Turning over a new leaf before stepping onto good old Rokkenjima?"`
`"......Not exactly.`
` I've quit being a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} called Ushiromiya Ange."`
`"Hm?"`
`I won't waste that long journey.`
` I now have a new way to live.`
`And that isn't as the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} called Ushiromiya Ange.`
`I am......reborn.`
`"Captain,`
` sorry, but would you mind leaving for a second?"`
`"Hmm?`
` Sure, whatever you say."`
`Captain Kawabata buried his face in the driver's seat.`
`"......What is it, missy?`
` Why the troubled face?"`
`"I feel like taking a step into a new life."`
`"You already have."`
`"True.`
` ......If I could sell off all the Ushiromiya family wealth that's burdening me, maybe donating it to some charity, that would be a huge relief.`
` Then, I'd finally be able to escape from the shell called Ushiromiya Ange."`
`"...........................`
` ......It seems a waste of all that money. You could do anything you wanted with it."`
`"Who cares?`
` My point is that I don't need it."`
`".........That may be true.`
` ......Then again, not everything that you'd be selling off belongs to you exclusively.`
` ......For example..."`
`"Are you talking about the Ushiromiya Group stock?"`
`".........That's right.`
` They may be little more than scraps of paper to you,`
` but doing something like that could shatter the whole company...`
` I don't think my boss could bear to have that happen."`
`"Yeah, I know.`
` It's like that for the Sumaderas and President Okonogi alike.`
` There are plenty of people who're in a tough spot because I can do as I please."`
`"............There's no doubt that you're a VIP, Ange‐san.`
` Instead of doing something dramatic, wouldn't it be better to keep your head down at this point...?"`
`"What would be the fastest and most convenient way to prevent this VIP from doing as she pleases, I wonder?"`
`"......Hmm, what would be the best way...?!`
` Well, we could break out the drinks, hash things out, and..."`
`"Anyone could guess that the final destination of my journey is Rokkenjima.`
` And, right now, Rokkenjima is completely uninhabited.`
` ......There's no one there.`
` No one to see or to hear.`
` Today is perfect weather for a locked room."`
`".........Well, that may be true."`
`"The Sumadera family is following me.`
` They even managed to barge into President Okonogi's building with perfect timing.`
` ......Someone leaked the fact that I was there."`
`"Are you saying my boss sold you out?`
` ......Then why would he give you a bodyguard?"`
`"Since he has no idea what I might decide to do at any given moment,`
` President Okonogi wants to have both me {i:and} the Sumadera family indebted to him.`
` And if he sells information about me, lets me escape by a hair, and keeps track of my whereabouts, he can have both me and the Sumadera family in his debt while keeping a trump card in his hand."`
`"You're definitely over‐thinking things there......"`
`Amakusa wore a forced smile, trying to smooth things over.`
`"The Sumadera family is absolutely following me.`
` My actions are being intentionally leaked to them.`
` We will bump into each other on Rokkenjima.`
` I will be killed by them.`
` After that, you will kill the Sumadera hitmen,`
` and President Okonogi will have a trump card to use in negotiations with the Sumaderas."`
`"......If I die, the Ushiromiya Group will be stable for the time being.`
` Plus, they'll be able to give a warning to the Sumadera family.`
` On the other side, the Sumadera family itself will be able to neatly do away with Aunt Kasumi, the leader of their overenthusiastic radical faction.`
` ......Both sides will finish their bargaining with a draw, and everyone'll be happy."`
`"........................Whew.`
` ......That's a pretty interesting story you've thought up there."`
`"The golf bag you brought with you.`
` I've had a look at what's inside.`
` I'm impressed... You could start a war or something with all those guns.`
` ......But one of them was a sniper rifle.`
` Would a bodyguard who's always by my side really need something like that?"`
`"Well, you never know what might happen......"`
`"Why would a bodyguard, who works best when traveling light,`
` choose to abandon his position for a whole day to get a gun like that, and right before we leave for Rokkenjima?"`
`".........Missy,`
` ......you're over‐thinking this, okay......?"`
`"When I reach Rokkenjima,`
` ......you'll suggest that I go visit the place they died or something, getting me alone.`
` That's the bait.`
` The bait to lure in Sumadera Kasumi and the others waiting for me on Rokkenjima.`
` After that, you'll use that ridiculously huge gun to end them all like fish in a barrel."`
`"......Well, what's wrong with being efficient?`
` Isn't that what a guard's supposed to do?"`
`"In addition to a cutting‐edge sniper rifle, you also had a modern German submachine gun."`
`"Those are really handy.`
` No matter how many people the Sumaderas have, I could take them all out, no trouble..."`
`"There was one more.`
` A handgun.`
` ......Even though the sniper rifle and the submachine gun were the best and the newest models, the handgun alone is beat up and old‐fashioned.`
` See?"`
`Ange......pulled the handgun out and pointed it at Amakusa.`
`"C‐......cut it out.`
` This isn't funny......"`
`"A handgun is something you're always supposed to have on your person, right?`
` So, why would you go get a second handgun, and go to the trouble of getting an unusually old one?`
` There's a theory that explains this.`
` ......That is...that it's the same kind of gun Sumadera Kasumi and the others are using."`
`"This is a Tokarev.`
` A gun once used by the Soviet military, which has gotten pretty popular in the Japanese underground.`
` A very likely weapon for the Sumaderas to be using."`
`"......Also, having Sumadera Kasumi die would be convenient for the Sumadera family as well.`
` They could have leaked......no, exchanged information from their side as well.`
` That would make it possible for you to know in advance that the Sumadera hitmen will be using Tokarevs."`
`Amakusa was speechless.`
`Was he speechless because this was all true, or because he was stunned by the determination with which Ange pointed that gun at him?`
`"The plan that you—`
`no, the plan that all of you made together...`
` It was to use me as bait to lure Sumadera Kasumi to an uninhabited island, then manipulate the scene so that it looks as though both sides finished each other off.`
` That way, everything would be settled nice and neat for both President Okonogi and the Sumadera family."`
`"......................................."`
`A single line of cold sweat dripped down Amakusa's forehead...`
`With the wind whipping through her hair, Ange spoke coldly.`
`"......All it takes is the presence of this handgun,`
` and a deduction like this becomes trivial for Ushiromiya Ange.`
` Your thoughts, ladies and gentlemen...?"`
`"............You haven't taken the safety off."`
`"I know.`
` ......Tokarevs don't have a safety."`
`Amakusa tried to dive behind cover, but he couldn't outrun a bullet.`
`It shot into his gut, making him double over in pain.`
`Knowing that he had a gun hidden in his pocket, Ange nipped any possibility of a counterattack in the bud.`
`Blood spurted from Amakusa's forehead. He did not close his eyes again.`
`".........The perfect, easiest way to confirm a death, without even being a doctor."`
`"Y‐.........you............!"`
`Kawabata showed up, all color drained from his face after having noticed the gruesome scene on the deck.`
`This time, it was his forehead at which Ange pointed the barrel of the gun.`
`"You needed time to get the boat ready.`
` That's what you told me.`
` However, if you've been bought, then we can say for sure that you were buying time so that Sumadera Kasumi could set up her ambush on Rokkenjima."`
`".........I, I have no......no idea what you're talking about...!!"`
`"You're a cat box, inside of which is a Kawabata who was bought and betrayed me, and a Kawabata who hasn't betrayed me.`
` ......Now then, how can I kill the part that betrayed me?"`
`"S‐stop...!!`
` Don't shoot......!!"`
`"I just have to shoot the whole cat box to death."`
`The boat's owner slumped over backwards......and fell.`
`Then, with a second bullet, Ange performed a perfect examination.`
`She had......survived.`
`She had now surely escaped......the expertly woven plot to kill her.`
`......Ange returned to the bow of the boat, faced the strong winds head on, and peered into the future in front of her.`
`The boat whose owner was gone...headed towards the endless horizon, on and on in a straight line.`
`She prayed that the truth she truly desired to reach lay before her.`
`Then, ......she heard the sound of clapping.`
`{n}The sound of clapping, on a boat where Amakusa and the captain were no more.`
`However, Ange didn't look surprised.`
`{n}She calmly and slowly turned around.`
`"Splendid reasoning, comrade Ange.`
` My fellow Witch of Truth, {f:5:Ange Beatrice}."`
`"......Oh, you're here, Erika."`
`"Anytime there's someone who wants to expose the truth, I am there.`
` *giggle*giggle*."`
`"Hey, Erika."`
`"What...?"`
`The boat had already passed by Rokkenjima.`
`{n}The island's silhouette was now off in the distance.`
`The boat headed towards the endless horizon, ......continuing on its endless journey.`
`The new Witch of Truth announced the beginning of this endless journey to her fellow witch.`
`".........I'll carve out my future in my own way."`
`"Sounds splendid."`
`"At the end, ......will there be a truth for me to find?"`
`"After all this, just what sort of truth are you looking for?"`
`"......................................."`
`"................................."`
`".........Hmph.`
` ......You're right.`
` I know that the truth isn't worth anything.`
` And there's one more thing I've figured out."`
`"What's that?"`
`"That bewildered look on Amakusa's face when his scheme was exposed.`
` That was pretty good."`
`"*giggle*!"`
`""<Good>!""``The majestic Witch of Theatergoing, Drama, and Spectating set down her pen, looked at the ceiling, and sighed deeply.`
`The desk was covered with a scattered mountain of paper covered with writing.`
`Words were packed onto the pages in a thin, high‐information‐density language that only the great ones could read.`
`Each letter of this language carried the same amount of information as several books in the {y:0:Human}{n:0:human} world.`
`These letters filled every inch of this huge pile of paper.`
`......Surely, she had written out every little detail of some world.`
`"............I have written all there is to write.`
` Though to be accurate, more could yet be written."`
`She stood up, sat down in her favorite rocking chair, and rocked peacefully for a while.`
`"How much must one write before they can say they've written it all?`
` ......That is what has bothered me in all my years of writing.`
` ......The adventures of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s can be very interesting as a tale.`
` However, even I still don't know when that adventure stops being an adventure."`
`"......My old friend, who is now gone...`
`once said that a {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}'s life is an adventure from beginning to end, so there is never a correct time to set down one's pen.`
` ......I do not agree.`
` I think one must put away the pen at some point.`
` I believe one should write a tale to an appropriate point, then leave the trailing notes and opinions of what follows to the minds of the spectators."`
`"......In short, the tale must be put inside a cat box at the appropriate time.`
` ......The cat box has been the subject of this long tale, so is it not better to refrain from writing the finale in its entirety, to instead put it in the cat box and leave it there...?"`
`{f:5:Featherine}......spoke to no one inside the empty study.`
`Of course, no one commented on her words.`
`However, {f:5:Featherine} seemed to hear something.`
`{n}She nodded and grinned contentedly.`
`"Yes, I know.`
` I will write a bit further, then lay down my pen.`
` ......Then, it will be time for us to say our goodbyes."`
`{f:5:Featherine} held up a finger and spun it around, a signal that she wanted to darken the room.`
`The lights in the study dimmed......`
`"Would you mind letting me rest for a while?`
` ......During that time, my cat......or rather, my miko will entertain you......"`
`"Owowow{0}ow{0}ow{0}ow{0}ow{0}ow{0}ow,`
` you suck! Can't you be less clumsy with that needle?!"`
`"......Shut up.`
` If you don't want it sewn by hand, I'll use a sewing machine.`
` Clatter‐clatter‐clatter."`
`"No! No machines!`
` I want you to do it by hand!`
` So please, just a bit more gently......owow!"`
`"It's nothing a little spit can't fix."`
`"Yeep!!`
` Tell me before you start licking me all of a sudden!"`
`"I'm going to sew you up with a long, fat needle now.`
` It'll hurt like hell, so you'd better close your eyes.`
` Five, four, three, two—"`
`"A‐and keep that stuff to yourse{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}elf!!`
` Ah, B‐Bern, d‐don't, don't, aaaa!!"`
`But despite all this, the two of them truly were close.`
`Though {f:5:Lambdadelta} had been brutally dismembered in the final fight, she had survived.`
`But, unfortunately, she was still dismembered.`
`So, {f:5:Bernkastel} was sewing her arms and head back on with a needle and thread.`
`The left arm, which was still waiting to be reattached, walked around on the bed impatiently with its index and middle fingers.`
`Only the arms were left to do, so it looked like this would be finished soon.`
`Then, Erika returned, slamming the door open.`
`"I'm home, my master!!`
` I bought some sesame salt!!"`
`"......Why sesame salt?`
` You aren't planning to put it in tea, are you...?"`
`"It's Erika's toy.`
` ......Erika, did you bring your chopsticks?"`
`"Yes, my master!!`
` Great detectives have their magnifying glasses!`
` Furudo Erika has her chopsticks."`
`"Are you ready?`
` Pour out that sesame salt and use those chopsticks to separate the sesame seeds from the salt."`
`"Yes, my master!!`
` Please watch my fantastic chopstick‐wielding skills!!"`
`"Yes, good luck.`
` ......When you're done, make sure you put everything back in the bag."`
`".........Are you still bullying her like that?"`
`"How rude. I'm playing with her.`
` .........Ah, yes, Erika.`
` The mailman just came by with a letter addressed to you."`
`"A letter?!`
` I sense a crime calling to me.`
` Don't tell me, I'll guess who sent it!"`
`".........The postmark is from Heaven.`
` It's probably from Dlanor or someone.`
` I'm surprised you're still in touch.`
` ......All it takes is the presence of this postmark,`
` and a deduction like this becomes trivial for {f:5:Bernkastel}."`
`"Hey!!`
` You can't do that, my master!`
` Van Dine's Rule #9!`
` It's forbidden to have multiple detectives!"`
`"......Then you'd better get out.`
` So long, Great Detective Erika."`
`"Nooooo, my masteeeer!! {f:5:Erika}, Witch of Truth, is here to serve!"`
`"............I still can't tell if you two like each other or hate each other."`
`"Of course we hate each other.`
` You're the only one I love."`
`"H‐how could you, my master!!`
` Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}!`
` It looks like there's not enough room for the two of us!"`
`"Are you serious?`
` ......Are you challenging the great {f:5:Lambdadelta}?"`
`Erika grinned and grabbed {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s left arm that was walking around the bed.`
`"Here is Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s arm.`
` And here is the sliced‐open end of her arm."`
`Erika grinned and wiggled her fingers menacingly.`
`"Wait, ......you aren't thinking........."`
`"Let's see if my rival can handle this."`
`"Gyah,`
` gyah{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}haa{0}haha,`
` ahh{0}hya{0}ha{0}ha{0}haha,`
` stoppii{-}i{-}i{-}i{-}it that tickle{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}e{-}es!!"`
`......She tickled the open end of {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s left arm.`
` Apparently, she was extremely ticklish there.`
`Incidentally, the open end of {f:5:Lambdadelta}'s arm was cute and fluffy with white cotton candy poking out.`
`Apparently, her body was made out of sweet candy, with a bit of spice thrown in.`
`Put your mind at ease, as there is nothing remotely terrifying about her severed arm.`
`Erika ran around, screaming "I've defeated Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} all by myself, just like my master!"`
` {f:5:Lambdadelta} growled and hissed at her.`
` {f:5:Bernkastel} kept on sewing, an exasperated look on her face.`
`It was a very peaceful scene...`
`"So?`
` What does the letter say?"`
`"Is there anything about how Dlanor and the others have been doing?"`
`"Gertrude‐san has been promoted to a full Inquisitor or something.`
` Hip hip hooray, I guess.`
` ......Ooh, in addition to her cat, she now has a {ruby:wanyan:meowoof} too."`
`"............What's a meowoof...?"`
`"What, you don't know?! You're so out of touch!`
` They've been all the rage lately!`
` Even I got a female meowoof a few days back.`
` They make awesome konpeitou too!"`
`"......I'm totally lost, but I'll make sure I stay far away from your homemade food in the future..."`
`"Cornelia‐san is.........oooh.`
` She learned that being good at martial arts gives you an edge in the Inquisitor exams, so she's started combat training.`
` Pretty hard to imagine her doing that, right?"`
`"Well, there's all kinds of combat training.`
` What's she doing?"`
`"Looks like kickboxing and Chinese Kenpo.`
` Could that be Eva's influence?"`
`".........Doesn't she look like she'd fight pretty good standing on one leg?"`
`"Good point.`
` A certain someone must've toughened her up by making her stand on one leg all the time."`
`"It also talks about Will‐san.`
` Ah, that's a surprise!`
` Looks like Will‐san hit it big on the foreign exchange, and he's now living a life of leisure on the income from his real estate investments...!`
` Sounds like he's started playing badminton lately too."`
`"......I'll bet he has a hellish coach."`
`"His butt's probably swollen by now."`
`"So, what about Dlanor?"`
`"As usual, she's stamping things,`
` stamping things,`
` sealing things,`
` approving things,`
` and {i:sometimes} even signing things.`
`"`
`"She humbly asks me to stir up a crime in her district, since she would get assigned to it personally."`
`"Well, why don't you?`
` Crime sounds fun."`
`"They do say crimes occur wherever the detective goes."`
`"Well, one of these days.`
` If I feel like it, I might drop by to bully her.`
` Oh, and there's also something here about the Chiester Sisters."`
`".........Wait.`
` I don't want to hear it all at once.`
` Let's hold off a bit for dramatic effect.`
` .........Okay, that'll do it."`
`"Ah, I finally grew my right arm back!`
` Do the left one now, please!"`
`"Let's have some tea first.`
` ......Erika, bring in a can of black tea and the pot of dried plums."`
`"Yes, my master!"`

`"......If you go north, I'm heading south."`
`"Then if you go east, I'm heading west."`
`"......I hope we can find another charming tale like this one."`
`"Next time, I hope you aren't playing the villain, Bern."`
`"You think so?`
` Being the bad guy was pretty fun."`
`"......I wonder...what kind of tale we'll find next."`
`"And what kind of tale we'll next meet in."`

` that continues to grow in leaps and bounds, the fantasy adventure novel...`
`‘Sakutarou's Great Adventure’!"`
`The projector in front of the audience showed a brief summary of the series.`
`It was...a lengthy fantasy adventure novel that was already more than eight installments long.`
`The thrilling fantasy story told of the adventures of Sakutarou, a cowardly vegeta‐lion who makes friends, learns through his experiences,`
` and grows in his search for the One Fragment.`
`The main character's catch phrase, "I'll become the King of the Beasts", was even one of the candidates for the Best Phrase to Come Into Modern Slang Award.`
`In addition to being a thrill to read, the books also contained many messages for children to learn from,`
` earning it high praise as an adventure novel that parents and kids could enjoy reading together.`
`However, it hadn't received praise like this from the beginning.`
`For the first six volumes, it went almost entirely unnoticed,`
` but last year, when foreign translations of the series began, it got its big break and suddenly became a huge topic of conversation.`
`Even before this series, the author had created quite a lot of works,`
` but none of those had achieved any public acclaim.`
`However, after this sudden rise in notoriety, her previous works were being reevaluated one after another.`
`It's probably fair to say that recognition of her works was very late in coming.`
`"Miss Kotobuki...!!`
` Congratulations on your award!"`
`"Your latest, "Sakutarou and the Witch's Island", was truly an excellent read!"`
`Publishing company executives repeatedly showered her with praise.`
`"Sakutarou's Great Adventure".`
`{n}The author's name...was Kotobuki Yukari ({p:0:寿ゆかり}).`
`Nearly all of her royalties were sent to a fund to support needy children,`
` and she herself served as the director at several protective institutions.`
`Some envious people tried to call this "fake charity", but the more that people learned about her, the more those voices withered and died away.`
`Kotobuki Yukari.`
`By now, that name rang loud and clear across Japan.`
`She sat in a chair, cheerfully chatting with the people who came to greet her.`
`Last year, it was discovered that she had developed a small tumor, and after the surgery, her physical strength had dropped sharply.`
`Because of this, even in this stand‐up awards party, she was given a chair and sat down while greeting people.`
`Some people lamented, saying that if only she had been twenty or even ten years younger,`
` ......she might have left her mark in history as one of the greatest authors in the twenty‐first century.`
`It had taken so long for her to receive the praise she deserved......`
`She could no longer be called young.`
`{n}Even so, her determination to write had not wavered in the slightest.`
`The story had gone around that, even during her stay in the hospital, most of her time had been spent typing away.`
`She always said the same thing.`
`{n}That she hadn't finished telling everything she needed to tell.`
`Did she mean that she hadn't fully completed "Sakutarou's Great Adventure"?`
`This is how she answered when this question was asked by a journalist...`
`If, by writing even one more book, I can teach just one more child how to find happiness...`
`Then I will spend the rest of my life to write every book, every page that I can.`
`Because I still haven't fully conveyed the precious teachings I was given......`
`"Miss Kotobuki, congratulations on your award!`
` I hear the movie adaptation has been getting splendid reviews as well!`
` From what I hear, you're set to break records with the best‐selling books of the year!"`
`"Thank you very much for your kind words.`
` It's more than I deserve......"`
`"Oh, I forgot to tell you...!`
` My name is Eks, head of Company X's first editorial department."`
`"It is an honor to meet you...`
` I hope we have a chance to work together sometime..."`
`"......Actually, Miss Kotobuki.`
` ......I, uh, apologize for being abrupt,`
` ......but do you happen to know of...`
`the mystery writer called Hachijo Tohya?"`
`"Hachijo......Tohya...... ......What about her?"`
`She recalled that name for the first time in several decades.`
`{n}She hadn't expected to ever hear it again.`
`"So you do know of Hachijo?`
` I don't suppose you've ever met...?"`
`"No, I have not...`
` I did go to visit once, but I was an unknown back then.`
` And, since I suddenly barged into the publishing company office, it's hardly surprising that I was refused an interview......"`
`"Oh, I didn't know that...!`
` Could it be that you were a fan of Hachijo's work...?"`
`"No.`
` I just wanted to find out what sort of person Hachijo was......"`
`"I see, I see.`
` .......Well, the truth is...about that novelist... ......Hachijo Tohya would like to meet with you discreetly."`
`"........................`
` ......To meet with...me?"`
`"Yes.`
` It would not be a formal interview or anything, just a personal meeting, off the record......`
` If you are interested, we would be delighted to make the arrangements...`
` Oh, and of course!`
` This has nothing to do with work!"`
`.........Hachijo Tohya...wants to meet...Kotobuki Yukari.`
`Just like I realized that Itouikukuro was Hachijo Tohya,`
` ......did she use my name to figure out my identity?`
`The Rokkenjima mystery, which was sometimes called the greatest social phenomenon at the turn of the century.`
`That uproar, which dragged in enthusiasts from across the world,`
` had suddenly subsided after an event held by Hachijo Tohya, where she was going to "unveil Ushiromiya Eva's diary containing the truth".`
`Though she had set up the event herself, she then outrageously disappeared without releasing the contents of the diary, drawing harsh criticism for doing so.`
`However, at the same time, this event resurrected a very, very natural feeling within the public:`
` that all of this was prying into a terrible accident with many victims only for the sake of curiosity.`
`And so, the frenzy surrounding the Rokkenjima mystery faded away quietly...`
`Hachijo Tohya.`
` No, Itouikukuro.`
`She caught the public eye as a Forger of Rokkenjima mysteries.`
`She claimed to have reached the truth, and released groundbreaking works of fiction one after another.`
` She became famous as the driving force behind the Rokkenjima mystery.`
`After realizing that Itouikukuro was Hachijo Tohya, I went to her publishing company to ask for an interview, but I didn't get one.`
`At the time, I despised her.`
`Back in the beginning, I thought she might have used the Rokkenjima mystery as a publicity stunt to advance herself,`
` .........but now I feel a bit grateful to her.`
`If she hadn't refused to show the diary in such an outrageous way,`
` the Rokkenjima cat box might still be the plaything of countless goats.`
`She is indeed a Forger who toyed with the cat box, and I still have an uneasy feeling about her.`
`However, at the same time, she is the one who, practically speaking, allowed Rokkenjima to rest in peace.`
`And......did she really reach the truth or not?`
`How is it that she reached something that {i:even from my perspective} was infinitely close to the truth?`
`Even now, all these years later,`
` .........that's something I'd love to know......if it's possible to find out.`
`"What do you think, Miss Kotobuki......?`
` Of course, this is not an urgent request.`
` I was told to tell you to take your time in making your decision if you wished..."`
`"I understand.`
` ......Does Hachijo Tohya live near the city?"`
`"I was told that a meeting near here would be satisfactory at any time...!"`
`"I see.`
` ......In that case, can I ask you to arrange a meeting for us in a quiet coffee shop next Sunday...?"`
`"Yes, as you wish...!`
` Thank you, thank you very much!`
` I believe Hachijo will be delighted as well...!"`
`"I have one condition."`
`"Yes, whatever you say...!"`
`"I am not going to discuss business, so please refrain from sending anyone from the editing department."`
`"But of course! We will do as you say."`
`"Madam Hachijo and I will meet alone, just the two of us.`
` Can I count on you to keep that promise...?"`
`"Well, as to that.........`
` ......We would, umm, appreciate it if you kept this quiet, but..."`
`"What is it...?"`
`"......Well, the truth is...`
` ......The works of Hachijo Tohya are written by two people.`
` To the outside world, those books were written by a single female author,`
` .......but there is actually a second author, a man...`
` ......The pair of them asked for a chance to meet you......"`
`As soon as I heard that,`
` ......I felt a premonition.`
`......How had Hachijo Tohya, a person with no connections to the Ushiromiya family, managed to write about their private circumstances in such detail?`
`I already felt a premonition of a certain kind of miracle......`
`When I left on my journey, I abandoned the name of Ushiromiya Ange and stepped into a new life.`
`By now, things had settled down, but back when the Sumadera family was still a threat, I wanted to distance myself from that name.`
`......Thanks to that, no one was able to get in touch with the new "me" anymore.`
`However, this year, "Sakutarou's Great Adventure" had caught the public eye.`
` It had made the name of Kotobuki Yukari famous, ......and maybe that name had finally reached his ears.`
`I used to play with a lion stuffed animal called Sakutarou, along with Maria onee‐chan.`
`If those who knew this connected the name Sakutarou with the hint in my own name, ......then it's only natural that they'd figure out who I was.`
`The number of people who could recognize me from this was very, very limited.`
`.........This person was also well‐versed in detective novels, and a man.`
`I could only think of one person who matched.`
`After all, I had learned just how many detective novels he had kept piled up in his room......when going through his personal effects.`
`It was almost the time we had arranged for our meeting.`
`My heart was racing, ......almost like a girl in love for the first time......`
`At precisely the arranged time, I heard the sound of the chime on the door,`
` .........and {i:they} appeared.`
`It was a man sitting on a wheelchair...and a woman pushing him.`
`My eyes immediately fixed on the man in the wheelchair.`
`......And, right away, ......I saw the similarity in his face...`
`He was, unmistakably,`
` ...............my brother.`
`My brother, ......Ushiromiya Battler......`
`When our eyes met, he gave a little bow.`
` I hurried to my feet and bowed back.`
`......It was a somewhat exaggerated and silly way for a pair of siblings to greet each other after several decades apart.`
`......But the miracle I had waited for all these years had become a reality, ......and my mind was now completely blank.`
`"......Are you Kotobuki Yukari?"`
`"Yes, I am...`
` ......And you two must be...Hachijo Tohya."`
`"A pleasure to meet you.`
` Thank you very much for letting us borrow your precious time today.`
` ......My name is Hachijo Ikuko.`
` I am mostly in charge of the actual writing.`
` ......This is Tohya.`
` He mostly handles the drafting."`
`Though the woman who called herself Ikuko was far older than me, she seemed to be unbelievably youthful.`
`It wasn't because she was good with makeup or dressed like a younger woman.`
`It feels strange to say it...`
`There was a strange mystique about her, ......as though she was immortal and never‐aging.`
`Then, I quickly remembered that she had introduced my brother as Tohya.`
`"......Pardon me for asking, ......but are you two married?"`
`"We are not married, but we have been together for a long time."`
`"True. Looking back on it, it really has been a long time......"`
`My brother smiled as he spoke.`
`......When I learned that, at least for him, these long decades hadn't been a period of isolation and loneliness,`
` I felt an incredible sense of peace and relief.`
`I suddenly realized that he was staring into my face just as I had been staring into his.`
`After all, when he saw me last, I was just six years old.`
` It must be hard for him to find any traces he can recognize.`
`However, ......I'm sure he'll recognize something, just the same.`
`We kept stealing glances at each other and looking away, like a couple on a blind date.`
`We were both at an age where outside appearances mattered to us.`
` Even though we both knew, we couldn't let our polite exterior falter.`
`This humorous exchange was extremely embarrassing.`
`......I thought that when fate reunited two people like this, they would hold each other and sob tears of gratitude together.`
`However, it seemed that the reality of it was different......`
`But that's fine.`
`It feels like my heart will explode with happiness......`
`"Let's take our orders.`
` Is coffee okay?`
` What does everyone want?"`
`"I'd prefer something that isn't so bitter.`
` ......How about you, Miss Kotobuki?"`
`"Oh, ......I don't mind...`
` ...I guess I'll have café au lait......"`
`How stiff we're being.`
`Even my brother seemed to be finding it amusing by now.`
`".........Well, then."`
`When she said that, my brother and I fell silent and sat up straight.`
`"Should I start the conversation?`
` Or would you like to be the one to do it, Tohya?"`
`".........I'll do it.`
` I'm the one who pushed so hard for this meeting, after all."`
`As he spoke, he watched me calmly.`
`"I came here today......thinking that you might be a certain person.`
` Her name is Ushiromiya Ange.`
` ......When I read your works and heard your name, I was sure that you were her."`
`"That's right.`
` ......How long it's been since I last used that name.`
` My true name is Ushiromiya Ange......"`
`I gave the exaggerated bow that I'd gotten so used to these long years.`
`......We've both aged, haven't we, Onii‐chan?`
`I whispered this in my heart.`
`Now, it was my turn.`
`With a quick apology, I fished around in my handbag and took out a photo.`
`It was a picture from a trip I'd taken to an amusement park with Battler onii‐chan.`
`I had many other pictures of us having a good time, but this one had the best shot of his face.`
`I looked between him and the photo.`
`{n}There was no longer any room for doubt.`
`"......Mr. Tohya.`
` Your true name is..........Ushiromiya Battler......san, is it not......?"`
`The hands of the clock inside me stopped.`
`I wanted him to answer with a yes...`
`Even though I was already so sure, ......I was still about to burst with the tension.`
`And then, when that instant that seemed far too long ended, my brother answered.`
`"That's right."`
`".............................."`
`Unconsciously, I stared at my brother's face.`
`With unbelievable quickness, he'd acknowledged that he was Ushiromiya Battler.`
`......My eyes immediately filled and overflowed with tears...`
`I took out a handkerchief and wiped them away, but I couldn't hold them back...`
`Onii‐chan was alive after all...`
`So why didn't he come back to me right away?`
`If he had been there during my darkest days, how much it would have meant to me......`
`Normally, the thought would have made me curse my brother, but by now, even that emotion was softened.`
`Because, now that I was faced with the miracle of being reunited with Onii‐chan, ......everything I felt before now fell away with my tears.`
`At this moment, ......I was happy.`
`I wasn't all alone.`
`{n}That belief had kept me going for decades.`
`And, finally, .........I had been rewarded......`
`By now, I couldn't even stop my tears.`
`For some time, I continued to sob and sniffle...`
`Watching this, my brother hung his head apologetically.`
`......Why hadn't he come back to me sooner?`
`{n}It looked as though he was feeling regret for that.`
`But I was sure he must have had some sort of reason.`
`He had probably come here today to tell me about it and apologize.`
`Already, ......just by him introducing himself to me today, ......everything inside of me had been washed clean with tears.`
`"......I'm......sorry......`
` ......I must be......embarrassing you......"`
`"No.`
` It's only to be expected.`
` ......For several decades, you've been waiting all alone, believing that your family would return."`
`"I did believe......`
` .........I believed you would come home.........`
` .........Onii‐chan............"`
`I held out my hand weakly, ......and my brother slowly held his out too.`
`Then, ......I gripped his hand.`
`Regardless of how many long years had passed, .........it was, without a doubt, my brother's hand.`
`Once more, I had to struggle to hold back the tears......`
`"......Aunt Eva avoided the explosion accident by escaping to Kuwadorian.`
` ......How did you escape the accident, Onii‐cha—......nii‐san?"`
`"On that day, ......I escaped through the underground passage."`
`"The one that goes to Kuwadorian?"`
`"I was told that an underground passage led to a hidden mansion on the opposite side of the island.`
` ......However, the place we escaped to was a submarine base, not Kuwadorian."`
`I don't know under what circumstances my brother entered the underground passage on that day.`
`At any rate, he went into the underground passage, split up with Aunt Eva there, and escaped to the submarine base.`
`There, he escaped the explosion...and survived......`
`"From there, I got away on a motorboat.`
` ......However, ......it must have capsized somewhere along the way."`
`"It...must have...?"`
`"......Please forgive him.`
` Tohya suffers from memory loss.`
` His memory from around the time he was drowning in the ocean is hazy."`
`"Could it be......that he forgot he was Ushiromiya Battler for a while...?"`
`"That is correct."`
`......Yes, that explains nearly all of the riddles.`
`My brother escaped from the explosion, but either his boat capsized during his escape from the island, or he fell overboard.`
`Afterwards, he must have drifted somewhere, wandered about half‐conscious, and maybe got into a traffic accident...`
`"On that day, he was lying on the road."`
`"If she had found me even a little later, I probably wouldn't have opened my eyes again."`
`"I believe you suspected that I was the one who hit you for quite some time."`
`"Hey, I've already apologized for that......"`
`This explains pretty much everything.`
`Either because of the time he nearly drowned, or because of the traffic accident, my brother's memory was damaged.`
`His memory must have come back eventually.`
`However, by that time, I had already set foot into my new life as Kotobuki Yukari.`
`Only a handful of people, including President Okonogi, knew where I was.`
`Even if my brother tried to contact me, there was a very good chance that he wouldn't be able to.`
`.........Ironically, the name I had abandoned when I decided to live in the future...`
`had delayed my reunion with my brother for so long.`
`In that sense, I am responsible.`
` I did it to myself.`
`......However, I think I did receive the message that my brother sent me.`
`It was through Itouikukuro.`
`I realized that Itouikukuro, the Forger who claimed to have reached the truth, was actually Hachijo Tohya.`
`And I did request a meeting with her through the publishing company, to question her about why she was so sure she'd reached the truth.`
`However, I wasn't granted a meeting.`
`In the end, I heard nothing from them, and it's taken all these decades for me to meet Hachijo Tohya.`
`......If the publishing company had only passed my message on, we could have been reunited so much sooner.`
`However, at the time, I was just a bourgeois girl who liked to throw money around.`
`Why would they pass on my message when I just barged in with no introduction and demanded to meet the famous and popular Hachijo Tohya?`
`We probably crossed paths several times.`
`If just one of those had worked out, if we had been able to meet...`
`{n}......Just how much would my life have changed?`
`But this was fate.`
`God had decided that a few decades were needed before this sibling reunion.`
`And during that time, my brother became one half of a mystery novelist.`
` I became a writer of adventure novels for children.`
`You could say that we achieved success in society.`
`My brother and I were able to be reunited after becoming successful.`
`Now, I could do nothing but thank God for bringing about this miracle...`
`"Maybe it was God's will that we should be reunited after achieving success as novelists...`
` .........Back then, I was nameless, so I never got through to you.`
` We've met now because we've both become famous as authors...`
` ......I think all of this was God's will......"`
`"We did hear through the publishing company at the time that you wanted to have an interview with us.`
` .........They told us that a fan who had discovered Itouikukuro's true identity wanted to talk, and they asked us for a decision."`
`"......You must've had dozens of fans dying for an interview.`
` You couldn't possibly go to meet all of them..."`
`"No.`
` They let us know that your name was Ushiromiya Ange.`
` ......At the time, I had already realized that Tohya's true name was Ushiromiya Battler, so I thought you should be given a chance to meet him."`
`"I...refused."`
`Those were my brother's words.`
`".........What.........did you say......?"`
`"I refused......because I didn't want to meet you."`
`Once more, my brother spoke clearly.`
`I was completely confused.`
`I could only sit there in shock and silence, waiting for the words that were sure to follow...`
`"......I believe I already mentioned that Tohya suffered from memory loss.`
` ......And then, one day—"`
`"Why did you refuse, when you knew it was me...?"`
`I cut through Ikuko's words and questioned him directly.`
`What reason could my brother have for rejecting me?`
`{n}I couldn't think of anything.`
`That unpleasant feeling brought up long‐forgotten feelings of anger inside me...`
`"You must have known that your little sister was living all alone, being crushed by loneliness.`
` So why...... Why did you refuse to allow me to see you...?"`
`My brother hung his head.`
`It seemed more like he was lost for words than apologetic.`
`Unable to sense that he even felt any compunction about his actions, I questioned him again in an even louder voice.`
`When I asked for an appointment with Hachijo Tohya, Itouikukuro was already famous as a Forger.`
`Why did Itouikukuro's Forgeries reach the truth?`
`It's obvious.`
`My brother, Ushiromiya Battler, explained to her what happened on the island in detail.`
`So, the appearance of Itouikukuro proves that my brother's memory had returned.`
`Therefore, he can't excuse himself by saying that he didn't remember me.`
`In fact, no, ...he isn't trying to make excuses.`
`On the contrary, he's openly saying that he refused to meet me, even though he knew who I was.`
`".........Looking back, ...I regret what I did."`
`"You {i:regret} it...?!!`
` Did you ever try thinking about how I felt?!`
` For decades, ......for most of my life...!`
` Do you realize what feelings I had to live with......?"`
`Various emotions swirled inside of me.`
`{n}I realized that I wasn't in control of them anymore.`
`I could only moan, to prevent myself from saying something I'd regret...`
`"I feel deeply ashamed for doing something so cruel to you.`
` ......That's why I've searched for you ever since then.`
` For your sake and for mine, ......I should have met you much earlier..."`
`".........Then why.........wouldn't you meet me then.........?"`
`"......Miss Kotobuki.`
` ......As I said before, ......his memory has been damaged.`
` It was an aftereffect of the accident."`
`"But his memory came back, didn't it......?!"`
`"......Yes, his memory came back.`
` However, that did not remove the aftereffects of the damage."`
`"I have Ushiromiya Battler's memories.`
` ......However, I can't think of those......can't accept those......as my own."`
`"............Can't think of those.........as your own......?"`
`"......Yes.`
` ......It's true that my memory of my escape from the island is still hazy.`
` However, I've remembered almost everything else."`
`".........Things like how those pink hair ornaments of yours that you treasured so much...were something I won for you at the game corner in that amusement park."`
`"Yes, that's right.`
` They're a treasure from when I was a child.`
` ......I still keep them with me in my handbag..."`
`"I remember a lot more besides that.`
` ......I remember you giving Mother trouble because you hated eating seaweed.`
` I remember that you tried to move it to my plate and trick her.`
` ......And when—"`
`"If you remember that much, .........then why can't you think of those memories as your own...?"`
`"...............That is......the condition I live with.`
` ......I've been to several hospitals, but it didn't do any good.`
` ......You probably can't understand it.`
` You can't know how painful it is to have your mind suddenly fill with the memories of a man you don't know..."`
`It was a terrifying feeling of losing his own identity.`
`The memories of a stranger filled his head, and they threatened to crush and overwhelm him.`
`They were almost certainly his own lost memories.`
`However, .........his brain couldn't accept them as his own.`
`"Those days were painful, terrifying.`
` .........It felt like my mind was being invaded...`
` ............On any given night, after I turned off the lights and went to sleep, maybe "I" would never wake up again.`
` Maybe a different man would wake up the following morning and start living life in my body.`
` ......I can't count the nights that I spent tormented by this fear..."`
`".........He tried several times to convince himself that they were his real memories.`
` ......He told himself that he was Ushiromiya Battler over and over again."`
`"But...nothing worked.`
` ......I am me, ...Hachijo Tohya.`
` ......No matter how much Ushiromiya Battler's memories flow into my mind.`
` ......To me, they're the memories of another person.`
` .........I couldn't accept Ushiromiya Battler........."`
`......As "Ushiromiya Battler" said this, ......he hung his head as his eyes turned red.`
`"............And one day, out of the anguish of being torn between himself and the other self he couldn't accept, in a fit, he............"`
`".........................................."`
`"He was fortunate enough to survive the ordeal, but the injuries he sustained then forced him to spend his life in a wheelchair..."`
`".........How......terrible......"`
`Now I see why he appeared in that wheelchair.`
`And, ......now I know why he refused to meet with me......`
`He was afraid......of me calling him "big brother".`
`He was terrified of meeting me, fearful that the part of himself that wasn't him would grow still further in his mind.`
`"Even so, he fought.`
` .........He felt that, since Ushiromiya Battler was inside him, it was his responsibility to meet you.`
` Thinking that, ......he kept on fighting in the space between his two selves."`
`And then, .........in a fit, he............`
`......After something like that, it was only natural that Ikuko would tell him that he didn't need to remember Ushiromiya Battler anymore.`
`Bit by bit, he tried to forget that he was once "Ushiromiya Battler".`
`Doctor's instructions and medication.`
` With that and Ikuko's diligent care, ......he slowly began to regain his peace of mind......`
`"Even so,`
` .........I...`
`thought that I would have to meet you sooner or later.`
` ......To be honest, I didn't get a wink of sleep last night.`
` .........I was...terrified of meeting you......"`
`"............................................."`
`"If I met you, would I die?`
` ......I was afraid that I would.`
` ......However, here I am, talking to you normally."`
`"......That's why I regret what I did.`
` .........If only.........I could have............met with you earlier......`
` ......You......and the Ushiromiya Battler inside of me.........might not have had to suffer for all those years...`
` ......Just thinking that makes me feel so......sorry.................. ............"`
`As the man who was once Ushiromiya Battler said this, he broke down crying.`
`......I was already......beginning to understand.`
`It really......{i:was} true.`
`{n}Ushiromiya Battler............did die that day.`
`After all, .........didn't the witches say that he was dead so often with the red truth...?`
`.........How pathetic for the Witch of the Future......the Witch of Resurrection......who swore that everyone would be together always......`
`..........................................`
`"......Tohya‐san.`
` Please, raise your head."`
`"............M‐......Miss Kotobuki......"`
`They realized why I had called him Tohya‐san.`
`And by calling {i:this man} by that name, ......I myself felt the agitation in my heart subside a little.`
`"Thank you.`
` .........You must have suffered a lot.`
` ......Thank you so much, Mr. Tohya......"`
`"......Uugh.........uuuuuughhhgh..............uuuu......"`
`".........Thank you,`
` nii‐san.`
` .........Thanks......for pushing yourself so hard to come here today............"`
`Holding hands, ......we brought our foreheads close and cried together for a while.`
`Then, we talked of the old days.`
`He remembered many things vividly, even things that I couldn't remember myself.`
`Each time, they made me cry even harder, and he hung his head apologetically.`
`And once I realized that my tears were hurting him, I just did my best to let him speak, nodding along with a strange look on my face, something between a sob and a smile.`
`.........Even if he isn't Ushiromiya Battler.`
`{n}My Onii‐chan came back to me...`
`Welcome home,`
` .........Onii‐chan.........`
`It had already gotten dark outside.`
`Even though he had come from far away, he was willing to stay as late as this.`
`We left the store.`
`It's probably best......if I don't meet with Mr. Tohya again.`
`It will cause him pain, ......and of course, I'll find myself bound to the past again.`
`Even so, just one more time.`
`{n}There was one place I felt I had to show him.`
`"......Mr. Tohya.`
` ......Would you mind meeting with me just one last time?`
` There's a place I feel I need to show you."`
`".....................`
` ......Sure, I don't mind."`
`From my handbag, I pulled an invitation, which had been printed on a sheet of A4 paper and folded into four.`
`The pair of them unfolded it.`
`"My.`
` Now this looks like a splendid event."`
`".........Come to think of it, you have been involved in a lot of things besides novels, haven't you?"`
`"On that day, would you lend me your time just once more?`
` ......That way, I think both me and my brother will be satisfied.`
` I think...it might also be a chance for you to free yourself from the weight of my brother's memory, Mr. Tohya."`
`"......I......don't believe we have any plans for then.`
` As long as we can get the afterword for the book finished ahead of time."`
`"Okay, Miss Kotobuki.`
` ......We'd be happy to join you."`
`"Thank you, Mr. Tohya........."`
`The cold, October night was a reminder that winter was approaching.`
`......The two people who called themselves Hachijo Tohya visited the city once again by Ange's invitation.`
`A car stopped in front of a large building.`
`Ikuko unfolded the wheelchair with a practiced hand, lent a shoulder to Tohya as he got out of the passenger's seat, and helped him into the chair.`
`".........It looks splendid."`
`"The Gospel House.`
` ......It's my first time coming here, ......but I know it well.`
` I believe it's the institution for children that was funded by the Ushiromiya family."`
`"Madam Ikuko, Mr. Tohya.`
` Allow us to welcome you to the Gospel House."`
`They were welcomed by Ange and some staff members.`
`This was...the Gospel House.`
`A welfare institution for unfortunate children who had lost their parents.`
`This institution was once dependent on the support it received from Ushiromiya Kinzo.`
`However, that support had been interrupted, and the Gospel House had been forced to shut down for a time.`
`Decades had passed.`
` And now, the institution would be revived.`
`Revived by the hand of Kotobuki Yukari.`
`"......It's a pleasure to see you again, Miss Kotobuki.`
` Thank you for your invitation.`
` ......This is from the two of us.`
` It's not much, but I hope the children enjoy it."`
`"That was never the intention behind inviting you here......`
` I feel terrible accepting this......"`
`"Please don't let it concern you.`
` ......The tales of the future are always woven by children.`
` ......After all, without them, the tale of {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}s will not continue."`
`"Children are treasures.`
` So please, let this be useful."`
`"......Thank you very much.`
` ......We have a form for donations, so if it isn't too much trouble......"`
`The Gospel House had been drastically remodeled in recent years.`
`In the hopes that children would one day be able to remember this as a fun place...`
`Ange had used her own money to massively remodel it into a beautiful establishment.`
`......By now, she had accumulated a lot of wealth as a novelist,`
` but even without that, she had been saving the tens of millions of yen she got from the Ushiromiya Group each year under the name of living expenses.`
`This money had been used generously to help the children.`
`When they came into the entrance hall, a cheerful scene was spread before them.`
`Pictures and crafts created by the children.`
` ......Every corner was filled with things on display.`
`The contrast between this elegant building and the school atmosphere was amusing.`
`The yells and laughter of kids running around drifted in from the distance.`
`".........I imagine that many children first come here hanging their heads in sorrow.`
` To think that they could be here laughing like that......... You really have done something great."`
`"All people can use magic to create their future and find a fragment of happiness.`
` ......This is a witch's school for teaching that magic."`
`"The "Witch's Dormitory" from "Sakutarou's Great Adventure"?"`
`"......Oh, how embarrassing.`
` ......So you've read it too..."`
`"We read straight through it right after our last meeting.`
` ......I really must bow my head, not only to your talent as a writer, but to your warm heart."`
`"How embarrassing......`
` .........This way, straight to the end."`
`Pushing Tohya's wheelchair, we advanced through the corridor and reached the great doors at the end.`
`The happy voices of children came from the other side.`
`Apparently, this was where tonight's party was being held.`
`There were several jack‐o‐lanterns cut out of origami.`
`Tonight...was the Gospel House's Halloween party.`
`"Here you are, Mr. Tohya."`
`"I see, so it's trick‐or‐treat."`
`He was handed a bag filled with candy.`
`A teacher warned him in a small voice...`
`to watch out for rampaging children.`
`"......Children.`
` I haven't had anything to do with them for years."`
`"Please tell the children stories of dreams.`
` We all welcome guests here......"`
`"That's tricky...`
` What should I tell them?"`
`"‘When you're handing in your manuscript, choose your publishing company wisely’?"`
`"‘Don't pay any attention to reader polls.’"`
`"*giggle*giggle*.`
` Then I'll open the doors.`
` The children are waiting."`
`Ange opened the large double doors......`
`"This......place..........................."`
`At the sight of the hall......Tohya opened his mouth in wide‐eyed shock.`
`This was...the great hall of the Ushiromiya mansion.`
`No, that would be impossible......`
`They were clearly in the Gospel House.`
`This hall.........was an exact look‐alike of the one in the Rokkenjima mansion...............`
`"......What a splendid hall."`
`"This is......a replica......of the hall in the Ushiromiya mansion.........on Rokkenjima......"`
`"Yes.`
` ......I've reproduced it as well as my memory would let me.`
` The details might be wrong though."`
`"......No.`
` .........This really is.........the hall of the Ushiromiya family mansion......on that day......"`
`And then, Tohya's eyes fixed......on something at the other side of the room.`
`It was.........a portrait.`
`{n}A portrait of Rokkenjima's other master.`
`"......It's.........exactly the same as my memories........."`
`"The artist hired by Ushiromiya Kinzo to paint the portrait had a photo.`
` ......I had him draw it again based on that."`
`".........................................."`
`I was simply frozen in shock.`
`The long, large table was filled with Halloween party food and surrounded with children stuffing themselves.`
`The teacher said "everyone, we have guests".`
`......The children all looked at us at once, ......then stood up and ran forward......`
`Their broad smiles at the arrival of this long‐awaited guest wrapped me up.`
`The smiles and eyes of the children.........welcomed me.`
`Yeah, .........I know.`
` ......I know......all your faces.........`
`It's been so long, far too long...... I'm finally here, at last......`
